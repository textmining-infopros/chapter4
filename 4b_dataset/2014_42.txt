ABSTRACT
CHRISTOPHER A. SHAFFER. An examination of diversity within three southeastern
academic libraries: A mixed methods, multi-site study (Under the direction of DR.
RONALD LINDAHL).
The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which three academic
libraries in the Southeastern United States could be considered diverse. This was a multisite, mixed methods study. It examined the climate and culture of the libraries, which was
assessed through two methods; the first, through survey responses from full-time faculty
and staff members at the three libraries studied. Secondly, selected individuals, including
the deans of all three libraries, participated in interviews with the researcher, to shed
further light on the climate and culture of the libraries. A raw catalog count of each
library’s monographic collection was conducted, using diversity-themed keyword
searches. Recent programming, when relevant was also considered as a method of
concretely measuring diversity.
Results of the study indicated that librarians at all three institutions valued the
concept of diversity within their libraries, particularly in terms of their collections.
However, under further scrutiny, particularly concerning issues such as homosexuality
and speaking foreign languages in the workplace, survey responses indicated some
reluctance by faculty and staff to fully embrace all areas of diversity. Librarians
interviewed consistently indicated they viewed libraries as safe harbors that contain a
wide array of diverse materials. All indicated there were materials within their libraries
that contradicted their personal belief system and believed that was acceptable, because
libraries exist for people of all beliefs.

As a result of this study, several recommendations emerged for both library
administrators and policy makers as well as library science researchers. A primary policy
recommendation is for academic libraries to be well-funded. A diverse library is
impossible to create and maintain without proper funding. Diversity policies need to be
created to reinforce the concept that diversity is a key component of the library. Diversity
should be institutionally promoted through public programming grants and encouraging
librarians to apply for fellowships and other programs that expose them to diverse
concepts.
Future research on this topic would prove to be enlightening. Research outside of
the Southeast region would allow for an assessment of whether information gleaned in
this study is consistent on a national level in the United States. Electronic databases are a
major component of an academic libraries’ collection and could be examined as one more
component of diversity.

DEDICATION
I dedicate this dissertation to the three people who have had the greatest impact on
my life; my wife, mother, and grandmother. To my wife, Amber, we have only spent two
months of our marriage without the pressure of this degree hanging over our heads.
Without your love and support, I would have never reached the end of this journey. To
my mother, Jane Shaffer Elliott, had you not exposed me to the diverse world around us,
I certainly would not be the person I am today. Finally, I would like to thank my
grandmother, the late Gladys Reed. Because of you, it was never a question of whether I
would go to college, but where.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
It would be impossible to properly show my gratitude to everyone who has helped
me on this journey. I would like to offer my sincere gratitude and appreciation to the
entire faculty of Alabama State University’s Doctoral Program in Educational
Leadership, Policy, and Law. The support and encouragement shown by all of you was
deeply appreciated. I would especially like to thank my dissertation chair, Dr. Ronald
Lindahl, for persistently coping with my tired prose. In addition, I would also like to
thank the other members of my dissertation committee, Drs. Sonja Harrington, John
Gooden, and Antwuan Stinson. The other people in my life who must be acknowledged
are Drs. Kenny Stephens, Henry Stewart, and Thomas Nadar. Thank you all for your
words of encouragement and support throughout this process, and for being friends with a
bottle of something good when words alone would not suffice. Many thanks to Jeff and
Robin Blitz for donating one of their bedrooms to me for this entire process as I traveled
back and forth from home to Montgomery, as well as my sister, Elizabeth Newton, for
keeping me awake by talking to me on the phone on the ride home after classes. I would
also like to acknowledge the support of Amber’s stepfather and mother, Darrell and Mary
Jane Collins, who wordlessly delivered snacks and drinks to me while I typed at their
house for the two consecutive holiday seasons. Finally, I would like to thank the entire
cast and crew of Cohort IX. One could not hope for a better group of colleagues with
whom to share such a journey.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION TO THE STUDY
America has always been considered to be a “melting pot” or "salad bowl" nation,
depending upon the generation to which one relates (Glazer & Moynihan, 1963). This
concept remains true today, with ethnic minorities increasing in population. The Hispanic
population is soaring, and the African-American population is well into the double digits,
while the Asian population is growing steadily as well (Shrestha & Heisler, 2011).
America is furthermore a magnet to which people from around the globe immigrate.
Consequently, because they serve the public, there has been an increasing focus among
those in the field of library science on the role of diversity in library settings, in terms of
collections, staff, leadership, and ideologies. Diversity is a remarkably broad term, but
for the purposes of this study, library collections, programming, staffs, and leadership
were examined. Through examining collections and programming, the researcher sought
to determine the extent to which the libraries studied embraced a variety of different ideas
and thoughts.
The American Library Association (ALA) itself fosters diversity through the
generous Spectrum Scholarship Program, the stated mission of which is to improve
“service at the local level through the development of a representative workforce that
reflects the communities served by all librarians of the new millennium.” This laudable
goal is achieved through the offering of scholarships, fundraising, recruitment,

2
mentoring, leadership, and professional development (The American Library
Association, 2011).
A commitment to multiculturalism goes beyond color and ethnic issues. It refers
as well to the world of ideas, something that libraries should be committed to preserving
and promoting. In the post-9/11 world, such diversity was often in danger as a result of
misplaced or confused patriotism, which often led to censorship. There were several
examples of works that were censored in recent years, caused much more by misplaced
patriotic zeal than by the more common moral outrage. Examples included works by
Michael Moore as well as the Dixie Chicks, following anti-war comments made by one
of the band's members (McCook, 2003, pp. 14-15). Because libraries' purse strings are
often controlled by the government, there is an unspoken pressure to conform to
government policies and wishes, which can at times deal painful blows to the concept of
diversity (Oppenheim & Smith, 2004). A less well known, but quite disturbing, example
can be found with the Smithsonian Institution, which downgraded an exhibit on arctic
wildlife following the government's announced intention to promote oil drilling in that
region (McCook, 2003, pp. 14-15).
In terms of ideological concepts, it is important to remember what might seem
like a fringe concept today may be tomorrow's mainstream ideology. For example,
during the Populist Movement of the late 19th century, the idea of women voting in
elections and America having an income tax seemed remarkably radical. Today, though,
these ideas are widely accepted as a normal part of American life. Therefore, it is crucial
for librarians interested in diversity to be constantly in tune with the progressive elements
of society, so that they are aware of ideas and trends that may be poised to become part of

3
mainstream America. This commitment to diverse ideas for public consumption is a task
that is beneficial to society as a whole, as concepts that appear radical at the time
gradually filter into the overall culture; consequently society changes to embrace what
was once a fringe or progressive concept.
One of the greatest challenges to achieving the goal of having a library with a
diverse collection promoting diverse ideas is that quite often various members of the
majority community, or other groups, are offended by concepts that might seem quite
acceptable to other individuals in the minority community within a state. In the
Southeast, the majority of residents are undoubtedly more conservative than the national
population as a whole (Jones, 2010). It is the job of librarians to balance such attitudes
with opposing viewpoints, not to change opinions, but to provide patrons with multiple
points of view. There is an increasing attitude across the political and cultural spectrum
in today’s America, that anyone can negate anyone else’s beliefs simply because they do
not match their own value system. Labels are often too quickly applied in the discourse of
the day; that, in turn, hinders the exploration of ideas. As Kierkegaard pointed out, “If
you label me, you negate me” (translated and cited in Zott, 2003, p. 177). Librarians, in
their role as information providers, constantly battle such mindsets and struggle to
provide information from all possible points of view.
These insular attitudes are the precise reason why the study of diversity and
implementation of diversity initiatives are critical. For a democracy to be healthy, it is
essential that a variety of social and political ideas can flourish and be debated in a
civilized fashion. In order for this to happen, there must be a diversity of individuals in an
organization to facilitate a comparable diversity of thoughts and ideas.

4
This study examined the culture and climate of three academic libraries in the
Southeast to determine the extent of diverse thought and multiculturalism that existed
within those organizations. These included a Large University Research Library (LURL),
a Regional University Library (RUL), and an Historically Black University Library
(HBUL).
Purpose of the Study
This study utilized the concepts of social change theory and narrative analysis.
Social change theory embraces the concept that there can be significant alteration of
social structure and cultural patterns through time (Harper & Leicht, 2007, p. 5).
Through narrative analysis, it is possible for one researcher’s subjects to become
exemplars, which then creates models of inquiry for future researchers to use (Lyons, N.
& LaBoskey, (2002, p. 11). The researcher examined the library holdings and
programming at three academic libraries in the Southeast. In order to learn about the
culture and climate of the libraries studied, the researcher sought feedback from
administrators, faculty, and staff at those same academic libraries to determine the value,
opinions, and attitudes concerning diversity within those institutions. In so doing, it was
possible to determine the extent to which the three libraries could be considered diverse.
Statement of Problem
In spite of a strong commitment by the American Library Association (ALA) to
diversify the library profession in terms of professionals in the field and through
programming, the number of librarians of color remains low. Furthermore, the
Southeastern region of the United States has a history of segregation and discrimination
regarding its public libraries, which were segregated until the early 1970s (Graham, 2002,

5
pp. 1-2). Academic libraries can serve as a role model for other libraries throughout the
state—public and K-12—to continue fostering the concept of diversity that was begun
with integration. This study was an examination of diversity in terms of workforce,
collection development, and programming. Through this examination, the researcher
discovered the extent to which the workforce at selected libraries was diversified, the
extent to which collections and programming were aimed at diversity, and the extent to
which a diverse workforce was necessary to achieve diversity in terms of collections and
programming. For instance, was it possible for a homogenous workforce to successfully
engage in practices that led to diversity in these areas?
Background of the Study
As noted in Graham (2002) and Stanton’s (2006) works, the United States
southeast region has a history of segregating its public libraries. Although de jure
segregation largely ended in the 1970s, truly diversifying the culture of such institutions
is more difficult. Vestiges of de jure segregation remained beyond the 1970s as revealed
in the 1981 Knight v. Alabama State Board of Education case, which argued that the
Alabama Commission on Higher Education (ACHE) had infantilized historically Black
universities by not allowing them to develop doctoral programs. This case ultimately
helped lead to the founding of the doctoral program in Educational Leadership, Policy,
and Law at Alabama State University, which was the first doctoral program in the history
of the school.
Academic libraries were also impacted by policies that led to the Knight verdict.
Because academic libraries are integral to the daily dynamics of a university and can also
serve as role models for their less well funded public counterparts, it was important to

6
examine academic libraries in the Southeast to determine the extent to which they were
embracing a commitment to diversity. Such a commitment would go well beyond race,
but would also include monographic collections, library worker attitudes, and library
programming that were inclusive of topics such as religion, gender and sexual
orientation, and multiculturalism.
Research Questions
The over-arching research question in the present study was to what extent does a
diverse environment existed at three academic libraries in the Southeast?
The specific research questions to be addressed were as follows:
1) To what extent is diversity in terms of race, religion, gender, nationality, and
sexual orientation considered a valued attribute of three academic libraries in the
Southeast?
2) What strategies are employed at three academic libraries in the Southeast to
foster diversity in terms of race, religion, gender, nationality, and sexual
orientation?
3) What are the perceived effects of diversity initiatives at three academic
libraries in the Southeast in terms of race, religion, gender, nationality,
and sexual orientation?
4) To what extent are collections and programming at three academic libraries in
the Southeast diverse in terms of race, religion, gender, nationality, and sexual
orientation?

7
Methodology
This study was a multi-site, mixed methods study that examined three academic
libraries in the Southeast in an effort to determine the extent to which a diverse
environment existed at those institutions. In order to obtain a sample of a variety of
academic library types, an Large University Research Library (LURL), a Regional
University Library (RUL), and a Historically Black College or University Library
(HBUL) were studied.
Qualitative data collection was obtained through interviews conducted with
library administrators.Quantitative data were generated from surveys developed by the
University of Tennessee Libraries Diversity Committee and were also distributed to these
same groups. Permission to administer the survey was obtained from the committee that
developed the survey. Through these activities, the researcher was able to determine the
extent that a diverse and multicultural environment existed at these facilities in relation to
collections, staffing, and programming.
The deans of the libraries at an LURL, an HBUL, and a RUL in the Southeast
were sent requests to allow their library administration, faculty, and staff, to take a
diversity climate survey that assessed attitudes and perceptions concerning diversity at
their institutions. Collections were also assessed through raw catalog count using preselected search terms to determine the extent to which collection development practices
were diverse. The public services librarian was asked to provide a list of programs
offered by the library in order for an assessment to be made about the diversity of
programming at the library. Interviews were also conducted with key individuals from

8
these three groups to further study—from a qualitative standpoint—attitudes concerning
diversity at these institutions.
Significance of the Study
The American Library Association (ALA) views diversity among professional
librarians as an essential element of providing quality service to its patrons.
Consequently, they developed the Spectrum program to provide scholarships and
mentoring opportunities to both the Master of Library Science (MLIS) and the Doctor of
Library Science (DLIS). This policy-oriented study could provide the ALA with
feedback, allowing them to know if their project is showing signs of success. It could also
serve as a guide for the federal government in terms of determining whether it needs to
provide funds for diversity scholarships for librarians. This study also served as a
reflective tool for the libraries that are studied and allowed for assessments of their hiring
practices, collection development policies, programming habits, and their overall
environment relating to culture and climate.
Limitations of the Study
1. Only one example of each type of academic library was studied from the three
categories of LURL, HBUL, and RUL.
2. It was possible that these libraries may not be representative of their groups
throughout the region.
3. This study only examined academic libraries. An examination of public
libraries or school libraries would provide additional insight on the topic of
diversity throughout the entire scope of libraries.

9
4. Black males were not interviewed in the study because they were not highly
represented among the faculty and staff of the libraries that were studied.
Delimitations of the Study
1. Three academic libraries in the Southeastern United States were studied.
2. Administrators, professional librarians (MLIS), and library staff were surveyed.
3.Diversity was delimited to race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, politics,
and national origin.
Assumptions
It was assumed that academic libraries had increased levels of examples of
diversity when compared to public and K-12 libraries—particularly in terms of
collections and programming—because of higher levels of overall funding. It was further
assumed that because of the academic setting and the higher level of education attained
by the community within universities, that there would be a greater openness to the
concept of diversity at academic libraries.

are dominant within their region and culture.
Faculty Librarian: Operationally defined as an individual employed by an
institution of higher learning, who is in possession of a Master’s of Library and
Information Science and has tenure-track status within the university. For the purposes of
this dissertation, faculty librarian and librarian are synonymous.
Historically Black College or University: Any historically Black college or
university that was established prior to 1964, whose principal mission was, and is, the
education of Black Americans (The Higher Education Act of 1965).
Large University Research Library (LURL): A library containing an in-depth
collection of material on one or more subjects, that would allow for doctoral study in a
variety of fields (Young, 1983, p. 188).
Library Programming: Operationally defined as any of a variety of events that
libraries hold for the benefit of the public. These can include, but are not limited to,
public lectures, book discussions, film showings, and art exhibitions.
Library Staff: Operationally defined as any individual working at a library
within an institution of higher learning who is not in possession of a Master of Library
and Information Science.
Patron: Operationally defined as any individual utilizing one or more aspects of
an academic library’s services.

11
Programming: Operationally defined as any type of event that his hosted by a
library. Most commonly, academic libraries’ typical programs would include lectures,
film screenings, book discussions, and exhibits.
Regional University Library (RUL): Operationally defined as a library located
on a university or college campus serving a faculty and undergraduate and graduate
population. The collection of regional libraries is broad, but not necessarily in-depth.
Organization of the Study
This dissertation proposal was organized into three chapters. The first chapter
included the statement of the problem, purpose of the study, operational definitions,
research questions, significance of the study, methodology, limitations, delimitations, and
definition of terms. Chapter Two provided a literature review that examined the
background of libraries in the Southeast, paying attention to the history of segregation in
the state. Literature relating to the importance of diversity in terms of staffing,
collections, and programming was examined and reflected the emphasis the overall field
of library science places on this topic. Chapter Three outlined the methodology of the
study. The study’s findings were presented in Chapter Four. Chapter Five presented a
summary and discussion of the study, which was followed by conclusions and
recommendations for both implementation by practitioners and further research.

CHAPTER 2
REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE
Because libraries are institutions intended for the use of all members of a
community, diversity issues are inevitable (Preer, 2008, p. 52). Librarians are perpetually
faced with the challenges of being accused of not having enough materials on a subject,
or having too many. Librarians may also become trapped within the confining
environment in which they live, as was the case in the Southeast during the segregationist
era.
Historical Perspectives on Racial Discrimination in U.S. Southeastern Libraries
Although research on segregation in the Southeast is pervasive throughout the
historical record, research on segregation specific to the topic of libraries has been
limited. This could be possibly due to libraries being swallowed by other studies
examining segregation through broader lenses. Regardless, segregated libraries were a
significant part of the racist landscape of the South during the first six decades of the
twentieth century (Barrett & Bishop, 1998; Fultz, 2006). Desegregation of public libraries
in the South stemmed directly from the Brown V. Board of Education (1954) decision
(Kuffner, 2008, p. 1248; Malone, 2007, p. 665).
The history of segregation in Alabama’s public libraries has received significant
interest during the past ten years (Graham, 2002; Stanton, 2006). Both of these histories
examined the extent to which public libraries were at the forefront of the Civil Rights

13
movement and that opposing the system in place meant placing one’s life at risk, as
demonstrated in the case of Juliette Hampton Morgan, a Montgomery librarian who was
for the integration of public libraries in that city. She committed suicide following
harassing telephone calls and a cross being burned on her front lawn (Graham, 2002,
Stanton, 2006). In 2005, a public library in Montgomery was renamed in her honor
(Stanton, 2006, p. 217).
Morgan’s case is extreme and merits further examination. She was inspired by the
liberal gains of Alabama during World War II, and with the end of the war grew
concerned with attempts to roll back the clock, which led to political activism on her part,
largely in the form of letters to the editor of the Montgomery Advertiser (Stanton, 2006,
p. 95). She was later responsible for staffing an interracial committee to examine possible
reform of health, welfare, and recreation for Birmingham, Alabama’s Black community
in 1951 (Stanton, 2006, p. 125). Upon her return to Montgomery, Morgan continued her
activism, working with the Fellowship of the Concerned, a local civil rights activist
organization. She could often be found sitting behind the defense table of Black
defendants who were accused of crimes under suspicious circumstances (Stanton, 2006,
p. 151). Morgan’s fate was largely sealed in 1957. She had been hospitalized repeatedly
for a recurring nervous condition and did not have the intestinal fortitude needed to be a
political activist. A letter she wrote was published in the Montgomery Advertiser on
January 14th. In it she called for full citizenship and equal rights for Blacks. Harrassing
telephone calls began immediately, and in April a cross was burned on her front lawn.
She committed suicide on July 16th. The following morning she was found in bed, fully

14
clothed, with a bottle that had contained sleeping pills clutched in her lifeless hand
(Stanton, 2006, pp. 196-205).
The extent of paranoia concerning racial issues in Alabama reached a level in the
1950s and 1960s that is difficult for individuals looking backward at a distance of 50
years to conceive. It is particularly well exemplified in the fight to ban a children’s book
by Garth Williams titled The Rabbits Wedding. The book, written for children aged three
to seven, depicted two bunnies on the cover, one white and one black. In the racially
charged State of Alabama, such a cover could only mean the clear support of
miscegenation—the mixing of the races. The Director of the Alabama Public Libraries
Service at the time, Emily W. Reed, attempted a compromise between leaders of the
Alabama legislature who wanted the book banned, and her ethics, which guided her in the
opposite direction. Ultimately, the book was placed on the library’s reserve shelves, and
librarians visiting Montgomery could access the book if they wanted. The solution of the
Alabama legislature was to enact legislation stating that only a graduate of the University
of Alabama or Auburn University could head the Alabama Public Library Service. Reed
was from Indiana and did not have a degree from either of Alabama’s state schools. Reed
resigned before the law went into effect to become coordinator of adult services for the
Washington, D.C. library system (Graham, 2002, p. 105; Martin, 2009).
Racial paranoia and pressure for Whites and Blacks to conform to the societal
mores of the South was also on display in other facets of the culture. In 1956, Nat “King”
Cole and his band, which was integrated, was attacked on stage by six members of the
White Citizens Council and assorted members of the Ku Klux Klan. Two men attempted
to drag King, who was injured in the attack, from the stage. In a letter two days later,

15
Juliette Hampton Morgan wrote, “Don’t let our Negro friends feel we are letting them
down” (Stanton, 2006, pp. 181-182).
The Alabama Library Association was organized in 1904, and throughout most of
the Civil Rights Era failed to show enthusiasm for integrating the states’ public libraries.
Gretchen Shenk first attempted to promote the concept of integration in 1951, but was
unsuccessful. She did succeed in establishing a biracial committee charged with studying
the possibility of admitting African American Librarians. The committee was dissolved
within one year following William Stanley Hoole, dean of the library at the University of
Alabama asking, “Who is stuffing these Negroes down our throats? I want you to know
that I represent a conservative institution” (Barrett & Bishop, 1998, p. 148; Graham,
2002, pp. 126-127). It would not be until 1965 that the Alabama Library Association
would hold its first integrated convention (Graham, 2002, p. 128). Such comments
demonstrate the need for Southern librarians to be ever-mindful of their region’s
collective history, and the important role diversity can play in the modern library.
At the national level, the American Library Association (ALA) was also coping
with issues of integration. It chose Richmond, Virginia to be the site of its convention in
1936. Racial concerns were not raised when Richmond was chosen as a location for the
convention. At that time, only 21.52% of Virginia’s Black residents had access to public
library service. In rural areas of Virginia, the number of all residents, regardless of color,
with library cards was only 8% (Preer, 2004, p. 139). The Rosenwald Fund was operating
11 public libraries in Virginia, which led to some improvements in library service to
White and Black patrons. (Preer, 2004, p. 139). The Rosenwald Fund was established by

16
Sears and Roebuck president Julius Rosenwald in 1917 with the intention of advancing
the “well-being of mankind” (Robbins, 2005, p. 355).
Southern attitudes on race conflicted with the more liberal beliefs of members of
the ALA. The Library Journal printed several letters in which writers accused
Richmond’s racial policies as being in conflict with the ALA’s democratic core beliefs.
Black librarians were not allowed to participate in the convention activities, and the only
Blacks present at the convention were there for the purpose of providing entertainment
(Preer, 2004, pp. 150-152). One more further irony was that Virginia had one of the few
accredited library schools in the country, housed at the Hampton Institute, a Black
college. Consequently, none of the librarians Virginia was producing could attend the
premier library convention when it was held in their state (Preer, 2004, p. 152).
Following 1936, the ALA adopted a policy of full integration at future conventions
(Preer, 2004, p. 152).
Houston, Texas had a long-standing history of segregation at its public libraries,
dating back to the Houston Lyceum and Carnegie Library’s opening in 1904. Nine years
later, in 1913, the Colored Carnegie Library opened for Black residents (Malone, 2007, p.
666). Following legal victories in state court in the cases of Smith v. Alwright (1944),
which outlawed the state’s white primary system, and Sweatt v. Painter (1950), which
allowed Blacks entrance into the University of Texas Law School, it was generally
agreed that the segregated library system would not survive a court test. With the election
of a forward-thinking mayor, Roy M. Hofheinz, the city began moving toward
desegregating its libraries (Malone, 2007, pp. 666-668). Using an incrementalist
approach, the city gradually integrated its libraries, beginning with adult services and

17
gradually incorporating children’s services, until in 1961, the “colored” branch library
was circulating a scant ten books per day, which enabled city leaders to close it (Malone,
2007, pp. 669-673).
Diversity through Collection Development
Diversity in any library is difficult to achieve; a pinnacle to which one aspires.
Libraries cannot help but be biased to some extent, because they are created by humans.
“Libraries are always paradoxical; they are as personal as the collector, and at the same
time are an ideal statement of knowledge that is impersonal, because it is universal,
abstract, and so much larger than an individual life” (Wood, 2011, p. 42). Librarians
strive to achieve the inclusivity offered through the ideal of diversity in terms of
collections, faculty and staff, and ideas.
Effective collection development within an academic library can be viewed as a
combination of science, art, and magic. As well, both cognitive and affective processes
are at work for collection development librarians (Dickey, 2011; Metz, 1987; Quinn,
2007). Quantitative data are essential for guiding collection development activities, and
computerized integrated library systems (ILS) that track acquisitions, cataloging, and
circulation have made generating such data a much easier task than in the even not so
distant past. Librarians may also compare their collections quantitatively by using the
Research Libraries Group (RLG) database, which provides numerical scores indicating a
collection’s strength and allows librarians to more easily determine areas that need to be
further developed. Another technological innovation that allows librarians to further
diversify their collections is the Online Catalog of the Library of Congress’ (OCLC)
catalog, WorldCat. Libraries from around the world are able to upload records of works

18
by their nations’ authors, which in turn allows librarians in other countries to have
knowledge of those books (Dickey, 2011, pp. 159-160.).
It is also possible that in order to maintain some libraries’ collections, a certain
degree of intuition and knowledge by the librarian is required that an outsider might not
have. For instance, a specific part of the collection might rarely be used, yet the topic area
is deemed critical by key stakeholders. Such a situation might present itself in cases
where a university has a major with a small enrollment, but is committed to maintaining
the degree program. The unpredictability of budgeting for libraries is a final variable for
collection development librarians. Institutional budgets can be remarkably capricious and
may change dramatically from year to year, meaning that some “holes” in the collection
are virtually unavoidable (Metz, 1987, pp. 3-4).
A balanced collection is at times difficult to achieve because of the persistent
ongoing battle within a librarian of the cognitive versus the affective aspects of collection
development. As pointed out earlier, libraries are as “personal as the collector.”
Therefore, it is rare that a collection does not have the personal stamp of the individual
who was charged with developing it. Even when working diligently to avoid bias,
librarians will inevitably purchase books and other items that relate to their own personal
interests. Over a lengthy period of time, such actions could severely influence the nature
of the collection. Emotions often play a much larger role in collection development than
many might realize, which makes it important for librarians selecting books to reflect and
be sure there is an intellectual reason and an academic need for the collection
development decisions they make (Quinn, 2007, p. 13).

19
One of the most concrete measurements of a library’s commitment to diversity is
its permanent monographic collection. Essentially, what books has the library purchased,
and what books does it intend to purchase? Diversity initiatives regarding collections
should focus on relevant topics to the patrons of the library, as seen in British libraries
that focus on Muslim topics because of changing demographics, or United States libraries
that focus on Native American literature out of historical need (Birdi & Syed, 2011;
Horava, 2010; Shaffer, 2007).
A balanced collection is central to a librarian’s professional responsibility. The
goal for collection development librarians is to develop an equilibrium of diverse
perspectives and ideologies. This supports the concepts of intellectual freedom and
freedom to read (Horava, 2010, p. 144).
Previously, relatively few ethnically diverse authors could compete with Western
authors in English, consequently making most thought written in English, Western in
focus. Because of post-colonial authors, that is no longer the case. With authors from
South Asia and Africa rising to prominence, there is a movement to incorporate their
work into the Western body of literature. It should also be noted that members of those
ethnicities also felt members from their respective groups were misrepresented in works
of fiction concerning their culture (Birdi & Syed, 2011, pp.817-818). An increase in
English writers from around Great Britain’s post-colonial territories should assist in
mitigating that concern.
Fear of misrepresenting cultures is the reason some argue that only someone from
a culture can accurately write about said culture. Shanley asserted that “Native
Americans identities can only be established by Native Americans in the plentiful stories

20
and essays being written in the late twentieth century (1997, p. 675). Shanley later
conceded, though, that in their effort to be leaders and spokespeople for their culture,
Native American authors may at times romanticize episodes, beliefs, and moral positions
(Shanley, 1997, p. 675). This leads one to the conclusion that “objectivity and sensitivity”
are the key components of depicting the true nature of a culture, rather than an author’s
racial composition (Shaffer, 2007, p. 128).
Therefore, it is possible for librarians to engage in collection building practices
related to multiculturalism that include “literature that represents any distinct cultural
group through accurate portrayal and rich detail” (Barter, 1996, p. 12). A book that
exemplifies this definition is Walk Two Moons; released in 1996, it tells the story of a 13year-old Native American girl. The book was written by a White American woman. As a
result of the accurate portrayal, the book does qualify as a multicultural work (Barter, p.
12; Shaffer, 2007, p. 128).
Building a diverse and multicultural collection is an increasing priority for all
types of libraries, but academic libraries have been particularly active in this area. This is
demonstrated through the active development of children’s literature collections, overall
cultural diversity initiatives that support university-wide mandates and cooperative
agreements that allow for sharing with other partner institutions that can also have an
impact on collection development (Chao, 2001; Pettingill & Morgan, 1996; Thornton,
2010).
The world of children’s literature looms large in an academic library because of
its importance to nascent teachers in schools of education. Typically, much attention has
been paid to building collections around awards such as the Newberry, Caldecott, Printz,

21
and Corretta Scott King awards. As a result of an increasing focus on multiculturalism in
education, it is important that librarians focus on developing collections of award winners
from outside the United States as well. In so doing, a better understanding and
appreciation for other cultures and countries can be developed by readers (Thornton,
2010, p. 47). The White Raven Award in Germany is an excellent example of a source
for collection development ideas on children’s literature from other cultures that has been
translated into English.
Collection development librarians may also improve their holdings by focusing on
purchasing items beyond major trade and university presses. They should also be
exploring the possibility of adding primary source documents that relate to ethnic and
racial groups (Trujillo & Weber, 1991, p. 160). Such additions are found quite easily
today, because of the slew of databases currently on the market.
Some institutions may enter into cooperative agreements in an effort to foster
diversity, as did the William and Anita Newman Library at Baruch College, a part of the
City University of New York (CUNY). This was done in response to the increasing
population of Asian and Asian-American students on the campus as well as the library’s
focus on developing collections on the Chinese language and on Chinese cultural studies.
Such an arrangement can lead to “better and enhanced services for the library patrons
through cooperative cataloging, centralized processing, cooperative acquisition of library
materials, exchange of bibliographic information, interlibrary loans, library information
networks, and library storage centers” (Chao, 2001, p. 124). Through such collaborations,
a more thoughtful collection development process is possible. By working together in the
technological age, cooperative relationships such as this could foster initiatives in library

22
digitization as a response to meeting the challenges of working with other people from a
great distance.
Few factors are as important in achieving a diverse collection as choosing the
correct individuals to be in charge of the selection process. Ultimately, selections for
additions to academic library collections are determined by a combination of subject area
librarians and teaching faculty (Macleod, 1981; Munro & Philips, 2008). The relationship
between these two individuals can be fraught with tension, with no clear right or wrong
on either side. The faculty member is likely to have more expert knowledge about the
subject under question as a whole. However, the librarian is likely to have a better
understanding of the collection as a whole, what areas need to be improved, and what
areas have what can be considered a critical mass that assure students and scholars may
conduct their research as needed (Munro & Philips, 2008, p. 150).
Munro and Philips further argued that while it can rarely be argued that teaching
faculty had more knowledge of specific subject areas, they can also tend to weight their
selections heavily toward their specific teaching interests, which leads to an unbalanced
collection rather than a balanced one. Teaching faculties’ selections must also be
reviewed by the relevant subject specialist librarian for appropriateness for other reasons,
such as the over-purchasing of periodicals and even a sometimes cavalier attitude
regarding the selection process caused by a lack of time or interest (Munro & Philips,
2008, p. 149).
The ideal situation that will insure a balanced and diverse collection that is also
high quality remains that of a genuine collaboration between faculty librarians and
librarian subject specialists. Rarely, though, is this utopic vision ever realized, due to the

23
nature in which faculty members tend to become involved in the collection development
process. Macleod (1981) pointed out that there are two types of faculty selectors. The
first are what he termed “bibliomaniacs,” who volunteer for every search committee that
comes down the pike. The second, and the most common, are faculty members who are
appointed to collection development committees, in order to check off a box within the
confines of the tenure and promotion process (MacLeod, 1981, pp. 146-147). Such
individuals may have only a minimal interest in this role because it was an assignment
rather than a choice. Furthermore, where faculty involvement is involved, what is truly
needed is not so much a faculty representative from each department, but a more active
role by all faculty. Such involvement will assure a balanced collection and also
counteract the effects of the specialized nature of teaching faculty, who might tend to
weight the collection toward their own narrow teaching or research interests.
The library profession sets forth guidelines for collection development that are
intended to be the standard for all librarians. Developed by the Reference and User
Services Association (RUSA) and last updated in 2010, these guidelines were developed
to assure even nascent librarians can be secure in developing an appropriate collection for
their library. RUSA recommends that librarians involve their clientele when assessing the
collection. Involvement includes having a mechanism to allow individuals to recommend
titles and resources for acquisition by the library. It also includes an assessment
mechanism, such as a survey, that allows for a reflective component that provides the
library’s clientele the opportunity to indicate their opinion of the collection. The
guidelines stress that libraries should have a collection development policy and subject

24
area librarians should work collaboratively with other library stakeholders (RUSA, 2010,
pp. 97-98).
Defining what constitutes a diverse or multicultural collection is ultimately at the
discretion of the individual charged with developing the collection. A library could focus
on traditional aspects of diversity, such as race, ethnicity, and gender. Others might want
to take such initiatives farther and focus on “maximum inclusivity by including sexual
orientation, gender identity, gender expression, physical ability, and socio-economic
class” (Ciszek & Young, 2010, p. 155). Ciszek and Young went on to point out that the
ALA also offers a broad explanation of diversity that is essentially all-inclusive.
Assessing the level of diversity in a collection can be achieved by using WorldCat
Collection Analysis, an Internet tool that allows libraries to compare their collections to
others. Librarians may also consult standard bibliographies, such as the Association of
College and Research Studies Women’s Studies Section’s Core List of Books. It is also
possible to utilize circulation and user statistics to determine the extent to which diverse
items are being circulated. In order to truly demonstrate a commitment to diversity,
libraries may want to consider creating a diversity librarian position and creating a
diversity statement. In so doing, libraries will demonstrate they are taking a proactive
approach to this issue (Ciszek & Young, 2010, pp. 156-159).
As a response to the university’s overall five—year plan, Old Dominion
University’s library decided to enact a diversity initiative in terms of its collection, which
contained eight points, one, stressing cultural diversity. Librarians discovered the
minority enrollment of the institution had grown over a 14-year period from 10% to 21%.
By examining the cultural backgrounds of ethnic minorities on campus, librarians were

25
more able to adequately investigate how to meet their needs as students. Librarians then
examined their collections to see how many items they had based on categories such as
Native American Studies or Chinese Studies. Once an item list was prepared, the
collection could be compared to other collections and booklists to assist in determining
future orders (Pettingill & Morgan, 1996, pp. 12-13).
The Challenge of Racist Materials
One challenge for librarians is where lines should be drawn relating to collections
that are deemed by some or many to be racist. This problem presents a particular
dilemma for academic librarians, because there are intellectual freedom issues that come
into play. Such materials may also be a valuable educational resource from an historical
perspective. At the same time, groups may justly find such materials offensive, and in
some cases, it is possible that university students may not understand the nature of the
materials without proper guidance. These issues are made clearer when examined through
the lens of Native American literature, which historically has been filled with racist
language and imagery (Burke, 2009; Tjoumas, 1993).
In order to build a good Native American collection, it is important to be positive
the books being acquired are free of racist terminology and that they do not perpetuate
negative stereotypes regarding Native Americans. American culture has been filled with
such stereotypes that stemmed from nineteenth century writings and twentieth century
Hollywood movies for so long that often the average person does not realize what is real
and what is false in regard to Native American culture, making it incumbent on the
librarian to purchase appropriate materials. In the past, surveys of juvenile Native
American literature have returned findings with terms such as “awful savages,” “red

26
devils,” and “crazy Indians who hardly looked like men” (Tjoumas, 1993, p. 110).
Librarians can play a leading role in eliminating such racist stereotypes through sound
collection development practices and decisions (Tjoumas, 1993, p. 110). Librarians can
eliminate issues of intellectual freedom concerning preexisting books in the collection
that contain such language by creating a separate section for those materials and
providing information that places the writings within the context of their time, which will
ultimately help students better understand the subject matter.
From Native American collections to those relating to African Americans and
other groups, the primary problem for collection development librarians is not so much
whether to buy specific materials, but what to do with them, because they were acquired
in earlier days. Studies have found that in the case of African Americans, particularly
regarding children’s books, which are also the most common book type challenged by
patrons, there have been significant changes to the manner in which they were depicted
over time (Burke, 2009, p. 370). In studies, librarians have been found to prefer retaining
books with racist language because of the issue of intellectual freedom, which is at the
heart of the profession. Patrons generally take the opposite view. As stated above,
creating a separate section in which the books can be examined within their proper
historical context may be the best solution to the problem.
Diversity in terms of Faculty and Staff
Developing a national pool of diverse librarians has been an increasingly
important goal of the American Library Association (ALA) since the inception of its
Spectrum initiative in 1997. The program offers scholarships to individuals wanting to
become librarians who are from diverse ethnic backgrounds. However, to date, this

27
initiative has had a relatively minimal impact on the profession, especially in terms of
recruitment of Hispanics to the field, which is considered crucial because of their rapidly
increasing population in the United States (Balderrama, 2000; Edelman, 2005; Guerena
& Edward, 2000; Pyati, 2003).
The fastest growing ethnic group in the United States is Hispanics, and as a result
there is an increasing amount of discussion among librarians nationally as to how to draw
them into the pool of library workers and users. There are a variety of reasons for
Hispanics not using libraries, which range from not realizing the institution actually may
have a Spanish language collection to being afraid of coming into contact with a
government organization. Communication with Spanish and other language speakers can
sometimes be a problem as well, and it may be up to librarians to become functionally
fluent in Spanish (and other languages) for this problem to be solved. In spite of efforts
by the American Library Association (ALA) and universities across the nation, the
percentage of librarians who are of a Latino background has remained stagnant since
1970 at only 1.8% (Guerena & Edward, 2000, p. 172).
Librarians recognize diversity as an operating principal, and because of everincreasing diverse users, there is a critical need for a librarian workforce that is diverse.
To this end, positions such as diversity librarian and diversity-themed committees have
been created at several universities (Balderrama, 2000, pp. 196-197). Balderrama further
argued that one obstacle to increased staff diversity is a preference for the status quo on
the part of top management, which he argued has little support for change and is often a
barrier to said change (Balderrama, 2000, p. 198). Although Balderrama strenuously
argued for the hiring of more diverse personnel, he failed to address the underlying issue

28
of the small number of minority librarians in the workforce. He did though, point out that
a lack of diversity is a challenge for a variety of fields beyond librarianship, particularly
in the media and politics (Balderamma, 2000, p. 205).
The front line or initial point of contact for most patrons in libraries is the
reference desk. Reference interviews can be especially challenging when librarians are
either unfamiliar with the language of the patron or are unused to assisting Limited
English Proficient patrons (LEP). With the continued and steady increase of speakers of
other languages, especially in terms of the Hispanic population, libraries must adapt in
order to properly cope with the challenges of changing demographics they serve. Some
solutions include improving reference librarians’ sensitivity to the different
communication styles of ethnic groups. Continued recruitment of Hispanics to the field is
also essential, in light of studies that indicate patrons from other cultures often feel more
comfortable approaching the reference desk when they know bilingual individuals are
present. Librarians who are sensitive to the needs of LEP patrons have also been shown
to put LEP patrons at ease (Pyati, 2003, pp. 264-266).
Edelman (2005) pointed out that many within the profession recognized the
importance of diversity within librarianship as early as the 1950s. During this time
period, the United States government began funding faculty and students in newly
established university programs that focused on Asian, Eastern European, and Latin
American studies. Libraries needed catalogers, particularly, who had language skills up to
the task of properly developing and cataloging materials in languages that were not
commonly spoken among the faculty and staff (Edelman, 2005, p. 235).

29
Several scholars have noted the critical shortage of diversity in librarianship and
that it potentially shortchanges the patrons they serve (Trujillo & Weber, 1991; Whitmire,
2003). Studies have shown that minority students use the library more than their White
counterparts. These students, as Pyati also noted, feel more comfortable, or at least less
intimidated approaching librarians of similar backgrounds to their own (Whitmire, 2003,
pp. 160-161). One possible solution to this dilemma is for libraries to consider identifying
local individuals and recruit them into the field of librarianship. Such people might be
drawn from the student body, student assistants, or student support staff within the
university community (Trujillo & Weber, 1991, p. 158).
Librarians who are from a non-White ethnicity can feel isolated, which has led to
the development of associations and conferences geared specifically toward them.
Among these is the Black Caucus of the American Library Association (BCALA), which
sponsors the National Conference of African American Librarians (NCAAL). By having
conferences such as NCAAL, the possibility of Black librarians feeling as though they
were lost or isolated, which has been a complaint at larger conferences, is eliminated
(Nelson, 1994, p. 38). Conferences such as NCAAL are able to meet the specific needs of
librarians of color and can also serve as starting points for outreach to support ALA
programs such as Spectrum.
On a positive note, the library profession is aging, meaning that with retirements,
there will be many opportunities to diversify the profession in the coming years. In the
United States, 17.8% of the population is 50 years of age or older (van der Walt & du
Plessis, 2010, p. 4). Through previously mentioned ALA initiatives, as well as what is

30
becoming a rapidly more diverse United States, it is inevitable that the library profession
will be somewhat diversified as these individuals retire.
It is interesting to compare South African diversity initiatives and issues with
those of the United States, because of their unfortunate shared history relating to race
relations. Both nations shared a sharply segregated past. Although this was especially true
in the American South, the racial divide was present on a national scale for much of
United States history. South Africa did not end its Apartheid policies until the 1990s.
Apartheid’s end changed South Africa more fundamentally than did the end of
segregation in America. Within the South African Constitution is a pledge to uphold “the
values of human dignity, equality, freedom and social justice in a united, non-racial and
non-sexist society where all may flourish” (Ocholla, 2002, p. 62). Ocholla discovered that
it is easier to change a constitution that it is to change the manner in which individual
people think. Unlike the ALA, the South African Library and Information Association
(LIASA) has failed to produce any diversity initiatives (p. 65).
Eight years after Apartheid’s end, libraries in South Africa generally continue to
lack diversity in terms of their staff. As a rule, the staff is a reflection of the library’s
community, whether that community be geographic, or in the case of universities, based
on the demographic the institutions have typically recruited, such as in the cases of
Historically White Universities and Historically Black Universities. Ocholla pointed out
that “diversity is difficult to enforce when a demographic area is dominated by a
homogenous community” (Ocholla, 2002, pp. 63-64). However, Ocholla further noted
that some universities, such as the University of Western Cape (UWC), recognize

31
diversity as a “huge” issue at their library. The challenge is to translate that attitude to
other institutions (Ocholla, 2002, pp. 63-64).
Ocholla (2002) asked the reader to consider the impact of the psychological toll of
Apartheid. At the moment, apathy appears to be prevailing on the issue of diversity, in
spite of the fact that strong instruments are in place for its encouragement. There is also a
fear that choosing to make diversity an issue can further divide people (Ocholla, 2002, p.
66). In examining the challenges of creating a diverse library climate in South Africa, it is
important to recognize the fact that there has been a seismic shift in the political climate
since 1994, and individuals must be given time to internalize and accept the new reality, a
process that has been on-going in the United States since the Brown v. Board (1954)
Supreme Court case.
In spite of the remarkable homogeneity in the field and the ALA’s lethargy in
developing the Spectrum Program, librarians have been keenly aware of the importance
of cultural diversity for a considerable time, both in the United States and abroad, and
even in the most homogenous of places. Diversity in many Southeastern libraries was not
a possibility until the early 1970s. Full scale diversity did not begin in the United States
until the 1980s, although for Black Americans it began during the Civil Rights era,
launched by the Brown v. Board (1954) decision. In 1994, Josey demanded that the ALA
cease its tolerance of state associations that denied entry to African American librarians.
Josey and Abdullahi (2002) employed a broad definition of diversity, stating that it
should include equal participation of both sexes in organizations, regardless of race,
ethnicity, gender handicap, or sexual orientation (Josey & Abdullahi, 2002, p. 10). The
authors argued against the canard that true diversity includes so many groups that such

32
movements die under their own weight, instead they argued that diversity can increase
organizational effectiveness (Josey & Abdullahi, 2002, p. 12). The ALA did not support
diversity through any financial means until the Spectrum Diversity program was
established in 1997. With United States population trends continuing down a diverse
path, this initiative and others will need to be supported and developed.
Patterson (2003) and Stanton (2006) wrote extensively in their books about the
history of segregation in Alabama’s public libraries. In so doing, they revealed that a
consequence of such reprehensible behaviors, that were legitimized by laws passed by an
immoral legislature, is for studies to be conducted from time to time to determine the
extent to which a new Alabama is committed to the concept of diversity. Although overt
acts such as beatings over attempting to obtain a library card (Patterson) or cross burnings
in librarians yards for supporting integration (Stanton, 2006) no longer occur, are libraries
remembering to engage diversity on softer levels, such as in terms of programming,
collection building, and staffing procedures?
Today, librarians of color do have significantly more resources than in the past
through organizations geared specifically toward them. African American recruitment
into the library field is fostered in part by the Black Caucus of the American Library
Association (BCALA). As the former president and current treasurer of BCALA
explained in 1994, “black librarians tend to get lost at the bigger conferences,” but within
the BCALA, specifically through the organization’s conference, the National Conference
of African American Librarians (NCAAL), “they have a better chance to network, learn,
and keep community (Nelson, 1994, pp. 38-39).”

33
Diversity of Ideas
The library profession is dominated in the United States by White females.
Although this trend is gradually changing, it will take time for a meaningful balancing of
the sexes and races to occur. This does not negate librarians’ ability to promote diversity
of thought within their libraries. Just, as mentioned above, those with the proper mindset
can accurately depict other cultures through writing, so can librarians from one
perspective encourage meaningful programs and discussions about other cultures and
ways of life. This can be fostered in a variety of ways, from building collections about
other cultures’ histories and languages, to engaging in international experiences, to
making a school or academic library friendly to an increasingly large immigrant
population (Agnosto, 2007; Martin, 1994; Pors, 2007; Reznowski, 2008; Vaagen &
Enger, 2004).
Agnosto (2007) defined culture as referring to much more than just racial and
ethnic backgrounds. The term encompasses a much wider array of characteristics that
include “a person’s ethnic, racial, linguistic, religious, gender, disability, political,
geographic, age, or socioeconomic status” (Agnosto, 2007, p. 27). Creating a
multicultural library can lead to students and patrons developing a sense of belonging
within the academic community. Multicultural resources are also helpful for easing the
transition into a new environment for English-language learners and also help other
students learn more about the world around them (Agnosto, 2007, pp. 30-31).
Librarians need not necessarily be from a minority group to foster diversity within
their own library. One such example is found at Washington State University, where
language librarians began actively engaging their patrons through both collection

34
development and teaching library skills that relate to language learners’ needs. In order
for such an initiative to be successful, a positive and collegial relationship is needed
between the language faculty and library faculty; needed materials must be identified
corresponding to the skill level of the language students; once the materials arrive, those
they are intended for need to be alerted to their existence and explained the value of the
items (Reznowski, 2008, p. 415). In so doing, the librarian can play an important role in
student learning outcomes at a university.
Librarians have multitudinous opportunities to learn about other cultures through
in-person experiences. Exchanges between countries are widely available, as are longterm seminars and fellowships to which librarians may apply. Taking advantage of such
opportunities can have the effect of creating an increase in respect for other cultures
among librarians who engage in such activities and also cause said individuals to be more
reflective in how they view differences among people (Pors, 2007, p. 189).
The challenge of developing libraries that support multicultural endeavors is a
worldwide one. Norway, which has historically had a decidedly homogenous culture, is
now faced with a sharp population decline, as is the rest of Scandinavia, and by
extension, Europe. This is caused by declining birthrates for indigenous populations. In
order for such nations to maintain viable economies, it is necessary for them to increase
the number of immigrants they admit, leading to the potential for cultural clashes, as well
as the occasional aberration, exemplified by the mass murder by Anders Behring Brevik
in July, 2011. As a result of wanting to improve their practices relating to
multiculturalism, Norwegian libraries have for a considerable time tried to hone their
skills in this area, particularly in Oslo, where a significant portion of the student

35
population in primary and secondary schools belongs to a linguistic minority (Vaagen &
Enger, 2004, p. 337).
Librarians in Norway are assisted in their efforts to achieve a multicultural
environment by definitive language from the national government that does not exist in
such specificity in the United States. The Public Library Act of 1985 tasks public
libraries with advancing learning by offering materials and programs that are available to
all residents. School librarians in Oslo are trying to meet this goal, which is exemplified
by best practices at Vahl Primary School, which holds titles written in Urdu, Arabic, and
Turkish, while at the same time works to promote proficiency in Norwegian. Story telling
takes place in students’ mother tongues until they are proficient in the Norwegian
language. As a result of rapidly changing demographics throughout the world, library
schools should actively educate their students to meet the needs of new populations of
patrons (Vaagen & Enger, 2004, pp. 338-343).
Dedication to developing a multicultural library demands attention be paid not
only to ethnic minorities, but also to gaps that exist culturally between generations, social
classes, and educational levels. Programming and events that promote harmony in these
areas can allow libraries to be “a meeting place with an integrating potential in a period
of profound cultural, demographic, and social changes,” (Audenson, 2004, p. 430).
Libraries can allow newcomers to a community a gradual introduction to the ways of the
local community, while at the same time providing them with opportunities to cultivate
their own culture. By recognizing that these two roles are far from disparate, the library
can achieve the ideal role of being a meeting place in today’s multicultural society
(Audenson, 2004, p. 432).

36
Audenson (2004) detailed a side effect of a program in Oslo that succeeded in
bridging generational and ethnic divides. A branch library hosted a regular Internet group
for senior citizens to teach them about computer technologies with which they were
unfamiliar. Over a period of time, the senior citizens and IT-minded immigrant youths
who were also using the library discovered that through interaction they had much to
learn from each other. Audenson pointed out that because both groups had a “kernel” of
common interests, they were able to bridge the gap between them (Audenson, 2004, pp.
437-438). Such programs demonstrate the valuable role libraries can play in a democracy.
Perhaps, the best long-range method for assuring diversity of thought among
librarians is to train nascent librarians to think along diverse lines from the start which is
not currently happening in many library schools across the United States. Subramaniam
and Jaeger (2011) recommended taking such an approach by adding classes that focus on
diversity as part of the required curriculum at library schools. They pointed out that
diversity is a broad topic and must be made a part of the overall curriculum for students
to genuinely understand its true meaning. Several traits fall under their concept of
diversity, which include elements relating to age, race, gender, physical disabilities,
language proficiency, sexual orientation, place of origin, and religious, moral, and
political values and beliefs (Subramaniam & Jaeger, 2011, p. 2).
Only 22.2% of the students enrolled in library programs indicated on a survey that
they were aware of any diversity-related courses available to them within the context of
their master’s program. Subramaniam and Jaeger (2011) recommended several types of
courses that would ameliorate this problem, including offerings such as: International and
Comparative Information Services, Multicultural Literature & Information Resources for

37
Youth, and African American Bibliography, among others (Subramaniam & Jaeger,
2011, p. 8).
As the changing clientele continues to evolve on university campuses across the
United States, libraries must cope to meet the needs of new students from different
backgrounds (Bianco, 2004; Martin, 1994). Key challenges academic libraries face that
relate to changing demographics include older patrons, new and emerging communities,
and cross-cultural understanding. Emerging communities are the greatest of these
concerns, because they are the most in need of support, because they are removed from
their family and indigenous community (Bianco, 2004, p. 27). Such individuals need
libraries to support them in such areas as communicating with family and friends in their
home country (e.g,. Skype, instant messaging, email), support with learning English,
education in how to use the library (beyond what a student accustomed to American
libraries might need), and information about health and employment. The university
library can also serve as a place where such individuals can share and celebrate their
identity with other students (Bianco, 2004, p. 28).
University libraries are responding to multicultural students’ needs in a variety of
manners. International students frequently view the library differently than those raised in
the United States. For instance, the library is often perceived as an arm of the state by
individuals from countries that have repressive regimes in place. Consequently it is
necessary to actively recruit such students to the library. As student populations become
more diverse, it is increasingly important to reallocate funds in order to fund resources to
support them (Martin, 1994, pp. 4-5). Most academic libraries quickly recognize the need
for developing collections that support diverse populations. As well, academic libraries,

38
such as at the University of New Mexico, seem keenly aware of the need to fully embrace
the dominant cultures they serve, in that case Whites, Hispanics, and Native Americans.
As campuses continue to diversify, though, it will become even more important to reach
out to a wider group of the international student community and also move beyond only
collections and also increase diversity in terms of staffing and programming in order for
such students to truly feel they are a part of the university community (Martin, 1994, p.
6).
Train, Dalton, and Elkin (2000, p. 483) listed a variety of factors that can lead to
groups being marginalized, including ethnic origin, gender, sexuality, physical or mental
disability, educational attainment, and economic status. They referenced Great Britain’s
Social Exclusion Unit, formed in 1997 to promote unity in an increasingly multicultural
nation. The Unit emphasized the importance of lifelong learning programs and literacy
programs to combat a variety of societal problems, which libraries could play a role in
assuaging. Through such programs, groups could “celebrate diversity through delighting
in difference” (Train, Dalton, & Elkin, 2000, p. 485). The British Public Library Service
also calls for libraries to create a non-judgmental, non-competitive environment; be a
caring, helpful and supportive place for the entire family, be a place to discover and
delight in diversity, be a safe haven, a place for sanctuary (an interesting point to consider
in light of recent immigration legislation passed in several Southeastern states); and to
encourage responsibility and citizenship (Train, Dalton, & Elkin, 2000, pp. 486-488).
The International Federation of Library Association’s (IFLA) Freedom of Access
to Information and Freedom of Expression (FAIFE) Committees are also supportive of
the concept that multiculturalism benefits all members of a society, and not just specific

39
minority groups. Such practices that foster multiculturalism can lead to all groups having
a deeper and richer understanding of each other. Therefore, FAIFE calls for giving
multicultural services and programming a higher policy profile and increasing funding
for activities and programming (Sturges, 2005, p. 305).
One crucial step in working to attain a diverse atmosphere in a library is to learn
what diverse learners need and want. Surveys can be an excellent aid in assisting
librarians in learning what their students already know, as well as what they need to learn
or have access to in order to make their library experience a better and more rewarding
one. International students continue to have an increased presence in colleges throughout
the United States, and consequently have an inescapable positive impact on diversity of
thought throughout the academy. Following a survey of international students, several
ideas were gleaned that could improve services to this group, including: creating a
partnership between the library and the international programs office, assigning a
librarian to international student programs and outreach, increasing library orientation
and outreach efforts specifically to international students, creating an online tutorial for
international students, creating library webpages for international students, collaborating
with campus pre-college English as a second language institutes, and providing
professional development seminars for library staff relating to services for international
students (Jackson, 2004, pp. 205-207).
Little can be more controversial than issues relating to gender. This subject can be
particularly difficult for librarians who are faced with making purchases or possibly
engaging in programming topics that reach out to people with alternate lifestyles, or
perhaps have programming relating to sex education (Cohen, 2008; Lupien, 2007).

40
Cohen found that librarians felt strongly that they should collect materials that would
inform teenagers about their reproductive health. However, they were uncomfortable with
including programming on the subject. Cohen stated that the American Library
Association advocates programming on such subjects, but librarians surveyed indicated
they were concerned about backlash from parents and within the overall community
(Cohen, 2008, p. 42).
As Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender (GLBT) students have become more
visible on campuses around the nation, libraries have come under increasing pressure to
meet their needs. GLBT students surveyed indicated they were “marginally satisfied”
with the collections and services at their academic library. Respondents indicated they
would prefer to see more up-to-date print materials, including books, journals, and
popular magazines. Forty percent of respondents indicated they chose not to approach the
reference desk to ask a question relating to a GLBT issue (Lupien, 2007, pp. 143-144).
Much effort has been put forth to define diversity (Ciszek & Young, 2010; Josey
& Abdullahi, 2002; Walter, 2005). Walter defined diversity as: “an administrative and
intellectual construct that typically encompasses concerns about the recruitment and
retention of students representing racial and cultural minority groups, the promotion of an
inclusive campus climate for students representing diverse cultures, and the development
of academic programs that explore the history, language, and culture of a variety of racial
and ethnic communities” (Walter, 2005, p. 438).
In spite of considerable efforts on the part of universities to attract diverse student
bodies, library support for such initiatives has proven to be uneven at best. The reason for
this dichotomy often relates to a library’s budget, which is faced with the same monetary

41
commitments it has always had, and is expected to build more diverse collections, or
develop diverse programming, with the same flat funding they have often had for years.
Many libraries have forged ahead though, creating diversity committees, and also finding
success in diversifying collections of relevant academic departments by library liaisons
working closely with faculty. Through working collaboratively with other departments,
libraries can also develop programs that foster campus diversity initiatives (Walter, 2005,
pp. 239-242).

CHAPTER 3
METHODOLOGY
The purpose of this multi-site mixed-methods study was to determine the extent to
which a diverse environment exists at three academic libraries in the Southeastern United
States. Diversity was measured based on observations (including staffing and
programming), instruments (three surveys developed by the University of Tennessee
Libraries Diversity Committee), interviews with deans and department heads, and catalog
count. The libraries that were studied consisted of a Large University Research Library
(LURL), a Regional University Library (RUL), and the library at an Historically Black
College or University (HBUL). This chapter provides the research questions, research
design, participants, data collection procedures, instrumentation, data analysis schema,
and personal biography of the researcher.
Research Questions
The overarching research question for this study was: To what extent are three
academic libraries in the Southeast embracing diversity? This study utilized surveys
containing a four- point Likert scale and a “not applicable” option given to
administrators, librarians, and staff at three unique academic libraries in a state in the
southeastern United States. An analysis was made of collections to determine the extent
to which they were diverse. An analysis was also made of programming to further
determine the extent to which a diversity of ideas existed at the libraries studied. The

43
qualitative portion of the study involved interviews with the deans and department heads
of the libraries to determine the level of importance they placed on diversity within their
libraries. Four subquestions that stemmed from the primary research question were:
1. To what extent is diversity considered a valued attribute of three academic
libraries in the Southeast in terms of race, religion, gender, nationality, and
sexual orientation?
2. What strategies are employed at three academic libraries in the Southeast to
foster diversity in terms of race, religion, gender, nationality, and sexual
orientation?
3. What are the perceived effects of diversity initiatives at three academic
libraries in the Southeast in terms of race, religion, gender, nationality, and
sexual orientation?
4. To what extent are the faculty and staff, collections, and programming at three
academic libraries in the Southeast diverse in terms of race, religion, gender,
nationality, and sexual orientation?
The researcher anticipated that a variety of themes will emerge as a result of the
insights gleaned from the literature review, particularly because of expectations placed on
librarians by the American Library Association regarding diversity. These themes are
found in Table 1 on the following page.

Research Design
This study was a multi-site, mixed methods study that examined three academic
libraries in the Southeast in an effort to determine the extent to which a diverse
environment existed at those institutions. In order to obtain a sample of a variety of
academic library types, an LURL, a RUL, and an HBUL were studied.
Case studies are empirically researched and investigate a “contemporary
phenomenon within its real-life context; when the boundaries between phenomenon and
context are not clearly evident; and in which multiple sources of evidence are used” (Yin,
1989, p. 23). A multiple site case study may provide added insight into an issue
(Creswell, 2007, p. 477). For this reason, the multiple site approach was chosen over a
single site approach. This approach is ideally fit to the topic, because the mission of
qualitative research is to study “the experience of real cases operating in real situations”
(Stake, 2005, p. 3).
The case study approach is also flexible in that it is not limited to only one type of
data. Qualitative and quantitative data can be studied. Furthermore, a variety of data
gathering techniques may be used, including surveys, interviews, and direct observations,
all of which were used in this study (Yin, 2004, p. 99).

45
The case study researcher plays a variety of roles, possibly none more important
than that of interpreter. This is because the researcher has recognized some type of
curiosity, and wants to delve more deeply into that subject, in order to increase the
knowledge on that topic. The researcher can then make that knowledge comprehensible
to others (Stake, 1995, p. 97).
This study was designed to determine the extent to which three academic libraries
in the Southeast have implemented diverse practices, as well as to gather evidence
regarding attitudes about diversity at these same institutions. In order to do so, a mixed
methods study allowed for the analysis of raw data, such as monographic collections and
examples of programming, and also delved into the personal beliefs of selected
interviewees. Mixed methods studies are ideal for studies such as this one, because by
bringing both quantitative data and qualitative data together, it will be possible to provide
a better understanding of the research problem (Creswell, 2008, p. 552). Permission to
conduct the study was granted by Alabama State University’s Institutional Review Board
(Appendix A). Interviews were conducted with library faculty (in academic libraries) and
staff. Surveys developed by the University of Tennessee Libraries Diversity Committee
were also distributed to these same groups. Permission to administer the survey was
obtained from the Committee that developed the survey (see Appendix B). Collections,
programming, and faculty and staff make-up were examined to further consider diversity
levels at the three institutions that were studied. Through these activities, the researcher
was able to determine the extent that a diverse and multicultural environment existed at
these facilities in relation to collections, staffing, and ideas. In order to examine the
diversity of the libraries’ collection, a variety of search terms were entered into the

46
catalog and the number of returns were compared. These terms can be found in Table 2
below.

Qualitative data was collected through interviews conducted with library
leadership at each of the three institutions studied. Qualitative research is defined by
Creswell as research that “begins with assumptions, a worldview, the possible use of a
theoretical lens, and the study of research problems inquiring into the meaning of
individuals or groups ascribe to a social or human problem” (Creswell, 2007, p. 37). In
qualitative research, data are collected in a natural setting and the final written report is
reflective of the voices of the participants (Creswell, 2007, p. 37).

47
Sites and Participants
In order to obtain an accurate snapshot of diversity levels and initiatives in
academic libraries in the selected state, three types of libraries were chosen to be studied.
These libraries were found at three distinct university types that consist of a large,
traditional university, a smaller regional university with roots as a teachers’ college, and
an historically Black university.
The LURL was selected because it is the library for the flagship university in the
selected state. It had an enrollment of more than 33,000 students; approximately 5,000 of
those students were enrolled as graduate students at the time of the study. The LURL was
in an urban setting and had been in existence for more than 150 years. The university’s
student body was 82% White and 12% Black, with a small number of Hispanics and
Asians enrolled. Two percent of the enrollment consisted of International Students. The
university was segregated until the 1960s.
The RUL studied was selected because it was representative of the numerous
traditional teacher colleges, or “normal schools,” in the state. The enrollment of the main
campus—which was the one studied—was approximately 7,000. The university was in a
rural setting and had been in existence for 125 years at the time of the study. The student
body was 60% White and 28% Black. Slightly more than 12% of the enrollment of the
university consisted of International Students.
The final library studied was one of several HBUL libraries in the state. It was in
an urban setting with an enrollment of slightly fewer than 10,000. One third of those
students were graduate students. The student body had a significant majority of Black
students, although White students frequently enrolled in graduate level classes. The

48
university was also heavily recruiting International Students. The university was founded
more than 125 years ago.
These libraries were selected through convenience, purposeful sampling
(Creswell, 2007). Because the participants of this study were from small populations, all
full time personnel in the libraries studied were provided the opportunity to take the
quantitative survey portion of the study. Deans and department heads were asked to
participate in the qualitative portion of the study. The three libraries were familiar to the
researcher and were easily accessible. The RUL and HBUL studied had only one main
library, but the LURL had five separate libraries on its campus. For this reason,
administration, faculty, and staff, at only the main library were surveyed. This library was
the primary library for the campus and had the most significant interaction with the
general student population.
A qualitative study was conducted at all three libraries. In order to seek out the
most informed individuals for this study, purposeful sampling was used to select
participants for this part of the study. Specifically, library administrators (deans) and one
other person of the deans’ choosing, at the respective institutions were interviewed in
order to gauge their opinions, attitudes, and perspectives concerning diversity at their
library, as well as the importance they placed on the concept of diversity.
Of the six participants who were interviewed, five had served as faculty librarians
for more than ten years. Three librarians, all deans, had served for at least 25 years in the
library field. Two participants were White Males, one was a White woman, and three
were Black Women. All had a Master’s degree in Library Science. The three deans also
had received a Ph.D.

49
Data Collection Methods
Before data gathering could commence, it was necessary for permissions to be
obtained, beginning with permission from Alabama State University’s Institutional
Review Board (see Appendix A). It was then necessary for the researcher to determine
the gatekeeper of the organizations studied (Creswell, 2008, p. 219). For the purposes of
this study, the gatekeepers were the deans of the three university libraries being studied.
Once the respective gatekeepers offered permission for the study to go forth by signing
the Site Authorization Letter (see Appendix C), approval for the study was then
submitted to the universities to be studied as well as the university attended by the
researcher. Upon approval from all universities, the data collection process proceeded at
the three university libraries.
All full time faculty and staff at each of the three libraries studied were asked to
take a diversity climate survey that assessed attitudes and perceptions concerning
diversity at their institutions. Surveys were administered and data was collected through
Survey Monkey. The snowball technique as outlined by Creswell, was implemented in
determining what subjects were interviewed at the libraries studied (Creswell, 2008, p.
156-157). Interviews were also conducted with deans at each of the three libraries
studied. In those interviews, the deans were asked to provide the names of other relevant
librarians that could be interviewed in order to add further insight on diversity topics at
their library. These interviews provided the opportunity to further study, from a
qualitative standpoint, attitudes concerning library diversity at these institutions. Data
relating to diversity of collections was gathered through searches of each university’s
Internet-based catalog. The public services librarian for each library studied was asked to

50
provide a list of public programming activities for the past five years that were sponsored
by the library.
In gathering data, Creswell stressed that it was imperative that ethical practices
are maintained by the researcher (p. 238). Data was collected in confidence, with only a
key, password-protected document kept on the researcher’s laptop and a back-up drive
that identified the participants to their transcripts. Participants’ confidentiality was thus
protected, with relatively little potential of their identities being revealed. Participants
also reviewed an informed consent form (see Appendix D) in order to understand the
purpose of the study before the researcher began collecting data. Once permissions were
granted for the study to begin, the researcher explained to participants the importance of
their participation, as well as offer an executive summary of the results, should it be
requested.
During interviews with administrators, permission was requested to use a digital
recorder, which allowed the researcher to fully focus on the responses of the interviewees
without the distraction of taking notes. This process also ensured accurate transcription of
the interviews.
Instrumentation
The primary instruments employed to collect quantitative data for this mixed
methods case study were composed of three surveys developed by the University of
Tennessee Libraries Diversity Committee. These surveys included the Diversity Climate
Survey, the Attitudes and Perspectives Survey, and the Interactions with Staff and Patrons
Survey (see Appendices E, F, and G). The purpose of the instruments was to
quantitatively assess attitudes concerning diversity issues at the three selected

51
Southeastern university libraries. The survey consisted of a series of questions on a fourpoint Likert scale that did not have a neutral choice, but did have a not applicable choice.
Question responses consisted of the following range:
Strongly Disagree

Disagree

Agree

Strongly Agree Not Applicable

A qualitative protocol, titled Diversity Climate Interview Protocol (see Appendix
H), was also administered to deans and department heads and allowed for a deeper
probing of participant attitudes concerning diversity. These questions enabled participants
to provide richer responses regarding attitudes about diversity at the selected institutions.
Interview questions began with general questions about diversity and the overall library
profession and then were followed by more specific questions about the library in which
the individual worked. Questions at the end of the interview protocol sought to examine
improvements or changes related to diversity the interviewee would like to see take place
at his or her library. The interview protocol for the qualitative portion of the study that
was given to administrators at the libraries studied may be found in Table 3 on the
following page.
It was anticipated that a variety of themes would arise from questions in the
qualitative portion of the study. In particular, the researcher anticipated that the library
deans would generally favor diversity. However, each institution would possibly embrace
diversity in different manners dependent upon their faculty and student composition. For
instance, it was expected that the HBUL in this study would have significant holdings
and programming concerning slavery, integration and relationships between Whites and
Blacks in the South. The LURL library, by nature of its funding, faculty and student
composition was expected to have a wider array of diversity demonstrated. The RUL was

52
expected to fall into a middle category, in which diversity is promoted, but student body
and faculty composition would drive their activities.

Establishing Reliability, Validity, and Confirmability/Trustworthiness
Quantitative Data
The Diversity Climate Survey, the Attitudes and Perspectives Survey, and the
Interactions with Staff and Patrons Survey were tested for reliability through the testretest method. Selected members of the faculty and staff at an RUL in a southeastern state
in the United States were asked to participate in the survey on two occasions, with a twoweek interval in between. Expert validity was determined through the cooperation of the
deans of the three selected libraries, who reviewed the questions and provided their
expertise to revise them as necessary. A Pearson Product Moment Correlation was
performed to determine test-retest correlation and (stability). To show reliability and
internal consistency, Cronbach’s Alpha was run, which indicated reliability at the .945
level.
Qualitative Data
The interview portion of the study began with an introduction of the researcher, a
description and rationale for the study being conducted, its significance, and
confidentiality issues. Interview questions ranged from philosophical to practical, and
culminated with questions regarding the direction the individual would like to see their
institution take in the future regarding diversity. Questions were open-ended, as
recommended by Creswell (2008). Field notes were taken by the researcher in order to
assure that interviewees answers were properly interpreted. Field notes, according to
Glesne and Peshkin (1991), along with audio recordings, are the primary recording tools
for the qualitative researcher. Not only do they serve to aid the researcher’s memory, they
can also become a place for the researcher to record ideas, observations, reflections, and

54
make notes of emerging patterns (p. 45). In so doing, interviewees were able to voice
their experiences unconstrained by any perspectives of the researcher or past research (p.
225). Responses from qualitative interviews were categorized and aggregated in order to
triangulate themes and patterns relating to diversity at the three institutions studied. In so
doing, it was possible to better grasp the level of diversity at the institutions being studied
relating to collections, programming, and perspectives of individuals working at each. To
improve the accuracy of the data, audio-recording of interviews, external auditing, and
peer review were utilized in this study, as recommended by Creswell (2007, pp. 207209). A case study database was developed, as recommended by Yin (1989, p. 41).
Internal validity was fostered by pattern-matching. In cases where predicted
patterns coincide, the internal validity of a study is strengthened (Yin, p. 41). It was
expected that patterns such as commitment to diversity would exist at each institution.
Data Analysis Schema
The primary goal of this study was to determine the extent to which diversity was
being embraced at three academic libraries in the Southeast. Descriptive statistics were
used, both from the surveys and the collection and programming analyses, to analyze the
quantitative data that was accumulated in this study. The data generated in this study
reflected the attitudes and perspectives of the administration, faculty, and staff of the
libraries studied. Data must first be prepared for analysis. Raw data from library catalogs,
as well as data concerning programming, was entered into SPSS in order to generate
descriptive statistics so that each university library’s information can be easily examined.
Survey results were compiled and results were aggregated in order to assess general
attitudes concerning diversity. For the qualitative data, it was necessary to transcribe the

55
recorded interviews into files. The data was then presented through descriptive themes
and diagrams.
The answer to Research Question Number One, “To what extent is diversity
considered a valued attribute of three academic libraries in the Southeast in terms of race,
religion, gender, nationality, and sexual orientation ?”, was determined by analyzing and
reporting data collected in the Diversity Climate Survey, the Attitudes and Perspectives
Survey, and the Interactions with Staff and Patrons Survey (See Appendices E-G) . Raw
numbers as well as percentages that reflected responses in a proportionate manner were
reported. In so doing, a rich picture of diversity and attitudes concerning diversity at all
three libraries studied emerged, thereby providing the researcher insight into the climate
of the libraries being studied. Transcripts and field notes will also be used to also assess
the attitudes of those interviewed for the study as well regarding diversity.
Research Question Number Two, was “What strategies are employed in these
three academic libraries to foster diversity in terms of race, religion, gender, nationality,
and sexual orientation?” The researcher developed a response to this question through
interviews with administration of the selected libraries. Transcripts of field notes and
interviews were categorized and aggregated to establish themes and patterns. Responses
by the different groups were then compared to determine the culture of the library, as
opposed to the climate of the library, which was assessed quantitatively with the results
of the first research question. As a result, an in-depth picture of diversity at each library
emerged.
Research Question Number Three was, “What are the effects of diversity
initiatives at three academic libraries in the Southeast in terms of race, religion, gender,

56
nationality, and sexual orientation ?” This question was assessed through analyzing the
results of the Diversity Climate Survey, the Attitudes and Perspectives Survey, and the
Interactions with Staff and Patrons Survey using descriptive statistics. Transcripts and
field notes were used to determine the effects of diversity initiatives at the selected
academic libraries.
Research Question Number Four was, “To what extent are the faculty and staff,
collections, and programming at three academic libraries in the Southeast diverse in
terms of race, religion, gender, nationality, and sexual orientation?” In order to determine
diversity in terms of collections and programming, a raw count system was used. By
entering terms such as “Asian Studies” or “Native American Studies” into the catalog, a
raw number of items reflecting that subject was generated. That number was then
compared with the overall collection to determine the percentage of such materials
(books or audio-visual) that existed within the context of the overall collection. The same
procedure was used to compare diversity programming with overall programming.
Demographics of personnel will be obtained from the offices of the deans of the
respective libraries.
Personal Biography of Researcher
The researcher is a White male enrolled in a doctoral program of Educational
Leadership, Policy, and Law at Alabama State University, an historically Black
university. He is a former secondary level history teacher and is currently director of
library services at Troy University’s Dothan campus. He holds a bachelor’s degree in
history from Auburn University, as well as graduate degrees in social studies education
from Augusta State University, educational leadership from Albany State University, and

57
library and information science from the University of Alabama. Shaffer has published
two articles relating to diversity in library science in the Emerald journal Collection
Building and the Routledge journal, Behavioral and Social Sciences Librarian. He has
presented nationally on the subject at the American Library Association’s Annual
Convention and the Association of College and Research Libraries Biannual Convention.
The researcher’s interest in diversity stems from a variety of life experiences that
include teaching English as a second language in the eastern European nation Slovakia
and also teaching in two public schools in Georgia with high poverty rates that also
enrolled large numbers of minority students. In particular, experiences in Slovakia
enabled the researcher to develop a sense of empathy toward people who feel separated
from the overall culture of a place. After becoming an academic librarian, Shaffer
frequently studied diversity topics because of experiences in his professional background,
and because he found the topic to also be as relevant to his new profession as it was to his
former one. Particularly he was interested in diversity through a broader lens than many
in his personal and professional life considered the phenomenon. Instead of viewing it as
an issue based simply on race, he became interested in diversity on a broader level, based
on nationality, political perspective, religion, and ethnicity.

CHAPTER 4
FINDINGS
The over-arching research question of this study was to what extent does a diverse
environment exist at three academic libraries in the Southeast. Diversity was measured
based on observations (including staffing and programming), instruments (three surveys
developed by the University of Tennessee Libraries Diversity Committee), interviews
with deans and department heads, and catalog count. Three types of academic libraries
were examined, which included a Large University Research Library (RUL), a Regional
University Library (RUL), and a Historically Black University Library (HBUL). The
study employed a mixed-methods research design in order to determine the extent to
which a diverse environment existed at those institutions. Four sub-questions emerged
from the over-arching research question.
Research Questions
1. To what extent is diversity considered a valued attribute of three academic
libraries in the Southeast in terms of race, religion, gender, nationality, and sexual
orientation?
2. What strategies are employed at three academic libraries in the Southeast to foster
diversity in terms of race, religion, gender, nationality, and sexual orientation?

59
3. What are the perceived effects of diversity initiatives at three academic libraries in
the Southeast in terms of race, religion, gender, nationality, and sexual
orientation?
4. To what extent are the faculty and staff, collections, and programming at three
academic libraries in the Southeast diverse in terms of race, religion, gender,
nationality, and sexual orientation?
Analysis of Quantitative Data
Quantitative data gathered came in the form of a keyword catalog search of
specific diversity-themed terms. Full-time librarians and library staff also responded to a
series of survey questions. Their answers were then arranged into themes in order to
develop a better understanding of the respondents’ true attitudes concerning diversity.
Response rates were above 70% for the HBUL (73.7%) and RUL institutions
(77.8%). The LURL had a a response rate of 42.9%. However, there was a much larger
raw number of respondents (45) than at either the HBUL (14) or RUL (14). Surveys were
distributed to all full-time faculty and staff, meaning that there is mixed pool of faculty
librarians and staff. This method allows for the overall attitude toward diversity to be
assessed at the libraries studied; however, it is possible that there could be a difference in
responses among librarians versus library staff. Out of concerns for privacy, because of
small numbers of employees at two of the three participating institutions, it was decided
to ask all full-time employees to respond to one survey.
The survey had a total of 42 questions. Respondents answered using a four-point
Likert scale that had no neutral option. There was a Not Applicable option that was rarely
used by respondents. In general, HBUL library workers provided the most negative

60
average responses to survey questions. RUL and LURL library workers consistently
scored higher than their HBUL counterparts on all sections of the survey, which would
indicate a lack of diversity in the workplace as well as a lack of openness to diversity in
some cases.
Survey Results
Full-time faculty and staff at three university libraries in the Southeast were asked
to take a survey consisting of 42 questions. The survey contained three separate parts that
examined the climate of the libraries regarding diversity, attitudes and perceptions
regarding diversity, and interactions with staff and patrons. The Diversity Climate Survey
can be found in Table 4 below:

Figure 3: This figure compares librarian interactions with staff and patrons.
To better understand the results of the surveys, questions and responses were
divided into ten themes. Only survey questions of particular interest to the researcher
were included in this section.

72
Theme One: Attitudes Concerning the General Climate of the Library: Questions 1
and 2
In response to questions concerning whether the library helped its employees
reach their full potential and whether hiring and promotional policies were fair, the RUL
received the highest marks (3.00 and 3.29). The LURL scored slightly lower (2.89 and
2.93). The HBUL though, was markedly lower than the other two institutions (2.77 and
2.43). Table 7 illustrates the results of this theme below:

Theme Two: Attitudes toward People with Different Ethnic Backgrounds:
Questions 3, 5, 15, 17, 19, 21, 35, and 36
Respondents revealed somewhat inconsistent answers regarding their attitudes
concerning people from different ethnic backgrounds than their own. Scores indicated
that respondents felt quite comfortable working with people from backgrounds different
than their own (Question 15). They also indicated that they did not believe their library
could be considered diverse at the moment (Question 21). However, those two factors did
not seem to lead to a general attitude that the library should be doing more to attract
under-represented applicants (Question 3). The RUL librarians scored lower than their
counterparts regarding whether library departments should include a staff from a variety
of ethnic backgrounds (Question 5).

73
All respondents were comfortable with the concept that their libraries should
admit all people (Question 35). They also indicated they felt comfortable working with
people from all ethnic backgrounds. It is curious, though, that if such attitudes are
prevalent that responses to Question Three are relatively low. Table 8 illustrates the
results of this theme below.

Theme Three: Attitudes Regarding Gender Issues: Questions 6 and 13
Respondents at the LURL and RUL seemed to indicate general contentment
regarding gender diversity at the library. However, the HBUL Librarians scored lower
than the other two libraries when asked about promotions for women (Question 6) and
gender discrimination in general (Question 13). Table 9 illustrates the results of this
theme on the following page:

Attitudes about being able to express religious views (Question 18), receive time
off for religious holidays (Question 10), religious discrimination (Question 12), and
perceptions by management as a result of religious expression were all higher at the
LURL and RUL libraries than at the HBUL. HBUL scores were much lower for each of
these questions than when compared to their counterparts. Question 10, which asked
about the ease of taking time off for religious holidays, was particularly low among
HBUL workers (2.18). Table 10 illustrates the results of this theme below:

Theme Five: Attitudes toward Older Employees: Questions 11, 37, and 41
Respondents had similar attitudes regarding the amount of funds expended
meeting ADA requirements (Question 41). The RUL seemed to be the most tolerant of
ageism issues. In answer to whether older candidates faced job discrimination (Question
11) and whether older staff were respected by other personnel, the HBUL scored
considerably lower than the other two institutions. Table 11 illustrates the results of this
theme below:

Theme Six: Attitudes toward Employee Relations at the Library: Questions 16 and
38
Questions relating to theme six examined general employee relations. All three
institutions scored one point, or more, higher on Question 38, which asked if respondents
had good working relationships with their co-workers, than Question 16. Question 16
asked if library employees were working up to their full potential. Effectively, employees
indicated they got along well, but questioned each other’s work ethics. Table 12
illustrates the results of this Theme Six:

Theme Seven: Attitudes toward Homosexuality: Questions 22 and 27
Attitudes toward homosexuality may not be properly reflected through the
responses given, particularly in the case of Question 27. Respondents at all three libraries
indicated they were comfortable working with people of other lifestyles. However, in
regard to the Question 27, which asked if it was comfortable for an employee who
identified as gay, lesbian, or bisexual to talk about their partners at work, scores were
markedly lower. It is possible that library workers at all three institutions were
comfortable with other lifestyles in the abstract, but not in a question that was more
reality focused. It is also possible though, that they considered the follow-up question to
be sexual in nature, which was not as the researcher intended. Table 13 illustrates the
results of this theme:

scores reflected an attitude of being at ease assisting individuals from these categories. As
noted previously, responses concerning funds spent on ADA compliance were reasonably
positive. Table 15 illustrates the results of this theme below:

Responses to Theme Ten illustrate the complexities faced when examining
diversity. Responses to Question 29 indicated all respondents feel positively about talking
about each other’s diverse backgrounds. Respondents also indicated that they were quite
comfortable with individuals with limited English abilities using the library. Scores were
lower though, when respondents answered questions about posting signs in foreign
languages (Question 33) and colleagues speaking in languages other than English
(Question 28). Table 16 illustrates the results of this theme below:

Keyword searches for terms relating to diversity issues were performed at all
three libraries studied. To provide context for the collection, the LURL had a total
circulating monograph collection of 2, 175,700 (Hogan, 2012, p. 38). Table 17 on the
following page, illustrates the results of keyword searches performed through the online
catalog at the LURL, RUL, and HBUL studied.

The RUL had a total circulating collection of 571,152 (Hogan, 2012, p. 37). The
RUL catalog search revealed high returns for most keyword searches. Adding the word
“race” to words relating to ethnicity produced larger returns. The converse proved true at
the other two institutions studied. Areas of the collection that possibly needed
improvement were topics on atheism and Hinduism, for which there were 185 and 459

80
entries respectively. This compares with 6,277 for Christianity, 3,044 for Judiasm, 1,447
for Muslim, and 1,758 for Buddhism.
In terms of sexuality, the terms Gay and Lesbian returned 2,677 and 976 entries
respectively. A search for the term “transgendered” revealed only 37 entries. The topic of
collections and services for the transgendered was referenced by three of the six
interviewees, which could be an indication that these numbers may increase in the future.
Searches for political terms revealed interesting results. The term “Liberal”
returned nearly double (1919) the number of entries than “Conservative” (937). However,
the term Republican returned nearly ten times (1,277) the number of entries as did
“Democrat” (140). The term “Libertarian” resulted in 92 catalog entries.
The RUL catalog revealed positive returns to keyword searches regarding race.
The term “Asian” had a high rate of return (2,296), which may relate to the large
international population at this university.
Terms relating to religion all revealed large numbers of holdings at the RUL. The
term “Christianity” returned 2,267 entries. Other religious entries that revealed large
holdings included “Judiaism” (835), “Muslim” (506), and “Buddhism” (407).
In terms of sexuality, results were similar to the LURL. Although, there were
several results for the terms “Gay” (1,237) and “Lesbian” (436), results for
“Transgendered” were low (17).
Searches for political terms reflected the results discovered at the LURL. There
were more results for “Liberal” (1,019) than “Conservative” (478), but fewer results for
“Democrat” (75) than “Republican” (592). The term “Libertarian” revealed 68 entries.

81
The HBUL had a much smaller circulating collection—254,000—than the other
two libraries, which may cause some results to appear out of proportion than they
actually are. However, in some cases, the number of entries does seem low. For instance,
the terms “Caucasian,” “Caucasian Race,” and “White Race” combined result in only 81
entries. The term “African American” reveals 3,300 catalog entries.
In terms of religion, the HBUL had large holdings of books relating to
Christianity (1,626). Other religious terms that revealed catalog holdings were “Judaism”
(719), “Muslim,” (108), “Buddhism,” (329), and “Hinduism” (110). The search for
“Atheism” returned 35 entries.
Holdings relating to sexuality were low at the HBUL. There were no holdings
resulting in searches for the terms “Homosexual” and “Transgendered.” The search terms
“Gay” and “Lesbian” resulted in 233 and 63 entries respectively.
In terms of politics, the HBUL had no holdings relating to searches for the terms
“Libertarian” or “Democrat.” Other results of the catalog search included “Liberal” (18),
“Conservative” (33), and “Republican” (89).
Analysis of Qualitative Data
Two librarians from each selected institution participated in this study. One of
these individuals from each institution was the library dean or director. That individual
then recommended a librarian to the researcher to be interviewed. Librarians interviewed
included a human resources librarian (LURL), a technical services librarian (RUL), and a
reference librarian with significant responsibilities within an archive (HBUL). The
protocol questions and the interviewees’ responses are recorded below.

82

Theme One: Answers were often more Staff Focused, rather than Idea Focused
Frequently, respondents examined diversity based on staff make-up, particularly
in that they were hopeful of developing a truly diverse faculty and staff for their library.
Although, this is certainly a noble and laudable goal, it is not achievable. As respondents
frequently noted, themselves, because the field of librarianship is composed
overwhelmingly of White women, there is no pool from which to choose a diverse library
faculty. In response to the question, “What types of improvements related to diversity
would you like to see at your library?” answers especially were focused on staffing rather
than collections or programming.
The researcher was particularly interested in the concept of diversity in the
broadest concept of the term, with a belief that an individual with an open mind can
foster learning related to any and all ideas. The hope was that such diversity initiatives
would be represented through programming at academic libraries studied. However,
programming at the universities studied was generally limited. The LURL library
reported some programming, much of it though being sponsored by other departments,
with the library being used as a meeting space. The HBUL had recently begun applying
for grant-related funding for public programming, with success in several areas noted
later. The RUL hosted several programs that could be considered diverse over the
previous four years. They were being driven, though, by a librarian on an extension
campus. The on-site librarians could actually report little effort being exerted to promote
a diverse atmosphere on campus.
The LURL Librarian said, I would like to see, I guess it will fall on my shoulders, a
more diverse faculty. I think that is important to students to see a reflection of their
population in the libraries. They do see it, but they see more staff than faculty. That may

83
not matter to them as long as they get their question answered. I think overall we do a
good job of presenting and exhibiting diverse materials and topics.
The RUL Dean said, One thing I would most like to see is at least one African American
librarian. That is the one thing I have worked on since coming here, but have never been
successful. I don’t believe we have ever actually even gotten to interview an African
American librarian. With our last vacancy, we had an excellent Black applicant, and just
before she was to interview with us, she contacted me and let me know she had found a
position elsewhere. She was the only one of the applicants who was a minority.
The RUL Librarian said, I go back to racial diversity. There are a bunch of middle aged
White folks in this library. I would like to see us have more people of color on our staff. I
think that would be good for our students.
The HBUL Dean said, We want to continue to build on what we have done. We currently
have one international person, and I would like to see more. When you have a diverse
staff, they feed off of one another, and that will only make your library that much
stronger, because they bring their perspectives to whatever programs you have going on
or what services you want to offer.
The HBUL Librarian’s response began as staff centered. It ultimately reflected a
desire for there to be a more general openness to a wider variety of perspectives than this
individual felt were currently being exhibited by faculty and staff at that university. The
HBUL Librarian, it should be noted, was also responsible for programming related grants
that had occurred on that campus, in the forms of two grants that had been recently
offered by the National Endowment for the Humanities concerning Civil Rights and
Islamic topics.
The HBUL Librarian said, “I would like to see more diversity on our staff, and I would
like to see more openness among our current staff to a wider variety of ideas, lifestyles,
and values.”
Theme Two: Increasing U.S. Diversity was Frequently Referenced as a Reason to
Promote a Diverse Library
As noted in Chapter Two, the United States is experiencing a demographic
transformation. Consequently, many of the respondents had concerns that, in terms of
staffing decisions as well as actions, their libraries should attempt to reflect these

84
demographic changes. Specifically, there was a desire for an increased number of
librarians who were from a variety of ethnic backgrounds.
The LURL and RUL both had large international student bodies, with more than
10% of the RUL’s campus coming from a country other than the United States. The
HBUL was beginning to recruit a larger international student body. The RUL Dean’s
comments reflected much of the international literature, particularly that of Northern
Europe, which reflected the role of libraries relating to foreign-born patrons. Not only is
the library a potential source of safe harbor for people of all backgrounds, it can be a
place where individuals learn about the new society in which they live, utilize technology
to communicate with loved ones in their home country, learn and perfect the language of
their new home, and share their culture with other patrons.
The RUL Dean said, I think you have to have the ability to serve a diverse population,
because in the U.S. we are getting a more diverse population all the time, and you need
to be able to respond to them with good service regardless of their background. Libraries
have always been, at least in my estimation, have always been places of refuge for those
who are in a minority status, because libraries have always tried to treat people equally
when they come in.
The LURL Librarian noted in other parts of the interview that a diverse staff was
not essential for a diverse attitude at the library. However, it was clear that he saw the
benefits of having such diversity on his staff when possible.
The LURL Librarian said, I think that the more diverse your staff is, the more tolerant
they are of the students, especially working here at a larger institution, I find that our
staff is more interested in how they can better serve the international community,
especially when there is a language barrier. So, I feel a diverse staff can foster a feeling
of concern more than might otherwise be there.

85
Theme Three: There was a Strong Desire to Hire Candidates that Represent
Diversity, but Few Exist. The Challenge to Recruit such Individuals is more
Pronounced in Rural Areas
There were a variety of explanations for reasons few minorities appeared to be
entering the field of library science. Librarian salaries were one of the topics addressed. A
further concern was that diversity candidates in the field tended to remain in urban areas
where they had more opportunities to interact with people who were of similar
backgrounds, and therefore not feel isolated. Rural areas, particularly in the South, may
find it difficult to recruit minority librarians, not only because of perceptions concerning
the region, but because large parts of the region are rural. It was assumed that such
candidates, particularly those who are young, would prefer to be in a more urban
environment in order to engage in more diverse cultural activities, and opportunities to
interact with individuals from similar backgrounds and lifestyles. All subjects indicated a
desire to hire diversity candidates when they were available.
The RUL Dean said, As far as diversity within the library, I would promote it; I would
push for diversity in terms of employees if we got applicants who were qualified.
Unfortunately, we don’t really get any applicants from minorities. I’m not sure what else
we can do, short of offering extra incentives, such as a bonus. Plus, we can’t do it
because I don’t get the applicants anyway. I can’t offer a bonus to someone who doesn’t
apply. And I’m really disappointed I haven’t been able to do that here. The same thing
was true of my previous position, and I was there 12 years. We had real trouble getting
minority applicants. In my job before that, we got a few, but I was in a library at that
point that was in a population area exceeding a million people, so there were more
minorities there, so there was a deeper pool. Still, I don’t think we ever hired a minority
librarian there; I think we had some applications, but we never found someone who fit
the position we were advertising. Now there was an HBUL school near there, and they
had a fairly full staff of African Americans. But we couldn’t get the applicants. I don’t
know if it was because the HBUL was there, but I also wasn’t the one doing the hiring or
advertising, but it has been a disappointment to me in my career that I have not been able
to get African American employees into professional positions. I know that when I was
teaching, we were able to get an African American faculty member, so that helped, and
we got some African American students, but, again, I don’t think we had a number that
was representative of the number of African Americans in the state. We had some come
through, and they got good jobs, but never a number that was representative.

86

The RUL Dean later said, If we could find good minority applicants we would try to
have a more diverse staff. Our problem here—and I don’t understand it sometimes—is
that we just do not get applications from those of other ethnic or racial backgrounds, or
at least we get them rarely. We have certainly had classified employees who had minority
backgrounds, and I don’t think anyone has ever felt out of place or been offended; at
least, nothing has been reported to me. In the past, before I started working here 16 or 17
years ago, there were a couple of minority employees who were not treated very well,
and they left, but that has not been my experience here. I do wish we could get at least
one public services librarian who is African American, because 25% of our students are
minority, and we don’t have any role models for them here. That’s an issue really across
the university. We have some African American professors, but it isn’t anywhere near
25%. I think that is also true of the classified employees. I don’t really understand that,
but I can say in the openings we have had for librarians, we rarely get a minority
applicant, and I try to reach out to places where I think I can get a candidate. We just
don’t get responses. I talked to one dean who is a good friend of mine who is at one of the
library schools that turns out a large number of minorities and basically I told him we
are not getting any applications from your place. He said “Yes, I know, but they don’t
want to move more than 15 or 20 miles away from home.” Therefore, they won’t come
this far away. And I also know that there are HBULs that have trouble getting minority
applicants. You would think that would not be the case, but I have talked to an HBUL
dean, and they do have trouble. I think it is probably a universal problem, at least as the
library level is concerned. I don’t think it should be such a problem at the clerical level,
but we don’t get the applicants. This campus is also hurt by its rural location, which
offers little socially and makes it harder to recruit younger people in general.
The LURL Dean indicated that, at the moment, he did not believe libraries could
make a valid effort to diversify their staffs, because the applicant pool simply did not
exist. Because librarians who are not White and female make up such a small pool of the
workforce, and library schools are not generating a more diverse pool of applicants
either, it is currently impossible for a library to diversify its staff so that it is adequately
reflective of the demographics of most regions of the nation. If the goal is achievable, as
noted by the RUL Dean previously, it is achievable in more urban and densely populated
areas.
The LURL Dean said, This is my personal opinion. I am not referring to the library
school at this university. The Association of Research Libraries, the American Library
Association, regional and state professional groups for 20 years have talked about
getting more diversity in the workforce, and what are we doing wrong not to recruit or

87
retain such individuals in the field. And I made myself quite unpopular in a discussion a
few years ago when I said we should stop beating ourselves up over this, because the
professional schools are not giving us the appropriate number of minority groups that
would let us diversify the workplace. Some of the problem is also in the recruiting efforts
of professional schools across the country. I think we are all fighting over too few of
these individuals and therefore it is difficult for any library to have an ethnically or
racially diverse workforce that is anything near the proportion that any minority group
represents in society.
The LURL Librarian noted some previous concerns that others speculated upon.
Among them was the lack of diversity in the existing workforce pool, as well as the lack
of a supply of diversity candidates coming from the “pipeline,” ergo the library schools.
The LURL Librarian said, It’s kind of a confusing thing because the people who you
come across in the profession are very much advocates for diversity, but you just don’t
see as much as you would like to see. I don’t know why. As you say, the majority of
people in the profession are White females. They’ve all been very open. I don’t know
whether the lack of diversity stems from the pipeline—the schools—and who applies to go
to library school and then comes out and looks for a job.
The HBUL Librarian raised an issue that was previously untouched, implicitly
suggesting that minority candidates might be self-segregating themselves through their
job searches. This view was reflective of the literature from South Africa. The HBUL
Librarian went on to suggest that an apprenticeship program of some sort might be set up
in place of graduate programs in library science that could foster diversity candidates and
eliminate the need for the degree. Although that goal might be achieved through such a
program, it would also create a permanent two-tiered solution within the field of libraries,
because of the value placed on the MLIS degree within the overall field.
The HBUL Librarian said, I don’t think it really can ever truly be diverse. I think the
only way it could be diverse and become more heterogeneous would be if opportunities
outside of library school opened up. Using my experience, I completed my degree in the
fall of 2010. I was pursuing jobs, and I tried to stay in the state where I acquired my
degree, but the requirements for applying for jobs were ridiculous out of the gate—3 to 5
years. For archives, you had to work for 3 to 5 years with your degree in a job before you
could ever apply. And I understand if you want a more seasoned professional, but for
those of us just starting out, do something, start an apprenticeship program. And where I

88
was, think the Confederacy except in a nicer way. It is no different than down here. It is a
hire and fire state. My opportunities there were limited. The people who looked like me
were applying for the same jobs. So the market was already flooded. One University had
a Black Cultural Center, and they weren’t looking for any experience in particular. So, I
applied for the position, and I did get the phone interview, but after the fact I found out
that they changed their requirements during the process. I’m not saying they didn’t find a
qualified candidate; I’m sure they did, but it was flooded with applicants—at least 20
people.
The HBUL Dean said, I think you also have to look at the fact that many people like
their job, but not their environment. When you look at how to recruit a diverse faculty,
you have to look at the environment you are in and what you can offer a diverse
applicant. While working in another state in the South, I hired a young lady from Sri
Lanka. Very good worker; I had to do some education with my staff because they wanted
to call the scarf she wore a scarf, and I had to do some sensitivity training and explain
her attire. Because there were not enough activities, particularly for her children, I lost
her to a city. So, I realized we have to acknowledge the places our universities are. Can
you bring in someone from a foreign country and expect to keep them?
Theme Four: Librarians Divided along Racial Lines about Whether their Library
Actively Promoted Diversity and if that should be a Mission of the Library
The researcher had anticipated that librarians interviewed would actively be
engaging in processes that would lead to increased diversity at their libraries. The
opposite was true. It should be noted, though, that librarians interviewed frequently
indicated that inherent in their job was an inclination toward developing diverse
collections. In some cases, the responsibility for promoting diversity was passed along to
faculty members from various colleges who were responsible for selecting titles for the
library. References were made to the belief that diversity is fostered by librarians
upholding the values of the profession.
For this portion of the study, there were an equal number of White and Black
librarians interviewed. In the only clear division along racial lines in the study, the White
librarians viewed “active promotion of diversity” as not something they were trying to
achieve. They did all make statements to the effect that through their daily actions they

89
were promoting diversity by working well together and with all facets of the university
community. Black librarians who were interviewed were emphatic that they believed
promoting diversity should be a major part of the library’s role within the university
community.
The LURL Dean said, I don’t believe it is done consciously. I believe that if we are
promoting a diverse atmosphere, it is in how we work together and how we are
comfortable with each other, whether it is in a part of the library no one sees or in a
public area. Having a head of HR who is African American sends a message that we are
fair and objective in how we treat each other. We don’t talk about it. I think people
assume that is what the workplace is going to be. Does that mean the public is more
comfortable? I don’t know. If by do we play a role, do we have an obligation? I don’t
think our obligation is any different than any other unit of the university. If people see
nothing but blonde haired, blue eyed people everywhere, they turn and the only thing
people see as library employees are blond haired and blue eyed, that probably seems like
something is going on. They only hire their buddies or family. That’s what it sends to me.
If I go into an office or store and I don’t see a cross section of the population there, I
think something is odd. You mentioned being in Chicago. Go in the Burberry store on
Michigan Avenue. They have been told they had to be nicer. For years they were the
rudest, coldest salespeople. For years I wouldn’t go in because they had the attitude of
are you worthy to be in our store? That place was weird because I felt they only wanted
to hire a certain type of person because it was as though they only wanted customers of
that same ilk in the store. Then, a couple of years ago I was talking to a salesperson
there, and I told her that I found her to be the most approachable, friendly, responsive
salesperson that I had ever dealt with in that store, and she lowered her voice and leaned
over the cash register and said that management insists that we have a new image. So,
going back to my point, if I am in a store that doesn’t have a diverse workforce, I wonder
what is going on and what decisions management has made.
The LURL Librarian did not necessarily contradict her dean, but she did have a
different perspective of how she viewed library activities and how those activities
promoted a diverse atmosphere. Her assessment of various programs that librarians were
engaged in, from displays celebrating various cultures to a safe harbor program for the
disadvantaged and abused, caused her to believe the librarians were active players in
terms of the promotion of diversity issues.

90
The LURL Librarian said, I know that here, a lot of our staff consider themselves
advocates of diversity. There are several different programs in terms of safe harboring,
based more on gender organizations on campus. A lot of our staff has gone through the
training to be a safe harbor for anyone who thinks they may be disadvantaged or abused
in any way. I think in our libraries, we participate when the different months of the year
come around like African American, Latino, and Women’s History month. We always
have exhibits that enhance and reinforce those topics during those months. We have
exhibits that highlight different ethnicity. We had one on the Vietnam War that was
controversial, because some opponents were not happy with materials being displayed. I
think that libraries not only with their collections have the opportunity as a place to host
exhibits that can open people’s minds and present different viewpoints on various issues.
Both RUL Librarians promoted the concept of a library as being a safe neutral
ground. The RUL Dean did stress that particularly in K-12 libraries, there is sometimes a
push toward homogeneity of collections, which he viewed as contrary to the manner in
which a library should be run. He also emphasized the importance of diversity of
collections and rejected any form of censorship.
The RUL Dean said, I don’t know that we play a great role in that. I think we play a role
in that we are a safe place for anyone to come to. Libraries are generally regarded as
being safe locations where everyone is treated the same. I think that is a very positive
thing of treating everyone equally. Libraries have always felt they needed to provide a
range of ideas and opinions, going from the most conservative to the most liberal,
regardless of what that range might be, for instance in economics or art, such as the
provision of nudity in art books. Libraries have always tried to provide that range of
materials so that people will have equal access to the types of things they might need.
That has always been a positive thing to me. People should be able to encounter other
ideas and materials in the library shouldn’t be censored. That’s my feeling, and I think
that libraries generally work that way. In elementary schools, and sometimes even in
high schools, there is a tendency on the part of schools to provide more homogenous
atmospheres, which is not necessarily good. Sometimes schools don’t pay enough
attention to parents who may want their child to have a wide range of reading material. I
think it is the parent’s responsibility to watch what children read.
The RUL Librarian said, I don’t think we really do. We are who we are. When we treat
everyone that treats through our doors the exact same and give people the exact same
help, hopefully for better not worse, as we would anyone else. No judgments should be
made based on appearance.
The HBUL Dean strongly believed in librarians promoting diversity within the
university environment. Her response then shifted more toward personnel and

91
encouraged the development and use of diversity offices, if not within the library, then at
the university in general.
The HBUL Dean said, It has to. And that is why I was mentioned diversity offices. Even
at a larger university, they need diversity offices, even in the library, in order to
understand not just your students but also your workers. Even here, you have to look at—
we’re in the South and we’re in the Bible belt—but there are a variety of religions in the
South. I worked in a community where another religious group—not, Baptist, Catholic,
or Jewish, but something else was prevalent, and the library employees from that religion
you had to be sure their beliefs were being respected. For instance, in this area of the
state the Seventh Day Adventists are a growing religion. Those that are practicing, you
have to take into consideration the religious practices for that group. So, I think that our
institutions have to be sensitive to its employees, staff, and to have somebody who offers
training, whether it is from your office of diversity or the human resources department. I
think it is a good thing. I like interacting with other people. That is what we do as
librarians.
The HBUL Librarian agreed that promoting diversity should be a goal of
librarians. However, she was critical of her own library in terms of achieving this goal,
and viewed librarians within the library as being intolerant of other cultures and
individuals with different viewpoints than their own.
The HBUL Librarian said, Here I don’t think they play any role at all. I think because
we are a predominantly Black university, the tolerance level is low. When issues come
up, and I don’t want to call it reverse discrimination. Discrimination is discrimination.
People have said there are certain things you can’t say to White workers because then
they will run across the street and tell HR, and you will lose your job for just insinuating
it is because of difference, so I would say tolerance level is low on campus as far as the
treatment of others. We do have quite a few when it comes to homosexuals, who will say
things like “That faggot,” and I am like, whoa, back it up! Shut up. Don’t say anything
else, because right now you are setting yourself up, because I might take offense to that.
And simply by me taking offense to that, I’m not gay, I’m not bisexual, I’m none of the
above, but you don’t use that word. I just think whoa, you really want to get fired. So, I
don’t think we play a role. I think we are just a microcosm of the overall university.
Theme Five: Librarians View Diversity through Many Lenses
Although responses indicated in interviews that many of the respondents
anticipated the study would be focused on issues involving White and Black race

92
relations, everyone interviewed had a remarkably broad and inclusive definition of
diversity that included race, sex, religion, national origin, gender, and transgender.
The RUL Dean said, “I look at diversity as covering a wide variety of things. It’s not
just race, it is cultural and ethnic background. There are income barriers. All of those
things are part of diversity in my mind.”
The HBUL Dean said, “I define diversity as a relationship between ethnicity, race and
gender. I look at all of those components and how they interact with one another.”
The LURL dean viewed diversity through the two lenses of the federal
government and the university at which he works. Because of the dominance of females
within the profession, sexual balance was also an interest.
The LURL Dean said, I personally look at diversity in two different ways. There is the
federal government definition that the university is very cognizant of. In this part of the
U.S., diversity is more along racial lines. We are in a profession that is historically more
of a female profession, so I see diversity also in terms of a sexual balance. And, we’ve
never been asked the question about sexual preference or lifestyle diversity, but in the
broadest sense of the word I would say that diversity is having a workforce that
represents the various groups making up American society. In terms of reporting, it
comes down to how many racial or ethnic groups we have and how many of these groups
we have on the faculty and staff at the library.
The LURL Librarian and HBUL Librarian had similar definitions of diversity,
which were both broad in nature. These definitions included sex, ethnicity, race, religion,
and handicapped.
The LURL Librarian said, I define diversity as probably not what most people think of,
just automatically Black/White. It’s probably because of my HR background. I think it is
the opportunity to have different points of view from different people. Diversity within an
institution has a multitude of differences presence. Whether it is male, female, Black,
White, people of other ethnicities, religions, sexual orientations, the whole gamut when I
think diversity.
The HBUL Librarian said, “I define diversity as relating to or about any differences in
culture, creed, religion, ability, capability, gender, or sexual preference. Pretty overarching.”
When asked if they felt their definition of diversity was generally shared by others

93
in the profession, five replied affirmatively. However, the HBUL Librarian disagreed.
She argued that her experiences relating to diversity within librarianship had been
negative from the time she entered graduate school. It is possible that some of her
experiences were more the cause of students being jealous of a scholarship she was able
to receive based on her background, than a genuine rejection of the overall concept of
diversity by those individuals. The experiences though, had an obvious and traumatic
impact on this individual.
The HBUL Librarian said, No, I don’t believe this definition of diversity is shared
among other professionals. I will relate it to my Master’s Degree. I will go back to that
because it was a Master’s in Library Science. I was a fellow at a Midwestern university. I
was part of the second cohort of that state’s library diversity grant, which was funded by
the Laura Bush Foundation’s initiative to diversify libraries. There were 39 of us. I
thought that it wouldn’t be such a big deal to become a librarian in that setting, because
that state—or the school, rather—is one of the top ten for librarians. I was sorely
mistaken. My first class was a reference class and it was not just me, but other members
of my cohort who were in this class. One of my cohort members was a VietnameseAmerican. Another was Indian-American, born in India. The rest of us were Black. I
would have thought we would have been part of the group as far as our classmates, but
instead there was a stark difference, as though there was a line drawn in the sand,
practically like they knew we were part of the group of students that came in with this
double standard and were treated differently. I tried to have a conversation with some of
my classmates regarding coursework, and they would just give me a sideways glance,
and weren’t trying to be inclusive, even though I’m in the program and paying for the
program. But my education was also being supplemented by a stipend; I am still a
student in this class. I didn’t have library experience before I started library school, but
some of the people did. They gave most of us that sideways glance. You would try to feel
inclusive, or a sense of inclusiveness, but it wasn’t there. There were very few in library
school that really wanted to be your friend and be that person you can lean on because
you know this is one of the hardest things you will ever do—at least at that time of your
life. So that was the first time for me of not feeling like part of the group, or part of the
whole, and it was something we had been warned about by the first cohort. They told us
that regardless of what you think and feel, as far as this program goes, people are
watching. They couldn’t find anything in their background in going back as far as
diversity. One lady was Native American, and we had another lady who was Korean
American, so we had a few. But there were others who couldn’t prove themselves, and the
program was looking for people who could diversify libraries and if you look like all of
the other current librarians, then you aren’t really diversifying it.

94
Theme Six: A Diverse Staff can Make Patrons Feel the Librarians are more
Approachable and Serve Students Better
There was considerable discussion about whether librarians with diverse traits
created a more comfortable environment for patrons coming from similar backgrounds.
Respondents did divide along racial lines on this topic. Black librarians indicated they felt
students would be more likely to approach a reference librarian if he or she was from a
similar background. White librarians acknowledged that they understood such theories
existed, but ultimately felt that if good, efficient, and friendly service was offered, it
should not make a difference in the patron experience. The LURL Dean believed it might
be possible that youth was an important factor to consider in terms of librarians at the
desk being viewed as approachable.
The LURL Dean said, According to the word out of the profession and according to the
literature, students are more receptive to approaching someone who they can relate to.
At this point in my career, I agree, but thinking back to my career as a student, I didn’t
approach a librarian based on whether I could relate to them, but if I thought they could
help me. Early in my career, I had a librarian who dressed as a hippie and advised her
staff to do the same, because it would allow the students to relate to them better. I still
don’t quite believe that. I think that when a person goes to their dentist, doctor, or
attorney, they would be concerned if they were dressed as casually as that. Why should
the profession of library science be any different? But then again, maybe I am revealing
my age. Probably younger people think how people dress at work doesn’t matter, but at
the same time it is how we look…how we dress…how old we are…how we comb our
hair…what color our skin is…I’m not convinced that influences how students relate to
the library or if they are willing to seek assistance at the library. But maybe in today’s
society, young people want to deal with someone who looks more like them. I must say,
too, that an undergraduate might be more inspired to pay more attention in a library
training session, or in approaching someone at the information desk if they looked more
like them chronologically. And the emphasis there is on age.
The RUL Dean, who previously had noted the large percentage of international
students on his campus, pointed out that a more diverse faculty and staff would help
librarians cope with language barriers that sometimes exist at the RUL Library. The RUL
Library has made attempts to diversify its personnel without success, but the RUL Dean

95
did indicate that an increased number of English as a Second Language classes have
helped to alleviate the language divide.
The RUL Dean said, Service should be given at a high level regardless. Does it affect
service? If you have individuals working in a public service position that deal with the
public a lot and have problems with diversity, then service may be different, but it
shouldn’t be. There is sometimes a language barrier, for instance with international
students. Sometimes their English ability isn’t good enough to completely explain what
the need, so it is necessary to do some interpretation at the desk in order to ascertain
what it is they truly want to know. Does that affect service? It does in a sense, because
you want to provide good service, but if you can’t understand what someone is asking, it
is hard to give them what they want. This problem has been somewhat alleviated because
the University has added English as a Second Language classes, which has improved the
abilities of students who speak a first language other than English.
The RUL Librarian felt that a diverse staff would be beneficial at the reference
desk. Using her own personal experiences, she pointed out that frequently patrons would
approach a student worker at the desk, rather than the librarian, because the student
worker looked more like the patron in terms of race, gender, or age.
The RUL Librarian said, I think the more diverse staff you have the better able you are
to serve the students. If you have experiences I haven’t had, that makes you better able to
serve some patrons. The thing that I experience at the reference desk is that I don’t look
like them, but the student worker does, and they go to the student worker to ask their
questions, meaning I have to listen in to be sure the question is being correctly answered.
This is one way that the homogeneity of our staff hurts us.
The HBUL Dean and HBUL Librarian believed that a diverse staff actually led to
better service, because the patron needs were better understood in such instances. Both
the HBUL Dean and the HBUL Librarian approached this topic from the perspective of
customer service, with the Dean making comparisons to the hospitality industry.
The HBUL Dean said, I think you are able to offer more and be able to ascertain what
their needs are with a diverse staff. We have students coming from all over, so if you have
a staff—believe it or not—on a minority campus; that is what students say, that they
would like to see more people working in the library who look like them, I guess because
they think their needs may be answered better or I am understood more if I am speaking
to someone who looks like me. You see this in the hotel and food industries as well as all

96
other segments of our environment too. I think libraries need to have that diversity too.
Students want folks who look like them and talk like them in order to address their needs.
The HBUL Librarian said, I believe that students who see service reps such as us that
look like them, I think that helps them feel more comfortable. I think 75% of the time
students see a White librarian and they go to her and it is fine. But I think it depends on
the type of service they have historically received. How were they treated? Were you
treated like a human or like cattle and just pointed around. We have that with the
librarians here. There are 7 librarians now. Two are White and the rest are Black. But I
can say honestly that 3 of the 5 reference librarians don’t treat students the way they
should be treated, and they are Black, and that is not fair to the students. They are
helping to pay our services. So I wouldn’t say that diversity is always a factor, if we are
not treating them the way we would want to be treated.
Theme Seven: Librarians can promote diversity to some Extent Simply by having
Positive Interactions with All Patrons and being Knowledgeable in their Fields
The importance of friendly, smiling, attentive librarians was frequently addressed
by respondents. Librarians who behave in such a manner were viewed as being able to
transcend any barriers based on physical differences that might be a concern to a patron
from a different background than the librarian. Furthermore, knowledge within specific
content areas can allow for librarians of different backgrounds to make selections outside
of their ethnicity or general background. To some extent, it is possible to gauge how well
librarians are promoting a comfortable space, based on the reactions of patrons.
The HBUL Librarian said, It can be as simple as a smile. For instance, if you are sitting
at the reference desk and you walk up and I smile and say “Hi, how are you today?”
That right there is enough to say that I feel comfortable going up to her. And I know that
from working in customer service—that your approach from just sitting at the desk is
enough.
The RUL Librarian said, Our student population is diverse, and they seem comfortable
coming here. Certainly to my knowledge there is no one who feels uncomfortable coming
here because of something that has happened here. The international students will open
and close the library. If no one else is here, the international students are here, if for no
other reason than because we offer the computers that they need.
The LURL Dean emphasized the importance of librarians being properly qualified
to perform collection development duties. To that end, it is not critical for a librarian

97
responsible for collection development of Chinese materials to actually be of Chinese
origin. The individual should have a graduate degree in Chinese language, history,
literature, or some other related field that would allow for expertise to be shown in that
area.
The LURL Dean said, When I was first here, back in 2001 or 2002, a student in a SLIS
class may have asked about building a collection in gender studies and shouldn’t
someone doing that be a member of the LGBT community. We got that quite often at a
previous university, particularly in women’s studies. Shouldn’t a woman be collecting for
that? One person made a big stink when she found out a man had been collecting for
women’s studies for many years. I was one of four people because of how she had filed
her complaint, pointing out women’s studies, gender studies, and a third area…they
brought in the selectors for those areas. We let the student explain her concerns, and by
the time she got done trying to convince us that only a member of the designated group
could know what to buy one of my bibliographers asked who was to buy for Classics, a
dead Greek? I used that as an opportunity to point out that of the people in their one was
a native speaker of French, who spoke English flawlessly except for a French accent so
thick you could have cut it with a knife. The other person was clearly a native speaker of
American English. Both in their title were Humanities Bibliographers. The one however,
was Humanities English, which meant Anglo-American Humanities. Or any book
published in English. The other was Humanities Europe. But the French woman was not
the bibliographer for Humanities Europe. She was the bibliographer for English. The
native English speaker handled Europe. The French librarian has an MA in American
Literature. The other was ABD in Classics. And when we explained how those people
were hired based on their expertise, not their gender or lineage, the woman came to
understand our point. If anyone brings it up, it doesn’t reach my office.
Theme Eight: Censorship Tends to be more a Result of Budgets and Space
Limitations than any Active Agendas, although the Temptation to Censor was
Acknowledged
No librarians interviewed had intentionally censored materials. There was an
exception that will be addressed in the LURL Dean’s response. There was general
agreement that libraries all had diverse collections and that there were supposed to be
titles that would run counter to the perspectives of everyone, including the librarians
themselves, which is the nature of libraries. Librarians must be aware though, of the
political and social environment in which they live. These situations can lead to difficult

98
decisions in which a middle ground is sought between the outright censoring of a book
and placing it in the general collection.
The LURL Dean said, I have to admit that since coming here, there was a book that I
asked be placed in limited circulation—not withdrawn, but not held on the open shelf. It
was an oversized art photography book with pictures of people totally nude while they
slept. It was still photography with multiple exposures. Men and women, people with
good and bad physiques, young and old. The photographer I am sure did it as art, but
people would have been looking at it for the nudity, not the art. There was a politician
who was concerned that university libraries were using state funds to buy books that
promoted what he referred to as a homosexual agenda. The library staff became
convinced that if he knew what was on our shelves we would be in trouble. I said the
library doesn’t promote any agenda. We have books on homosexuality, but they don’t
encourage homosexuality, any more than a book about Nazi Germany are meant to
promote Nazism or books about Communism are meant to promote communism. They are
here for the study of those political leanings. Therefore, books on homosexuality are here
for the study of psychology, poetry…name all the reasons things like that might be here.
But, this one particular book was very unnecessarily sexually graphic and I knew it was
the wrong time for that to be stumbled upon in the stacks. We also received a large gift
collection at one point that we gave the euphemistic title of Human Sexuality. It may have
been given the label gender studies. But it was given to us intentionally to be a collection
of gay materials. The donor was convinced that because of the leanings of the state, the
university would have never collected it. Some of the stuff was so innocuous that we had
much of it already. Thomas Mann’s Death in Venice, or Proust’s novels that may have
had a gay character or theme. But then he also gave us runs of gay magazines that we
would have never acquired, and students studying those themes were interested in access
to those materials. As we went through the material, we found a small box full of sexually
very explicit photographs, and it was decided that that person never meant for us to see
those things in that collection and we did not add them to the collection. We had agreed
that anything not used would be returned to the donor. We chose not to return the photos
either, because we were convinced he never meant to include them and did not want to
embarrass the donor.
The LURL Dean also provided his opinion of censorship within libraries in
general and indicated he felt the practice was widespread today and always had been.
Librarians often believe that purchase of materials on certain topics that are politically
and culturally sensitive at a given time could lead to complaints, which in turn could
endanger their job. He pointed out that libraries in the United States did not purchase
books about the reunification of Germany during the Cold War out of fear of being

99
labeled anti-Semitic. He also realized such problems continued today, pointing out that
while he was at a very large university, his job would be endangered if he included AlJazeera to be included in the rotation of news channels shown in the library’s coffee shop.
The LURL Dean added, I think librarians have spent generations censoring. Many
librarians will not buy books on certain topics because they don’t want anyone to think
they are sympathetic to those views. While I have never done it when I was selecting
books, I never prevented myself from buying something I thought needed to be in the
collection, but I know a lot of people might have said “I am not putting my name on
that.” Twenty or so years ago, I was part of a panel examining what are academic
libraries not collecting from Western Europe? I was asked to speak specifically about
German studies. I had this long laundry list of things that were not being acquired that
logically should have been, if librarians were truly anticipating faculty teaching and
research interests. One of the things I was able to show we were not collecting in
American libraries was anything to do with the question of Germany’s eastern borders
with Poland or anything to do with the reunification of Germany. This was before the fall
of the Berlin Wall. At the end of the program, the program organizers let us all know that
the proceedings of the panel would be published. The person in charge had my paper,
and she called me after a few days and said “I wouldn’t talk about reunification or
Germany’s border with Poland.” I said that there were certain political topics in
America that we were not collecting, but wanted to not be specific in front of a national
audience for fear of being grossly misunderstood. Remember, this was June of 1988 or
1989. A year later, there was no debate about collecting on such topics, but, before, many
people would consider you anti-Semitic. It was a forbidden topic, and those continue to
exist. For instance, I will not say that the library will be showing Al Jazeera on the TV in
the coffee shop from one to three each day. It would probably cost me my job. So many
topics exist that people want touch. I think all libraries have individuals who subtly selfcensor because they are opposed to the topic.
The RUL Dean pointed out that within libraries, the budget often drives what is
censored, more than anything else. Any academic library will have a large number of
items that it must purchase each year to support the various courses of study that are
offered at the university it serves. Particularly if a budget is limited, complete focus may
be turned toward meeting those demands, and controversial purchases might be put off or
ignored altogether.
The RUL Dean said, I’ve never been tempted to do it; I’ve known others who have. As I
said earlier, I think there should be a wide range of opinions represented in the library.
There are things in the collection that I don’t personally agree with, but I have no urge to

100
have them removed. It is possible that at some point when ordering books, I might not
order something and base it around the issue of the budget, but I don’t remember ever
doing something like that. If so, I did it subconsciously.
The RUL Librarian pointed to the challenge of books and other materials that are
donated to the library. As with any structure, a library can contain only so many items. It
is also true that with some donations, the benefactor has an agenda in mind, and a
librarian must decide whether the donated materials are suitable to be included in the
overall collection. In the case the RUL Librarian referred to, the Church of Scientology
sent two large packages of books per year to libraries nationwide free of charge and
unrequested. It is the responsibility of the collection development librarian to consider
whether such books are relevant to patrons the library serves, if there is enough space to
accommodate them, or how to otherwise dispose of them.
The RUL Librarian said, I run into that with gift books, and I am so glad I can hand
that problem off to the subject specialists, because there are things that just make me
cringe. If the materials are completely irrelevant, we can refuse to add them based on
space limitations.
The HBUL Dean pointed to the ALA’s Freedom to Read policy. With the belief
that academic libraries exist to allow their researchers to study any topic they wish, the
HBUL Dean asserted that if there was a need for a book, she would purchase it.
The HBUL Dean said, No. The one thing that I would have to say is that we try to follow
the Freedom to Read ALA policy. The fact that we are a teaching and research institution
plays into this as well. I think any resource is a potential piece of information for
research, from the three little pigs to whatever. If there is a need for us to have it, we will
get it.
The HBUL Librarian offered a somewhat nuanced perspective. Although she
pointed out that everyone’s point of view should be represented within a library and that
she did not want to take sides in any particular debate, she would be willing to steer
patrons toward books that presented a balanced approach to various issues. This can be

101
viewed as librarians acting within their role as a faculty member and assisting students in
finding materials that will be most appropriate for what they are researching.
The HBUL Librarian said, As a librarian, I understand that everyone’s points of view
need to be on display. I’m not saying I’m going to uphold one over the other. I’m not
going to infuse my own beliefs into what someone should pick up, but I will say this is
something you should read, such as What Shall We Do About the Negro? It is about the
Civil War, emancipation, and Lincoln, and anytime someone has a question about that
era, I tell people they should read that book. It explains that Lincoln did not want to free
the Negro. That was not his plan. But it still gives you both sides of both the Confederacy
and the Union. I try to give people materials that will play to both sides without revealing
my beliefs.
Theme Nine: Low Salaries and Higher Aspirations Based on often Being the First in
a Family to Graduate College May be a Hindrance to Blacks Entering Library
Science
There was some discussion about why Blacks were not entering the field in
greater numbers, particularly when recruitment by the ALA is at an all-time high.
Salaries, as well as the requirement to obtain a graduate degree—in the case of academic
librarians two graduate degrees, were viewed as potential reasons for low numbers of
minorities in the field.
If the goal of the ALA is to recruit more minorities and groups that have
previously received the brunt of discriminatory practices, then some consideration must
be given to the issue of salaries. Stated simply, if someone is the first in their family to
attend college, are from a poor background, and are for the first time in their lives being
given the chance to flourish both intellectually and financially, they are unlikely to
choose to enter a field that offers such low remuneration for five years of higher
education.
The LURL Dean said, I would like to see more African Americans on the faculty and in
supervisory positions, whether that is at the dean or associate dean level or a supervisor
lower than a department head. Those are the demographics of this area. I am not
optimistic that is going to happen, because African Americans have far better

102
opportunities to be in a higher paying profession. African Americans do not seem all that
interested in library careers. Also, in this age, women and minorities have far fewer
disadvantages in terms of selecting a career or advancing in a career. Why would
someone who is bright and capable want to think along traditional employment lines that
don’t pay well, such as librarians, teachers, nursing, etc. Those fields that have been
largely filled by women and don’t pay well on top of it; why if I had a bright, capable
minority student in my office would I expect them to say I can’t decide between going to
med school or becoming a librarian? Why would I tell that person to limit their financial
security and not reach their full intellectual potential if they have the chance of going to
medical or law school and being well paid for the rest of their lives.
The HBUL Librarian said, You are right that that is one of the major components as
well. I have two children, one when I was in grad school. When I was offered this job, it
was $39K, and I thought, fine it is an entry level job, and I have to have a job. I also took
it because it was an opportunity and I still got to get my foot in the door. Since I’ve been
here, I have had an increase and now I am at 45K, but, still, other professions make more
than that when education and experience are considered.
Theme Ten: Libraries Can be Places that Foster Diversity
Because of the nature of libraries to be open to literally all topics and develop
collections that are as broad in scope as the faculty and student body of the universities
they represent, it was generally believed that libraries can, and do, foster diversity. This
can occur even when it is not necessarily a primary goal of the librarians at the
institution. Diversity can also prove to be a challenge when patrons disagree with the
programming or activities in which the library is engaging. As the LURL Dean
discovered, offering a diverse selection of information—in the case that is referred to,
television news—can be challenging in a conservative region of the nation.
The LURL Dean said, When we first opened up the coffee shop and added televisions, I
had never thought about CNN being too liberal. And I thought by tuning the TV
permanently to CNN, we would have 24 hour news with captions and that everybody
would be happy. After a few months a young man requested if we could keep the TV
permanently tuned to FOX. I have to admit now that CNN is more liberal with a capital
L, clearly promoting more of the liberal agenda than FOX. So, in writing my response, I
thanked him for pointing this out. I did not do the following to aggravate him or tell him
no. I said I appreciated his suggestion because I had talked previously about moving the
channel on a predetermined schedule 2 to 3 times a day to different types of broadcasts.

103
The examples I gave him were the BBC and Deutsche Welle, because they broadcast in
English. I asked if he would be willing to meet with me to discuss what the students would
like to see in addition to CNN and FOX. In a conversation with someone later, they
pointed out the student likely thought I was putting him off or putting him down by
suggesting foreign broadcasts. One person pointed out that I should be careful, because
next he would be saying you were trying to show Al Jazeera. And, yet, this is a university.
If any university is going to be showing news broadcasts, shouldn’t one of those be an
English language foreign newscast?
The LURL Librarian provided a different example of the challenges that can
come with diverse programming. In this case, the library had hosted an exhibit on
Vietnam that showed the perspectives of the North Vietnamese as well as the United
States and South Vietnamese, leading to the librarians having to field some complaints.
The LURL Librarian said, Sometimes with our exhibits, there have been guest books
that people could sign. For the Vietnam display, people were able to write their reactions
to the display, and I think the dean can probably answer this better. I think if people react
to something it gets to his office. I don’t always hear about things like that. I know there
have been reactions to programming that has been considered controversial. Sometimes
people give positive feedback as well. In the case of the Vietnam exhibit, there were
materials from the perspective of the North Vietnamese. That’s why it was considered
controversial to some people who thought the library shouldn’t have been presenting
things from that point of view.
The RUL Dean pointed out that there had been several programs hosted by the
library in the past three years that could be viewed as promoting diversity, and all had
been very well received by students, faculty, and the general public. Topics included
Black History, the Holocaust, and Islamic Studies. Programs such as these can also bring
the collection to the user in a sense, encouraging students to come into the library
afterwards and search for more information on the subjects on which they have viewed
programs.
The RUL Dean said, There have been positive responses regarding several programs we
have had, including programs on the Holocaust, Islamic studies, and some programming
for Black History Month. My interpretation of a library is that you should provide
diversity regardless of what you personally believe in. There are people who use your

104
library who want to know what that range of opinion is, and they ought to be able to find
it in the library. And, it is a non-threatening place for them to learn about something.
The HBUL Dean noted two recent grants that the library received. Both grants
provide materials for the library’s collection and also provide funds for programming
relating to those materials. The HBUL Dean had a history of collaborating with diversity
offices, in particular, at universities to create a variety of programs that were targeted at a
variety of different minority segments of the population.
The HBUL Dean said, We recently received the Muslim Journeys Bookshelf grant from
the NEH, so we did some programming on Muslim topics. We also got the Bridging
Cultures Created Equal grant about the Civil Rights era. We just continue to do those
sorts of programs to make sure that we have a library that is very diverse in terms of its
collections and programs. At another University where I worked, there was a diversity
office, and the library would work with them to do the parade of flags and have a very
nice celebration of all of the cultures that were there on campus and in the community.
The HBUL Librarian was pleased that the dean was encouraging the librarians to
apply for programming grants. She also discussed some programs they initiated in-house
that were positive experiences for the library as well as the university committee and
indicated that in addition to grant funded activities, practical programming such as AIDS
Awareness Day should be increased.
The HBUL Librarian said, Programming is something we have beefed up. We have
celebrated National Black HIV/AIDs Awareness day. Thirty students came and were
tested for HIV. It came up because some students were having sex here, a librarian saw
it, and was like, “Y’all need to pull your pants up!” So, it developed out of a conversation
with another librarian, and we knew we couldn’t tell them they couldn’t have sex,
although we could tell them not to have sex in the library! But, I said let’s make this a
conversation piece where we bring it back to them and say if you are going to have sex,
be responsible. One of the students who attended was gay and wrote a poem about her
experiences. I think that brought out the idea that there are a lot of important issues out
there and they are not necessarily Black/White or Gay/Straight, they are issues everyone
deals with every day. It doesn’t matter; it’s an issue and open to everyone. And the
students respond well and just want to know what are we doing next? We try to highlight
different aspects of everything. We had a STEM Day in March, and we highlighted the
women in STEM. We had someone from NASA, a Black woman, here. I think events that
particularly focus on student self-awareness are especially likely to be successful.

105
Theme Eleven: No Libraries had Diversity Policies
Only the HBUL was developing its own policy. The other two libraries studied
followed the policy of their university. The HBUL was developing a diversity committee.
Neither of the other institutions had a diversity committee for their libraries, nor were
they planning to develop one. A common response was that the university had an overarching diversity policy, and the library followed those guidelines.
THE LURL Librarian and RUL Dean both offered personnel/human resources
answers regarding this question. Although it certainly had a personnel component, the
researcher was searching for policies and attitudes that indicated the libraries and
universities studied had an open view toward diversity and encouraged the celebration of
other cultures, rather than parsing the policy into a vehicle to avoid a lawsuit.
The LURL Librarian said, We follow the university’s diversity policy. In every
advertisement, it states that women and minorities are encouraged to apply. We certainly
attempt to include a diverse population in our pools and look for those qualified
candidates when we have our search committees. The reason we have been more
successful with staff and professional staff, the recruitment is more wide open. Whoever
puts in an application is there. There are more people who already live here, and they
want to find a job. The university is a good employer, so they apply. A lot of our staff
have been students here, and so that pipeline has more diversity in it than the pipeline for
our faculty.
The RUL Dean said, No. I am not sure the University has one. I think there is an
unstated policy that we should be looking to have a diversity of employees. But, with a
rural community, the number of applicants tends to be small. I hear of people in other
places getting 30 and 40 applicants for a job. I am happy if I get five or six. And
therefore you don’t have a very deep pool to look into. And it’s hard; even if we try to
recruit—we try to go out of the area—we try to advertise outside of the area. We
advertise nationally for librarian positions, and we still don’t get the applications. The
economy has been bad lately; maybe that is why people don’t want to move far away
from home, because it distances them from their safety net. Generally in the past when
there were economically trying times, people would try to move where there was the
possibility of finding a job. This has been a different kind of economic crisis though, so
maybe it has something to do with it.

106
Both the HBUL Dean and HBUL Librarian indicated that the library did not have
a diversity policy. They were pleased that one was being developed. The diversity policy
being developed seemed to the researcher to have a sense of urgency, and was important
to both individuals to complete.
The HBUL Dean said, We are in the process of developing one. To my knowledge, we
don’t have a diversity department on campus. I continue to go back and look through the
faculty and staff handbook and try to find some segments on diversity there. We are
trying to work on ours here in the library.
The HBUL Librarian said, “No, and I certainly hope it is being worked on. I would love
to see it come to fruition. I don’t want to keep talking about it. Just to do it.”
Theme Twelve: Librarians Recognized the Importance of Diversity within the
Context of Libraries
Regardless of whether the libraries studied had diversity committees or policies,
the importance of the concept of embracing diversity within libraries was clearly evident
with all respondents. Because libraries literally serve anyone who comes into their
facilities, it is imperative for librarians to have an open attitude in order to offer proper
service. The LURL Dean pointed out that, as a rule, if a business does not have a staff
that reflects the population it is serving, something is wrong. In the case of libraries,
which do not have a pool of faculty applicants that reflect the general population, staffs
should be developed to reflect that population. As for collections and programming, they
will be diverse, so long as librarians are properly educated, trained, and follow
professional guidelines.
The LURL Dean said, “This is a simple answer. I believe there has to be diversity in
general. That is our society and if we don’t have a diverse workforce…a workforce that is
not diverse either has a problem attracting people to the profession or there is something
about hiring that is preventing the law of averages from bringing in a diverse
workforce.”

107
The LURL Librarian pointed out that embracing diversity can lead to librarians
running afoul of politicians, pointing to a state level legislator who wanted to ban any
book at a public institution that “promoted” homosexuality. The individual later extended
his proposed ban to anything of a sexual nature that might influence young minds. In
addition to being impossible, because love is a common theme in world literature,
banning books is an anathema to librarians.
The LURL Librarian said, Not only in serving your patron base, but dealing with the
material that you see when you work in libraries. A lot of our materials can be
considered controversial by segments of the population. We’ve had a state legislator be
very concerned about what was on the shelves. He thought anything of a sexual nature
should not be available to such impressionable minds. So, it is not just serving the patron
base but also being able to deal with the material that comes in so that you have an open
mind about that as well as serving the patrons that you have.
The RUL Dean returned to the basic mission historically of libraries, that of the
people’s university. Minorities, the impoverished, and immigrants can all use libraries to
lift themselves up to a higher position in society. In this light, it is hard to imagine a
librarian with such an outlook as being able to conceive of anything other than a place
that was open to diversity.
The RUL Dean said, I think you have to have the ability to serve a diverse population,
because in the U.S. we are getting a more diverse population all the time, and you need
to be able to respond to them with good service regardless of their background. Libraries
have always been, at least in my estimation, have always been places of refuge for those
who are in a minority status, because libraries have always tried to treat people equally
when they come in. I don’t know that it is any more important in libraries now than it was
then, but I think that everyone continues to work hard to try and provide an equal
response to whoever is asking the question.
The RUL Librarian pointed out that particularly in the case of that university,
where there was a population of more than 10% international students, diversity was
remarkably important. Such students have a variety of needs, and in order to satisfy those

108
diverse collections and preferably diverse faculty and staff are required to meet them.
This view was also voiced by the HBUL Dean.
The RUL Librarian said, “Just because the more diverse experience, the more diverse
people, the better chance that we have people on our staff who can satisfy a variety of
needs.”
The HBUL Dean said, “In order to be able to attract students to the university, you need
to have a library that feeds into where they are from. Not only based on their majors, but
where they are from.”
The HBUL Librarian compared diversity to having an open mind. She pointed out
that although she was a Black American, she also spoke Spanish, which made her more
diverse. She also studied sociology in college, which further opened her mind to other
cultures. She had significant concerns about some of her colleagues, and their attitudes
about diversity, particularly concerning homosexuals.
The HBUL Librarian said, I would say that it’s sort of like having an open mind. You
are open to different types of information and you can best decipher what needs to be
given at the point of service. For example, my undergraduate is a BA in Spanish, my
minor was Sociology, and I have a concentration in African American History. That’s
pretty broad. But just looking at that background, there weren’t too many people I knew
in my program who were Black females with a Spanish degree. I could probably count
them on one hand. Just having that and having the openness of mind. One of my
sociology classes was about sexuality and society, and you talk about mind blowing! That
right there set the stage, and when we talk about gender and sexuality; not everyone talks
about that. You can say male or female, but you have people in this world who are born
male, but are female in their thinking, and you have to consider that. Gender and
sexuality have a lot to do with who we are. And I think our librarians here have this close
minded mindset that it just isn’t right. If you take the recent Supreme Court decision, and
I can’t believe it is happening in this day and age, but the comments have been colorful to
say the least. It just doesn’t bother me if people are gay or bisexual. As long as it doesn’t
impose on me, that is the case with anyone. I can have friends, and as long as they don’t
impose their lifestyles, why do I care? Heterosexual people get to be married and
miserable, why shouldn’t gays? So, for me it is a big deal. Diversity here as far as
diversity goes, we say one thing but mean another. So, you just don’t talk about it. If you
bring it up, it’s hitting the fan.

CHAPTER 5
SUMMARY, DISCUSSION, CONCLUSIONS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Chapter 5 includes a summary of the study. It will offer a discussion that
compares evidence found in the literature with results gleaned from the study. It will also
present conclusions and provide recommendations for both practice and further research.
Summary
This study examined the attitudes of librarians’ and library staffs’ attitudes toward
diversity issues. The study also examined concrete topics regarding diversity in libraries,
which included a raw catalog count based on selected keyword searches and also
considered the type of programming that had been engaged in by librarians at the three
institutions studied.
Research Question 1: To what extent is diversity considered a valued attribute of three
academic libraries in the Southeast in terms of race, religion, gender, nationality, and
sexual orientation?
Data revealed that librarians were generally open to diversity in a variety of
forms, as was anticipated at the outset of the study. Survey results were higher when
general questions were asked. Lower scores sometimes resulted when more specific
questions were asked. For instance, respondents at all three institutions scored quite
positively to “I value diversity in the workplace” (Question 15). However, when asked
specifically about homosexuality (Question 27), scores plummeted.

110
Data indicated that respondents were comfortable with, and possibly wanted, a
more diverse work environment (Question 29). However, none of the three institutions
studied had a particularly diverse workforce, in large part, because the applicant pool
itself is not diverse.
Interviews with library deans and their designees were consistently positive
relating to issues of diversity. All subjects indicated a strong desire to hire a more diverse
workforce, and lamented the lack of a diverse candidate pool. References were made to
the fact that libraries are considered safe harbors and intended to be available to all
people. Interviewees indicated a strong belief that the collection should be diverse, with
all points of view on any subject represented.
Research Question 2: What strategies are employed at three academic libraries in the
Southeast to foster diversity in terms of race, religion, gender, nationality, and sexual
orientation?
Relatively few distinct strategies were being used to foster diversity at the
institutions studied. No library had a diversity policy or a diversity committee. The
HBUL was developing a diversity policy. All three libraries relied on their university’s
overall diversity policy, although the dean at the RUL indicated he was unsure whether
the university had such a policy.
Both interviewees at the HBUL consistently advocated for the library to be an
advocate for diversity on the campus. Neither the LURL or RUL interviewees viewed
their roles in such a light. However, it should be noted that all respondents indicated that
diversity was an inherent part of daily life in a library. Therefore, it may be that

111
individuals never viewed themselves as advocates, per se, because fostering diversity was
a natural outgrowth of their daily routine.
All libraries were engaging in various levels of programming that would be
considered diverse. The RUL and HBUL had recently received programming grants from
the National Endowment for the Humanities that promoted diverse topics. These
programs focused on Civil Rights, Islamic Studies, and French culture.
Research Question 3: What are the perceived effects of diversity initiatives at three
academic libraries in the Southeast in terms of race, religion, gender, nationality, and
sexual orientation?
Diversity initiatives could best be examined through the context of programming.
All interviewees who referenced diversity-themed programming at their institutions
generally described positive reactions from patrons. There was some backlash at the
LURL’s exhibit on Vietnam because a part of it explained the perspective of the North
Vietnamese. Responses at the other two institutions reflected positive attitudes about
programming to date. In surveys, respondents indicated that they did not feel diversity
was being forced on them (Question 19). The HBUL librarian indicated that student
response to programming had been positive and that there was a demand for the library to
do more in terms of outreach to the student body. The RUL Dean indicated that
programming hosted by that library had been well attended and that responses had been
positive.
Although the three surveys were not designed to assess diversity initiatives
specifically, results indicated a general positive outlook by full-time faculty and staff
toward diversity issues. The HBUL tended to score the lowest in general throughout the

112
survey. All three institutions’ respondents indicated they did not feel as though diversity
was being forced upon them and had positive responses to questions relating to race and
gender. Numbers were lower relating to the use of foreign languages and homosexuality.
Research Question 4: To what extent are the faculty and staff, collections, and
programming at three academic libraries in the Southeast diverse in terms of race,
religion, gender, nationality, and sexual orientation?
Based on interview responses and survey responses, the faculty and staff of all
three libraries have positive attitudes toward diversity, when considering the topic in
abstract and general terms. Survey responses indicated some possible negative attitudes
relating to homosexuality. At the HBUL, it appeared that were perceived concerns about
respect given to older workers. The HBUL survey also indicated concerns relating to
religious expression and the ability to take time off for religious holidays.
The collections at each institution could all be considered diverse. The LURL and
RUL had larger holdings than the HBUL, leading to greater diversity based on raw
numbers. Books relating to the search term “Transgendered,” were limited at each
institution. Books on atheism were less likely to be at all three institutions. All three
institutions had at a minimum 100 volumes on each of the five major world religions.
Conclusions
From the outset of this study, it was assumed that librarians would have certain
fundamental beliefs based on the nature of their profession, which lends itself to serving
people from all walks of life. These assumed beliefs included favoring diversity and
opposing censorship. Diversity was examined through a broad lens that examined race,
religion, sexuality, and political beliefs. After examining the results of the study, it is

113
clear that the librarians who participated positively view diversity; when examined more
narrowly, some individuals did struggle with the issue.
The survey taken by librarians at the three institutions frequently reflected the
complexity of diversity issues. For instance, librarians generally responded that they were
comfortable working with an individual who preferred a different lifestyle. However,
scores plummeted when the same librarians responded to the question of whether they
were comfortable with someone with a different lifestyle discussing their partner at work.
Similarly, librarians at all three institutions indicated they had positive feelings
toward patrons who spoke English as a Second Language or had limited proficiency.
They also indicated positive attitudes toward colleagues from other backgrounds sharing
their diverse backgrounds. However, when questions were asked to gauge librarian
reactions about posting signage in foreign languages, or colleagues speaking in their
native languages, respondents’ scores again dropped.
Catalog searches of the LURL and RUL reflected diverse catalogs that served the
research interests of faculty and staff well. The LURL had the most diverse collection by
far, as would be expected of an institution of its size. The RUL’s collection was
substantial and also had a large selection of books relating to the diversity categories
searched for. The HBUL did not seem to have a diversity problem as much as a dearth of
materials in general. Their holdings on all topics searched for were remarkably smaller
than either of the other institutions studied. Although all of the institutions had relatively
large numbers of holdings for search terms relating to homosexuality (gay, lesbian,
homosexual, and bisexual), all three had only a few number of books that could be
discovered using the term “transgendered.”

114
Librarians who were interviewed for this study all indicated that they had positive
attitudes about diversity. However, when asked how diversity was promoted at the
library, several of the librarians indicated that it was not. There was also a general
opinion among the librarians at the LURL and RUL that it was not the library’s mission
to promote diversity. As the LURL dean pointed out, if his faculty and staff did promote
diversity it was through their interactions with each other and their patrons. Conversely,
the HBUL librarians who were interviewed both believed that promoting diversity was a
part of their library’s inherent mission. At the same time, there was a general consensus
that, through their nature, libraries promote diversity. They are places that house diverse
materials and serve diverse groups.
All of the librarians interviewed lamented the scarcity of diverse candidates
within the library field at large, and also within the pools of applicants that had existed
within job searches they had participated in. They attributed the dearth of diversity
librarians in the overall field to low salaries and the requirement of at least one and
sometimes two graduate degrees. Within the context of searches that they had conducted
in their own libraries, each subject referenced the challenge of recruiting people of
diverse backgrounds to rural locations in the Southeast.
Discussion
One crucial step in working to attain a diverse atmosphere in a library is to learn
what diverse learners need and want. Surveys can be an excellent aid in assisting
librarians in learning what their students already know, as well as what they need to learn
or have access to in order to make their library experience a better and more rewarding
one. International students continue to have an increased presence in colleges throughout

115
the United States, and consequently have an inescapable positive impact on diversity of
thought throughout the academy. Respondents at the RUL and LURL institutions studied,
indicated they had large international student populations and discussed how they had
affected library services and procedures. The HBUL library dean indicated that she
anticipated increased international student enrollment in the future, and realized students
from foreign backgrounds would have specific needs that would need to be met by the
library.
Following a survey of international students, several ideas were gleaned that
could improve services to this group, including: creating a partnership between the
library and the international programs office, assigning a librarian to international student
programs and outreach, increasing library orientation and outreach efforts specifically to
international students, creating an online tutorial for international students, creating
library webpages for international students, collaborating with campus pre-college
English as a second language institutes, and providing professional development
seminars for library staff relating to services for international students (Jackson, 2004, pp.
205-207).
One of the simplest mechanisms for testing the diversity of a library is by
assessing its collection and then improving that collection as deemed necessary.
Fortunately, for the modern librarian, such a task has never been easier, because of
technology that is currently available. Quantitative data are essential for guiding
collection development activities, and computerized integrated library systems (ILS) that
track acquisitions, cataloging, and circulation have made generating such data a much
easier task than in the even not so distant past. Librarians may also compare their

116
collections quantitatively by using the Research Libraries Group (RLG) database, which
provides numerical scores indicating a collection’s strength and allows librarians to more
easily determine areas that need to be further developed. Another technological
innovation that allows librarians to further diversify their collections is the Online
Catalog of the Library of Congress’ (OCLC) catalog, WorldCat. Libraries from around
the world are able to upload records of works by their nations’ authors, which in turn
allows librarians in other countries to have knowledge of those books (Dickey, 2011, pp.
159-160.).
Library deans at all three institutions studied responded that they believed they
had diverse collections that were well suited to their student population, faculty, and the
degree-granting level of the institution. Although this was found to be true of both the
cases of the LURL and RUL, the HBUL’S collection was found lacking in numerous
areas, particularly when compared with the other two institutions in the study.
Because libraries are as personal as the collector (the librarians who are charged
with book purchases), it is rare that a collection does not have the personal stamp of the
individual who was charged with developing it. Even when working diligently to avoid
bias, librarians will inevitably purchase books and other items that relate to their own
personal interests. Over a lengthy period of time, such actions could severely influence
the nature of the collection. Emotions often play a much larger role in collection
development than many might realize, which makes it important for librarians selecting
books to reflect and be sure there is an intellectual reason and an academic need for the
collection development decisions they make (Quinn, 2007, p. 13). By utilizing databases
such as RLG and WorldCat, librarians can minimize their personal biases regarding the

117
overall collection. Librarians at all three institutions readily admitted that there were
items in the overall collection that were personally offensive to them. They also
acknowledged that ordering items that ran contrary to their own personal belief system
was part of the job they had chosen. Limited space and budgets were the reasons most
commonly given for censoring by the librarians interviewed.
Developing a national pool of diverse librarians has been an increasingly
important goal of the American Library Association (ALA) since the inception of its
Spectrum initiative in 1997. The program offers scholarships to individuals wanting to
become librarians who are from diverse ethnic backgrounds. However, to date, this
initiative has had a relatively minimal impact on the profession, especially in terms of
recruitment of Hispanics to the field, which is considered crucial because of their rapidly
increasing population in the United States (Balderrama, 2000; Edelman, 2005; Guerena
& Edward, 2000; Pyati, 2003). As noted in field interviews, diversifying library
personnel was a key goal of each subject; however, they all pointed to the fact that not
only did a diverse pool exist, library programs were devoid of diversity as well. The
LURL librarian went so far as to suggest that worrying about diversity when conducting
job searches was pointless, because so few diverse candidates existed. He also indicated
that it would be difficult for the applicant pool to be increased, because low salaries
within the field discouraged students from pursuing graduate degrees in library science.
As the diversification of the United States population continues to increase, there
is a continued need for a pool of librarians who reflect their patron base. Many subjects
noted on the survey portion of this study, as did interviewees, that there is a prevailing
belief among librarians that people who are of minority status are more comfortable

118
approaching librarians who look like them. Language barriers can also cause challenges
for librarians, particularly in university settings where there is a large international
population. This problem is particularly felt in relation to the Hispanic community, in
which communication can sometimes be a problem. It may be up to librarians to become
functionally fluent in in Spanish (and other languages) for this problem to be solved. In
spite of efforts by the American Library Association (ALA) and universities across the
nation, the percentage of librarians who are of a Latino background has remained
stagnant since 1970 at only 1.8% (Guerena & Edward, 2000, p. 172). Such problems are
particularly difficult for libraries in rural locations. Both the library deans at the RUL and
HBUL institutions indicated that although the challenge of diversifying library faculty
was felt throughout the field of academic librarianship, it was even more difficult to find
candidates to fill librarian positions in more rural regions of the nation. Both deans
attributed these challenges to diversity candidates being able to find more cultural outlets
that appealed to them and their backgrounds in more urban areas.
Diverse personnel are needed for more than simply patron interactions. They also
play a critical role in diversifying the monographic collection. As Edelman (2005)
pointed out, many within the profession recognized the importance of diversity within
librarianship as early as the 1950s. During this time period, the United States government
began funding faculty and students in newly established university programs that focused
on Asian, Eastern European, and Latin American studies. Libraries needed catalogers,
particularly, who had language skills up to the task of properly developing and cataloging
materials in languages that were not commonly spoken among the faculty and staff
(Edelman, 2005, p. 235). Diversity in terms of foreign-born librarians could be viewed as

119
sporadic at the libraries studied. Although, the library deans all indicated they had a
librarian on their faculty who was a native speaker of a language other than English, the
language spoken was not necessarily useful to the institution in question. For example,
the RUL employed a librarian from the Ukraine on one of its extension campuses.
Although the Ukrainian librarian certainly added diversity to the library, the main
international group at the university was Chinese.
The library profession is dominated in the United States by White females.
Although this trend is gradually changing, it will take time for a meaningful balancing of
the sexes and races to occur. This does not negate librarians’ ability to promote diversity
of thought within their libraries. Just, as mentioned above, those with the proper mindset
can accurately depict other cultures through writing, so can librarians from one
perspective encourage meaningful programs and discussions about other cultures and
ways of life. This can be fostered in a variety of ways, from building collections about
other cultures’ histories and languages, to engaging in international experiences, to
making a school or academic library friendly to an increasingly large immigrant
population (Agnosto, 2007; Martin, 1994; Pors, 2007; Reznowski, 2008; Vaagen &
Enger, 2004). Almost all of the librarians interviewed pointed to the importance of
programming in terms of promoting a diverse atmosphere. The LURL had recently
hosted an exhibit that examined the Vietnam War, in part, through the lens of the North
Vietnamese. The RUL dean listed several programs that the library had hosted, which
included lectures by a Holocaust survivor and an expert on Black Cowboys. The HBUL
had recently received a grant to host programming on the Civil Rights era.

120
More than just personnel, diversity is about being open to a wide variety of ideas.
Interviewee responses for this study indicated they had a remarkably broad view of the
definition of diversity and its role within their professional culture. The LURL dean
pointed out that if a person is well-trained and well-educated, they do not have to be a
member of a certain group to order materials for that group. Agnosto (2007) defined
culture as referring to much more than just racial and ethnic backgrounds. The term
encompasses a much wider array of characteristics that include “a person’s ethnic, racial,
linguistic, religious, gender, disability, political, geographic, age, or socioeconomic
status” (Agnosto, 2007, p. 27). Creating a multicultural library can lead to students and
patrons developing a sense of belonging within the academic community. Multicultural
resources are also helpful for easing the transition into a new environment for Englishlanguage learners and also help other students learn more about the world around them
(Agnosto, 2007, pp. 30-31).
Recommendations for Practice and Policy
The following are recommendations for future research and for policy makers and
practitioners of library science:


Academic libraries should receive funding that would allow them to develop and
maintain diverse collections.



Academic libraries should develop diversity policies in cases where they do not
have them.



Academic libraries should establish diversity committees to assist with the
development and maintenance of appropriate policies and procedures regarding
diversity.

121


A specific librarian or librarians—should the interest exist—be placed in charge
of developing programming for the library. This programming should emphasize
diversity issues as needed.



Grants related to diversity (books, instructional materials, and programming),
should be pursued by academic libraries.



Academic libraries should dedicate a budget line to programming.



Administrators of academic libraries should take steps to assure that library
faculty and staff are aware of the ALA’s policies regarding diversity, as well as
those of the library and university.



Academic librarians should be encouraged to take advantage of professional
fellowships and study abroad opportunities that would enable them to learn more
about other cultures.
Recommendations for Further Research
The following are recommendations for further research for scholars interested in

library science:


Researchers should broaden the lens of this study to include other sections of the
country, which would provide a richer perspective of diversity attitudes within
libraries.



Researchers should broaden the catalog portion of the study to include electronic
materials held in databases.



Further examination of the role of library programming should be considered.
Although all libraries within this study engaged in programming, very little
concrete data about past programs were available.

122


Library faculty and staff who participated in the survey scored low on questions
relating to both homosexuality and the use of foreign languages. Both of these
topics would be interesting for future scholars to examine.



Librarians interviewed at the LURL and RUL consistently indicated that they did
not believe it was their job to promote diversity. HBUL librarians consistently
argued that it was part of the library’s mission. All librarians interviewed agreed
that by their nature, libraries were inherently diverse. The issue of whether
libraries should promote diversity, rather than simply be diverse by their nature
appeared to be based on the race of the interviewee. This dichotomy should be
further examined.

Ms. Mack,
I am contacting you because you are listed as the co-chair of the University of Tennessee
Libraries Diversity Committee. I am in the initial phases of my dissertation at Alabama
State and my topic is going to be on diversity within Southeastern academic libraries. I
found a 2002 survey developed by your committee online and many questions are
relevant to my research. Would it be possible for you to give me permission to use
questions from this survey in my research, or could you put me in contact with the person
who could give me permission to do so?

Institutional Review Board
c/o Office of Human Subjects Research
Dear Members of the Institutional Review Board:
After reviewing the proposed dissertation study, “An Examination of Diversity Initiatives
within Southeastern Academic Libraries,” presented by Mr. Christopher A. Shaffer, an
Alabama State University doctoral student, I have granted authorization for key
stakeholders of the University Library indicated to be recruited as participants of the
study.
The purpose of this doctoral dissertation study is to explore the extent to which a diverse
climate exists at three academic libraries in the Southeast, as well as the type of attitudes
that exist within those libraries concerning diversity. Mr. Shaffer will conduct the
following activities within the libraries: collect data concerning collections and
programming, collect data through surveys of faculty and staff, and collect data through
interviews with deans and department heads. This project will end no later than
December 20, 2013.
To ensure that the personnel are protected, Mr. Shaffer has agreed to provide me a copy
of any University IRB-approved, stamped consent document before he recruits
participants at the selected libraries for the study. To eliminate any risk of coercion, I will
neither advocate or dissuade that any member of the libraries participate in this study. Mr.
Shaffer has agreed to provide an executive summary of his dissertation study results to
our library.
If the IRB has any concerns about the permission granted to the researcher by this letter,
please contact me at (XXX) XXX-XXX.
Sincerely,
Dr. Smith, Dean

II. Consent and Introduction
My name is Christopher Shaffer. I am a student in the doctoral program of
Educational Leadership, Policy, and Law at Alabama State University, and am
conducting a library diversity study as my doctoral dissertation project. Diversity is a
broad term that can be defined differently depending upon the individual. The goal of my
study is to examine a variety of diversity types and determine the extent to which the
academic libraries participating in this study are addressing diversity issues, particularly
in terms of collections, staffing, leadership, and programming. The interview should take
between 45 minutes to one hour. I will be audio-recording your responses in order to
assure the accuracy of the interview. Your identity will be kept confidential.
III. Interview Questions
Question 1: How do you define diversity?
Possible Probe: Do you believe this definition to be generally shared by other
professionals in the library science field?
Question 2: Although the profession is slowly changing, library science still tends to be
dominated by white women. To what extent do you think a field as homogenous as
library science can still be diverse?
Question 3: How do you feel a diverse environment affects service to students?
Question 4: Why do you believe diversity is important within the context of libraries?

153
Question 5: To what extent do you believe the library plays a role in fostering tolerance at
a university? How does it do this?
Question 6: What sort of feedback from faculty and students do you receive concerning
diversity in terms of programming, staffing, and collections?
Question 7: In what ways you believe your library is diverse? What areas do you feel
your library needs to improve in regarding diversity?
Possible Probe: Do you believe that your own personal philosophy or university
demographics drives your diversity efforts at the library?
Question 8: Does your library have a diversity policy? If so, what is that policy?
Possible Probe: How do you believe having such a policy improves the quality of your
library?
Question 9: Have you ever been tempted to remove an item that clashed with your
personal beliefs in terms of politics, religion, etc.? If so, did you?
Question 10: Have you ever intentionally not ordered a book or other item because it
violated your personal belief system in some way?
Question 11: How diverse is the student population at your university?
Possible Probe: As your university’s demographics have changed, has that also changed
your collection development habits or policy?
Question 12: How do your faculty and staff promote a diverse atmosphere?
Possible Probe: Do you feel the message of diversity reaches your faculty, staff, and
students?
Question 13: What type of additional resources does your library have for international
students? Are these materials adequate for the students they serve?
Question 14: Does your library have a diversity committee? If so, is it active and
effective?
Question 15: What types of improvements related to diversity would you like to see at
your library?
Possible Probe: How difficult do you think it will be to make these improvements?
Question 16: Is there anything else you would like to tell me about?
