ABSTRACT OF THE DISSERTATION
Interactions in calls
to the 9-1-1 Emergency System in Costa Rica
By ALEXA BOLAÑOS-CARPIO

Dissertation Director:
Dr. Galina Bolden

This dissertation examines interactions in calls to the 9-1-1 Emergency System in
Costa Rica, and particularly focuses on the analysis of the overall structural organization
of calls, and interactional activities of requesting help and formulating place. The
dissertation uses the methodology of Conversation Analysis to examine recordings of
naturally occurring interactions on the 9-1-1 telephone line, supplemented by nonparticipant observations in the call room and interviews with 9-1-1 officials. I analyze
215 calls of actual incidents. My findings show that, in the overall structural organization
of the call, callers proffer (and sometimes engage in) greetings during the opening of the
call. In the interrogative series phase, besides formulating the location of the incident and
the problem, call-takers verify the caller’s contact information (i.e., name and telephone
number). In the response of assistance phase, call-takers do not promise the assistance,
but suggest it by using a combination of informings (i.e., the information was sent, the

ii

dispatch center is in charge of dispatching assistance, be alert on the assistance).
Regarding requesting help, my analysis shows that by using particular turn designs
callers may display an orientation to their low entitlement to the request and to high
contingencies in getting the assistance (e.g., “para ver si”, “do me a favor” construction,
“be kind” construction), or, alternatively, to low contingencies in getting the assistance
and high entitlement to the request (e.g., description of self-evident incidents). Regarding
formulating place, findings show that callers use three practices: geographical
formulations, landmark formulations, and “other signs” formulations. The landmark
formulation is comprised of a landmark, a distance from the landmark, and the direction
of the movement. A place formulation is institutionally sufficient by call-takers when it
includes both geographical and landmark formulations. These findings inform us about
different practices that different communities use when calling to 9-1-1 services. By
examining the overall structural organization of calls, and interactional activities of
requesting help and formulating place, and analyzing possible interactional problems that
participants might experience when calling for help, this dissertation has a potential to
inform and possibly improve the 9-1-1 service in Costa Rica.

Chapter 1
Introduction
People call emergency services when they are in need of help, whether it be for
life-threatening incidents (e.g., a heart attack) or incidents of marginal urgency (e.g.,
having fever and body pain). 911 services are crucial for preserving people’s lives and
property, given that they provide critical services to citizens and communities (e.g.,
extinguishing a fire in a park). A rapid response to a call for assistance can save lives and
property; therefore, communication is key.
Collecting information about the incident and its location is a crucial part of 911
service interactions. This information is needed not only to figure out what is happening
and to dispatch the assistance, but also to dispatch the appropriate assistance. For
example, if a caller reports a car accident involving an injured person, the call-taker
might dispatch both the police and an ambulance. On the other hand, if a caller reports a
car accident not involving an injured person, the call-taker might only dispatch the police.
Effective communication, however, does not entirely rely on a single participant of the
call. Both callers and call-takers are responsible for negotiating and co-constructing the
incident. For instance, if the caller only reports a car accident, the call-taker might find
out, through an interrogative series, that there is an injured person in the accident;
therefore, they would be able to dispatch the appropriate response teams.
Effectively communicating the details of an incident impacts not only the
response time of the assistance, but also the distribution of resources within the
emergency center. Since the center can only deal with a limited number of calls at a given

2
time, if a call proceeds smoothly, call-takers may subsequently be available for further
incoming calls.
This dissertation analyzes interactions from the 9-1-1 Emergency System in Costa
Rica. This is a countrywide, state-funded, and centralized system that receives calls from
all over the country, and subsequently transfers the information to local response teams.
The system coordinates more than ten institutions, such as the Costa Rican Red Cross,
Fire Department, and Judiciary Investigation Bureau.
This dissertation uses the methodology of Conversation Analysis and analyzes
data by means of examining naturally occurring interactions (i.e., actual calls to 9-1-1
Costa Rica). This inductive approach grounds all of the analytic claims in a participant’s
observable conduct. A conversation analysis proceeds by building collections of
particular interactional phenomena in order to explain recurrent patterns of
communication and how participants deal with recurrent interactional tasks. This
dissertation also uses ethnographic methods, such as non-participant observations from
the call room and interviews with 9-1-1 officials, in order to better understand this
institutional setting.
This dissertation analyzes the overall structural organization of calls and
interactional practices of requesting help and formulating place. By examining these
phenomena and analyzing possible interactional problems that participants might
experience, this dissertation has a potential to inform and possibly improve the 9-1-1
service in Costa Rica. This dissertation contributes to Conversation Analysis by shedding
light on the action of requesting help and on how participants co-construct the location of
the incident. Furthermore, this dissertation also contributes to Conversation Analysis by

3
extending research to languages other than English, the language in which most
conversation analytic research has been conducted. This dissertation extends research to
the Spanish language, in the context of emergency calls, and in Costa Rica.
Overview of the dissertation
The dissertation is organized as follows. Chapter 2 reviews research on two main
areas: institutional talk and interactions in emergency calls. First, I review conversation
analytic research on institutional talk and provide a summary of the main characteristics
of institutional talk: task-oriented interactions, particular constraints on participation, and
specialized inferential frameworks (Drew & Heritage, 1992a; Heritage & Clayman,
2010). Secondly, I review research on emergency calls, including the overall structural
organization of the calls, as well as research on particular phenomena, such as emotions
in emergency calls (Kidwell, 2006; Svennevig, 2012; K. Tracy & Tracy, 1998; S. J.
Tracy & Tracy, 1998; J. Whalen & Zimmerman, 1998).
Chapter 3 sets up the methodological framework for this dissertation. This chapter
is organized into two main sections: methods and data, and background information
about 9-1-1 Costa Rica. First, in the methods and data section, I explain the assumptions
and goals of the conversation analytic method, describe the dataset and explain the main
conventions of the transcription system. Second, I provide background information on the
history of the emergency system in Costa Rica, the call processing, and my nonparticipant observation in the call room. I also describe the flow of information between
different emergency assistance organizations. Lastly, I describe the call-takers’ work
station and equipment, as well as the computer application in which the incident log is
created.

4
Chapter 4 explores the overall structural organization of emergency calls in the
context of the 9-1-1 Emergency System in Costa Rica. First, I provide a review of prior
research on the overall structural organization of emergency calls. Second, I analyze the
different activities that constitute calling to the emergency services: an opening sequence,
a reason for the call, an interrogative series, a response of assistance, and a closing
sequence. The analysis also reveals some distinct aspects of calls to the Costa Rican
service, particularly regarding call openings, interrogative series, and responses of
assistance.
Chapter 5 explores the activity of requesting help. First, I provide a succinct
review of research on the reason for the call to 9-1-1. Secondly, I analyze the design of
requesting turns, focusing on three main formats: explicit requests, reports, and
descriptions. Drawing on notions of entitlement and contingency of requests (Curl &
Drew, 2008) and benefactive stance and status (Clayman & Heritage, 2014), I discuss
how, in designing requests, callers display their orientations to contingencies involved in
the provision of help and entitlement to the service.
Chapter 6 explores the activity of formulating the location of the incident. First, I
review research on place formulation with emphasis on formulating place in the context
of emergency calls. Second, I describe practices used by callers when formulating the
location of the incident, namely: geographical formulations, landmark formulations, and
“other signs” formulations. I draw upon the notion of granularity (Schegloff, 2000) to
argue that these practices correspond to different levels of granularity in place
formulations. Third, I examine what constitutes an institutionally sufficient place
formulation.

5
Chapter 7 closes the dissertation. First, I review the interactional phenomena
analyzed in each chapter and summarize the findings. Lastly, I discuss the theoretical
implications of the reported findings, as well as the possible practical implications of this
research.

Chapter 2
Literature review
In what follows, I first review conversation analytic research on institutional
interaction, and then review research on emergency calls. I also provide reviews of
particular interactional phenomena in each analytic chapter.
Conversation analytic approach to institutional interaction
From a conversation analytic (CA) perspective, the institutionality of interaction
is not predetermined by the setting (e.g., whether the interaction happens in a courtroom
or a physician’s office), but rather by how participants negotiate, orient to, and
understand the interaction that is happening (Drew & Heritage, 1992a; Heritage &
Clayman, 2010). Interactions characterized as institutional are task-oriented, and one of
the participants involved presents him or herself as interacting on behalf of or as a
representative of an institution. Participants in institutional interactions share orientation
to carrying out particular institutional goals (Drew & Heritage, 1992b; Heritage &
Clayman, 2010). For instance, callers to the 9-1-1 emergency number expect to receive
assistance, and call-takers expect callers to have some sort of urgent incident; thus, their
shared knowledge of the type of activity allows them to achieve the goal of receiving and
dispatching the help.
Institutional interactions are also characterized by particular constraints on
participation (Drew & Heritage, 1992a; Heritage & Clayman, 2010). Participants are
oriented to pursuing their institution-specific goals, which are accomplished through talkin-interaction; however, how participants accomplish these goals may differ for

7
professionals and non-professionals. Institutional constraints may exist that shape the
interaction and the types and sequencing of allowable contributions, some of which may
not be known to non-professional (Drew & Heritage, 1992a; Heritage & Clayman, 2010).
For example, calling 9-1-1 to solicit information about a Nutcracker ballet show would
not constitute an allowable contribution in this particular setting.
Additionally, institutional interactions may be characterized by specialized
inferential frameworks, i.e., implicatures or inferences about the workings of institutions
that allow participants to understand each other (Drew & Heritage, 1992b; Heritage &
Clayman, 2010). In other words, the inferential frameworks relate to the institutionspecific goals and the participants understand their contributions regarding these goals.
For instance, an inferential framework of emergency services is that someone who dials
9-1-1 might be seeking help; thus, a call-taker might understand hanging up the phone as
a request for help.
When examining institutional talk, researchers may focus on the following
dimensions: the turn-taking system, overall structural organization, sequence
organization, turn design, lexical choice, and practical epistemology and social relations
(Drew & Heritage, 1992b; Heritage & Clayman, 2010). During some institutional
interactions (e.g., in courtrooms or during interviews or debates), the turn-taking system
(i.e., the distribution of turns among participants) may be constrained in various ways,
such as by: a turn-type preallocation (as in news interviews), the use of mediator (as in
formal debates), or a mix of the two (Heritage & Clayman, 2010). In other kinds of
institutions (such as those involving calls for help), turn-taking is negotiated on a turn-byturn basis, as is the case with mundane talk (Sacks, Schegloff, & Jefferson, 1974).

8
The overall structural organization refers to the sequence of activities that
comprises the interaction (Schegloff, 2007). Excluding the opening and closing
sequences of mundane talk, these conversations have a very open structural organization.
However, institutional talk is constrained by interactional activity and its component
tasks. In the case of emergency calls, the overall structural organization is constrained by
the tasks at hand (i.e., requesting help and providing assistance) and includes a prebeginning, a conversation opening, a request for help, an interrogative series, a response
to the request, and a conversation closing (M. R. Whalen & Zimmerman, 1987;
Zimmerman, 1992b).
The sequence organization refers to how the interaction is organized through
sequences of actions (e.g., adjacency pairs) and ways in which turns are coherent with
prior turns (Schegloff, 2007); for example, a turn may be understood not as responding to
the prior question, but instead as launching an insert sequence. Turn design refers to
aspects of turn composition and action formation. In institutional interaction, turn design
may be shaped by the contingencies and constrains of the specialized turn-taking system,
by the institutional goals (Schegloff, 2007), and by knowledge asymmetries (i.e.,
designing a turn for a patient vs. a medical student). Participants’ lexical choices can
show how participants evoke and orient to particular institutional identities. For example,
the use of technical terms by one participant can show his or her knowledge of the
terminology, and also serves as a way to enact his or her identity as a competent or
knowledgeable speaker (Drew & Heritage, 1992a; Heritage & Clayman, 2010; Kitzinger
& Mandelbaum, 2013).

9
Research on practical epistemology and social relations examines the
management of knowledge, entitlement, institutional asymmetries, and participants’
rights and responsibilities in relation to the institution (Drew & Heritage, 1992a; Drew &
Walker, 2010; C. W. Raymond, 2014; G. Raymond & Zimmerman, 2007; K. Tracy,
1997; Zimmerman, 1992b). For example, during a 9-1-1 call, callers may account for
how they became aware of the incident, which may serve as a way to display their
epistemic standing in relation to the incident and to justify their request (G. Raymond &
Zimmerman, 2007; Zimmerman, 1992b).
Conversation analytic research on emergency calls
Callers to 9-1-1 request medical help or assistance from the police, fire
department or other public safety services. Callers may present life-threatening incidents,
as well as other less serious incidents or “problems of marginal urgency” (Heritage &
Clayman, 2010, p. 79). Calling for help is a monotopical activity with the specific
framework of dealing with one single task at hand throughout the entire call (i.e., as
opposed to mundane calls, during which interactants may have one or more tasks to
accomplish throughout the duration of the call). During emergency call interactions,
participants negotiate the institutional requirements of call processing and the
circumstances of each call (Zimmerman, 1992). Regardless of the internal organization of
each call center and its technological characteristics (e.g., the use of a particular computer
application, its call processing protocols, the form of the dispatched package, etc.), all
call centers have the same goal of gathering the information required to assess the
incident in a timely manner (Zimmerman, 1992). This goal is achieved by completing the
following tasks (Zimmerman, 1992):

10
a) Collecting information about the problem in order to categorize what kind of
incident it is (e.g., a fire, crime, car accident, etc.) and, thus, what kind of help
that is needed.
b) Collecting information about the location of the incident; for example, if the
incident occurred in a street or intersection, and whether it occurred in a
house, apartment, or public area.
c) Collecting additional information about the incident; for example, whether a
suspect is armed or whether people were injured in a car accident.
d) Gatekeeping the provision of service by analyzing whether or not the incident
justifies sending assistance, given that it is a limited public resource.
These tasks, in turn, will help in the creation of the dispatch package, i.e., the
information collected by the call-taker to be sent to the local emergency team that will
respond to the emergency (Zimmerman, 1992b).
Telephone calls made during both mundane and institutional talk are generally
understood as interactions occurring between two parties. During emergency calls,
however, and depending on the institutional organization of the emergency center, more
than one person might be involved in answering the telephone (J. Whalen & Zimmerman,
2005). For example, call-takers and dispatchers might share the same call room and,
although call-takers are the ones who answer the call, dispatchers might have access to
the information collected during the call. In other words, the emergency center is a multiparty team involved in call management (J. Whalen & Zimmerman, 2005).
Several studies of 911 calls (M. R. Whalen & Zimmerman, 1987; Zimmerman,
1992b) have examined the overall structural organization of emergency calls, which

11
includes: a pre-beginning, an opening, a reason for the call or a request for help, an
interrogative series, a response, and a closing. Although the same phases may apply to
interactions during others service encounters, such as calling an airline to reserve a ticket
(Zimmerman, 1984), the particularity of emergency calls lies in the fact that help is being
sought and provided. For a review of prior research on each particular phase of
emergency calls, see Chapter 4 “Overall structural organization of calls to 9-1-1 Costa
Rica.” For a review of research on requests during emergency calls, see Chapter 5
“Requesting help in calls to 9-1-1 Costa Rica.” For a review of research on the
interrogative series regarding location formulations, see Chapter 6 “Formulating place in
calls to 9-1-1 Costa Rica.” In what follows, I review prior research on gatekeeping
considerations and interactional problems while managing emotions in calls to
emergency numbers.
Research on gatekeeping considerations
Call-takers are gatekeepers of the service and callers are held accountable for
requesting help (Zimmerman, 1984). Callers may provide an account of the requested
assistance. If not, call-takers solicit this type of information, as they need to assess the
worthiness of the request. Additionally, callers are accountable for requesting a public
safety service, contrary to requesting other types of service (Heritage & Clayman, 2010;
M. R. Whalen & Zimmerman, 1987). For example, whereas shopping customers are not
held accountable for buying a book, callers to a 9-1-1 service are accountable for such a
request.
When assessing the incident, call-takers follow two “gatekeeping considerations”
(Heritage & Clayman, 2010, p. 72): the genuineness and relevance of the incident. The

12
genuineness issue refers to verifying the veracity of the incident, as some callers may
make malicious reports or report situations that appear to be incidents but turn out not to
be (Heritage & Clayman, 2010); for example, someone could report a fire due to smoke
on a property, when in reality the smoke is coming from a barbeque gathering. Callers
display the genuineness of a situation by stating how they had physical access to the
scene, their social relationship to the incident, or their practical epistemology (M. R.
Whalen & Zimmerman, 1990). Callers may use chronological narratives in order to get
an extended turn to describe the incident (Zimmerman, 1992b), which allows them to
provide detailed information about the scene and how they became aware of the incident.
While describing the incident, callers may account for their entitlement to request the
service and the policeability of the situation (Meehan, 1989). However, callers may treat
the questioning during the interrogative series phase as “face-threatening” acts, as they
may feel that call-takers are challenging their problem presentation and trustworthiness
(S. J. Tracy, 2002).
The relevance issue refers to whether or not the incident pertains to an emergency
service (Heritage & Clayman, 2010). For example, calling to 9-1-1 to solicit information
about a closed road would not be relevant to the emergency service, given that in Costa
Rica, this information is directly managed by the Traffic Police. It has been found that
when callers request services that do not pertain to emergency services, they preface the
request with a “token of apology” (Heritage & Clayman, 2010, p. 78). Gatekeeping
considerations do not only apply to the provision of the service, but also to the language
used during the interaction. Another line of research (C. W. Raymond, 2014) examines
how participants negotiate the language used during calls to 9-1-1 when callers do not

13
speak English (this particular research uses Spanish as the other language). This study
shows that call-takers are not only gatekeepers of access to the emergency service, but
also of access to the language.
One line of research focuses on callers’ display of entitlement to the requested
assistance. Callers’ insufficient or null knowledge about the incident may be related to
their social relationship to the incident (M. R. Whalen & Zimmerman, 1990), which in
turn relates to gatekeeping issues. One study analyzes how claims of insufficient
knowledge or a lack of knowledge when requesting help during emergency calls via the
phrase “I don’t know” hinder the granting of assistance (Fele, 2014). When callers do not
have sufficient or any knowledge of the incident, it is difficult for them to ground the
request for help or display entitlement.
Another line of research analyzes the use of categories in emergency calls
(Berger, Kitzinger, & Ellis, 2016; Del Corona & Ostermann, 2013). For example, topics
within this line of research include how a caller uses a particular category to refer to a
person (e.g., a personal doctor) in order to resist the course of action initiated by the calltaker (Berger et al., 2016), or how the way in which the callers categorize the violators
influences the policeability of the reported incident (Del Corona & Ostermann, 2013).
Some incidents do not constitute emergencies or crimes, but rather conflicts or fights
between callers and a third person; therefore, when the caller categorizes him or herself
as the “victim” and the third person as the “offender,” they create an opposition between
themselves and the offenders that will subsequently impact the outcome of the requested
assistance (Del Corona & Ostermann, 2013).

14
Research on managing emotions in emergency calls
When a person experiences a life-threatening situation, it is expected that his or
her behavior will be affected. If that person decides to call an emergency line for help,
call-takers need to know how to handle the emotions displayed by callers during the
interaction, or how to “take control of the call” (J. Whalen & Zimmerman, 1998, p. 153).
For instance, if a caller is not able to provide a report of the incident, it will be difficult
for the call-taker to dispatch the service required. Call-takers need to gather the most
precise information possible from the caller in order to dispatch the correct service, such
as an ambulance, a police patrol or a fire truck. Sometimes, callers are so emotionally
affected by the situation that collecting this information becomes a very difficult task.
Callers may display their emotions via verbalizations and/or paralinguistic
behaviors (Heritage & Clayman, 2010); for example, they may use expressions of
surprise, such as “oh my God,” or they may even sob. By showing emotion during an
emergency call, callers may legitimize the emergency (J. Whalen & Zimmerman, 1998).
Nonetheless, emotions may hinder callers’ cooperativeness during the call, as they may
not be able to provide specific information about the incident necessary to dispatch the
assistance (J. Whalen & Zimmerman, 1998). In these cases, call-takers may take control
of the call by summoning the callers, asking them to calm down, and/or reassuring them
that the assistance is on the way.
Research shows that the display of emotion by callers is precisely placed
(Kidwell, 2006; J. Whalen & Zimmerman, 1998). However, showing uncontrolled
emotion (such as “hysteria”) might lead to misunderstandings, premature hang-ups,
problems when gathering accurate information, and, in the worst case scenario,

15
someone’s death (Drew & Heritage, 1992b; Heritage & Clayman, 2010; Kidwell, 2006; J.
Whalen & Zimmerman, 1998). During emergency calls, a person is labeled as “hysteric”
when he or she is so distressed that he or she cannot provide the necessary information (J.
Whalen & Zimmerman, 1998), particularly information needed for dispatching the
emergency service.
Additionally, callers may not be aware of the reasoning behind the call-takers’
questionnaire (Heritage & Clayman, 2010). As a result, callers may become angry and
upset during the interrogative series, which may impede the collection of crucial
information necessary in order to assess if the incident is worthy of assistance. However,
callers may also become angry during the opening of the call, as problems may arise
when requesting the help due to different frameworks (K. Tracy, 1997); for example,
someone may request medical assistance using linguistic constructions commonly used
during costumer services encounters. On the other hand, other problems may arise during
the opening of the calls when the activity of calling for help has been “contaminated”
with other activity (e.g., the infamous Dallas call in which the request for assistance
became contaminated with an argument) (J. Whalen, Zimmerman, & Whalen, 1988).
Call-takers are recipients of callers’ emotions (S. J. Tracy & Tracy, 1998), but
their responses to callers are institutional and task-oriented, rather than personal or
empathetic (Heritage & Clayman, 2010). On the other hand, call-takers may also
experience distress, sadness, anger, anxiety and/or powerlessness triggered by highly
emotional emergencies (S. J. Tracy & Tracy, 1998), such as cases of domestic violence,
when elders and/or children are injured, life or death incidents, or in-progress incidents.
Because of this, some emergency centers have guidelines for how to manage emotions.

16
Research found that call-takers manage their emotions via strategies such as giving
advice to the caller, self-talk, joking, and/or storytelling (S. J. Tracy & Tracy, 1998).
Studying emotions displayed during calls is important not only because it gives us a
better understanding of how emotions are organized during talk (J. Whalen &
Zimmerman, 1998), but also because it may have practical implications for emergency
centers (S. J. Tracy & Tracy, 1998).
Research also focuses on examining cases that failed to achieve a positive
outcome. For example, there may be misalignment problems between callers and calltakers, as examined in the “Dallas call” (J. Whalen et al., 1988). In other words,
interactants may have different opinions regarding how the interaction is unfolding
and/or different expectations of how it should unfold and, thus, engage in a dispute that
may complicate achieving the requested help. On the other hand, some problems may
arise in establishing intersubjectivity between callers and call-takers when call-takers do
not properly listen and/or display their understanding regarding the callers’ incident
(Svennevig, 2012); this may lead to “activity contamination” (Svennevig, 2012; K.
Tracy, 1997; J. Whalen et al., 1988) and a negative outcome.
Conclusions
As we can see from the conversation analytic research reviewed in this section,
some phases (or constituent activities) of emergency calls have received more attention
than others. For example, the opening sequence and interrogative series have been
studied more than the response of assistance or the closing sequence. In addition,
research on interrogative series has mainly focused on problem presentation, not on place
formulation. This dissertation aims to contribute to our knowledge of interrogative series

17
by examining activities that participants engage in during this phase other than problem
presentation, namely: place formulation and verification of callers’ information. This
dissertation also builds on prior research on the opening sequence and the response of
assistance by drawing on linguistic and institutional practices that might explain the
differences occurring in these two phases (i.e., differences existing among the findings of
prior research and those of this dissertation regarding the opening sequence and the
response of assistance). For example, by examining the opening sequence and paying
close attention to possible differences between the opening sequence of emergency calls
in the U.S. and the U.K., we learn not only about different institutional practices, but also
about cultural practices that may explain the use (or lack thereof) of greetings in the
opening sequence.
Most of the conversation analytic research – in general and specifically on 9-1-1
services – has been conducted in English-speaking countries, such as the U.S. and the
U.K. However, little research has been conducted on other varieties of English; for
instance, South African English (Penn, Koole, & Nattrass, 2016; Penn, Watermeyer, &
Nattrass, 2016; Penn, Watermeyer, Neel, & Naltrass, 2015). Nevertheless, non-English
research is growing. For example, research has been conducted in France (Fele, 2006,
2014), Italy (Paoletti, 2012a, 2012b), Brazil (Del Corona & Ostermann, 2012, 2013),
Sweden (Cromdal, Landqvist, Persson-Thunqvist, & Osvaldsson, 2012; Cromdal,
Persson-Thunqvist, & Osvaldsson, 2012), and Denmark (Larsen, 2013). However, little
conversation analytic research has been conducted in Spanish (Cashman & Raymond,
2014; C. W. Raymond, 2014, 2015, 2016a, 2016b), and this dissertation aims to
contribute to extending said research to the Spanish language.

Chapter 3
Methodology and Data
This chapter is organized as follows: first, I provide a methodological background
for Conversation Analysis; second, I describe and explain the data; and third, I provide
background information about 9-1-1 Costa Rica.
Methodological backgrounds
This study uses the methodology of Conversation Analysis (Sidnell & Stivers,
2013). As field of study, Conversation Analysis (CA) was developed in the 1960s from
the work of Harvey Sacks, Emanuel Schegloff, and Gail Jefferson (Clayman & Gill,
2004; Heritage, 1984; Heritage & Clayman, 2010; Maynard, 2013). CA is rooted in two
traditions of sociology: Goffman’s (1983) interaction order and Garfinkel’s (1967)
ethnomethodology, which examines shared methods of practical reasoning. CA marked a
shift in the research paradigm for approaching the study of social interaction (Maynard,
2013). The main goals of CA are to describe and explain methods used by people when
interacting, and to describe the underlying mechanisms that organize social interaction
(Clayman & Gill, 2004).
Four main assumptions underlie CA research. First, ordinary conversation is the
foundation of social institutions (Sacks et al., 1974), as ordinary conversation is
embedded in human interaction in all institutional domains (Schegloff, 1987). In other
words, it is through ordinary conversation that other types of social institutions are
brought to life. Second, “there is order at all points” during the interaction (Sacks, 1984,
p. 22) (i.e., the activities and practices in which people engage are stable and organized

19
because without order, people would not be able to understand each other’s behaviors).
Third, social practices are independent of participants’ characteristics (Heritage &
Clayman, 2010); that is, the analysis is inductive and data-driven, and the relevance of
context (in a varied sense of the word) must be demonstrated rather than presumed.
Fourth, participants’ turns-at-talk are contextually oriented in that they are both “contextshaped” and “context-renewing” (Heritage, 1984; Schegloff & Sacks, 1973). For
instance, if Person A offers a ride to Person B, then Person B’s response is shaped by the
prior turn and he or she will subsequently accept or reject the offer; however, Person B’s
turn will also set up a slot for the next turn and determine how it will be produced and
interpreted. Sequences are the foundation of intersubjectivity, as each contribution shows
the speaker’s understanding of the prior action and allows for a possibility for correction.
A key feature of CA is the use of naturally-occurring interaction that it is captured
by audio or video recordings (Sacks, 1984). On the one hand, the usage of naturalistic
data (i.e., not hypothetical scenarios or researcher-created data) captures the interaction as
it happens (rather than relying on participants’ reports). On the other hand, the usage of
recordings serves as a resource for analyzing and reanalyzing the data (Sacks, 1984). The
use of recordings in conjunction with transcripts adds validity to data analysis, as
someone can reanalyze the data and/or show the data to other scholars in order to discuss
the findings (Heritage, 2002; Heritage & Clayman, 2010; Peräkylä, 2004; Sidnell, 2013).
Transcripts are not considered data and are not used in place of the recordings, but they
do however make up a key analytic tool (Clayman & Gill, 2004; Hepburn & Bolden,
2013). The transcription system was created by Jefferson (1984) with the goal of showing

20
features of the produced talk (e.g., overlapping talk, volume, pitch, intonation), as well
features accompanying the produced talk (e.g., laughter, crying).
CA is an inductive qualitative method primarily grounded in data (Clayman &
Gill, 2004; Heritage, 2002) of naturally-occurring interactions, which range from
encounters in everyday contexts to institutional contexts. CA is also a cumulative
method, as it builds on previous findings (Sidnell, 2013). Its data analysis is emic
(Heritage, 2002), as its analytic claims are grounded in participants’ own understandings.
Additionally, the data analysis is always driven by responding to the omnirelevant
question “why that now?” (Schegloff, 2007; Schegloff & Sacks, 1973) that participants
ask themselves in order to produce an appropriate next action. This question addresses
three key analytic elements: the action which a turn-at-talk is accomplishing (i.e., the
“why”), the composition of the turn (i.e., the “that”), and its sequential environment (i.e.,
the “now”).
Data
In this section, I will describe the data, collection, data analysis, and the
transcription system.
Data collection
The data for this study come from audio-recorded telephone calls to the 9-1-1
Emergency System in Costa Rica. The corpus consists of 7,300 audio files, totaling 71
hours. All 9-1-1 calls are routinely recorded by the Department of Service Delivery
Process, which provided me with a random selection of calls recorded during the months
of January, February, March, April, July, and September of 2013. The duration of the
calls varies from a few seconds to several minutes. The calls represent various types of

21
incidents, such as domestic violence, car accidents, fires, alcohol abuse, shootings, and
medical assistance. For this dissertation, I examined 634 audio files; 215 of the 634 audio
files were incidents (almost 34%), and the remaining 419 audio files were either prank
calls, hung-up calls, or just the automatic recording of the institutional identification
message (comprising 66% of the analyzed audio files).
In addition to the recordings, I also conducted ethnographic work at the call
center, which included non-participant observation in the call room, as well as interviews
with staff members. I observed the call room a total of two times. One of the times, I sat
next to a call-taker for a period of two hours and observed her answering calls and using
the computer application in which incidents are registered. The other time, I sat in the
supervisors’ area, observed their work, and conducted informal interviews with two of
the supervisors regarding the difficulties encountered by call-takers. For example, the
supervisors explained to me the resources used by call-takers when locating landmarks in
geographical areas that might be unknown to the call-takers.
I also participated in an introductory training session in the use of the computer
application used to create incident logs. This application, as detailed in the next
subsection (see “The computer application” section), is crucial in registering the calls.
Additionally, it is necessary for a research to be familiar with its functioning in order to
have a better understanding of the locational information of incidents. I also conducted an
interview with the coordinator of the Delivery Service Department, during which we
discussed the flow of the information (e.g., from the caller to the local responding team),
the classification of requests for help (e.g., codes of each incident given by the
responding institutions, the level of urgency predetermined within the description of each

22
incident code), the dispatch package (e.g., the information sent, the circumstances under
which call-takers transfer the call to the local dispatch center), and the management of
calls (e.g., granted vs. non-granted assistance).
Data transcription
Following the method of Conversation Analysis (Sidnell & Stivers, 2013), calls
were transcribed using its standard conventions (Hepburn & Bolden, 2013; Jefferson,
1984) and then subsequently translated into English. Transcripts follow the Leipzig
glossing conventions (Comrie, Haspelmath, & Bickel, 2015), which include three lines:
the first line includes the transcription in its original language (i.e., Costa Rican Spanish),
the second line includes a word-by-word gloss with some grammatical information, and
the third line includes an idiomatic translation into English. Excerpt 1 (see below) shows
an example of how this three-line transcript appears.

In Excerpt 1 above, we see that the conversation analytic transcription symbols
(e.g., intonation) are marked in the first and third lines (see the comma symbol in the
transcript). In the second line, some relevant grammatical information is included, such
as verb conjugations (marked for person, number, tense, and mode). For example: “deja”
(line 15) is translated in the second line as “leave.3SG”.
The data were anonymized. All identifiable information about callers (i.e., names
and telephone number) was removed (see Excerpt 2 below). Locational information was
altered to prevent possible identification of participants’ places of residence. For
example, if the caller explains that the incident is occurring in a white house located 200
meters north from a certain landmark, the transcript will alter the distance, the cardinal
direction, and the color of the building. The landmark information remains unaltered
given that it does not reveal the speaker’s identity without the other locational
information and it is necessary for the purposes of this study (see Chapter 6 “Formulating
place in calls to 9-1-1 Costa Rica”).

In excerpt 2 above, we see that the name of the caller is not provided (line 42).
Instead, names will be recorded as “NAME” and “LAST NAME”. The transcripts only
show what type of name information was provided, i.e., whether the caller provided just
the first name or a full name with one or two last names1 (line 42). The telephone number
is represented by zeros on the transcript (line 46).
In addition, geographical names (of neighborhoods, towns, districts, counties,
provinces, etc.) have a special treatment, since Chapter six examines place formulations.
Geographical names are classified in the second line of the transcripts by type, that is,
whether the place is a neighborhood, a county, or a province, as shown in excerpt 3:

Latin American countries follow the Spanish tradition of having one first name, an

25
In excerpt 3, we see that the caller has provided the neighborhood (“Dulce
Nombre”; line 6), the district (“San Isidro”; line 7), and the county/province (“Alajuela”;
line 7). A more detailed explanation of the transcription system is provided in appendix
A, whereas appendix B describes the Leipzig Glossing Rules.
Data analysis
As mentioned above, the data for this dissertation comes from telephone
recordings to the 9-1-1 Emergency System in Costa Rica. Once the telephone recordings
of emergency calls were obtained, the data processing began with sorting out audio
recordings to determine which were real incidents and which ones were not (e.g., hangups, prank calls). After the corpus was built up (i.e., 215 “real incident” audio recordings
out of 634 audio files), the calls were meticulously transcribed using the transcription
conventions of Conversation Analysis (Hepburn & Bolden, 2013; Jefferson, 1984) (see
the above subsection). The transcription process included anonymizing the transcripts
and audio files, as well as translating the transcripts into English following the Leipzig
Glossing Rules (Comrie et al., 2015) (see the above subsection).
The data was analyzed following conversation analytic procedures (Peräkylä,
2004; Sidnell, 2013). These procedures involve identifying particular interactional
practices and examining them in detail, compiling collections of similar cases so as to
describe recurrent patterns. For example, once calls were sorted out, transcribed, and
translated, I examined the practice of requesting help. I closely looked at the turn design
of each request and, based on the different designs, compiled collections according to the
actions conveyed by each design format. Once the collections were built up, it was
possible to describe the interactional patterns of this particular activity.

26
The ethnographic interviews and non-participant observations were used as
supporting material to help in analyzing the recordings of the 9-1-1 calls. This
ethnographic material allowed for me to gain a better understanding of the organizational
processes involved in responding to 9-1-1 calls. For example, the ethnographic material
was used in the “Background information about 9-1-1 Costa Rica” (see below) in
describing the flow of information and explaining the functioning of the computer
application used by call-takers when creating incident logs.
Background information about 9-1-1 Costa Rica
“El Sistema de Emergencias 9-1-1” in Costa Rica (the 9-1-1 Emergency System,
in English) was created in 1994 with the goal of constructing a unified system to respond
to emergencies. The aim of the system is “to participate, timely and efficiently, in
emergency care for the lives, liberty, integrity, and security of the citizens or in cases of
danger to their property”2 (Act of Establishing the 9-1-1 Emergency System; Ley No.
7566 Creación del Sistema de Emergencias 9-1-1, in Spanish). Nowadays, it coordinates
the work of the Costa Rican Red Cross, Fire Department, Rural Guard, Civil Guard,
Ministry of Public Safety, National Poison Center, Judiciary Investigation Bureau,
Traffic Police, Association for the Deaf, Women’s Institute, Institute of Masculinity, and
all of the hospitals around the country.
The system is countrywide and centralizes responses to emergencies across the
country. Its headquarters – containing the administrative offices and the call center– are
located in San José, the country’s capital city. 9-1-1 Costa Rica receives all telephone
2

The original text in Spanish reads “Participar, oportuna y eficientemente, en la atención
de situaciones de emergencia para la vida, libertad, integridad y seguridad de los
ciudadanos o en casos de peligro para sus bienes” (Ley No. 7566 Creación del Sistema
de Emergencias 9-1-1).

27
calls from any geographical point in the country, and then transfers the information to the
respective local dispatcher according to the geographical point at which the emergency is
occurring. Because its purpose is to relay information to relevant dispatchers, 9-1-1 Costa
Rica neither refuses nor promises to dispatch assistance; the dispatch of assistance is
coordinated by each responding institution and is granted according to the availability of
resources and the incident’s level of priority.
9-1-1 is a network that connects all of the responding institutions. Each
responding institution has a “despacho” (“central communication office,” in English) that
contains 9-1-1’s technological equipment, but is operated by officials of the responding
institution. For instance, although there is a computer owned by 9-1-1 in the Fire
Department’s central office in the capital city, it is operated by Fire Department officials.
That computer works with the same computer application as 9-1-1 and shows all of the
incident logs in real time.
Flow of information
As mentioned above, 9-1-1 Costa Rica is a centralized system that gathers
information about incidents and transfers it to a particular responding institution (e.g., the
Fire Department, the Costa Rican Red Cross). In other words, 9-1-1 is the link between
callers and all responding teams. According to the interviews I conducted, the
information flows as follows: (1) the callers call 9-1-1; (2) the call-takers receive calls
and create an incident log using a computer application; (3) the incident log is sent
automatically to staff at a particular responder’s “central communication office” located
in the capital of each province; staff at each provincial central communication office has
a computer linked to 9-1-1’s computer application system and can view the incident log

28
in real time; and (4) the provincial central communication offices transfer information
about the incident (by internal telephone or radio) to a local (district) emergency team in
charge of dispatching the assistance. Figure 1 (below) illustrates this process.
Officials in provincial central communication offices have access to the incident
log, as they share the same computer application as call-takers, and they send information
about the incident (i.e., a dispatch package) via radio or telephone to local dispatch
centers. The dispatch package includes: (a) the location of the incident, and (b)
“información adicional” (“additional information,” in English).

As observed during my non-participant observation in the call center in the 9-1-1
headquarters, the system uses an enhanced computer system (Zimmerman, 1992) for
gathering information about the emergencies. In other words, the system retrieves the
caller’s information, which is “automatically displayed on a console in the dispatch

29
center when the call is answered” (p. 432). The information is retrieved from the
telephone subscribers’ database, and it contains the subscriber’s name, telephone number,
and address. Call-takers must verify the subscriber’s information in the database with the
information provided by the caller during the call. Call-takers verify the caller’s
information in order to distinguish between prank phone calls and calls reporting actual
incidents. Call-takers can see the telephone number of each incoming call displayed on
the screen. Even blocked and private numbers can be seen on the screen because 9-1-1
has the legal authority to unlock these numbers.
Call processing
9-1-1 Costa Rica has established call-processing procedures for call-takers to
follow, which are described in the “Guía del operador” (“Operator’s Manual,” in
English). Call-takers should: (1) select an incident code, (2) gather information about the
incident via a questionnaire, (3) create an incident log, and (4) verify callers’ information
by soliciting the caller’s full name and telephone number. Soliciting the caller’s
information is a practice that 9-1-1 implemented in order to distinguish between
inappropriate calls and actual emergencies. When asked about their personal information
(i.e., name and telephone number), callers tend to hang up if it is an inappropriate call.in
such cases, call-takers register the call as inappropriate and a report is sent to the office in
charge of processing a fine for making an inappropriate call. Fines are included in the
callers’ telephone bill.
The manual identifies three phases of the call processing, namely: the reception
phase, processing phase, and transferring phase. In the reception phase, call-takers are
instructed to open the call with “Emergencias nueve, uno, uno, ¿cuál es su emergencia?”

30
(“Nine one one emergency, what is your emergency?,” in English), if the automatic
recording is not activated. Call-takers are taught to contact the supervisor in the event of a
glitch in ALI/ANI (i.e., the telephone subscriber’s database). Call-takers are also
instructed on how to classify and treat different types of calls, including: silent calls,
interrupted calls, wrong calls, unintentional calls, multiple calls reporting the same
incident, dubious calls, inappropriate (i.e., obscene, insulting, or false alarm) calls, and
calls in foreign languages.
During the processing phase, call-takers should obtain callers’ information and
the location of the incident, as well as classify the incident. During this phase, callers are
also asked for their name and telephone number in order to verify the call. When
requesting location information, call-takers must verify the location with the information
from the telephone subscribers’ database and modify it accordingly for cellphone calls or
when the incident is happening at another location. Regarding the location of the
incident, the Operator’s Manual (March, 2015) states that the call-taker should:
confirm with the caller the selected zone before continuing processing the
incident. If the call comes from a landline and the caller is not able to provide the
exact address, help the caller by reading aloud the address shown in the
Telephone Operators’ database. If the call comes from a cellphone, the address
shown in the database may not necessarily match the real place of the incident.
For the time being, the computer application is not able to triangulate a

31
cellphone’s location. Determining the address of the incident depends on the calltaker’s ability and the information provided by the caller. (pp. 1-2)3

According to the interviews I conducted, the information about the type of
incident is based on the description of incidents that each responding institution has
created. The primary responding institution creates the “código” (“code,”in English) or
the incident identification information, which includes: (1) a code number, (2) the name
of the emergency, (3) the level of priority from 1 (high) to 4 (low), (4) a description (e.g.,
a description of the incident, as well as instructions regarding when it is mandatory to
transfer the call to the local dispatch center), (5) a questionnaire to assess the nature and
urgency of incidents, and (6) the responders (i.e., primary and secondary).
The transferring phase is the last phase identified in the manual. During this
phase, call-takers may transfer the call to third parties, such as to a dispatcher or
supervisor, or they may end the call. When transferring to third parties, call takers are
instructed regarding how to advise the caller to stay on the line, how to contact the third
party, and how to connect the caller to the third party. When ending a call, call-takers
might promise assistance, mention the call-taker’s code, and instruct the caller to hang
up.

The original text in Spanish reads “Confirme con el usuario la zona seleccionada, antes
de continuar con el trámite del incidente. Si la llamada proviene de un teléfono fijo y el
usuario no logra proporcionar una ubicación exacta, díctele la dirección que aparece en
la base de datos de los Operadores Telefónicos para tratar de ayudar al usuario. Si la
llamada proviene de un teléfono celular, no necesariamente la dirección en la base de
datos corresponde al lugar actual del incidente; por el momento, la aplicación
informática no es capaz de triangular una ubicación del celular, por lo que depende de
la habilidad del operador y de la información que aporte el usuario para precisar la
dirección del incidente.” (Operator’s Manual, 2015).

Call-takers’ work stations
During my non-participant observation, I observed the physical setting of the call
room. Call-takers’ work station (see Figure 2 below) includes one desktop computer with
two monitors, a set of headphones with a microphone, and a telephone with access to
external (eight-digit) and internal (four-digit) numbers. The monitor on the left hand side
is used to create incident logs, whereas the monitor in the right hand side has the
“herramienta facilidades” (“facilities’ tool,” in English), a calendar, and other
applications that call-takers may need.

While interviewing the supervisors, I was told that 9-1-1 Costa Rica has created a
set of strategies to deal with the problem of identifying the location of the incident (see

Chapter 6). For example, 9-1-1 created the “herramienta facilidades” (“facilities tool,” in
English) and its own database of landmarks with information about the provinces,
counties, and districts, as well as a database of highways with a breakdown of kilometers
by province, county, and district. This tool is a database that provides information about
zone codes, landmarks, citizens (e.g. identification numbers), telephone directories. This
information is retrieved from the databases of the “Instituto Costarricense de
Electricidad” (“Costa Rican Institute for Electricity,” in English; i.e., the public
telephone and electricity provider), the “Tribunal Supremo de Elecciones” (“Supreme
Electoral Tribunal,” in English), and the “Instituto Geográfico Nacional” (“National
Geographic Institute,” in English). These databases were created and are maintained by
9-1-1 call-takers, and are checked against the database of the “Instituto Geográfico
Nacional” to assign landmark codes (according to the province, country, and district).
During my non-participant observation, I saw that each work station is numbered
with signs that are placed at the center console and on the back of the chair. While
interviewing the supervisors, I was told that the number of each work station is displayed
on the supervisor’s monitor, along with other information, such as the call-takers’
identification number, name, and status (e.g., active, in a call, on a break, waiting), as
well as time spent on the current call.
IPC: The computer application
Understanding how the computer application functions is crucial, as it guides the
organization of calls (see Chapter 4), and it is also used during calls. During an
introductory training session, a staff member of 9-1-1 Costa Rica explained to me the

34
functioning of the computer application which is used to record all calls received by 9-11 Costa Rica.
Calls are classified as “llamadas” (“calls,” in English) or “emergencias”
(“emergencies,” in English). On the one hand, “llamadas” are inappropriate calls, for
which a “registro de llamada” (“call log,” in English) is created. On average, 80% of all
incoming calls fall in this category. On the other hand, “emergencies” are calls in which
some sort of help or advice is requested. For “emergencies,” an incident log is created.
An “incidente” (“incident,” in English) is an electronic document that contains
information related to the emergency. In order to distinguish between the two meanings
of “incidente” (i.e., an emergency versus an electronic document), I will refer to them as
“incident” and “incident log”, respectively. The information that call-takers record in the
incident log is subsequently seen by officials of the responding institutions, as 9-1-1 and
the responding institutions share the same computer application.
The computer application used by 9-1-1 is called “Incidente para la
contingencia” or IPC (“Incident for Contingency,” in English). This application has three
main sections into which information is entered when creating a call log or incident log.
These three main sections are: (a) “datos de la llamada” (“call information,” in English),
(b) “tipo de incidente” (“type of incident,” In English) or “tipo de llamada” (“type of
call,” in English), and (c) “información adicional” (“additional information,” in English).
A fourth section appears at the bottom of the screen, named “hilera de incidentes y
respuestas” (“incidents and responses row,” in English), which shows all of the received
calls. This particular section is used to retrieve or update a previous report, or to inform
callers about the status of assistance when callers call back a second time. The “call

35
information” is located in the upper left hand side of the screen, the “type of
incident/call” is located in the upper right hand side of the screen, the “additional
information” is located in the central part of the screen, and the “incidents and responses
row” is located at the bottom of the screen.
The “datos de la llamada” (“call information,” in English) section. This
section is divided into two subsections: information about the caller and information
about the place of the incident (see Figure 3 below). The first subsection shows the
caller’s telephone number, the call number according to the 9-1-1 counting system, the
date and time of the call, the caller’s identification number, and the caller’s name. This
information comes from the telephone subscribers’ data located in the public telephone
provider’s database.5 The telephone numbers of calls made from landlines belonging to a
public provider are shown on the screen once they are answered. However, if calls come
from numbers belonging to private providers, then 9-1-1 cannot retrieve the call’s
information.
The second subsection in the “datos de la llamada” (“call information,” in
English) section shows the information regarding the place of the incident, which is
entered into two different boxes – “zona” (“zone,” in English) and “dirección”
(“location,” in English). In the “zone” box (see Figure 3 below; marked with a red box),
call-takers are instructed to enter the five-digit geographical code that corresponds to the
identification number of the provinces, counties, and districts according to the “Instituto
Geográfico Nacional.” For example, the code 11303 codes for a specific province (e.g., 1

Until 2011, the only telephone and Internet provider in Costa Rica was the “Instituto
Costarricense de Electricidad” (“Costa Rican Institute for Electricity,” in English).
Nowadays, there are at least three private providers.

36
represents San José), county (e.g., 13 represents Tibás), and district (e.g., 03 represents
Anselmo Llorente). Once the call-taker has entered the district, the system will
automatically place the corresponding county and province. “Zone” assigns the incident
to a particular dispatch center, as the code for each district encodes the information about
the province, county, and district. Costa Rica is politically and administratively divided
into seven provinces. Each province is subsequently divided into counties, which in turn
are subdivided into districts. Additionally, each district has a code that distinguishes it
from other districts that have the same name but belong to different counties or
provinces. To avoid a possible mismatch, call-takers are instructed to enter the name or
the code of the district into the “zone” box in the computer application.

Figure 3. A screenshot of the “call information" section in the computer application IPC,
by Sistema de Emergencias 9-1-1 Costa Rica.

In the “location” box (see Figure 3 above; marked with a yellow box), call-takers
confirm or complete the location of the incident. When entering the information in the

37
“location” box, call-takers are expected to include the province, county, district,
neighborhood, landmark, cardinal direction or the phrase “hacia” ("towards,” in English)
and “señas” (“signs,” in English; for more details see Chapter 6). According to
supervisors of the call room, when the “Ministerio de Seguridad Pública” (“Ministry of
Public Security,” in English; i.e., the entity in charge of the Police Department) is the
responding institution, the color of the house must also be solicited as part of the
questionnaire. If the incident occurs in a residential development, the Police Department
does not solicit house number (since the number could be too small or it could be too
dark at night to see the number).
Also, during my interviews with supervisors, I was told that if a particular
landmark does not show up in the landmark menu of the “facilidades” tool, then calltakers create the incident log with whatever information callers provide; call-takers then
transfer the call to the local committee (i.e., local dispatcher) of the responding
institution. If the incident is classified as priority level 1 (high) and there is no clear
location, call-takers must transfer the call to the local committee (i.e., local dispatcher) of
the responding institution. If callers do not know their location, call-takers should guide
the callers and offer them two or three possible locations. For instance, call-takers may
ask the caller “¿Guadalupe de San José o Guadalupe de Cartago?” (“Guadalupe in San
José or Guadalupe in Cartago? ,” in English). In order to do this, call-takers use the
“facilities” tool located on the right hand side of their computer screen.
The “tipo de incidente / tipo de llamada” (“type of incident/call,” in English)
section. The second section of the IPC computer application is the classification of the
call into “tipo de llamada” (“type of call,” in English) or “tipo de incidente” (“type of

38
incident,” in English) section. Call-takers create a log for each incoming call regardless
of whether it is a call (e.g., wrong numbers, inappropriate calls) or an incident (e.g., a
request for an ambulance, a report of a car accident). In the upper right hand side of the
computer application, there is a “tipo de llamada” (“type of call,” in English) box that
displays a menu with default options for classifying the call as: cancelled, wrong,
inappropriate, testing system, or transfer to WEM (i.e., the “Instituto de la
Masculinidad,” or “Institute of Masculinity,” in English). Inappropriate calls are defined
as obscene calls, prank calls, or calls with sexual content; they are recorded in order to
file a fine for inappropriate use of the emergency services. Such calls are transferred to
WEM so that callers can speak to officials. WEM only provides telephonic advice (e.g.,
parental authority), as it has very limited resources and is run mainly by volunteers.
Additionally, no incident logs are created for WEM calls, given that no assistance was
dispatched. “Prueba del sistema” (“testing system,” in English) calls are made when the
telephone network is under repair or when call-takers are being trained.
If the caller reports an incident, then call-takers assign the “tipo de incidente”
(“incident type,” in English) according to the information provided by the responding
institutions. This box displays a default menu with “tipo de incidente” (“type of
incident,” in English), “descripción” (“description,” in English), and “prioridad”
(“priority,” in English). The type of incident shows the code and name of the incident, the
description briefly provides an explanation of the type of situations covered under the
particular code, and the priority shows the level of urgency. Each responding institution
assigns the information displayed in this menu.

39
The “información adicional” (“additional information,” in English) section.
In this section, call-takers record answers to the questionnaire. Once these annotations are
made, they will appear in the “información adicional” (“additional information,” in
English) section. The additional information box automatically records the day and time
of the annotation. It also contains the annotation itself (i.e., a description of what
happened), and the user (e.g., the call-taker, supervisor, or dispatcher). In this box,
dispatchers add the status of the assistance (i.e., pending, dispatched, on the way, on the
scene, controlled, finished, or canceled), as supervisors and dispatchers also have access
to the incident log. The computer application can be accessed by call-takers, supervisors,
and dispatchers. In any case, one can see the same incident log on the screen. Once the
incident log has been created, supervisors and dispatchers can modify it. For example,
dispatchers may include information about the number of the unit dispatched to the
location.
The “hileras de incidentes y respuestas” (“incidents and responses row,” in
English) section. This section is not part of the call processing, but it is also included
within the computer application. At the bottom of the screen, this section lists all of the
incident logs that have been created by all call-takers during the entire day. The
information is organized in columns according to: incident number, date and time of the
incident, caller’s telephone number, type of incident (i.e., the code number and name of
the incident), priority level (e.g., incidents coded as high priority are indicated by the
number “1” in red), zone of the incident (i.e., the province, county, district, and five-digit
zone code), and location of the incident. This section allows call-takers to retrieve a
previous incident in the event that callers call back a second time.

40
Some challenges faced by 9-1-1 Costa Rica
During the interviews, officials of 9-1-1 Costa Rica agreed that some challenges
are faced when responding to requests for assistance. Two of the main difficulties have to
do with identifying the location of incidents and with callers lacking knowledge about the
organization of the 9-1-1 service. Regarding the former, 9-1-1 officials report that callers’
locations are not always updated in their telephone subscriber information within the
database of the public provider’s database. The 9-1-1 system does not have access to the
telephone subscribers’ information within the private providers’ databases, and prepaid
telephones can be activated with minimal personal information. In these situations, calltakers cannot retrieve locational information from the database, which may impact the
provision of assistance. Furthermore, callers tend to use landmarks that no longer exist;
for instance, “del antiguo Higuerón” (“from the former higuerón tree,” in English).
Lastly, callers tend to not know the address of where they live. 9-1-1 officials report that
gathering information about incident locations is the activity that requires the most time
during the call. On its website, 9-1-1 Costa Rica advises that “it is necessary to provide a
location that is as accurate as possible of the place in which the emergency is happening,
ideally using the province, county and district, landmarks, or names of places (for
example: streets, avenues, cardinal directions, shopping malls, parks, churches, schools,
hotels, etc.), so that the assistance units can reach the place as soon as possible”.6

The original text in Spanish reads “Es necesario proporcionar una dirección lo más
exacta del sitio donde está ocurriendo la emergencia, utilizando, idealmente provincia,
cantón y distrito, puntos de referencia o nombres de lugares (por ejemplo: calles,
avenidas, puntos cardinales, centros comerciales, parques, Iglesias, escuelas, hoteles,
etc.), esto para que las unidades de ayuda puedan llegar lo antes posible.” Retrieved
from http://www.911.go.cr/como-funciona/proceso-de-la-llamada-de-emergencia/

41
The second difficulty the officials mentioned during the interviews is the lack of
understanding by callers regarding who grants the assistance. As mentioned above, 9-1-1
Costa Rica does not refuse to provide assistance, but it also does not promise it either; as
previously stated, each responding institution grants assistance according to the
availability of resources and the priority level of each incident. According to 9-1-1
officials, this situation affects 9-1-1 because callers may not be aware that 9-1-1 is a
network linking different response teams, and callers may not understand that the
responding institution either does or does not grant assistance. Hence, callers complain to
9-1-1 instead of the particular responding institutions.
The difficulties expressed by officials of 9-1-1 services in Costa Rica were made
apparent through data analysis. While it is true that formulating place is an organized
activity – as is the case with any other interactional activity, and as discussed in Chapter
6 – and that both callers and call-takers negotiate the formulation of the place of an
incident, this step seems to require some time (if compared to other location formulation
processes in which an address is used, such in the U.S. or the U.K.); this is primarily due
to its characteristics, as previously mentioned. Furthermore, as presented in Chapter 4,
call-takers’ responses to requests for assistance may be problematic for callers, as callers
understand some aspects of a response as a virtual promise to provide assistance. By
exploring how callers and call-takers deal with these and other challenges in actual
interactions, this dissertation has a potential to improve the workings of this organization
(as discussed in Chapter 7).

Chapter 4
Overall structural organization of calls to 9-1-1 Costa Rica
This chapter examines the overall structural organization of calls to 9-1-1. During
calls to emergency numbers, there are two interactional goals: callers seek help, and calltakers gather the information needed to assess the incident and dispatch the assistance.
These two activities (i.e., getting help and dispatching the assistance) are shaped by
institutional constraints of the emergency system, such as the internal organization of the
emergency system (M. R. Whalen & Zimmerman, 1987; Zimmerman, 1984, 1992b), how
the emergency system is linked to response teams, or how the computer application
organizes data collection (Del Corona & Ostermann, 2012; Larsen, 2013). This chapter
explores the overall structural organization of emergency calls to the 9-1-1 Emergency
System Costa Rica in light of its linguistic and institutional particularities.
Prior research on the overall structural organization of emergency calls has found
that these calls consist of the following activities: a pre-beginning, an opening, a reason
for the call or request for help, an interrogative series, a response, and a closing (M. R.
Whalen & Zimmerman, 1987; Zimmerman, 1992a, 1992b). These activities are
illustrated in the following example:

Response
Closing

During the opening of the call, the call-taker answers the call with a categorical
self-identification (line 1), and the caller acknowledges having reached the right service
(line 2). Once the caller has provided the reason for the call (line 4), the call-taker moves
on to the interrogative series in order to gather information about the location of the
incident (lines 6-9). Once the problem has been assessed and has been deemed worthy of
police assistance, the call-taker responds to the request for help by promising the
assistance (lines 14-15), and then moves on to terminate the exchange (lines 16-17).
In this chapter, I examine the overall structural organization of emergency calls in
the context of the 9-1-1 Emergency System in Costa Rica. Overall, my data is in line with
prior research on the overall structural organization of calls to emergency services.
However, the analysis also reveals some distinct aspects of calls to the Costa Rican
service, particularly during call openings, the interrogative series, and responses of
assistance. In the following sections, I review the literature on the overall structural
organization of emergency calls, and then examine the different activities that constitute
calling to emergency services.
Prior research on the phases of emergency calls
Research on the organization of emergency calls has mainly been conducted in
the U.S. and the U.K. (Drew & Walker, 2010; C. W. Raymond, 2014; G. Raymond &

44
Zimmerman, 2016; K. Tracy, 1997; M. R. Whalen & Zimmerman, 1987; Zimmerman,
1984, 1992a, 1992b), and has been limited to particular activities that have been
examined in more detail than other activities. For example, the opening sequence has
been the main area of study (Wakin & Zimmerman, 1999; J. Whalen et al., 1988; M. R.
Whalen & Zimmerman, 1987; Zimmerman, 1984, 1992a, 1992b), whereas other
activities (e.g., the interrogative series) have received less attention (Del Corona &
Ostermann, 2012; Paoletti, 2012b). However, recent studies conducted in other countries
have contributed to gaining a broader understanding of the constituent activities of a call
to an emergency service (Cromdal, Landqvist, et al., 2012; Cromdal, Persson-Thunqvist,
et al., 2012; Del Corona & Ostermann, 2012, 2013; Larsen, 2013; Paoletti, 2012b; Penn,
Koole, et al., 2016; Penn et al., 2015).
Research on mundane telephone calls shows that the activity of opening a call
consists of the following sequences of actions: a summons/answer, an
identification/recognition, an exchange of greetings, and an exchange of “howareyou’s”
(Schegloff, 1986). During emergency calls, the opening sequence is typically limited to a
summons (i.e., the telephone ringing), an answer (i.e., the call-taker’s response), and
acknowledgement by the caller (Wakin & Zimmerman, 1999; M. R. Whalen &
Zimmerman, 1987; Zimmerman, 1992b). A reduction of the opening sequence promotes
an early introduction of the reason for the call, which comes immediately after the
alignment of the participants’ identities has been achieved (G. Raymond & Zimmerman,
2016; Zimmerman, 1984). The short opening sequences in 911 calls show participants’
orientation to seeking help from an anonymous encounter (i.e., one that does not require
personal identification) and to the urgency of receiving assistance (M. R. Whalen &

45
Zimmerman, 1987; Zimmerman, 1984, 1992a, 1992b). During the opening of any phone
call, interactants negotiate the type of conversation in which they are engaging and who
they are in relation to each other (Schegloff, 1979). In other words, during the opening of
the calls, interactants establish whether the call is a business call, a call between friends,
or a call between family members, and they also align their identities as friends,
daughter/mother, caller/call-taker, etc. In the case of emergency service calls, the type of
call is established by the categorical self-identification of the call-taker, who is answering
the phone on behalf of the institution, as well as by the caller’s response (Zimmerman,
1984, 1992b).
One line of research focuses on how to maximize the progressivity of the
interaction during the opening of calls to emergency services. For example, a study
(Penn, Koole, et al., 2016) implemented an intervention to reduce the mean length of the
calls by reducing the opening from a three-part sequence (i.e., consisting of the
institutional identification, the operator’s personal identification, and an invitation for
callers to present the emergency) to a two-part sequence (i.e., consisting of a service
identification and the operator’s name). Another intervention (Cromdal, Landqvist, et al.,
2012) was made to ensure the progressivity of the interaction: moving from a one-part
opening (i.e., consisting only of an identification of the type of service) to a two-part
opening (i.e., consisting of an identification of the type of service and a query about the
incident). Examining reductions of the opening sequence in emergency calls is crucial
because time matters when responding to an emergency (Penn, Koole, et al., 2016; J.
Whalen et al., 1988). In other words, the length of the call may impact the provision of
assistance, and it may also be a matter of keeping call-takers available for other incoming

46
calls. The above studies focus on the machinery of the opening sequence in order to
ensure the progressivity of the interaction, but they do not focus on the linguistic or
cultural components that may intervene during the opening sequence of emergency calls.
Another line of research, however, does focus on the language used by callers during the
opening of the calls, particularly on callers’ entitlement to request the service in a
language other than English, and on how call-takers act as gatekeepers of both the
emergency service and the language (C. W. Raymond, 2014).
Research on requests for help has identified different formats in which the request
for help is designed, namely: as requests, reports, and descriptions (M. R. Whalen &
Zimmerman, 1987; Zimmerman, 1992b). Recent studies examine these formats in
relation to notions of contingency/entitlement, and benefactors/beneficiaries (Drew &
Walker, 2010; Heritage & Clayman, 2010; Larsen, 2013). For example, it was found that
the strongest claims of entitlement by callers (such as the phrase “I must”) are responded
by call-takers with dispatch-relevant information, thus treating the incident as more
urgent (Larsen, 2013). Descriptions have also been analyzed as formats that provide the
caller’s epistemic access to the incident (Larsen, 2013), and as formats that provide a
sense of verisimilitude regarding the presentation of the problem (Cromdal, Osvaldsson,
& Persson-Thunqvist, 2008). For a more in depth review of research on this phase, see
Chapter 5 “Requesting help in calls to 9-1-1 Costa Rica.”
After callers proffer the reason for the call, call-takers then proceed to the
interrogative series. During this phase, call-takers solicit additional information about the
incident through a series of questions. Specially, they aim to discover information that
would be consequential for identifying what kind of help to send and dispatch the

47
appropriate emergency response team (e.g., an ambulance, a fire unit, or a police unit).
These questions are also used by call-takers to assess the urgency of the incident and so
that they can serve as gatekeepers of the service (Zimmerman, 1992b). In other words,
call-takers assess whether the incident is worthy of the requested assistance (Meehan,
1989). Two main components of the interrogative series are the questions about the
location of the incident, and the questions about the nature of the incident or the
presentation of the problem (Zimmerman, 1984). Research on the interrogative series has
been limited to an examination of place formulations (see Chapter 6 “Formulating place
in calls to 9-1-1 Costa Rica”). Studies show that there may be a mismatch between
institutional constraints and the practices used by callers to formulate the place of the
incident. For example, the peculiar characteristics of settlements in South Africa (Penn et
al., 2015) and Brazil (Del Corona & Ostermann, 2012) make it difficult for call-takers to
match the address proffered by the caller with the address given by the computarized
system. On the other hand, call-takers in Italy prefer place formulations that do not
necessarily match the address formulated by the caller; whereas the callers first indicate
the locality, the call-takers prefer to first receive the name of the municipality (Paoletti,
2012b).
Research on the closing sequence has determined the constituent components of
closings of emergency calls (M. R. Whalen & Zimmerman, 1987; Zimmerman, 1984,
1992b). The exchange is terminated when the callers’ project of seeking help is brought
to a possible completion by call-takers (G. Raymond & Zimmerman, 2016). Another line
of research examines how callers and call-takers negotiate the closings of calls, and,

48
particularly, how participants handle a mismatch between the caller’s project completion
and the completion of the call (G. Raymond & Zimmerman, 2016).
As demonstrated in this literature review, some constituent activities have
received more attention than others (e.g., the opening sequence has been studied more
than the interrogative series or response of assistance). Although traditional literature on
emergency calls serves as the foundation for any research on this topic, new research has
also enriched our understanding of the various practices that interactants deploy (e.g.,
notions of entitlement/contingency in requests, notions of benefactor/beneficiaries roles)
in order to carry out their interactional goals and tasks. This chapter aims to contribute to
research on emergency calls by examining the linguistic and institutional practices of the
9-1-1 Emergency System in Costa Rica. In what follows, I will examine the overall
structural organization of emergency calls, namely: the opening sequence, the reason for
the call, the interrogative series, the response or promise of the assistance, and the closing
sequence.
Opening sequence
Similar to what has been found in calls to emergency services in other countries, a
reduction of the opening sequence to a summons/answer/acknowledgement sequence is
seen during the openings of 9-1-1 calls in Costa Rica. However, my dataset shows that
the opening sequence during calls to the 9-1-1 service in Costa Rica also includes an
exchange of greetings. In this subsection, I will only analyze the answer and
acknowledgement turns of the calls, given that the audio recordings in my dataset do not
include the ringing tones. In what follows, I will examine: (a) practices used by call-

49
takers when answering the call, and (b) practices used by callers during the first turn-attalk (i.e., acknowledgment tokens, and pro-forma and full greetings).
Call-takers answering the call
Call-takers answer the call with the categorical self-identification of the institution
(M. R. Whalen & Zimmerman, 1987; Zimmerman, 1984, 1992a, 1992b). My data show
that there are three ways in which this practice is accomplished: (a) via the presentation
of only call-takers’ categorical self-identification (Excerpt 3), (b) via the presentation of
only the automatic recording (AR) of the institution (Excerpt 4), and (c) via the
presentation of both (a) and (b) (Excerpt 5). Excerpts 3, 4, and 5 (below) illustrate how
call-takers answer the call.

Excerpts 3, 4, and 5 above show practices used by call-takers when answering the
call. Additionally, these excerpts demonstrate that regardless of what form of categorical
self-identification is employed (i.e., only the call-taker’s categorical self-identification,
only the automatic recording, or a combination of the two), callers treat any form as
sufficient in order to move on to the reason of the call. The automatic recording is
recorded by every call-taker and is played in the work station assigned to that particular
call-taker that day. When the automatic recording is played, it is hearable to callers as an
automated categorical self-identification; this may be the reason why call-takers also

51
produce a categorical self-identification after the automatic recording is played (i.e., in
order to make the callers aware that they are not talking to a machine). All the above
excerpts are in line with the standard patterns shown in traditional research regarding
emergency calls (M. R. Whalen & Zimmerman, 1987; Zimmerman, 1984, 1992a, 1992b).
Callers’ first turn-at-talk
After the call-takers answer the call with their categorical self-identification, it is
the callers’ turn to acknowledge that they have reached the service that they intended to
reach, or to apologize for dialing the wrong number (as shown in the Excerpt 6 below).
First, the automatic recording (AR) of the institution (line 1) is played, followed by the
categorical self-identification of the call-taker (line 2). After a gap (line 3), the caller
apologizes for dialing the wrong number (line 4), and the call-taker subsequently accepts
the apology (line 5).

Excerpt 6 above shows the caller’s apology for dialing the wrong number; this
indicates that callers are held (as well as hold themselves) accountable for calling an
emergency number (Zimmerman, 1984). This finding is in line with prior research on the
opening of emergency calls (Heritage & Clayman, 2010): when callers call an emergency
number and solicit unrelated services, they tend to preface the request with a “token of
apology.” When the caller explicitly apologizes (as seen in line 4 above), he or she
initiates a new course of action in which the apology is the first pair part of an adjacency
pair that makes a second pair part conditionally relevant (Robinson, 2004). In the case of
explicit apologies, the preferred response includes mitigation, a rejection of the offense,
or absolutions (Robinson, 2004). In Excerpt 6 above, the call-taker absolves the offense
via the phrase “No hay problema” (“No problem,” in English; line 5) after the caller’s
explicit apology.
To convey that the right service has been reached, callers may respond to the
institutional self-identification with an acknowledgement token, such as “yeah” in
English (M. R. Whalen & Zimmerman, 1987; Zimmerman, 1984, 1992a, 1992b). In my
dataset, callers routinely employ the Spanish acknowledgement token “sí” (“yes,” in
English). However, callers’ first turns may also contain greetings (e.g., “buenas,” or
“good day,” in English) and summons (i.e., “aló,” or “hello,” in English). In what
follows, I explore the use of the following practices: (a) “sí” as an acknowledgment
token, and (b) “buenas” form as a pro-forma greeting or full greeting.

53
“Sí” (“yes,” in English) as acknowledgment token. Callers may acknowledge
that they have reached the right service via the use of the Spanish token “sí” (“yes,” in
English), as in the call entitled “The guy fainted” (Excerpt 7 below). After the playing of
the automatic recording (AR) which states the institutional identification (line 1), the
caller acknowledges, via the phrase “sí” (line 2), that 9-1-1 was the service that she
intended to reach.

The caller not only acknowledges that she reached the correct service, via the

phrase “sí” (“yes,” in English; line 2), but she also confirms it by characterizing the
reason for calling as “an emergency” during the same turn (lines 2-3).
“Buenas” (“good day”). Callers may also include “buenas” (“good day,” in
English) in their first turn-at-talk. “Buenas” stands for greetings “buenos días” (“good
morning,” in English), “buenas tardes” (“good afternoon,” in English), and “buenas
noches” (“good evening” and/or “good night,” in English). It is a short version of these
greetings that can be used any time of day, evening, or night. My data show that
“buenas” is used as: (a) a pro-forma greeting, and (b) a full greeting. A pro-forma
greeting functions as an acknowledgement token (similar to “sí” or “yes,” in English) to

54
confirm that the reached service is the right one. However, when callers proffer “buenas”
as a full greeting (i.e., engaging in a greeting sequence), they invite a greeting response
from call-takers and present the incident as non-urgent. In this subsection, I will examine
these two practices.
“Buenas” (“good day,” in English) as a pro-forma greeting. The calls entitled
“Silent assault alarm” and “Something can happen” show examples of the phrase
“buenas” (“good day”) used as a pro-forma greeting functioning as an acknowledgment
token. In the “Silent assault alarm” call (Excerpt 8 below), the call is answered with a
categorical self-identification produced by the call-taker (line 1). The caller then responds
with the phrase “buenas” (“good afternoon,” in English), followed by the reason for
calling (i.e., to report a silent assault alarm; lines 2-3).

In the excerpt above, we see that the caller’s first slot is a multi-unit turn
comprised of the form “buenas” (“good morning,” in English; line 2), along with the

55
reason for calling: to report the silent assault alarm (lines 2-3). When “buenas” is
immediately followed by the reason for the call, it is considered a pro-forma greeting that
functions as an acknowledgment token. In other words, “buenas” has a similar function
as “sí,” in that they both acknowledge that the caller has reached the correct service.
“Buenas” is a pro-forma greeting, as it conveys a different action than the greeting (i.e.,
the pro-forma greeting acknowledges that the service has been reached), and the caller
immediately moves onto the reason for the call without waiting for the call-taker to
respond to the greeting. Similarly, the call-taker in this particular case does not treat
“buenas” as a greeting: she then solicits the location of the incident (line 5) rather than
returning the greeting.
The same pattern can be seen in Excerpt 9 below: the caller packages “buenas”
(“good evening,” in English) with the reason for calling (i.e., to report a car theft; lines 34), and the call-taker then responds with follow-up questions about the incident to clarify
the type of theft that has occurred (line 6).

After the automatic categorical self-identification (line 1) and a gap (line 2), the
caller packages the “buenas” form with the reason for the call (lines 3-4). The caller’s
first turn-at-talk is a multi-unit turn that comprises the “buenas” (“good evening,” in
English) form, the address term “muchacho” (“young man,” in English), and the reason
for the call (i.e., “para denunciar un robo” or “to denounce/report a theft,” in English.
“Buenas” is not responded to by the call-taker, who instead orients to the business at hand
by soliciting information about the nature of the incident (i.e., clarification of the kind of
theft being reported; line 6). By proceeding to the interrogative series, the call-taker treats
“buenas” as a pro-forma greeting and also aligns with the institutional goals of the 9-1-1.
In both Excerpts 8 and 9 above, the callers produced a “buenas” (“good
afternoon/evening,” in English) form, followed by the reason for calling. By putting these
two components in the first turn-at-talk, the callers display an orientation to the task at
hand. In both excerpts, the call-takers do not respond by greeting the callers back. By
instead responding to callers’ first turn-at-talk with the solicitation of the incident’s
location, the call-takers align with the institutional goals of an emergency service and
move on to the interrogative series, thus promoting the progressivity of the interaction. In
doing so, the call-takers show their orientations to not treating “buenas” as a full greeting,
but rather, as pro-forma greeting.
“Buenas” (“good day,” in English) as a full greeting. In only a few cases in the
current dataset do callers and call-takers engage in an exchange of greetings. In these

57
cases, the “buenas” form functions as a full greeting (i.e., engaging in a greeting
sequence) that invites greeting responses, and also functions as a summons.
The call entitled “Problem in the bar” (Excerpt 10 below) shows an example of
“buenas” used as a full greeting. After the automatic categorical self-identification (AR;
line 1), and a gap (line 2), the caller acknowledges having reached the service by
producing a full greeting followed by an address term (line 3). The caller’s greeting is
then responded to by the call-taker (line 4).

During the first turn-at-talk, the caller produces the “buenas” (“good evening,” in

English; line 3) form, followed by the “caballero¿” (literally meaning “gentleman,” but
can be translated as “sir,” in English; line 3) formal address term. This turn is produced
with a rising intonation (i.e., with an inverted question mark; line 3). This invites a

58
response by the call-taker (Stivers & Rossano, 2010), as the rising intonation is one of the
features that has been found to mobilize a response from the recipient.
The caller’s turn does get responded to with the acknowledgment token “Sí”
(“Yes,” in English; line 4), followed by the full greeting “buenas noches” (“good
evening,” in English; line 4). In this segment, the caller produces a greeting turn after the
automated recording (line 1) and a 1.0-second gap (line 2). The same sequential
environment can be seen in the call entitled “Question or report” (Excerpt 11 below): the
call is opened with the automatic recording of the institutional identification (line 1)
followed by a 1.0-second gap (line 2). The caller produces a full greeting form “Buenas
noches,” (“Good evening,” in English; line 3) with a slightly rising intonation (indicated
by the comma sign), and the call-taker subsequently responds with a full greeting (line 4).

After the automated categorical self-identification (line 1) and a gap (line 2), the
caller produces the first pair part of a greeting sequence using the phrase “Buenas

59
noches,” (“Good evening,” in English; line 3). The greeting form is delivered with a
slightly rising intonation (indicated by the comma sign) that invites a response from the
call-taker (Stivers & Rossano, 2010). The call-taker responds with the second pair part of
the greeting, followed by an address term “Buenas noches señora” (“Good evening
ma’am,” in English; line 4). By producing the second pair part of the greeting sequence,
the call-taker is treating “buenas noches” as a full greeting and not as a pro-forma
greeting. Although research has demonstrated that emergency calls show a reduction in
the opening sequence (M. R. Whalen & Zimmerman, 1987), my dataset shows that some
callers and call-takers do engage in a greeting sequence. This is in line with the research
conducted on South African emergency numbers by Penn, Koole and Natrass (2016),
who pointed that greeting sequences are present in some calls; however, they could not
provide a pattern of use. Instead, the authors account for this phenomenon in cultural
terms and in terms of the inexperience of first-time callers to an emergency service.
The two cases of “buenas” used as a full greeting (i.e., as a means to engage in a
greeting sequence) in both Excerpts 10 and 11 above share similarities in the sequential
environment. Both calls opened with the automatic self-identification recording (i.e.,
indicated by “AR”; line 1) followed by a gap of one second. The caller then produces the
full greeting with a rising intonation, which invites a response from the call-taker (Stivers
& Rossano, 2010). The call-taker then responds with a full greeting. It seems that when
callers hear an automated recording, they might be unsure as to whether they can proceed
with the call. After approximately a one-second gap – a “standard maximum silence”
(Jefferson, 1989) – the callers set out to determine whether they can proceed via initiating

60
a greeting sequence. In this sense, callers seem to employ a greeting practice as a
summons in order to ensure that they have reached a proper recipient.
In the 9-1-1 Costa Rica Operator’s Manual, call-takers are instructed as follows:
to “use terms such as sir, ma’am, gentleman. If the caller says ‘good morning, good
afternoon, or good evening/night,’ answer the greeting fully.”7 Callers tend to proffer
“buenas” as a pro-forma greeting followed by the reason for calling. In these cases,
“buenas” functions as an acknowledgment token that confirms that the caller has reached
the correct service. Callers also tend to proffer “buenas” as a full greeting after the
automatic self-identification recording and a long gap. In these cases, callers invite a
greeting response from call-takers and seem to employ the full greeting form as a practice
to check whether they can proceed with the call (i.e., as a summoning practice).
Other practices used by callers during the first turn-at-talk. When responding
to the categorical self-identification, callers employ a variety of practices, such as
acknowledging the reached service via the “sí” (“yes”) token, fully greeting the call-taker
via the phrase “buenas,” or orienting to the matter at hand via the phrase “buenas”
followed by the reason for the call. Callers may also use the phrases “disculpe” (“excuse
me” or “sorry,” in English) and “gracias” (“thank you,” in English) during their first
turn-at-talk. In the following subsection, I will describe these two practices.
“Disculpe” (“excuse me” or “sorry,” in English). Callers may respond to the
institutional identification with “disculpe” (“excuse me” or “sorry,” in English), followed
by the reason for the call. Callers use this practice when the reason for calling is

The original text in Spanish reads:“Use términos como señor, señora, caballero. Si el
usuario dice “buenos días, buenas tardes o buenas noches”, responda el saludo
completo.”
7

61
problematically aligned with the institutional practices; for example, they may use these
phrases when trying to reach a local response team rather than reporting an emergency.
This is exemplified in the calls entitled “Fever and body pain” and “Almost giving birth”
(below). In the call entitled “Fever and body pain” (Excerpt 12 below), the caller presents
the reason for calling (i.e., that she requires the telephone number for an ambulance [lines
4-5]) after the institutional identification (lines 1-2). The composition of the caller’s first
turn-at-talk contains an address term (“muchacha” or “miss,” in English), an apology
(“disculpe”; “sorry,” in English), and the reason for the call (“el número de la
ambulancia” or “the phone number for an ambulance,” in English).

After the opening of the call (lines 1-2) and the gap (line 3), the caller produces
the reason for calling. This turn is designed as an “apology-prefaced question”
(Robinson, 2004, p. 296). In other words, the apology is an action subordinate to the main
course of action (i.e., the request for the Red Cross’s telephone number; lines 4-5). When
formulated as a subordinate action (or a “token apology”), the apology is not responded
to by the recipient (Robinson, 2004). After the caller proffers the reason for calling (i.e.,
to solicit the number of the Red Cross; lines 4-5), the call-taker solicits an explicit
confirmation of whether the caller requires an ambulance (line 6). After the caller’s
confirmation (line 7) of this fact, the call-taker solicits the location of the incident (line
9).
The caller’s first turn-at-talk may suggest her unfamiliarity with 9-1-1 Costa Rica,
as she requests a telephone number and not an emergency service. 9-1-1 Costa Rica is a
centralized system that gathers information about incidents and transfers it to the
corresponding dispatch center; therefore, calling to request an ambulance is a task
considered within the services of the institution. However, what does seem to be unusual
is when a caller requests the telephone number of a responder (e.g., the Red Cross, Fire
Department). The caller in this particular call seems to mark her reason for calling as
inapposite by prefacing it with an apology token. The use of “disculpe” to preface the
reason for calling is in line with prior research (Heritage & Clayman, 2010), as callers

63
tend to use a “token of apology” when requesting services that may not be emergencyrelated.
The call entitled “Almost giving birth” (Excerpt 13 below) is another example in
which “disculpe” (line 5) prefaces the reason for calling: a woman is giving birth (lines 79), but the caller has not been able to reach the local Red Cross (lines 9-11).

After the opening of the call which states the automatic recording of the
institution (line 1) and a gap (line 2), the caller produces a pro-forma greeting. The
“buenas” form functions as an acknowledgement token that the caller has reached the
right service, shown by the fact that the caller almost immediately continues with her turn
(i.e., she overlaps with the call-taker’s turn; lines 4-5). The reason for calling (lines 7-11)
is prefaced with the “disculpe” apology token (line 5). The caller accounts for calling the
9-1-1 emergency service: she called the local Red Cross, but there was no answer (lines
9-11).
As can be seen in both Excerpts 12 and 13 above, callers use the apology
“disculpe” as a way to account for calling 9-1-1 when their reason for calling may seem
to not align with the typical services offered by an emergency system (e.g., when
requesting the responder team’s telephone number instead of requesting the service
offered by the responder team).
“Gracias” (“thank you,” in English). Callers may also respond to the
institutional identification with “gracias” (“thank you,” in English) before articulating
their reason for the call. In Excerpt 14 below, after the automatic institutional
identification (line 1) and a gap (line 2), both the caller and call-taker come in overlap

65
(lines 3-4). After another gap (line 5), the caller provides the reason for the call (lines 68) prefaced with “gracias” (line 6).

The caller’s turn begins with the phrase “thank you,” as well as with a polite and
formal address term (“miss”; line 6). The caller then proceeds to report the problem with

66
a police-relevant label (i.e., “car accident”; lines 6-7) and to request help (i.e., “send me
an officer”; lines 7-8; see Chapter 5 “Requesting help in calls to the 9-1-1 Costa Rica”).
While both the practice of apologizing and the practice of thanking during the
caller’s first turn-at-talk were found in my dataset, they seem to be uncommon. Further
research is needed in order to better understand these practices in the context of calls to
emergency numbers.
Reason for the call
After the opening of the call comes the reason for calling. In the case of
emergency calls, the reason for the call is the report of the incident, which can be in the
form of requests, reports, descriptions, or narratives (M. R. Whalen & Zimmerman, 1987;
Zimmerman, 1992b). The reason for the call will be analyzed in detail in Chapter 5
“Requesting help in calls to the 9-1-1 Costa Rica.”
Interrogative series
During the interrogative series, callers solicit information about the location of the
incident and the nature of the incident (Zimmerman, 1984, 1992b). Call-takers for 9-1-1
Costa Rica also obtain and verify callers’ information (i.e., their name and telephone
number) in addition to these two tasks. How the location of the incident is formulated is
analyzed in detail in Chapter 6 “Formulating place in calls to the 9-1-1 Costa Rica.” In
the section that follows, I will describe how callers’ contact information is verified.
Call-takers for emergency services are instructed to verify callers’ information by
soliciting their name and telephone number. However, this procedure does not apply to
every emergency center; in fact, most 9-1-1 calls in the United States are anonymous
(Zimmerman, 1992b). Nonetheless, other emergency centers in other countries require

67
the callers’ information for different purposes (Larsen, 2013). 9-1-1 Costa Rica receives a
daily average of 2,500 calls, 20% of which are emergencies and 80% of which are
classified as non-emergencies (e.g., prank phone calls, hung-up phone calls, and obscene
calls). Therefore, in order to assess whether the call is an incident or a prank, 9-1-1 Costa
Rica instructs call-takers to solicit callers’ personal information. In most cases, the
verification of the caller’s information is not problematic, as shown in the call entitled
“Crash in Escazú” (Excerpt 15 below). After confirming the cardinal directions as part of
the incident location formulation (lines 22-24; see Chapter 6 “Formulating place in calls
to 9-1-1 Costa Rica”), the call-taker solicits the caller’s name (line 25) and telephone
number (lines 28-29), and the caller responds to both questions (lines 27 and 31).

Excerpt 15 above is an example of an unproblematic verification of the caller’s
information. The call-taker solicits the caller’s name (line 25) and telephone number
(lines 28-29). Once this information has been gathered (lines 27, 31), the call-taker then
proceeds to ask questions about the nature of the incident (line 32).
However, some callers do show concern about providing their personal
information. This is especially evident when callers report incidents related to domestic
violence or drugs, as shown in the call entitled “Potato chip factory” (Excerpt 16 below).
In this call, the caller reports a domestic violence incident happening in her neighbor’s
house. Once the caller has presented the problem and formulated the location (data not
shown), the call-taker solicits the caller’s name (line 71). The caller provides her first
name only (i.e., not her full name; line 73), and after a gap (line 74), asks whether the
complaint can be filed anonymously (line 75).

In the excerpt above, it can be seen that in response to a name solicitation by the

call-taker (line 71), the caller provides only her first name (line 73). After a 1.2-second
gap (line 74), the caller solicits confirmation that the complaint can be filed anonymously
(line 75); and that uncertainty may be the reason for providing only her first name instead
of her full name (line 73). The call-taker then comes in overlap with the caller’s turn to
clarify that the information is confidential and is only used to verify the data (lines 76-77,
79, 81). Once the call-taker has explained how the caller’s information will be used, the
caller provides her full name (line 83). In doing so, the caller displays her understanding
of the institutional requirements of this particular emergency service and complies with
them. After a 1.5-second gap (line 84), the caller unpacks her concerns about providing
her personal information: “Es que como el hombre es así medio,” (“It’s just that since the
man is kind of,” in English; lines 85-86), thus implying that she is concerned about her
safety due to the man’s violent behavior.
In a few cases, call-takers account for soliciting the caller’s information. Some
callers may be reluctant to provide this information and refuse to answer these questions.
When callers do not want to provide their name, call-takers will explicitly account for
requesting that information, as shown in the call entitled “Driving lesson” (Excerpts 17a,
17b below). After soliciting details about the location of the incident (line 36), the calltaker asks for the caller’s name (lines 39-40). However, the caller dismisses the question
by saying “Ah el nombre no importa” (“Uh my name is not important,” in English;
line 42).

In light of the caller’s refusal to provide her name (line 42), the call-taker
explicitly accounts for soliciting this information by saying “Sí. Sí lo necesito para
confirmar la veracidad de su llamada” (“Yes. Yes I need it to confirm the veracity of
your call,” in English; lines 43-45). By explicitly providing grounds for the request, the
call-taker informs the caller that there is an institutional reason for soliciting that
information (i.e., by suggesting that the inquiry aligns with the institutional goals). Rather
than accepting the account, the caller continues to resist the action trajectory by
responding that she is calling on behalf of the community sports committee (line 47-48).
This grounds the caller’s initial response (i.e., that her name is not important; line 42),
since she is calling as an institutional representative rather than as an individual. The
answer is not sufficient for the call-taker, however, who again solicits the caller’s name
(line 50). In doing so, the call-taker is suggesting that calling on behalf of a committee
and not providing ones’ own name is not a sufficient response. After a 1.5-second gap
(line 51), the caller again refuses to provide her name (line 52) by proffering a multiple
saying of the “no” token. Multiples sayings have been found “to display the speaker’s

73
stance against the prior speaker’s perseverating course of action” (Stivers, 2004, p. 269).
In the case of line 52, the caller not only refuses to provide her name, but she also refuses
to engage in the phase of verifying the caller’s information (i.e., her information) that was
launched by the call-taker in line 39 (Excerpt 17a above).

As seen in this example, the refusal is not accepted by the call-taker, who explains
that the calls are confidential (line 53) and thus continues to pursue the required response
by grounding it in the institutional goals. The caller, again, refuses to answer the question
(i.e., in the first turn constructional unit or TCU “No no no.”; line 54) and dismisses the
call-taker’s explanation (i.e., in the second TCU; line 54).

75
As seen thus far, the caller resists providing her name several times (see lines 42,
47-48, 52, and 54) and the call-taker also pursues a response from the caller several times
by explaining that the information is necessary and confidential (see lines 39-40, 43-45,
50, 53). However, the caller is not aligning with the institutional goals. In light of the
caller’s resistant behavior, the call-taker solicits confirmation of the caller’s name “Doña
NOMBRE es¿” (“Miss NAME is your name¿,”in English; line 56). The call-taker is able
to do this because 9-1-1 Costa Rica is an enhanced system (Zimmerman, 1992b) in which
the computer application retrieves the caller’s information from telephone subscribers’
data located in the public carrier company’s database. In other words, the call-taker sees
the caller’s information on the computer screen, but he or she has to reconfirm that
information with the caller. It is at this point (i.e., when the call-taker explicitly solicits
confirmation of the caller’s name) that the caller responds (line 58). However, the caller’s
response is delayed (indicated by a 0.5-second gap; line 57) and minimal (line 58). Once
the caller’s name has been confirmed, the call-taker proceeds to soliciting the caller’s
telephone number (lines 60 and 63), and informs the caller that the information will be
sent to the corresponding dispatch center (lines 71-72).
As demonstrated in Excerpts 16, 17a, and 17b above, some callers resist
providing their personal information and/or explicitly raise concerns for their safety.
While, in most cases, callers voluntarily comply with call-takers’ solicitations, callers are
sometimes reluctant to give their name. In these situations, call-takers account for their
request by presenting the fact that provision of the caller’s name is an institutional
requirement. By explicitly providing grounds for soliciting callers’ information, calltakers make the workings of the institution more transparent to callers.

76
Response to the assistance
Once call-takers have assessed the incident as worthy (or unworthy) of the
requested assistance, they respond by granting (or not granting) the assistance (Heritage
& Clayman, 2010). Contrary to what has been found in other emergency calls (M. R.
Whalen & Zimmerman, 1987; Zimmerman, 1984, 1992b), my dataset shows that calltakers of 9-1-1 Costa Rica do not promise assistance. This is due to the fact that 9-1-1
Costa Rica is a unified emergency system that coordinates the work of all state-funded
public safety organizations. As discussed in Chapter 3, 9-1-1 Costa Rica gathers
information about reported incidents and automatically sends incident logs to the
appropriate dispatch center. Each dispatch center responds to the incidents depending on
the level of priority coded in the incident log and the availability of resources at the time.
Because of this institutional structure of 9-1-1 Costa Rica, the call-takers of this
emergency service cannot promise to provide help. Instead, call-takers inform callers that
the requested assistance has been processed; this can be hearable as a pre-closing move
projecting the closing of the call. The response may be comprised of three components:
(1) informing that the information was/will be sent to the dispatch center, (2) informing
that the dispatch center is in charge of granting the help, and/or (3) informing callers to
be on the alert for the response team. In the current subsection, I will describe the
responding turn, its three components, and how it is hearable as a pre-closing of the
interaction.
The information was/will be sent
Call-takers tend to respond to the request for assistance by informing callers that
the information was or will be sent to a dispatch center. In many cases, this is the only

77
indication of a response of assistance before the closing of the call, as shown in the call
entitled “Homeless man in front of my house” (Excerpt 18 below). The call-taker moves
from the interrogative series (e.g., the information provided by the caller; lines 63-64) to
the response of assistance (line 66). Lastly, the call-taker suggests that no more
information is necessary in order to assess the kind of help needed for the incident.

((end of the call))

78
Following the caller’s description of the person about whom she is calling (lines
63-64), the call-taker enters the information in the computer application (indicated by
“typing sounds;” line 65) and moves on to the response of assistance (line 66). The
composition of the response only includes one component: “Ya se pasa el informe” (“The
report is now being sent,” in English; line 66). The assistance was not promised, nor was
the incident assessed as not being worth of police assistance; however, the assistance was
suggested by informing the caller about the transfer of the information. In this sense, this
component may be ambiguous for callers to interpret.
By informing the caller about the transfer of the information, the call-taker
acknowledges that the information about the incident was processed, and orients to the
closing of the call (i.e., this component may be hearable as a pre-closing sequence). By
not promising the assistance, call-takers are orienting to the institutional constraints of 91-1 Costa Rica. Call-takers for this emergency service can collect information, but cannot
make decisions about the provision of the service. By indicating that the information was
sent to a relevant dispatch center, call-takers comply with the “Operator’s Manual”
guidelines of 9-1-1 Costa Rica. Call-takers are instructed to “Use the following phrases:
‘The information has already been transferred to the (Fire Department, Red Cross, Police,
etc.) office,” “The (Fire Department, Red Cross, Police, etc.) office already has your
information.’”8. By complying with the guidelines from the Operator’s Manual, calltakers make the tasks and duties of 9-1-1 as an emergency system transparent to callers.

8

The original text in Spanish reads: “Utilizar las siguientes frases: “La información ya
fue transferida al despacho de (Bomberos, Cruz Roja, Policía, etc.)”, “El despacho de
(Bomberos, Cruz Roja, Policía, etc.) ya tiene su información”.

79
The dispatch center is in charge of the help
Another component of the response is informing that the dispatch centers are in
charge of granting the requested service. Call-takers use expressions such as “ellos le
coordinan la unidad” (“they coordinate the unit,” in English), “ellos se encargan de
enviarle el oficial al lugar” (“they are in charge of sending the official to the place,” in
English). My dataset shows that this component typically appears along with any of the
other two components, as shown in the call entitled “Fire in a slum” (Excerpt 19 below).
After confirming the caller’s telephone number (line 101), the call-taker moves on to the
response (lines 102-104). The call-taker then informs the caller that the information was
sent to the dispatch center (i.e., to the Fire Department; lines 102-103) and that the
dispatch center is in charge of coordinating the assistance (lines 103-104).

((end of the call))
The design of the call-taker’s response consists of informing the caller that the
information was sent to the Fire Department (lines 102-103), and informing that the Fire
Department is responsible for sending the help (lines 103-104). These two components
together are hearable not only as registering that the incident log was created, but also as
a pre-closing move projecting the closing of the call. Both components move towards the
closing of the call, since they inform the caller that no more information is required.
By informing the caller that the information was sent to the dispatch center, the
call-taker acknowledges that the incident was created and processed. Furthermore, the
call-taker informs that it is not the responsibility of 9-1-1 to respond to the incident by
informing that the dispatch center is in charge of granting the help. Call-takers are thus
presenting themselves not as gatekeepers of the service, but rather as a link in the chain
of assistance. This finding is contrary to prior research on emergency calls, in which calltakers are considered gatekeepers of the service (Heritage & Clayman, 2010). On the
other hand, call-takers for the 9-1-1 Costa Rica also comply with the goals of the
institution as a service platform that unifies different kinds of emergency calls, and they
make visible the institutional workings behind the service provided.
“Estén pendientes” (“be alert,” in English)
Another component of the response is to inform the caller to be on the lookout for
the response team. My dataset shows that this component does not appear in an isolated
form, but rather in combination with any of the other two components. Although call-

81
takers are instructed not to promise the provision of assistance, they use the expressions
“esté pendiente” (“be alert,” in English) or “Ojalá haya alguien afuera/esperando”
(“Hopefully there will be someone outside/waiting,” in English) in some cases.
The expression “esté pendiente” poses particular comprehension challenges, as
Spanish is a language in which the suffix of the verb indexes the person, the number, and
the mode of the verb. In other words, Spanish speakers can omit the subject of the verb
because it is coded in the conjugation of the verb. For example, in the expression “estoy
pendiente” (“be.1SG alert”), the verb conjugation indexes the first person in the singular
form of the indicative mode. However, the expression “esté pendiente” (“be.SUB.2S/3S
alert”) could either index the second person in the singular form (i.e., “usted” which is the
formal second person singular form pronoun commonly used in Costa Rica), or the third
person in the singular form (i.e., “ella/él”), both in the subjunctive mode. As shown in the
excerpts below, the expression “esté pendiente” can be ambiguous, as it could be
hearable as informing callers to keep an eye out for the possible assistance, or it could
also be hearable as informing callers that the response team will be notified that there is
an incident to which the response team must respond.
In the call entitled “Intoxicated man” (Excerpt 20 below), the call-taker both
informs to the caller that the information was sent to the Police Department (lines 93-94)
and uses the “esté pendiente” expression (lines 94-96).

((end of the call))
The call-taker dropped the noun of the verb in the “esté pendiente” (“be alert,” in
English) expression. Nonetheless, according to the suffix of the verb, speakers can
interpret that the verb is either conjugated in the singular form of the second person, or in
singular form of the third person, both in the subjunctive mode. Drawing upon the
context of the utterance, one could infer that the “esté pendiente” expression refers to the
caller, but one could also infer that this expression refers to the Police Department
(“Fuerza Pública”; line 94).
In some instances in the current dataset, callers treat the “be alert” response as a
promise of assistance, as shown in the call entitled “Alarm activation” (Excerpts 21a, 21b
below). In this call, the alarm in the caller’s warehouse went off, and the security
company that monitors the property called their client (i.e., the caller) to let him know
about the situation (data not shown). The call-taker informs the caller that the information

83
will be sent to the Police (line 86) and then produces the “esté pendiente” expression
(lines 86-87). However, the caller treats the call-taker’s turn as a promise of assistance
“Usted cree que ellos vengan:: en, (.) >de=una vez¿<” (“Do you think that will come::
in, (.) >right=away¿<,” in English; line 89-90).

The call-taker produces the “esté pendiente” construction, but in the plural form
(line 87), which could be understood either as “ustedes” (i.e., “you,” in English, 2nd
person) or as “ellos” (i.e., “they,” in English, 3rd person), both in the plural form.
However, the caller did not present himself as a collectivity or as calling on behalf of an
organization. Both the caller and the police are nouns in the singular form; therefore, the
use of the “esté pendiente” construction in the plural form by the call-taker is puzzling.
After a 0.5-second gap (line 88), the caller inquires when exactly the police will arrive to
the place of the incident (lines 89-90). The caller’s question is designed using a noun in
the plural form of “ellos” (i.e., “they,” in English; line 89), thus referring to “they, the

84
police.” However, the caller shows his understanding of the call-taker’s “esté pendiente”
construction to be a possible promise to provide the help when he asks for clarification
(lines 89-90) This expression, as mentioned above, may be ambiguous, as the noun of the
verb tends to not be explicitly expressed. The ambiguity of this expression can be seen in
the call-taker’s response: the recycling of lines 86-87 (Excerpt 21a above) in lines 91-92
(i.e., that the information was sent and the response team is in charge of granting the
assistance; Excerpt 21b below).

((end of the call))
The call-taker responds by adding another response component: “Ya ellos tienen
el dato para que le coordinen” (“They already have the information so that they can
coordinate it,” in English; lines 91-92). Informing the caller that the local police are in
charge of sending the assistance conveys the message that the 9-1-1 service is not
responsible for dispatching the requested help. In this sense, the call-taker’s response
evades the caller’s question. After a 1.0-second gap (line 93; Excerpt 21b below), the
caller solicits clarification regarding whether to call the private security company that
monitors the caller’s warehouse (lines 94-95). After a 0.5-second gap, the call-taker
informs that it is the caller’s decision via the utterance “Como usted guste” (“Whichever
you prefer,” in English; line 97), given that the police already have the information about
the incident (lines 98-99). The caller then acknowledges this advice and thanks the calltaker (line 100). After a 0.7-second gap (line 101) in which there is no uptake from the
call-taker, the caller ends the call with the acknowledgement token “okay” (line 102).
The call entitled “Alarm activation” (Excerpts 21a, 21b above) shows that the
“esté pendiente” response may be problematic, as callers may hear it as promising the

86
requested assistance. However, as previously mentioned, call-takers of 9-1-1 Costa Rica
are instructed to not promise assistance, as the assistance is either granted or not granted
by the relevant responding team. The call entitled “Morphine” (Excerpt 22 below) is
another example in which a call-taker responds using the “esté pendiente” construction
and it is hearable as promising to provide the help.
In the call entitled “Morphine” (Excerpt 22 below), the call-taker’s response:
(a) informs the caller that the information will be sent to the Red Cross (lines 65-66),
(b) produces the “esté pendiente” construction in the plural form (lines 66-67), and
(c) advises the caller to wait outside for the unit (line 67-68).

((end of the call))
The design of the call-taker’s response in the excerpt above suggests that help will
be sent. For example, the utterance “ojalá haya alguien- esté afuera. (.) Esperando la
unidad” (“Hopefully there will be somebody- stay outside. (.) To wait for the unit,” in
English; lines 67-68) is composed of the expression “ojalá” (“hopefully,” in English),
which indexes a wish or desire. Additionally, the suggestion to the caller that someone
should go wait outside seems to indicate that, in this case, the assistance has been
promised.
As shown in this subsection, call-takers of 9-1-1 Costa Rica do not promise
assistance. Instead, they inform callers that the requested help was processed via three
components: (1) informing the caller that the information was/will be sent to the dispatch
center, (2) informing the caller that the dispatch center is in charge of granting the help,
and (3) informing caller to be alert for the assistance. These three components are not
mutually exclusive, but rather are used in various combinations.

88
Closing sequence
In the closing sequence, the call is brought to an end, given that no further
interactional business is required from either the caller or the call-taker (Heritage &
Clayman, 2010). In mundane calls, in which multiple topics may be discussed, the
closing is negotiated through a coordinated sequence of moves (i.e., pre-closings) as
participants check for other “mentionables” to be brought up (Schegloff & Sacks, 1973).
In contrast, emergency calls are monotopical (i.e., dedicated to a single task). Once that
single task is completed (i.e., once the call-taker responds to the request for help, as
discussed above), interlocutors move on to the closing sequence, which quickly leads to
the ending of the call.
Prior research on emergency calls in the U.S. (G. Raymond & Zimmerman, 2016;
M. R. Whalen & Zimmerman, 1987; Zimmerman, 1984, 1992b) has found that once calltakers have signaled the closing of the call (i.e., by responding to the request for
assistance), callers produce an expression of appreciation (e.g., the phrase “thank you”),
and call-takers respond with a terminal particle (e.g., the phrase “bye”) (G. Raymond &
Zimmerman, 2016). In my dataset, callers also thanked call-takers for the service (e.g.,
via the phrase “gracias” or “thank you,” in English), but call-takers ordinarily responded
with the phrase “con gusto” (“you’re welcome,” in English), “a la orden” (“at your
service,” in English) and/or “para servirle” (“I am here to help,” in English). In this
section, I will describe the closing of the calls.
Closing the call via the operators’ identification number
As seen in the response of assistance section (above), in the case of the calls to 91-1 Costa Rica, call-takers may project an imminent completion of the call by informing

89
callers that the incident information was/will be sent to a local dispatch center; therefore,
they convey that no further details about the incident are needed. After projecting the
closing, call-takers tend to close the call by providing their identification number, such as
in “Lo atendió el operador 000” (“Operator 000 served you,” in English).
The call entitled “Shelter runaway denunciation” (Excerpt 23 below) illustrates
how the call-taker’s identification number projects the closing of the call. The call-taker
informs the caller that the police dispatcher has already received the information about
the incident (lines 85-86), and then provides his (i.e., the call-taker’s) identification
number (lines 86-87).

((end of the call))
The response to the request for help is a multi-unit turn that informs the caller that
the information was already sent to the police dispatch center (i.e., in the first TCU; lines

90
85-86), and provides the operator’s number (i.e., in the second TCU; lines 86-87). By
providing their identification numbers, call-takers orient to the institutional goals and
constraints that shape the interaction, as well as make visible the institutional workings of
9-1-1 Costa Rica. The call-taker manual for this institution states that: “Mentioning the
operator’s number at the end of the call is optional, keeping in mind that you must
identify yourself (by providing your name) when requested by the caller”9. On the other
hand, call-takers project the closing of the call when they provide their identification
numbers, given that no further information is required from callers. It is worth
mentioning that although call-takers are not required to provide their identification
numbers, the closing of the call is projected when such information is provided.
Closing the call via “gracias” (“thank you,” in English)
Another practice for closing the call is thanking the call-taker for the service.
Callers tend to thank for the service, even though 9-1-1 does not promise to provide
assistance. The call entitled “Shelter runaway denunciation” discussed above (Excerpt
23) illustrates this practice, as well as the call entitled “Man with a machete” below. In
this call, the call-taker informs the caller that the information was sent to the dispatch
center (lines 43-44) and the call-taker provides his identification number (lines 45-46).
The caller then thanks the call-taker (line 48), and the call-taker accepts the “thank you”
(line 49).

The original Spanish text reads: “Mencionar el número de operador al finalizar la
llamada será opcional, tomando en cuenta que deberá identificarse (brindando el
nombre) en el momento que sea solicitado por el usuario” (Manual del Operador).

Additionally, my dataset shows that call-takers thank callers when call-takers see
themselves as beneficiaries and callers as the benefactors (Clayman & Heritage, 2014).
This phenomenon was only found in calls in which callers reported a fire, as shown in the
call entitled “Fire in a slum” (Excerpt 25 below). In this call, the call-taker moves from
the interrogative series (line 101) to the response of assistance (lines 102-104). After the
caller has thanked the call-taker for the services provided (line 106), the call-taker also
thanks the caller (line 107).

((end of the call))
After the call-taker informs the caller that the information was sent to the Fire
Department (lines 102-104), the caller initiates the closing by thanking the call-taker
(lines 106). This last step also serves an indication that the caller has understood the calltaker’s informing as a pre-closing sequence. The caller’s “thank you” is an expression of
gratitude and also a practice for initiating the closing of the call (Zimmerman & Wakin,
1995). The call-taker then thanks the caller and provides her identification number (line
107). By thanking the caller, the call-taker is positioning herself as a beneficiary of the
information about the fire, and sees the caller as the benefactor of the interaction by
providing the information about the fire to 9-1-1. By thanking the caller rather than

93
accepting the expression of gratitude (e.g., with “you’re welcome”), the call-taker also
seems to resist the caller’s expression of gratitude, but she does not resist the closing of
the call. It can be seen that when the call-taker provides her identification number, she is
orienting to the closing of the call.
This excerpt also exemplifies that the emergency centers are reactive in nature
(Meehan, 1989). In other words, the emergency services depend on callers’ reports to
respond to emergencies. In this call, the call-taker relies on the caller’s report in order to
transfer the information to the Fire Department, which, in turn, will be the entity
responsible for dispatching the assistance to the place of the fire.
Closing the call via the “para servirle” (“I am here to help,” in English)
constructions
Call-takers may terminate the call using “service” constructions; for example “con
gusto” (“you’re welcome,” in English), “a la orden” (“at your service,” in English), or
“para servirle” (“I am here to help,” in English). These constructions inform callers of
the immediate closing of the call, and are profferred by the call-taker after the caller’s
“thank you.”
In the call entitled “Intoxicated man” (Excerpt 26 below), the call-taker terminates
the exchange with “con mucho gusto” (“you’re very welcome,” in English). After
indicating that the information was sent to the police (lines 93-94) and advising the caller
to keep an eye out for the unit (lines 94-95), the caller thanks the call-taker (line 96).
Lastly, the call-taker accepts the thank you via the phrase “con mucho gusto” (“you’re
very welcome”; line 97).

Call-takers tend to close the calls using the phrase “con gusto” (“you’re
welcome,” in English) and its variations with intensifiers, such as “con mucho gusto”
(“you’re very welcome,” in English; Excerpt 25 above). Another closing used by calltakers is “para servirle”, as shown in the call entitled “Homeless man in front of my
house” (Excerpt 27 below; also used as excerpt 18 when examining the response of help
section). After the call-taker informs that the information will be sent to the dispatch
center (line 66), the caller acknowledges the service provided (via the phrase “okay”; line
68) and shows her appreciation for the service: “gracias muy amable” (“thank you that’s
very kind of you,” in English; line 68). The call-taker then brings the call to an end by
producing the reciprocal terminal phrase “para servirle” (“I am here to help,” in English;

95
line 70), which is responded to by the caller with the receipt token “bueno” (“okay,” in
English; line 71).

Besides closing the call with “con gusto” (“you’re welcome”) and “para servirle”

the call-taker informed that the information will be sent to the dispatch center (line 44)
and provided his identification number (line 45), the caller acknowledges the service by
thanking the call-taker (line 47) and the call-taker brings the call to an end via the “a la

((end of the call))
As shown in this call, call-takers bring the call to an end using constructions that
suggest the acceptance of the gratitude in callers’ “thank you’s,” such as “con gusto”
(“you’re welcome”), “a la orden” (“at your service”), and/or “para servirle” (“I am here
to help”). By using these constructions, call-takers are complying with the Operator’s
Manual guidelines, in which it is stated that: “The following special considerations
should be taken into account: a) Be kind and polite (yes sir, yes ma’am, you’re very
welcome, I am here to help)”.10 By using such constructions to bring the call to an end,
call-takers also make the workings of the institution more transparent to callers. In
addition, it should be notes that callers and call-takers do not tend to close the call via
“bye’s.”

The original Spanish text reads: “Se debe tomar en cuenta las siguientes
consideraciones especiales: a) Ser amable y cortés (sí señor, sí señora, con mucho gusto,

Summary of findings
In this chapter, I have examined the overall structural organization of emergency
calls to 9-1-1 Costa Rica. Although my data are in line with the prior research findings
regarding the overall structural organization of calls to emergency services (G. Raymond
& Zimmerman, 2016; M. R. Whalen & Zimmerman, 1987; Zimmerman, 1984, 1992a,
1992b), there are some linguistic, cultural, and institutional practices that distinguish 9-11 calls in Costa Rica.
During the opening sequence, callers may also use the “buenas” (“good day,” in
English) practice in the first turn-at-talk, in addition to the acknowledgment token “sí”
(”yes,” in English). The form “buenas” is a greeting that can be treated, both by callers
and call-takers, as: (a) a pro-forma greeting, when it is immediately followed by the
reason for the call; or (b) a full greeting, when it is used as a greeting by the call-taker. In
the first case, callers seem to be orienting to the matter at hand and the progressivity of
the interaction by using “buenas” together with the reason for the call (i.e., the pro-forma
greeting works as an acknowledgment token). In the second case, callers invite a
response from call-takers, as callers are checking whether to proceed with the call (i.e.,
the full greeting form functions as a summons).
During the interrogative series, call-takers gather information pertaining to the
location and nature of the incident. In calls to 9-1-1 Costa Rica, the interrogative series
also includes a verification of the caller’s information (i.e., soliciting his or her name and
telephone number). Call-takers are instructed to do so as a way to distinguish between
real incident reports and prank phone calls. Including the verification of the caller’s

98
information within the interrogative series shapes the interaction, as it makes the
workings of the institution more transparent to callers.
Ordinarily, responses to callers’ requests for assistance convey whether the
service will be granted. However, call-takers of 9-1-1 Costa Rica are instructed not to
promise assistance, as the emergency center is a service platform that simply gathers
information about incidents and transfers it to the appropriate local dispatch centers. This
is an institutional constraint that shapes the interaction and outcome of the call, given that
the assistance is granted by the dispatch center according to the priority of the incident
and the availability of resources. Instead of promising the assistance, call-takers of 9-1-1
Costa Rica respond by using three components that may be combined together: (1)
informing the caller that the information was/will be sent to the dispatch center, (2)
informing the caller that a particular dispatch center is in charge of granting the help, and
(3) suggesting for the caller to keep an eye out for the response team. The latter of these
response components is often treated by callers as a virtual promise to provide assistance.
During the closing of the call, the conversation is terminated. My dataset found
three practices for closing the call: (a) call-takers providing their identification numbers,
(b) callers and/or call-takers saying “thank you’s,” and (c) call-takers accepting the
“thank you’s” via “at your service” constructions. First, call-takers tend to inform callers
that the call is coming to an end by providing their (i.e., the call-takers’) identification
numbers. In response to the call-taker’s identification number, callers tend to thank
and/or accept the informing of the service (vs. a promise of assistance). Second, calltakers may also close the call by thanking callers for providing the information. My
dataset show that these cases only happen when callers reported a fire. By thanking

99
callers, call-takers are presenting themselves as beneficiaries of receiving the
information, and callers as benefactors of the public service. Third, call-takers may also
close the call by accepting the callers’ “thank you’s” via a service construction, such as
“con gusto” (“you’re welcome,” in English), “a la orden” (“at your service,” in English),
“para servirle” (“I am here to help,” in English).
The overall structural organization of calls to 9-1-1 Costa Rica shows the
interactional workings behind a countrywide emergency center. Through the examination
of the overall structural organization, it can be seen how institutional constraints shape
the interactions and how tasks and goals are accomplished through talk-in-interaction.

Chapter 5
Requesting help in calls to 9-1-1 Costa Rica
This chapter examines how callers give their reason for calling 9-1-1. When
requesting help, callers draw upon various practices to convey information about the
incident and the type of assistance that may be required. In this chapter, I examine three
main formats used by callers when requesting help: explicit requests, reports, and
descriptions. I analyze how callers display an orientation to the contingencies involved in
the provision of help and their entitlement to making the request. While the problem of
requesting help from an emergency service is a generic one, the interactional solutions
are culture and language specific. Therefore, in this chapter, I examine some language
and culture specific resources that callers use when designing their requests, as well as
the interactional circumstances in which particular request forms are deployed.
Prior research on requests in 9-1-1 calls and other settings
Prior research on 9-1-1 calls has found three formats used by callers to request
help: requests, reports, and descriptions (M. R. Whalen & Zimmerman, 1987;
Zimmerman, 1984, 1992b). Requests are explicit requests for a particular service (e.g., an
ambulance, a fire truck, or a police patrol car), reports use a “report” verb followed by a
policeable label that categorizes the incident (e.g., a break-in, fire, car accident), and
descriptions are extended tellings in which callers provide some information about the
incident without necessarily labeling it (e.g., by saying that a woman has just been
attacked with a machete) (M. R. Whalen & Zimmerman, 1987; Zimmerman, 1992b).
Other research has considered how descriptions are deployed by callers as a way to detail

101
their epistemic access to the incident (Larsen, 2013) and to support the veracity of the
report.
Prior research on requests across social contexts found that requesting is an action
embedded in the fabric of social life. By asking others to do something for us (e.g., to
pass the salt, borrow a car, take us to the hospital), we enlist them in our projects (Drew
& Couper-Kuhlen, 2014a). A variety of social actions can be used to enlist others, such as
directives, invitations, offers, suggestions, advice, or requests (Craven & Potter, 2010;
Drew & Couper-Kuhlen, 2014b).
When speakers get someone to do something for them, they design their actions
with an orientation to a range of issues. The design of a request displays the speaker’s
orientation to his or her entitlement to the requested action (i.e., the speaker’s rights to
ask for something) and to the contingencies involved in fulfilling the request (i.e.,
external factors beyond the requester’s control that are associated with granting the
request) (Curl & Drew, 2008). Research shows that request designs are on a continuum
from low entitlement/high contingency to high entitlement/low contingency. In English,
modal verb constructions (e.g., “Can you?”) convey speakers’ high entitlement to the
request, whereas other constructions (e.g., “I wonder if”) display less entitlement (Curl &
Drew, 2008). In terms of requesting assistance from 9-1-1 services, research shows that
this activity incorporates the notions of entitlement and contingency. For example, Curl
and Drew (2008) examined the practices of requesting help from the police and found
that almost 80% of requests were designed as reports of incidents and that less than 20%
of requests were designed as explicit requests for assistance. Larsen (2013) analyzed how
requests designs containing stronger claims of entitlement by the caller will be responded

102
to by call-takers with dispatch-relevant information (i.e., the incident is treated as being
more urgent).
The notions of benefactive stance and status have been examined in research on
requests, as requesting is an action that implies benefits for particular interactants and/or
can place some sort of imposition on other interactants (Clayman & Heritage, 2014;
Drew & Couper-Kuhlen, 2014a). For example, requesting for someone to pass the salt (a
simple practical action) is less imposing than requesting a ride or for an ambulance to be
dispatched (which constitute “high cost” actions). Requests are actions in which the
addressee is the agent of the requested action (i.e., the benefactor) and the other speaker
(i.e., the requester) is the beneficiary (Clayman & Heritage, 2014; Couper-Kuhlen, 2014).
Additionally, requests are also actions that show a congruence between the benefactive
stance and status (Clayman & Heritage, 2014). In other words, requesting is an action
that shows congruency between the intended action (i.e., the benefactive stance) and the
conditions that may affect the action being granting (i.e., the benefactive status).
Research on requesting assistance from 9-1-1 services, however, has not yet incorporated
the notions of benefactive stance and benefactive status into their analyses.
In this chapter, I will examine how callers orient to issues of entitlement,
contingency, and benefactive status in designing their requests for help. The analysis will
be organized into three main sections: explicit requests, reports of incidents, and
descriptions of incidents. The explicit requests section will analyze practices that show an
orientation to the contingencies of the requested outcome via the phrase “para ver si” (“to
see if,” in English), and practices that display an orientation to less entitlement via
“favor” and “amabilidad” (“kindness,” in English) constructions. The reports section will

103
analyze practices that present the problem as being self-evident via the verbs “reportar”
(“to report,” in English) and “denunciar” (“to denounce,” in English), and how these
practices relate to the notion of benefactors and beneficiaries. Lastly, the descriptions
section will analyze practices that present the problem as being self-evident via
policeable labels or a problem that needs to be unpacked via prospective indexicals.
Explicit requests
Traditional literature on emergency calls (M. R. Whalen & Zimmerman, 1987;
Zimmerman, 1992b) defines requests as actions that solicit emergency assistance without
specifying the nature of the problem or incident (e.g., the phrases “I need the paramedics
please?,” “Would you send the police please?,” or “Could you have the police come
out?”; Zimmerman, 1992, p. 436). As seen in these examples, the callers explicitly
request a particular service, such as the paramedics or the police. In this section, I will
analyze different request designs found in my dataset and examine how callers orient to
contingencies and entitlement. Specifically, the analysis will focus on: (a) the phrase
“para ver si” (“to see if,” in English), in which the caller orients to the contingencies
involved in receiving the requested service; and (b) “favor” and “amabilidad”
(“kindness,” in English) constructions, in which the caller orients to having low
entitlement to the requested service.
Practices orienting to contingencies involved in receiving the assistance
The data show that the linguistic construction “para ver si” (“to see if,” in
English) is commonly used in requests for help in 9-1-1 Costa Rica. This construction
poses a translation challenge because, although it is grammatically correct and
pragmatically accepted in Spanish, it does not constitute an idiomatic expression when

104
directly translated into English (i.e., “to see if,” in English). In order for it to be an
idiomatic expression in English, the words “I’m calling” must be added in order to make
the phrase “I’m calling to see if.” However, it is necessary to note that the words “I’m
calling” do not appear in the original Spanish request. On the other hand, the conditional
“si” (“if,” in English) is embedded in the grammatical composition of the Spanish phrase
“para ver si”; that is, “sí”cannot be removed because otherwise the phrase would not be
comprehensible. The conditional “if” encodes, in the grammatical construction itself, the
fact that contingencies exist in terms of receiving the requested assistance.
In a majority of cases constructed with “para ver si,” the caller explicitly requests
a particular service. For example, “para ver si me puede enviar una ambulancia aquí en
Atenas” (“[[I’m calling]] to see if you can send me an ambulance here in Atenas,” in
English), “para ver si puede mandar una patrulla aquí a La Mirta de Heredia por favor”
(“[[I’m calling]] to see if you could send a patrol car here to La Mirta of Heredia please,”
in English), or “es para ver si mandan unos bomberos a Hatillo 5” (“[[I’m calling]] to
see if you could send some firefighters to Hatillo 5,” in English). In this subsection, I will
show: (a) that the grammatical construction “para ver si” orients to the contingencies
involved in receiving the assistance, and (b) that the “favor” and “kindness” constructions
included in the caller’s turn orient to the caller’s low entitlement to the request. The data
show that callers tend to use these practices when the incidents are not life threatening,
such as for car accidents where there is only material damage or for when homeless
people are bothering clients in stores. Requests containing these practices are also used to
solicit ambulance services for non-life-threatening medical incidents, such as for
infections, problems relating to asthma, painful pregnancies, or continuous convulsions.

105
Whatever the incident, these practices are used to convey the speaker’s low entitlement to
the request, as well as the contingencies involved in receiving the assistance (i.e., the
possibility exists that the requested help may not be granted).
In the call entitled “Paint studio” (Excerpt 1 below), the caller designs her request
in a way that conveys a high contingencies involved in providing the service (Curl &
Drew, 2008). In this call, the caller requests an ambulance for her father, who is suffering
from tachycardia, is nauseous and weak, and is experiencing difficulty walking (data not
shown). After the opening of the call (lines 1-4), the caller explicitly requests help via the
phrase “Es para ver si me pueden mandar una uni- una ambulancia” (“[[I’m calling]] to
see if you can send me a uni- an ambulance,” in English”; lines 6-7) and then includes her
location in the same TCU (lines 7-8).

The request design conveys her uncertainty about receiving the assistance via the
grammaticalized phrase “para ver si” (“to see if,” in English) and the modal verb
“pueden” (“can,” in English). By requesting the help using the structure “para ver si,” the
caller orients to the possibility that the assistance might not be provided (i.e., it is a high
contingency request) and, possibly, to her low entitlement to make the request. The high
contingency orientation can be conveyed by the conditional “si” (“if,” in English), as it is
embedded in the request design. There is a different way in which the request could have
been designed, for instance, by directly asking for the service: “necesito una ambulancia”
(“I need an ambulance,” in English) or “manden una ambulancia” (“send an ambulance,”
in English). Instead, the composition of the request includes the grammaticalized phrase
“para ver si,” with the embedded conditional element, and the modal verb “pueden”
(“can,” in English). The present tense of the modal verb “pueden” (“can.2PL”) expresses
a high probability of receiving the assistance (vs. “podrían,” or “could,” in English;

107
“could.2PL”); however, by introducing the request with the conditional phrase “para ver
si,” the caller orients to the possibility that the request might not be granted. Nonetheless,
by providing the location as part of her request turn, the caller seems to convey a high
expectation that the help would be granted. In lines 10-12, the call-taker begins to record
the exact location of the incident (i.e., first by typing, and then by soliciting additional
details), thereby treating the request as a legitimate one.
The call entitled “Asthmatic man” (Excerpt 2 below) is another example of a
request for help in which the caller orients to the contingencies involved in receiving the
assistance by introducing the request with the grammaticalized construction “para ver si”
(“to see if,” in English). The caller solicits an ambulance for his neighbor, who is an
asthmatic man and is not feeling well (lines 11-12). After the opening of the call (lines 15), the caller requests the help: “E::h caballero era para ver si tal ve:z e::h, (.) podían
mandar una unidad por acá en Santa Clara, (0.3) para un señor que es asmático y
está’hí un poco fregadillo” (“U::m sir [[I was calling]] to see if may:be u::m, (.) you

This request design includes several mitigation devices that downgrade the
certainty of the requested outcome being fulfilled. For example, the past verb “era”
(“was”) and the conditional word “si” (“if,” in English) in the phrase “era para ver si”

109
indexes the caller’s doubt. In this particular excerpt, the phrase “para ver si” is prefaced
by the verb “era” (“was.3SG”) conjugated in the past tense. The use of the past tense in
the request may display the caller’s orientation to the contingencies of the outcome (i.e.,
not receiving the requested assistance). The adverb “tal vez” (“maybe,” in English) and
the modal verb “podían” (“could.2PL”) both convey an even greater uncertainty of
receiving the requested assistance. Interactionally, these devices show the caller’s
orientation to the possible contingencies involved that may lead to not receiving the help
and, in turn, show the caller’s orientations to her low entitlement to request the
assistance. The caller does not explicitly request a type of service, but he does use the
generic term “unit” (line 8), which seems to convey a sense of uncertainty about the
service required. The caller then formulates the place where the assistance is needed
using a geographical formulation (i.e., by stating “Santa Clara,” which is a district in
Costa Rica; line 9). After a pause (line 10), the caller presents the problem – that the
requested unit is for an asthmatic man who is feeling a little under the weather (lines 1112). The presentation of the problem provides a description of the patient’s current status
(i.e., of the reason that prompted the call), as opposed to the patient’s general illness. In
other words, the patient’s illness is asthma (i.e., he is “un señor asmático” or “an
asthmatic man,” in English; line 11), but the patient’s current status is that he is “un poco
fregadillo” (“a little under the weather,” in English; line 12). The patient’s current status
seems to be a weak reason for requesting the assistance, which, in turn, explains the
caller’s use of various mitigation devices in the design of the request. Furthermore, this
also relates to the caller’s low entitlement to the request. The call-taker then clarifies
what kind of “unit” the caller is requesting: “(Enton-) usted quiere el: la la unidad de la

110
Cruz Roja” (“[S-] do you want the Red Cross unit,” in English; lines 14-15). By doing so,
the caller-taker is making sure that the unit requested is a Red Cross unit.
Both Excerpts 1 and 2 illustrate a practice of requesting help in which the
composition of the request shows the callers’ acknowledgment of the contingencies
involved in the granting of such assistance by the emergency team, as well as their
acknowledgement of their low entitlement to request the assistance. These excerpts
showed that the basic request form “para ver si” (“to see if,” in English) can be modified
to further downgrade the caller’s certainty about receiving the requested service.
Additionally, there are a few cases in which the request for help conveys an orientation to
even lower entitlement via “favor” and “amabilidad” (“kindness,” in English)
constructions; these practices are precisely what I will examine in the next subsection.
Practices orienting to low entitlement
Callers may formulate their requests as someone doing a favor for them by
implementing the “favor” construction along with the conditional phrase “para ver si”
(“to see if,” in English), as seen in the phrase “me puede hacer el favor de” (“can you do
me the favor of,” in English). In such cases, the request appears to be designed to
acknowledge the caller’s low entitlement to the assistance by soliciting the help as “a
favor.” The “para ver si” phrase in conjunction with the “favor” construction tends to be
used for non-life-threatening incidents, such as for medical cases of hypertension or
asthma, police cases of assault with no physical harm to the victim, or car accidents with
only material damages. In my dataset, both the “favor” and the “amabilidad”
(“kindness,” in English) constructions were used by callers who called on behalf of the
victims. In these cases, the callers presented themselves as benefactors (Clayman &

111
Heritage, 2014) of the help. In this subsection, I will show how callers orient to their low
entitlement via: (a) the “favor” construction, and (b) the “amabilidad” construction.
The “favor” construction
The “favor” construction is one practice that callers use to request help and is one
that orients to both to the contingencies involved in the granting of the requested help and
to the caller’s low entitlement to the request. This practice seems to be used when
requesting medical services for non-life-threatening incidents in which callers call on
behalf of the patient. Callers tend to use this practice in second calls to the emergency
service, after having not received assistance from their first call. In this subsection, I will
show that callers’ use of the “favor” construction functions to pursue a response from the
emergency service after a prior lack of response.
The call entitled “Papaya colored house” (Excerpts 3a, 3b below) is one such
case. The caller requests the ambulance for her mother, who suffers from high blood
pressure and chronic asthma (data not shown). After the opening of the call (lines 1-3;
Excerpt 3a below), the caller requests help via the phrase: “=Para ver si usted me puede
hacer el favor de mandarme una ambula:ncia?” (“[[I’m calling]] to see if you can do me
the favor of sending an ambulance to me?” in English; lines 3-5), and the call-taker then
verifies the caller’s information (line 7).

The requested assistance is presented as “a favor,” which shows the caller’s
orientation to low entitlement to the request and the high contingencies involved in
receiving the assistance. The contingencies are displayed via the modal verb “me puede”
(“can you [[to me]],” in English; line 4), as well as via the phrase “el favor” (“the favor,”
in English; line 4). Designing the request as a favor presents the caller as the recipient of
the favor/help (i.e., as the beneficiary), and the call-taker as the benefactor.
The call-taker then moves on to the interrogative series, which in 9-1-1 Costa
Rica includes a verification of the caller’s information (i.e., her full name and telephone
number; line 7). Next, the call-taker solicits the location of the incident (data not shown),
and proceeds to determine what the incident is (line 52; Excerpt 3b below). In her
response, the caller presents the problem: “mi mamá está enferma desde el día de ayer”
(“my mom has been sick since yesterday,” in English; lines 53-54). After a micropause
(line 55), the caller accounts for her call to 9-1-1: “Ayer [se hizo un llama]do a la==Cruz
Roja pero no llegó” (“Yesterday [a call was mad]e to the==Red Cross but they didn't

The caller had called the Red Cross the day before, but they did not dispatch an
ambulance (lines 56 and 58; Excerpt 3b above). The excerpt above shows the context in
which the “favor” construction was found in my dataset (i.e., after a lack of response
from the emergency services). In other words, the caller is pursuing a response after a
prior failed attempt at receiving the help. By using the “favor” construction, the caller is
acknowledging the possibility of also not receiving the assistance in the second call.

114
However, more research is needed, as there were only a few instances of the “favor”
construction in my dataset.
The “amabilidad” (“kindness,” in English) construction
The “amabilidad” (“kindness,” in English) construction is another practice that
callers use to request help. Furthermore, it displays orientations to both the contingencies
involved in granting the requested help and to the caller’s low entitlement to the request.
This construction includes phrases such as “sería tan amable” or “si tuviera la
amabilidad” (both translated as “would you be so kind,” in English). This practice seems
to be used for non-life-threatening incidents (e.g., an assault or a car accident, both
without physical harm) in which callers present themselves as the benefactors, given that
they are calling on behalf of the victims. In this subsection, I will show that by using the
“amabilidad” construction, callers pursue a response after a prior lack of response.
The call entitled “Her blood sugar dropped” (Excerpt 4 below) is an example of a
request for help using the “amabilidad” (“kindness,” in English) construction. In this call,
a husband requests an ambulance for his wife, whose blood sugar has dropped (data not
shown). After the opening of the call (lines 1-4), the caller requests an ambulance using
the “amabilidad” construction: “sería tan amable de mandarme una: ambulancia aquí”
(“would you be so kind and send an: ambulance here”; lines 5-6). The caller also includes
the location of the incident (lines 6-7) in the same turn, and the call-taker initiates repair
to clarify the location of the incident (line 9).

The composition of the request (lines 5-7) includes the modal verb “sería”
(“would-be.2SG”), the intensifier “tan” (“so,” in English), and the positive assessment
“amable” (“kind,” in English). These three devices together all characterize the call-taker
as the benefactor of the help (i.e., as a kind person who controls the help), given that if
the call-taker “were not kind enough,” he would not dispatch the requested help to the
caller.
As seen in this section, request formats are explicit requests for help in which
callers solicit a particular type of emergency service. My dataset found two practices used

116
in explicit requests for help: (a) practices orienting to the contingencies involved in
receiving the assistance via the grammaticalized form “para ver si” (“to see if,” in
English), and (b) practices orienting to low entitlement to the requested help via the
“favor” and the “amabilidad” (“kindness,” in English) constructions. The findings show
that both practices use mitigation devices (e.g., conditionals, modal verbs, and the “do me
a favor/be kind” construction) that suggest that the incident is less urgent or less lifethreatening.
Report forms
Reports use a “report” frame to identify the incident and the nature of the problem
with a clear police-relevant category, such as, as an accident or a break in; for example,
the phrase “I want to report a real bad accident” (Zimmerman, 1992, p. 437) would
constitute a report. During my non-participant observation of the 9-1-1 call center, I
observed that incidents are classified according to the type of incident; for instance, as a
“fuego” (“fire,” in English), “fuga” (“runaway,” in English) or “disputa familiar”
(“family ,” in English). Therefore, by including a police-relevant category in their report,
callers present the incident as being self-evidently policeable. By designing their request
for help as a report, callers orient to low contingencies of the desired outcome, given that
providing an incident category category may facilitate placing the incident into a
predetermined category. When using a report frame, callers may be reporting an incident
on behalf of the victim (i.e., as a third party; Zimmerman, 1992b). In such cases, callers
present themselves as the benefactors of the interaction (Clayman & Heritage, 2014) and
as “Good Samaritans” for informing the emergency services about the incident. However,
callers may also call on behalf of themselves to report an incident.

117
My dataset shows that two verbs are used for reporting: “reportar” (“to report,” in
English) and “denunciar” (“to denounce,” in English). The verb “reportar” is broader in
a semantic sense and may refer to reporting any incident, whereas “denunciar” implies
communicating a wrongdoing. Interactionally, however, there does not seem to be a clear
difference in terms of how these two verbs are used, as shown in this section. When using
either “reportar” or “denunciar,” callers may be presenting themselves as “Good
Samaritans” in letting the emergency services know about the incident and providing
information for others/third parties; on the other hand, they may be calling on behalf of
an institution. In this section, I will show how callers orient to self-evident incidents via:
(a) the “reportar” (“to report,” in English) frame and (b) the “denunciar” (“to denounce,”
in English) frame.
Using the verb “reportar” (“to report,” in English)
In Spanish, the verb “reportar” (“to report,” in English) means “to transmit, to
communicate, to inform.”11 This meaning is also shared with the verb “denunciar” (“to
denounce,” in English). In this subsection, I will show how reports that use the verb
“reportar” followed by a policeable label are built up as being self-evident incidents.
The call entitled “Forest fire in Heredia” (Excerpt 5 below) is an example of how
callers design their requests for help using the “reportar” verb. In this call, the automatic
recording (“AR”) opens the call (line 1) and the caller reports a forest fire (lines 2-3). The
call-taker then solicits the location of the incident (line 5).

11

The original text in Spanish reads “Transmitir, comunicar, dar noticia.” (RAE, 2014b).

The caller’s first turn-at-talk is a multi-unit turn that includes an acknowledgment
token (line 2), a pro-forma greeting (line 2), a report frame (line 2), and the incident (line
3). As discussed in Chapter 4 “Overall structural organization of calls to 9-1-1 Costa
Rica,” callers may acknowledge having reached the correct service and/or proffer a
greeting form during the first turn-at-talk. In the case of Excerpt 5 (above), the caller
proffers both components: the acknowledgment token “Sí” (“Yes,” in English; line 2) and
the “buenas” greeting form (“good afternoon,” in English; line 2). The “buenas” form is a
pro-forma greeting that does not initiate a greeting sequence, but instead shows the
caller’s orientation to proceeding to the reason for the call. Following the pro-forma
greeting, the caller formulates the reason for the call: “para reportar un incendio
foresta::l¿” (“[[I’m calling]] to report a forest fi::re¿” in English; lines 2-3). The request
is designed using a report frame followed by a police-relevant category (i.e., “incendio
foresta::l” or “forest fi::re,” in English; line 3).

119
The relation of the caller to the incident (M. R. Whalen & Zimmerman, 1990) is
unclear. The only evidence provided by the caller appears later in the call, when he
informs that “no se puede respirar” (“it is hard to breathe,” in English; data not shown).
This shows some sort of access to the incident (i.e., the caller is close enough the fire to
experience its negative effects).
The call entitled “Reporting a runaway from a shelter” (Excerpt 6 below) is
another example of requesting the help via the verb “reportar” (“to report,” in English).
After the opening of the call (lines 1-5), the caller reports that two teenagers have run
away from the shelter (lines 5-6 and lines 9-10). The call-taker then solicits further
information about the shelter (lines 11-12).

The composition of the request for help is comprised of a report frame that uses
the verb “reportar” (“to report,” in English; line 6), followed by the categorization of the
incident with the label “fuga” (“runaway,” in English; line 9). By using a policeable
label, the caller presents the incident as being self-evidently policeable, and thus
strengthens the case by providing a concise category that may be an identifiable incident
code. This report shows the caller’s practical epistemology (M. R. Whalen &
Zimmerman, 1990), as it details the information about the incident: the people involved
(“dos chicos” or “two boys,”; line 9) and the place of the incident: “del albergue La
Torre, en Guadalupe” (“from the La Torre shelter, in Guadalupe,” in English; lines 9-10).
It is possible that the caller is a staff member of the shelter, as she indexes her location as
being within the shelter itself by using the deictic “acá” (“here,” in English; line 9). After
the caller has reported the runaway, the call-taker solicits clarification regarding what

121
kind of shelter it is: “es el albergue del PANI12?” (“is it the PANI shelter?” in English;
lines 11-12). In doing so, the call-taker is treating the incident as being worthy of police
assistance.
As seen in this subsection, the verb “reportar” is used to communicate an
incident, followed by a police-relevant category; therefore, the policeability of the
incident is evident and not questionable. Callers reporting incidents via the “reportar”
verb may be presenting themselves either as “Good Samaritans” (e.g., the caller reporting
a forest fire; Excerpt 5), or as calling on behalf of an institution (e.g., the caller reporting
the runaway; Excerpt 6). In the case of callers calling on behalf of an institution, the
report frame seems to be related to their status as institutional representatives.
Using the verb “denunciar” (“to denounce,” in English)
In Spanish, the verb “denunciar” (“to denounce,” in English) shares its meaning
with “reportar” (“to report”) in the sense that both verbs communicate news. However,
“denunciar” also has the connotation of communicating a wrongdoing to the respective
authorities: “to report or inform the judicial or administrative authorities of an illegal act
or an abnormal event,”13 in English (RAE, 2014a). Nonetheless, there seems to be no
difference in how these two verbs, “reportar” and “denunciar,” are used in this context.
In this section, I will show how reports of incidents that use the “denunciar” verb
followed by a policeable label are built up as being self-evident incidents.

12

PANI stands for “Patronato Nacional de la Infancia,” which is the National Child
Welfare Agency in Costa Rica. Therefore, a PANI shelter is a state-funded shelter run by
this agency.
13
The original text in Spanish reads “dar a la autoridad judicial o administrativa parte o
noticia de una actuación ilícita o de un suceso irregular” (RAE, 2014a).

122
The call entitled “Shelter runaway denunciation” (Excerpt 7 below) is an example
of designing the request for help via the verb “denunciar” (“to denounce,” in English). In
this call, the caller seems to work in a state-funded children/youth shelter, and calls to
inform about a teenager who has run away from the shelter. After the opening of the call
(lines 1-3), the caller presents the reason for calling: “Para denunciar una fuga¿ (0.3) Del
albergue NAME¿” (“[[I’m calling]] to report a runaway¿ (0.3) From the NAME shelter¿”
in English; lines 5-7). The call-taker then solicits the location of the shelter (line 9).

123
In this call, the call-taker treats the problem as being policeable by soliciting the
location of the shelter (line 9). By providing the label of “fuga” (“runaway,” in English;
line 5) for the incident, the caller presents the problem as being self-evidently policeable.
In both Excerpts 6 and 7, the callers report the runaway of teenagers from state-funded
shelters, and they also provide the name of the shelters with some indication of their
location. However, the verbs used in each case are different (i.e., “reportar” and
“denunciar,” respectively). Excerpts 6 and 7 show that the two verbs are used in similar
circumstances, suggesting that there might not be a difference in how they are deployed
in this setting.
The call entitled “Car theft” (Excerpt 8 below) is another example of a request for
help designed with the verb “denunciar” (“to denounce,” in English). After the opening
of the call (lines 1-3), the caller presents the reason for calling: “es para denunciar un
robo¿” (“[[I’m calling]] to denounce a theft¿” in English; lines 3-4). The only
information provided in the reason for the call is theft, which is a broad category, given
that it can include the theft of small items (such as a wallet or a book) or of bigger items
(such as luggage or a car). In response, the call-taker initiates repair to specify what kind
of theft it is by soliciting “Un robo a¿” (“A theft of¿” in English; line 6), and specifies
the place of the incident: “Adónde¿” (“Where¿” in English; line 6). Once the incident has
been clarified (lines 9-15), the call-taker solicits the location of the incident (line 17).

The caller’s response “a un carro” (“of a car,” in English; line 7) is still unclear to
the call-taker, who initiates repair again: “fue robo del carro o fue robo dentro del
carro¿” (“was it a theft of a car or was it a theft inside the car¿” in English; lines 9-11).
The caller clarifies that it was a “robo del carro” (“theft of the car,” in English; line 14),
and then displays how she learned about the theft, or practical her epistemology (M. R.
Whalen & Zimmerman, 1990): because they are “aquí afuera” (“here outside,” in
English; line 14) and “nos lo acaban de robar” (“it was just stolen from us,” in English;
line 15). By repairing (lines 6, 9-11), the call-taker is narrowing down the possible
meanings of the word “robo” (“theft,” in English), but he may also be sorting out what
code should be assigned to the incident according to the type of reported problem (i.e.,
because different kinds of thefts are assigned different codes and priority levels).
The composition of the turn in lines 14-15 sheds some light on the time of the
incident and the caller’s perception of her agency regarding the incident. The utterance
“Estamos aquí afuera” (“We are here outside,” in English; line 14) implies that the caller
is not by herself (i.e., she uses the first person plural form of the verb conjugation) and
that the car was somewhere outside in the street (e.g., the car was not in the caller’s
garage or in a parking garage). The formulation of how the car was stolen via the
utterance “se- nos lo acaban de robar” (“it was just stolen from us,” in English; line 15)
shows an abandoned “se-,” which possibly indicates “se lo robaron” (“it was stolen,” in
English). In Spanish, “se lo robaron” is a passive grammatical construction that removes
the subject from the action taking place. In this particular instance, this passive

126
construction also removes any attachment of the caller to the car. The reformulation of
the possible abandoned turn into “nos lo acaban de robar¿” (“it was just stolen from us¿”
in English; line 15) indicates that the person does have some attachment to the object.
That attachment is seen in the reflexive pronoun “nos” (“us,” in English); that is, the car
was stolen “from us,” which implies the caller’s attachment to the car. Additionally, the
use of the phrase “acaban de” (“just,” in English) indicates the time of the incident; it did
not happen yesterday or five hours ago, but it just happened shortly before the caller
made the call. The call-taker’s response to the caller’s clarification of the type of theft
(line 17) is made up of three TCUs: (1) the acknowledgement of the stolen object via the
phrase “Al carro” (“To the car,” in English), (2) the acknowledgement of the incident
(i.e., via the phrase “okay”), and (3) the solicitation of the place of the incident: “adónde
sería eso¿” (“where would that be¿” in English). By soliciting the place of the incident,
the call-taker closes the presentation of the problem and moves on to the interrogative
series. In doing so, the call-taker is also therefore treating the incident as policeable.
As shown in this section, the report format deploys a report frame in which
callers label the incident using a policeable category. My dataset shows two verbs used in
the reports of incidents: (a) the verb “reportar” (“to report,” in English), and (b) the verb
“denunciar” (“to denounce,” in English). Although there is a semantic difference
between the verbs, there seems to be no particular interactional difference (i.e., both
verbs communicate information about an incident to the authorities). The findings show
that requests for help designed as reports of policeable incidents present the incidents as
being self-evident (i.e., the provision of appropriate assistance is not in question).

127
Furthermore, callers who are not directly involved in the incident (e.g., but rather, as
victims) tend to design the request for help using a report frame.
Descriptions
Descriptions are declarative statements that provide some sort of information
about the incident. For example, “In thuh YWCA parking lot there uh bunchuh teenagers
right now vandalizing my ca:r,” (Zimmerman, 1992, p. 438). As seen in this example,
descriptions are not prefaced with any type of frame, as it is the case with explicit
requests (i.e., “para ver si”, “[[I’m calling]] to see if,” in English) or reports (i.e., “[[I’m
calling]] to report/denounce”). Commonly, descriptions are multi-unit turns in which
callers describe the incident to call-takers. In the descriptions, callers do not explicitly
request a type of service. However, descriptions are understood as requests for help in
this institutional context (Drew & Walker, 2010; M. R. Whalen & Zimmerman, 1987).
My dataset shows two practices that callers use when describing the incident: (a)
descriptions that include a police-relevant category and thereby display the caller’s
orientation to low contingencies involved in receiving assistance, and (b) descriptions
that use prospective indexicals that project an extended telling about the incident and
thereby display the caller’s orientation to high contingencies of receiving the requested
outcome. In this section, I will examine the two aforementioned practices and also show
how descriptions of incidents are treated by call-takers as requests for help.
Describing self- evident incidents (using policeable labels)
Description of self-evident incidents using a policeable label is a practice for
requesting help in which callers orient to low contingencies of receiving the assistance. In
these descriptions, callers not only provide some information about the incident, but they

128
also name the incident with a policeable label (e.g., a fire, an accident, or a gunshot).
These descriptions do not request a particular type of assistance and are commonly
delivered in a single TCU. In this subsection, I will show that descriptions using a
policeable label: (a) are self-evident as they describe the incident, and (b) display an
orientation to the low contingencies involved in receiving the assistance due to its selfevident policeability.
The call entitled “Harassing two young girls” (Excerpt 9 below) is an example of
a request for help in which the problem is described using a police-relevant category. We
can hear the caller yelling at a third party (“TP” on the transcript) on the caller’s side
about a young girl (lines 1-2), even before the automatic institutional recording is
activated (line 3). After the automatic institutional recording is activated, the caller
describes that there is an old man harassing two young girls (lines 4-8). Then the calltaker then solicits confirmation of the place of the incident (line 10).

The caller’s practical epistemology (M. R. Whalen & Zimmerman, 1990) to the
incident is included in his description of the incident in which he articulates how he
became aware of the incident: he is “aquí en el parque de Barva” (“here at the park in
Barva,” in English; lines 5-6). The deictic “aquí” (“here,” in English; lines 4, 5) indexes
the caller’s proximity to the incident. While describing the offender’s conduct, the caller
categorizes it as “acosando” (“harassing,” in English; line 6). By using a police-relevant
category, the caller may be strengthening his case, as this category may be recognizable
for the call-taker as an existing code for classifying an incident.
This request for help is designed as a description, since the caller provides
information about the context: the offender is “un roco” (“an old man,” in English; lines
4-5), the location of the incident is “en el parque de Barva” (“at the park in Barva,” in
English; lines 5-6), the incident of “acosando” (“harassing,” in English; line 6), and the

130
victims are “dos muchachas de colegio” (“two young high school girls,” in English; line
7). The composition of the request for help displays the caller’s orientations to the low
contingencies involved in receiving the assistance, since the caller provides the evidence
that builds up the incident as being self-evidently policeable. By providing the contextual
information of the incident in the form of descriptions, callers show their epistemic
access to the incident (Larsen, 2013). Additionally, the caller is not suggesting the type of
assistance that the incident requires by requesting help in the form of a descriptions;
instead, he leaves it up to the call-taker to decide what type of help is needed in the
particular circumstances of the incident. In doing so, the caller is building a case as a selfevidently policeable incident. This excerpt also illustrates that descriptions of incidents
are accepted by call-takers as requests for help, a finding that is in line with prior research
(Drew & Walker, 2010; M. R. Whalen & Zimmerman, 1990).
The call entitled “Forest fire in Los Chiles” (Excerpt 10 below) is another
example of a request for help designed as a description that includes a police-relevant
category. In this case, the caller informs the call-taker about a forest fire. After the
opening of the call (lines 1-3), the caller introduces himself with his name (line 3) and the
place from which he is calling: “yo le hablo aquí de Los Chiles” (“I’m calling from Los
Chiles,” in English; line 4). In doing so, the caller legitimizes that the call is real (i.e., is
not a prank). Additionally, the caller provides this information without being prompted
by the call-taker – which is a routine activity in 9-1-1 Costa Rica (i.e., as a way to
distinguish between pranks and actual incidents; see Chapter 3 “Methodology and Data”).
In doing so, the caller is displaying an understanding of how the emergency system
functions (Paoletti, 2012b). After a gap (line 5) and a go-ahead from the call-taker (line

131
6), the caller describes the incident: there is a forest fire (lines 7-10). The call-taker then
solicits the location of the incident (line 11).

The presentation of the problem consists of a person presentation (lines 3-4), a
place formulation (lines 4, 7-8, 10), and an identification of the incident (lines 9-10). The
composition of the request shows the caller’s practical epistemology (M. R. Whalen &
Zimmerman, 1990) in relation to the incident. The verb “estoy” (“I am,” in English; line
7) indexes that the caller is at the place of the incident, and, because of this, he is able to
provide information about the place: “de la escuela del Jobo, dos kilómetros carretera=a
Caño Negro” (“from the Jobo school, two kilometers on the way to Caño Negro,” in
English; lines 7-8). Additionally, he is also able to provide a more granular place
formulation of the incident: “sobre- [sobre la vía]” (“along- [along the road],” in
English; line 10). The incident is described as an “incendio forestal” (“forest fire,” in
English, line 9), which, in turn, reinforces the claim that the caller’s description shows his
practical epistemology in relation to the incident (i.e., since he is able to articulate a
granular description of the fire by providing a particular kind of fire, a “forest fire”).
Again, this shows that descriptions provide evidence of callers’ epistemic access to the
incident (Larsen, 2013).
Once the caller has labeled the problem as a “forest fire” (line 9), the call-taker
comes in right away in overlap (line 11). This overlap shows the call-taker’s acceptance
of the caller’s description of the incident as sufficient. The caller presents the problem
using the verb “tenemos” (“have.1PL”; line 9), which may be interpreted as calling on
behalf of an organization. Nonetheless, there is no evidence throughout the call that this
is the case. Instead, it may be the case that the caller is aggregating himself (Lerner &
Kitzinger, 2007) as part of the Caño Negro community where the wildlife refuge a refuge
where caimans spawn – is located. In doing so, the caller may be adding legitimacy to the

133
call, which can be added to the caller’s self-identification (e.g., his name and
geographical location) in the opening of the call. The caller presents himself as a
benefactor (Clayman & Heritage, 2014) and as a Good Samaritan, as he informs 9-1-1
about the fire; however, he also presents himself as a beneficiary, as he seems to consider
himself to be a part of the community in which the incident is happening.
In both the call entitled “Harassing two young girls” (Excerpt 9 above) and the
call entitled “Forest fire in Los Chiles” (Excerpt 10 above), callers formulate the incident
as a description. In doing so, they display their epistemic access to the incident. In these
calls, the callers do not solicit a particular service or explicitly request help given that the
incident is self-evident; therefore, the callers leave it up to the call-takers to decide what
kind of assistance is required given the circumstances described by the callers. In
producing these descriptions, callers are requesting help by simply providing evidence for
the call-taker to consider the incident as worthy of police assistance. On the other hand,
describing the incident with policeable labels is a practice that not only presents the
incident as self-evident, but also orients to low contingencies involved in receiving the
assistance. The low contingency is displayed via the design of the request with a
policeable label (e.g., a fire or a car accident), as well as via other elements of
description. These additional elements (e.g., the type of fire, the affected area by the fire,
or the health condition of the victim in a car accident) provide further grounds for why
the assistance is needed.
Describing incidents that are difficult to categorize (using prospective indexicals)
Describing incidents that are difficult to categorize using prospective indexicals is
a practice for requesting help that orients to high contingencies in receiving the

134
assistance. In this type of descriptions, the caller introduces the incident using a
prospective indexical (Goodwin, 1996), which is an expression that projects a multi-unit
turn to explain to what the speaker is referring. Describing incidents using prospective
indexicals is a practice that callers use in order to get an extended turn to explain the
incident. While an incident reported in this way may be worthy of police assistance, it
may not be easy to categorize or the policeability might be questionable. In describing
such incidents, callers may need an extended turn to explain the incident and show its
policeability. Additionally, callers may unpack prospective indexicals in their initial turn
or in response to call-takers’ solicitations. Some of the prospective indexicals found in
my dataset are the words “problema” (“problem,” in English), “emergencia”
(“emergency,” in English), “caso” (“case,” in English), or “asunto” (“matter/issue,” in
English).
These descriptions might be combined with explicit requests for an ambulance or
a police car, or with a request for help in which the caller solicits general “help” (i.e., not
a particular service). In this subsection, I will show that descriptions with prospective
indexicals: (a) are used to obtain an extended turn that allows callers to describe an
incident that is difficult to categorize, (b) are used in cases in which the policeability of
the incident might be questionable, and (c) orient to high contingencies in receiving the
assistance, as callers may not know what kind of assistance may be possible to receive
due to the particularity of the incident.
The call entitled “My brother does drugs and threatens me” (Excerpt 11 below) is
an example of a request for help in which the caller describes the incident and introduces
the problem with a prospective indexical. In this call, the caller informs that her brother,

135
who does drugs, is always threatening her. After the opening of the call (lines 1-2), the
caller presents the problem (lines 4-15). The composition of the problem presentation
includes: the prospective indexical “un problema” (“a problem,” in English; line 5),
contextual information about the incident (lines 5-6), the person involved (line 7), the
problem (lines 7-8), the current state of affairs (lines 9-10), the caller’s account for not
being able to file a formal criminal complaint before calling (lines 11-12), and an explicit
request for help (lines 12-15).

The use of the prospective indexical “un problema” (“a problem,” in English; line
5) projects that there are more TCUs to come (Goodwin, 1996), since this word must be
unpacked in order to understand to what it is referring. During the caller’s first turn-at-

137
talk in this call, she unpacks the prospective indexical and presents details of the incident.
The caller sets up her incident presentation by providing contextual information about the
incident (i.e., “Yo ahora tuve que llamar .hh temprano” [“I just now had to call .hh
earlier,” in English; lines 5-6]). This information seems to be relevant in building the
case, since it provides the basis for the second request for help that the caller is asking for
in this call. By setting up this call as a follow up call, the caller is pursuing a response
from the emergency services after a prior request for assistance.
The incident presentation also includes a reference to the person involved in the
problem (i.e., the caller’s brother; line 7), and provides information about that person
(i.e., “[he] does drugs, .hh and he is always threatening me”; lines 7-8). By including this
information about her brother, the caller is framing him as a problematic and/or
dangerous person, thus making visible that the “problema” has to do with him. In doing
so, the caller is presenting herself as the victim of the incident and as a beneficiary
(Clayman & Heritage, 2014) of the assistance. The composition of the brother’s
characteristics indexes a recurrent pattern of behavior that ends up constituting the
problem. In other words, by framing her brother as a person that “se droga” and “siempre
me está amenazando” (“does drugs” and “is always threatening me,” in English; lines 78), the caller is informing that these behaviors have happened not only today, but that
they are recurrent and that she frequently deals with them. The brother’s recurrent
behaviors (lines 7-8) plus the current state of affairs (i.e., “Ahorita acaba de llegar del
trabajo” [“Right now he just got back from work,” in English; lines 8-9]) set up the
incident of the call: “está insultándome” (“[he] is insulting me,” in English; lines 9-10).
The caller also accounts for not solving the problem earlier with “yo no he podido salir a

138
poner la demanda” (“I haven’t been able to go out and file a lawsuit,” in English; lines
11-12). The word “demanda” (“lawsuit,” in English) might indicate that the problem has
escalated to the point that the caller is willing to take legal action against her brother, thus
indicating that this incident is a serious problem for the caller. The final TCU in the
description of the incident is an explicit request for help: “A ver si pueden mandar alguna
patrulla o hacer algo porque ya no sé qué hacer” (“I’m calling to see if you can send a
patrol car or do something because I don't know what to do anymore,” in English; lines
12-15). As discussed above, the use of the grammaticalized form “para ver si” (“[[I’m
calling]] to see if,” in English) frames the request as high in the contingency of receiving
the assistance. The call-taker then treats the incident as policeable by soliciting
confirmation of the location given by the caller in the first call during the morning: “Y es
la misma dirección que brindó en la mañana¿” (“And is it the same location that you
provided this morning¿”; lines 16-17).
Excerpt 11 (above) is an example of designing the reason for the call as a
description. In the description, the caller provided her grounds for calling. However, she
also made visible that she does not know what kind of help could be provided for her
particular request. Descriptions including prospective indexicals seem to be a practice
used by callers when they do not know what service to request or when there does not
seem to be a clear category for labeling the incident.
The call entitled “She leaves the baby home alone” (Excerpts 12a, 12b below) is
another example in which an incident is described using a prospective indexical (i.e., file
a complaint”; line 6 of Excerpt 12a). The caller reports that the neighbor, who is a
teenager, leaves the baby with other teenagers and that the baby cries continuously. The

139
opening of the call (i.e., Excerpt 12a below) includes the automatic recording with the
institutional identification (line 1), the repetition of the identification by the call-taker
(line 2), and the repair initiation “Aló?” (“Hello,” in English; line 3) by the caller that
prompts the reformulation of the opening by the call-taker (line 4). The reformulation of
the opening in line 4 includes the greeting “Buenas noches” (“Good evening,” in
English), and an explicit solicitation of the reason for the call “cuál es su emergencia?”
(“what is your emergency,” in English). This explicit solicitation shows that the call-taker
assumes that the call is an emergency. As is the case with emergency services (i.e.,
according to the specialized inferential frameworks of the emergency calls), all calls are
treated as requests for help. In response, the caller presents her reason for calling: she
wants to “hace:r .hhh este una denuncia” (“fil:e .hhh um a complaint,” in English; lines
5-6). In this case, the words “denuncia” (“complaint,” in English; line 6) is the
prospective indexical. Immediately after the reason for calling, the caller builds her case
(lines 6-16). The first information that the caller provides is that she lives “en unas
casitas de alquiler” (“in some little rental units,” in English; lines 7-8), which indexes the
socioeconomic level of the caller (i.e., this implies that the caller does not own the place
and that is small). The description of the caller’s house seems to be an explanation of
how she was able to hear the baby crying and how she became aware of the problem.

After a minimal receipt token from the call-taker (“Hm”; line 9; Excerpt 12a
above), the caller continues building the case and provides evidence for the problem
(lines 10-11, 13-19; Excerpt 12b below. This evidence includes an ongoing event starting
“de hace tiempo para acá,” (“a little while ago here,” in English; line 10) and the people
involved in the event (“la muchacha tiene una bebé pequeñita,” [“the young woman had
a little baby,” in English; line 11]). At this point in the call, we do not yet know what the
incident is; however, the caller has provided evidence to ground her concern as
policeable: the incident, whatever it is, involves a woman and a baby and seems to have
been happening for a while. The call-taker responds with a continuer (“Hm”; line 12). In
doing so, the caller-taker is letting the caller know that she (i.e. the call-taker) is listening,

141
but that the incident description is not yet complete (Schegloff, 1982). The caller
continues to build the case: (a) by providing details about the people involved: “Y la
muchacha yo no sé si será menor de edad,” (“And the young woman I don’t know if she
is a minor,” in English; lines 13-14), and (b) by introducing the problem: “y vieras que
deja la chiquita, sola con otros menores de edad” (“and look she leaves the little girl,
alone with other minors,” in English; lines 14-16).

The reported problem is that a baby is left without adult supervision (lines 14-16).
The caller presents herself as the benefactor (Clayman & Heritage, 2014) who informs 91-1 about an incident in which a baby is heard crying for a long time during the early
morning (i.e., the call was registered at 2:28AM) without proper adult supervision (i.e.,
no parents or close family members seem to be in charge of the baby). The problem does
not seem worthy of police assistance to the call-taker, who does not provide any uptake
(see the gap in line 17) to the problem just presented by the caller. The caller then adds
that “la chiquita lleva horas de estar llore y llore y llore” (“the little girl has been crying
and crying and crying for hours,” in English; lines 18-19). By providing this information,
the caller is showing her practical epistemology (M. R. Whalen & Zimmerman, 1990) or
how she became aware of the problem. Additionally, by informing that she can hear the
baby crying, the caller also upgrades the incident (i.e., the baby is not only crying, but has
been crying continuously). The auditory evidence (lines 18-19) and the time reference of

143
“lleva horas” (“for hours,” in English; lines 18-19) indicate that the baby has been
unhappy for long time, which seems to be enough reason for the caller to request help.
However, the call-taker seems to not be completely sure about the policeability of the
problem at this point in the call, as evidenced by her minimal (lines 9 and 12) or no
uptake (lines 17 and 20). There is another gap (line 20) after which both the caller and the
call-taker begin speaking in overlap (lines 21-22). The call-taker then solicits the
relationship of the caller to the incident (M. R. Whalen & Zimmerman, 1990) by asking if
the young woman is the caller’s neighbor (“es vecina suya?”; line 22). The caller
subsequently confirms (“Sí,” or “Yes,” in English; line 24).
The call entitled “She leaves the baby home alone” (Excerpts 12a, 12b above) is
an example of a request for help designed as a description. It seems that callers use
descriptions of incidents in which a prospective indexical is unpacked, when the incident
is questionable. In this particular call, the call-taker seemed doubtful about the
policeability of the incident.
Both the call entitled “My brother does drugs and threatens me” and the call
entitled “She leaves the baby home alone” (Excerpts 11 and 12a, 12b above) illustrate
that using prospective indexicals to describe the incident allows the caller to get an
extended turn during which he or she can provide details of the reported incident. Both of
these calls also illustrate that prospective indexicals may be used when the incident is
difficult to describe or categorize with a label. Descriptions are not explicit requests for
help (i.e., the callers do not request a particular service); however, descriptions are
requests not only because of the specialized inferential frameworks of emergency calls
(i.e., call-takers are instructed to treat every call as a request for help), but also because

144
they provide evidence of the problem. Requesting help via descriptions with prospective
indexicals is accepted by call-takers as a legitimated practice to request assistance.
Summary of findings
In this chapter, I have examined the activity of requesting help in calls to the 9-11 service in Costa Rica. As noted by traditional research on emergency calls in the U.S.
(M. R. Whalen & Zimmerman, 1987, 1990; Zimmerman, 1992a, 1992b), requests for
help can be designed as requests, reports, or descriptions. I have analyzed these formats
in relation to the notions of entitlement and contingency (Curl & Drew, 2008), the notion
of benefactors and beneficiaries (Clayman & Heritage, 2014), and the linguistic choices
that callers make when requesting help. In what follows, I summarize the findings about
each request form, as shown in Figure 4 (below).
Reasons for calling designed as explicit requests are turns in which callers solicit
a particular service (e.g., a patrol car or an ambulance). The findings show two practices
for explicit requests: (a) practices orienting to contingencies in receiving the assistance
via the grammaticalized form “para ver si” (“to see if,” in English), and (b) practices
orienting to low entitlement to the requested service via the “favor” and “amabilidad”
(“kindness,” in English) constructions. Callers may design their requests with mitigation
devices (e.g., conditionals, modals, “do me the favor/be kind” constructions) to further
downgrade the urgency of the incident and present it as non-life-threatening.
Reasons for calling designed as reports include police- and/or emergency servicerelevant categories, such as a break-in, a car accident, or a fire. By using an easily
recognizable category to label the incident, callers present the incident as being selfevident. Reporting incidents can be designed via two verbs: “reportar” (“to report,” in

145
English) and “denunciar” (“to denounce,” in English). Although both verbs share the
meaning of communicating news to the authorities, “denunciar” (“to denounce,” in
English) has an extra component for communicating a wrongdoing. Despite this semantic
difference, the findings do not show interactional differences between the two verbs.
Requests for help designed as reports are typically used by benefactors (e.g., people not
directly involved in the incident).

146
Reasons for calling designed as descriptions provide some sort of information
about the nature of the incident. On the one hand, descriptions can be designed as singleunit turns that display an orientation to low contingencies of receiving the assistance, as
the policeability of the incident is presented as being self-evident (via the use of
policeable labels). On the other hand, descriptions can also be designed as multi-unit
turns that display an orientation to high contingencies of receiving the assistance, as the
incident may be difficult to categorize and its policeability may be questionable.
When designing the request for help as descriptions, callers may not explicitly
request a particular type of service. Instead, they leave it up to call-takers to assess the
type of assistance needed according to the circumstances of each particular incident.
When designing the request for help as descriptions, callers may not even request help, at
least not explicitly. However, descriptions are considered acceptable as a practice for
requesting help to emergency services. In other words, descriptions are understood by
call-takers as requests for help, and therefore, are institutionally acceptable due to the
specialized inferential frameworks of emergency calls.

Chapter 6
Formulating place in calls to 9-1-1 Costa Rica
This chapter examines the interactional activity of formulating place in calls to 91-1. When formulating place, interactants face the problem of communicating the
location to the recipient within the context of the practical tasks and activities that they
might be carrying out (e.g., arranging meeting up with one another, giving directions,
etc.). When formulating place, interactants draw upon various interactional practices,
which may be vary both linguistically and culturally. In other words, while the problem
of formulating place is a generic one, the interactional solutions are culture and language
specific. In the case of calls to emergency services, callers need to identify the location of
the incident and formulate the location for the call-taker in a way that will enable the
provision of help. This chapter explores how exactly interactants formulate place in the
context of the 9-1-1 Emergency System in Costa Rica.
Little prior research on emergency calls has focused on place formulations (Del
Corona & Ostermann, 2012; Paoletti, 2012b; Penn et al., 2015). Most studies assume that
“there are such matters as streets and houses and highways with numbers, etc.” (Psathas,
1986b, p. 83), and that these identifiers are readily available to the callers (G. Raymond
& Zimmerman, 2007; M. R. Whalen & Zimmerman, 1987; Zimmerman, 1992a, 1992b).
For instance, Excerpt 1, derived from a 9-1-1 call in the U.S., shows an unproblematic
location formulation via the provision of an address, which includes a building number
(“Three oh one six”; line 7) and a street name (“Maple”; line 7).

In Costa Rica, few houses have a number and not every street has a sign
displaying the street name or the building/house number. Although house numbers may
be common in some urban areas, a common practice for formulating place in Costa Rica
is to use the name of the geographical place, in conjunction with the landmarks and a
very detailed description of the place or surroundings. For example, in Excerpt 2 below,
the caller reports that a teenager has run away from the shelter that she manages (data not
shown). The call-taker then solicits the location of the shelter (line 9), and the caller
formulates the place by providing the distance and direction of the incident from a
landmark (lines 10-11).

149
In line 9, the call-taker solicits the location of the shelter. In lines 10-11, the caller
responds by formulating the location using a distance and the direction of movement
“Cien metros, noreste:” (“One hundred meters, northea:st,” in English; line 10) from the
landmark “parque Vargas Araya” (“Vargas Araya park,” in English; line 11). As seen in
this excerpt, this formulation is considered to be institutionally sufficient for the calltaker. By moving on to the verification of the caller’s information (i.e., name; line 13),
the call-taker is orienting to closing the location formulation sequence.
In this chapter, I examine three practices that people use to formulate locations in
9-1-1 calls according to the resources available in their communities, namely:
geographical formulations, landmark formulations, and “otras señas” (“other signs,” in
English) formulations. The analysis suggests that these formulations correspond to
different levels of granularity (i.e., from less granular to more granular descriptions;
illustrated in Figure 5 below).

Geografical formulations
(lesser granularity)

Landmark formulations

Figure 5. Levels of granularity of place formulations.

150
The analysis suggests that geographical formulations together with landmark
formulations: (a) are considered to be institutionally sufficient in terms of formulating the
place of the incident, and (b) are pursued by call-takers; on the other hand, “otras señas”
(“other signs,” in English) formulations are optional, and they may either be provided by
callers or solicited by call-takers. In the following section, I review existing literature on
place formulation.
Prior research on place formulation
The activity of formulating place has been examined in countries like South
Africa, Brazil Italy, the U.S., and the U.K. (Del Corona & Ostermann, 2012; Heritage,
2007; Kitzinger et al., 2013; Paoletti, 2012b; Penn et al., 2015; Schegloff, 1972).
However, little is known about how places are formulated in Costa Rica. The issue is
sometimes mentioned in the mass media (Mayorga, 1997; Oviedo, 2006; Villegas, 2009,
2010), and it has also been discussed in popular culture via cartoons (see Figure 6 below)
or short video clips. This chapter aims to build upon our understanding of the activity of
formulating place by examining it in the context of emergency calls to 9-1-1 Costa Rica.
Research on place formulations examines how places are formulated in
conversation (Schegloff, 1972) according to the specific communicative goals of the
interaction and the participants’ lexical choices (Enfield, 2013; Schegloff, 1972).
Through their lexical choices, participants show the analytic processes involved in
formulating place. For instance, the phrase “let’s meet at Marie’s place” shows the
location analysis (i.e., the analysis that the speaker must carry out in order to produce a
place reference), the membership analysis (i.e., the categories to which participants
belong, given that the speaker examines his or her own categories and those of the hearer

151
in order to produce a relevant place formulation that is specifically designed for the
recipient), as well as the topic analysis (i.e., the selection of the formulation). According
to Schegloff (1972), topic analysis (also known as activity analysis) includes a collection
of five types of place formulations: (1) geographical formulations, such as “123 Main
Street” (2) formulations in relation to members, which refer to places belonging to a
member, such as “at Marie’s house”; (3) formulations in relation to a landmark, such as
“behind the library”; (4) course of action formulations, which are analyzable in terms of
what happens at that place, such as “where there was an accident a couple of years ago”;
and (5) place name formulations, which include the name of the place, such as “New
York.” This list of formulations, however, is not exhaustive, and other languages may use
different typologies for place formulations (see Levinson & Wilkins, 2006).

152

Other research on place formulation examines the relationship between
intersubjectivity and the progressivity of interactions (Heritage, 2007), as well as how
place is reformulated in repair (Kitzinger et al., 2013). Other research on place
formulations deals with giving directions (Psathas, 1986a, 1986b, 1990; Psathas &
Kozloff, 1976), an activity that requires a shared knowledge by all speakers involved of
both the physical and geographical environments (i.e., so that the direction-giver as able
to provide the directions and that the direction-seeker as able to follow said directions).
Recent research has examined the activity of formulating place in emergency
calls, calls during which obtaining the precise location of the incident is a key task.
Studies conducted in Brazil, Italy, and South Africa have identified a mismatch between
institutional constraints of emergency services and callers’ practices for providing
locational information. For instance, a study of South Africa (Penn, Watermeyer, Neel, &
Naltrass, 2015) analyzes the difficulties that call-takers encounter when trying to match
the address formulated by the caller with the address given by the computarized system.
In this country, call-takers use a computarized system that locates the address of the
incident. However, some of the problems that call-takers encounter are due to peculiar
characteristics of the country: large surfaces, informal settlements, as well as dense rural
and urban areas. In Brazil (Del Corona & Ostermann, 2012), call-takers use a software
which contains an electronic form that requires them to enter a street name and number
that already exists in the software; however, in many cases, callers call from settlements
that do not posses such information. In Italy (Paoletti, 2012b), research shows that calltakers show a preference for a certain type of place formulation that does not necessarily

153
match up with the address that callers formulate. The study shows that call-takers prefer a
formulation that includes: (1) the municipality; (2) the locality; and (3) lastly, the specific
address. This goes against how callers routinely formulate place in Italy, in which thay
use only the specific address (i.e., because they assume that call-takers are familiar with
the area of the incident). These three studies show a mismatch that exist between
institutional constraints of emergency services and place formulation practices used by
callers.
In what follows, I examine the practices of formulating place via geographical
formulations, landmark formulations, and “otras señas” (“other signs,” in English)
formulations.
Geographical formulations
Geographical formulations are place formulations that indicate the territorial
divisions of the country (i.e., into districts, counties, and provinces, as well as into towns
and neighborhoods). For example, the formulation “San Juan of Santa Barbara of
Heredia” informs the district, county, and province of the place. In this section, I will
show that: (a) callers tend to provide some sort of geographical formulation packed with
the request for help, and (b) call-takers solicit geographical formulations when such
information is not offered by callers during the request for help.
Callers tend to provide geographical formulations
When requesting help, callers tend to provide some sort of geographical
formulation. In these cases, callers design the request for help to include some kind of
geographical information regarding where the incident is occurring, as shown in Excerpts
3 and 4 below. In Excerpt 3, the caller requests an ambulance and identifies a district and

154
a county (“Villafranca >>de Guácimo¿<<” or “Villafranca >>of Guácimo¿<<” in
English; line 16). In Excerpt 4, the caller packs the presentation of the problem with the
district and the province (“Liberia Guanacaste”; lines 7-8).

The 9-1-1 service in Costa Rica uses a computer application that requires the call-

taker to enter the district of the incident. Once the district has been entered, the system
will automatically input the corresponding county and province for that district (see

155
Figure 5 in Chapter 3 “Methodology and Data”). Therefore, the first information required
by the call-taker, due to the institutional constraint of the computer application, is the
geographical formulation (i.e., the district, county, and province). As seen in Excerpts 3
and 4 above, callers might provide some sort of geographical information (e.g., the
district and the county, or the district and the province) during their request for help.
However, not all callers formulate the location using the district, county, and province.
Some callers formulate the location using only the neighborhood without any other
indication of where the place is located. This can be problematic, given that 9-1-1 Costa
Rica: (a) is a centralized system that receives calls from all around the country, (b) calltakers may not know where the location to which the caller is referring is located, and (c)
the same name of the location may be used for several neighborhoods in different parts of
the country. In the call entitled “Asthmatic man” (Excerpts 5a, 5b below), the caller
requests an ambulance for an asthmatic neighbor who is experiencing breathing
problems. This call shows a formulation of the location using only the name of the
neighborhood: “por acá en Santa Clara” (“around here in Santa Clara,” in English;
line 9).

The caller refers to the location using only the name of the neighborhood (i.e.,
“Santa Clara”; line 9), and this formulation does not include information regarding where
the place is located within the political administrative division of Costa Rica. Although
the caller used a geographical formulation (i.e., by indicating the Santa Clara
neighborhood), this formulation does not provide enough information about the location
of the emergency (i.e., the district, county, or province). Call-takers need information
about the political administrative division of Costa Rica when entering the location of the
incident into the computer application used to create the incident log. As a result, the calltaker then offers a candidate location (Excerpt 5b below). This information was retrieved
by the call-taker from the telephone subscribers’ database, which contains the
subscriber’s name, telephone number, and address. Call-takers are able to offer candidate
locations because 9-1-1 is an enhanced system (Zimmerman, 1992) that retrieves callers’
information from the telephone subscribers’ database.

The candidate location is formulated according to the territorial division of the
country: Alajuela is the province, San Ramón is the county, Ángeles is the district, and
Rodríguez is the neighborhood (lines 20-21, 23). However, the caller rejects this
candidate location, and subsequently reformulates it (line 24). In this reformulation, the
caller aligns with the formulation previously used by the call-taker (i.e., the caller follows
the same formulation pattern used by the call-taker when building the components of the
location). Thus the caller provides the neighborhood (i.e., Santa Clara) and the county
(i.e., San Carlos; line 24).
The call entitled “Asthmatic man” (Excerpts 5a, 5b above) showed the caller’s
orientation to align with the institutional needs of the emergency system by providing
some sort of geographical formulation packed with the request for help. However, it is
also true that callers sometimes request help without offering the location information in

158
the same TCU. In those cases, the call-takers solicit the location of the incident, as shown
in the following section.
Call-takers solicit geographical formulations when not provided by callers
Callers might not offer geographical information in their request turn. If that is the
case, call-takers will solicit the location of the incident by pursuing geographical
formulations so as to complete the institutional tasks (i.e., filling out the incident log in
the computer application) of the emergency service. In the calls entitled “Fight between
daughters” and “Morphine,” the call-takers solicit the geographical location when it is not
offered by the callers. Also seen in these calls are the callers’ orientation to align with the
institutional goals (i.e., responding with some geographical information) of the
emergency service.
The call entitled “Fight between daughters” (Excerpt 7 below) is an example of an
interaction in which the call-taker solicits the locational information, as well as one in
which the caller orients to providing some geographical information. Contrary to
Excerpts 3, 4, 5a (above), the caller in this call does not provide any geographical
formulation during the request for a patrol car (i.e., which is solicited by the caller due to
a fight between neighbors; lines 6-7). When the call-taker solicits where the incident is
taking place (line 9), the caller provides the name of the neighborhood (line 11). The calltaker then seeks a more detailed geographical formulation (line 12).

In the excerpt above, the caller requests a patrol car: “me puede llamar una, #una
patrulla aquí#” (“can you send me a patrol car here#,” in English; lines 6-7). The only
locational information provided in the request is the deictic “here.” While the deictic does
show the caller’s proximity to the incident (M. R. Whalen & Zimmerman, 1990), it does
not offer any geographical information. After a 1.0-second gap (line 8), the call-taker
initiates repair and solicits clarification of where exactly “here” is: “Aquí adónde
señora?” (“Here where ma’am?” in English; line 9). The caller responds with a
geographical formulation (i.e., Los Laureles is the neighborhood; line 11), but this is not
sufficient because it lacks the district. The call-taker initiates another repair: “Y eso dónde
queda?” (“And where is that?” in English; line 12). This shows that the caller’s
formulation has failed because it is not recognizable to the call-taker, who then initiates
repair to clarify the location of the incident within the country. The caller responds with
another geographical formulation, the name of the county: “Aquí en Siquirres” (“Here in
Siquirres,” in English; line 14). In this TCU, the caller uses the deictic “here” to index her
proximity to the incident. After a gap, during which the caller breathes loudly (line 15),
the call-taker solicits confirmation of whether Los Laureles is a residential area (line 16).
The caller disconfirms by responding that it is a neighborhood (line 17), and then adds
the name of the county/district (line 19). After another round of reconfirming the county

161
(lines 21-22), the call-taker solicits information about the incident (line 24). Later on in
the call, the call-taker solicits where exactly in the neighborhood the incident is occurring
(data not shown).
The call entitled “Morphine” (Excerpt 7 below) is another example of a call in
which the call-taker solicits a geographical formulation of the incident. In this call, the
caller informs the call-taker that a woman suffering from cancer has run out of morphine,
is in severe pain, and has fainted (data not shown). In the request for help, the caller does
not offer any geographical formulation about the incident; therefore, the call-taker solicits
the location of the incident: “Eso dónde es?” (“Where is that?” in English; line 14). The
caller responds with a geographical formulation (i.e., the neighborhood and the county;
line 16), and the call-taker then solicits confirmation of the district (line 23) and the exact
location (lines 26-27).

The call-taker solicits the location of the incident (line 14; Excerpt 7 above), and
the caller responds with a geographical formulation that includes the neighborhood and
the county: “La Aurora de Alajuelita” (“La Aurora of Alajuelita,” in English; line 16).
The call-taker subsequently solicits confirmation of the district by asking “San Felipe
sería esto?” (“San Felipe would this be?” in English; line 23), which constitutes an
institutionally required piece of information that must be entered into the incident log.
Additionally, entering the wrong district into the incident log would affect the outcome of
the call, given that the district information is used for sending the dispatch package to the
corresponding local dispatch center. After the caller has confirmed the district (line 24),

163
the call-taker then solicits more details about where exactly in the neighborhood the help
is needed (lines 26-27). By soliciting “Y ahí cuál sería la dirección en La Aurora?”
(“And there what would be the location in La Aurora?” in English; lines 26-27), the calltaker is moving on to another level of granularity in the location formulation.
Additionally, by soliciting this information, the call-taker indicates that the geographical
formulation is complete. Although a geographical formulation is necessary, it is not
sufficient by itself; thus, more locational information is required.
This section shows that geographical formulations are one type of location
formulation used by callers and call-takers. Although this type of formulation is
necessary for building up the location of an incident, it is not sufficient by itself. In the
section entitled “When is a location institutionally sufficient?”, I will discuss what
constitutes an institutionally sufficient place formulation. Callers tend to provide some
sort of geographical formulation during their request turn. In doing so, they are showing
their understanding of how the emergency system works (Paoletti, 2012b), as well as
aligning with the institutional goals of the emergency system. On the other hand, calltakers pursue geographical formulations in order to pursue institutional goals, since they
are instructed to enter the location of the incident in the “zone” section of computer
application. Once call-takers have entered the district name, the system will automatically
input the corresponding county and province, and will also assign the incident to the
corresponding local dispatch center. After the geographical formulation has been secured,
the call-takers can then enter the exact location, which is formulated by callers using
landmark formulations (see next section).

164
Landmark formulations
Landmark formulations are place formulations which anchor the location to a
particular landmark. These formulations are made up of three basic elements: the
landmark, the distance of the incident from the landmark, and the “sentido” (“direction,”
in English) of movement. For example, in the formulation “de la escuela de San Pablo
200 metros sur” (“from the San Pablo school 200 meters south,” in English), the San
Pablo school is the landmark, 200 meters is the distance from the landmark, and south is
the “sentido” (“direction,” in English) of movement. Landmarks are salient places used as
starting points from which the locations are formulated; for instance, examples of
landmarks include churches, schools, bridges, gas stations, well-known stores, etc. The
distance from the landmark can be expressed in metric units (e.g., “five hundred meters,”
“two kilometers”), or by providing the side of the landmark (e.g., “in front of,” “behind”).
The “sentido” of movement can be expressed either in cardinal directions (e.g., “north”),
or by referencing the incident’s location in relation to a town or another landmark (e.g.,
“towards El Llano” or “towards the bridge”). In this section, I will show: (a) thet these
three formulations (i.e., landmarks, distance, and “sentido”) make up a complete package;
and (b) that the “sentido” (“direction,” in English) of movement can be expressed using
cardinal directions when the incident is located inside (e.g., in a house or a store), or by
referencing the incident’s location in relation to another landmark or town when the
incident is located outside (e.g., in the street or on a highway).
Landmark formulations are a complete package
As previously mentioned, landmark formulations are made up of three
components: the landmark, the distance from the landmark, and the “sentido”

165
(“direction,” in English) of movement (see Figure 7 below). These three elements are a
complete package; in other words, participants orient to using landmarks in conjunction
with the distance and “direction” when formulating place, as showed in the calls entitled
“Bus blocking” and “Papaya colored house” (below).

In the call entitled “Bus blocking” (Excerpt 8 below), the caller reports that a bus
is blocking the street that leads to her neighborhood (data not shown) after the opening of
the call. The call-taker then solicits the place: “Dónde es eso?” (“Where is it?” in
English; line 10), and the caller provides a geographical formulation: “San Juan de Dios
de Desamparados” (i.e., San Juan de Dios is the district and Desamparados is the county;
line 12).

When call-takers pursue a place formulation from callers, just a geographical
formulation is not institutionally sufficient. Therefore, more details are required and the
call-taker solicits the “dirección exacta” (“exact location,” in English; line 14) in this
call. The caller’s response contains a landmark formulation: it includes the distance of
“doscientos setenta y cinco: o trescientos” (“two hundred seventy-five: or three hundred
((meters)),” in English; lines 16-17), the “sentido” of movement “suroeste” (“southwest,”
in English; line 17), and the landmark “Guardia Rural” (“Rural Guard,” in English; line

167
17) which serves as the starting point of the place formulation. The caller then repeats the
geographical formulation (line 18) after the landmark formulation. After a gap of 4.3
seconds (line 19), the call-taker moves on to verify the caller’s information (i.e., by
soliciting the caller’s telephone number; line 20). This final question indicates that the
location formulation provided by the caller is institutionally sufficient.
The call entitled “Papaya colored house” (Excerpt 9 below) also shows an
instance in which the landmark, the distance, and the “sentido” (“direction,” in English)
of movement are packaged together. Prior to the lines included in this excerpt, the caller
has already formulated the place using a geographical formulation (data not shown). In
this excerpt, the caller selects a school in the neighborhood as a landmark (line 36;
Excerpt 9 below). The caller also offers a landmark formulation (lines 35-36) that lacks
the direction of moment; this information is subsequently repaired by the call-taker (lines
40-41).

The caller attempts to formulate the location using a landmark formulation, but
she only refers to the distance of the incident from the school without including the
“sentido” (lines 35-36) of movement. After no uptake from the call-taker (line 37), the
caller continues to formulate the location using “otras señas” (“other signs,” in English;
see next section), such as the color of the house (line 38). After a gap (line 39), the calltaker explicitly solicits the “sentido” (“direction,” in English) of movement (lines 40-41).
In overlap with the call-taker’s list of candidate directions, the caller responds by
providing the cardinal point (line 42). This excerpt shows that the three components of
landmark formulations are packaged together and are pursued by call-takers. When
callers do not offer all three components, call-takers will initiate repair to solicit the
missing component (i.e., in order to receive the complete landmark formulation). This
excerpt also shows that possibly complete and institutionally adequate location
formulations occur at different points during the call for callers and call-takers. For
example, after providing the distance of the incident from the landmark (lines 35-36), the
caller offers the color of the house (line 38). However, line 38 is sequentially deleted by
the call-taker, who then solicits the exact “sentido” (“direction,” in English) of movement
(i.e., “and one hundred meters where?”; lines 40-41). The “sentido” of movement was

169
originally missing from the location formulated by the caller (i.e., “one hundred meters
from La Esperanza school”; lines 35-36); therefore, this shows that when using landmark
formulations, the distance and the “sentido” are also pursued by the call-taker in order for
the location to be considered institutionally sufficient.
“Sentido” (“direction,” in English) of movement
When formulating place, participants select a landmark as a starting point from
which they construct the location of the incident. Additionally, as previously mentioned,
landmarks are packaged with the distance and the “sentido” (“direction,” in English) of
movement. Callers tend to express the “sentido” of movement using cardinal directions
(i.e., north, south, east, west) when the incident is located inside, or by referencing the
incident’s location in relation to another landmark or a town (e.g., “towards the bridge,”
“towards El Llano”) when the incident is located outside (see Figure 8 below). In what
follows, I will show two calls in which callers express the “sentido” of movement
differently. These differences arise from the fact that different locations provide callers
with different resources with which to formulate place. For example, when the caller is a
passerby (i.e., a person who is not very familiar with the place), the resources available to
the person with which to formulate the location may be limited. On the other hand, if the
incident occurs in an urban area or inside of a building, the caller may have more
resources available to use when formulating place.

The calls entitled “Attacked by a machete” and “Audible burglary alarm” (below)
are examples of landmark formulations in which the “sentido” (“direction,” in English) of
movement is expressed using cardinal directions (i.e., because the incident is occurring
inside of a building). During the call entitled “Attacked by a machete” (Excerpt 10
below), the caller informs the call-taker that a woman has been attacked by her husband
with a machete. Upon the call-taker’s solicitation, the caller formulates the location using
a geographical formulation. Once the call-taker has gathered the geographical
information, the caller increases the granularity of the place formulation by offering a
landmark formulation: “Es aquí en la entrada de La Bellota¿” (“Is it here in the entrance
of La Bellota¿”, in English; data not shown). The call-taker then solicits where exactly in
the neighborhood (i.e., where exactly in La Carlota) the incident is occurring by soliciting
“De la entrada cuánto?” (“From the entrance how far away?” in English; line 67). Next,
the caller provides the distance and the direction of movement from the landmark (lines
69-70, 74, 76).

The call-taker solicits where exactly within the neighborhood the incident
occurred (line 67), and the caller responds with a landmark formulation (lines 69-70, 74
76). The caller’s response includes “la entrada” (“the entrance,” in English) of the

172
neighborhood as the landmark (line 69), “trescientos” (“three hundred ((meters)),” in
English; line 70) as the distance of the location of the incident from the landmark, and the
cardinal point “oeste” (“west,” in English; line 70) as the “sentido.” After a gap (line 71)
and the call-taker’s continuer (line 72), the caller repeats part of the previous formulation
(line 74) and completes it by adding “y ciento cincuenta al sur” (“and one hundred and
fifty ((meters)) south”; line 76). After another gap (line 77), the call-taker solicits the
color of the house by asking “En una casa de qué color?” (“What color is the house?” in
English; line 78). In doing so, the call-taker is indicating that the landmark formulation is
complete, given that it includes the landmark, the distance of the incident’s location in
relation to the landmark, and the “direction” of movement. By soliciting the color of the
house, the call-taker is also making another kind of place formulation institutionally
relevant. This particular type of place formulation will be described in detail in the
section entitled “Otras señas (“other signs,” in English) formulations” (i.e., in the next
section).
The call entitled “Audible burglary alarm” (Excerpt 11 below) is another example
of a call in which the “sentido” of movement is expressed using cardinal directions (i.e.,
because the incident is occurring inside). In this call, the caller, who works for a security
company that installs alarms and monitors places, requests a patrol car because an audible
burglary alarm has gone off in a drugstore. In the beginning of this excerpt, the caller
packs the request for help with some geographical information (line 11). The call-taker
then solicits more details about the geographical formulation (line 12) and also solicits
where exactly within the district the incident is occurring (lines 17-18). Next, the caller
responds to this question with a landmark formulation (lines 19-20).

The caller packs the request with the geographical formulation: “una patrulla en
Limón” (“a patrol car in Limón,” in English; line 11). Although the caller’s place
formulation is made up of a geographical formulation, this seems to not be sufficient for
the call-taker, who solicits clarification of where exactly in Limón the incident is taking
place. Furthermore, using Limón in a place formulation could be problematic, given that
“Limón” is the name of a province, a county, a district, and the center of a district in
Costa Rica. Thus, the caller responds by narrowing the options down to the center of the
district (line 14). The call-taker then solicits confirmation of the place and, after a 4.7
second gap (line 16), solicits where exactly in the district the incident is occurring (lines
17-18). By soliciting the exact location (“Okay Limón centro y de ahí cuál es la
dirección?” or “Okay the center of Limón and from there what is the location?” in
English; lines 17-18), the call-taker is indicating that while the geographical formulation

175
is complete, it is still institutionally insufficient by itself. In other words, while a
geographical formulation is necessary, additional information is also required; for this
reason, the call-taker solicits the exact location. The call-taker’s question is responded to
with a landmark formulation (lines 19-22) that includes the main entrance of a hospital as
a landmark (“De la entrada principal del hospital Tony Facio” or “From the main
entrance of the Tony Facio hospital,” in English; lines 19-20), “trescientos” as the
distance (“three hundred ((meters)),” in English; line 22), and “este” (“east,” in English;
line 22) as the “sentido” of movement. Next, the call-taker solicits confirmation of the
“direction” (see the emphasis placed on the cardinal point in the transcript, which is
marked by an underline; line 24), which the caller confirms (line 25). The caller also
offers an “other signs” formulation (i.e., “on the left-hand side”; line 25), as well as the
exact place of the incident: a drugstore (line 26).
The calls entitled “Attacked by a machete” and “Audible burglary alarm” (both
above) illustrate that the “sentido” (“direction,” in English) of movement can be
expressed using cardinal directions when the incident occurs inside (e.g., in a house or
store). On the other hand, the calls entitled “Huacas” and “Party in the middle of the
street” (below) are examples of landmark formulations in which the “sentido” of
movement is expressed by referencing the incident’s location in relation to another
landmark or town, given that the incident is occurring outside (e.g., in a street or on a
highway).
In the call entitled “Huacas” (Excerpt 12 below), the caller packs the presentation
of the problem (“Para reportar un accidente” or “((I’m calling)) to report an accident,”
in English; lines 4-5) and the location of the emergency (“en la cuesta de Huacas” or “on

176
the hill in Huacas,” in English; line 5). Later in the call, the call-taker learns that the
incident is a car-motorcycle accident and that the victim is lying against a raised shoulder
in the street (data not shown).

This call is an example of expressing the “sentido” (“direction,” in English) of

movement by referencing an incident’s location in relation to a town. The incident is
occurring outside (i.e., in the street, since it is a car-motorcycle accident). The location is
formulated using a hill as a landmark, followed by a geographical formulation (i.e.,
informing that “Huacas” is the name of the town). Huacas is a town located in the
Guanacaste province near the beach that has a relatively flat surface. Therefore, a hill
would be very noticeable in that area’s geography, and therefore, is a salient place for the
inhabitants of that town. The call-taker initiates repair (line 6), and the caller then
reformulates the location: “E:s, Huacas de Santa Cruz” (“It: is, Huacas of Santa Cruz,” in
English; lines 7-8). The caller packs the name of the town with the name of the county
(i.e., Santa Cruz). In doing so, she treats the call-taker’s repair initiation as an indication
of an understanding problem rather than a hearing problem. By adding the name of the
county, the caller shows her understanding of the possibility that the call-taker might not
be familiar with the geographical area. The caller has reported the incident and
formulated the location by using a landmark (i.e., “the hill in Huacas”; line 5) followed
by a geographical formulation (i.e., “It: is, Huacas of Santa Cruz”; lines 7-8). The calltaker subsequently inquires if the emergency is occurring right on the hill in Huacas:
“Propiamente en la cuesta. De Huacas?” (“Exactly on the hill. In Huacas?”; line 12).
The caller then responds not with a cardinal direction, but rather with the location of the
incident in relation to its direction towards the nearest town (i.e., “towards El Llano going
uphill”; lines 14-15).

178
The call entitled “Party in the middle of the street” (Excerpt 13 below) is an
example of expressing the “sentido” of movement by referencing the incident’s location
in relation to another landmark (i.e., the incident is occurring outside). In this call, the
caller informs the call-taker about a party happening in the middle of the street. The caller
thinks it is dangerous because a driver could potentially hit the young boys who are
partying. In the beginning of this call, the geographical formulation is gathered (data not
shown). The call-taker then solicits where exactly in the district the party is taking place
(line 16). Next, the caller offers a candidate formulation (lines 18-19), but the call-taker
still solicits a more precise place formulation (lines 21-22). The caller then formulates the
location of the incident using a complete landmark formulation (lines 24, 28-29).

The geographical information provided by the caller included the names of the

county and the district (data not shown); however, the call-taker still solicits where
exactly the party is taking place (line 16). By repeating the county and the district while
also soliciting a more exact formulation of the location (i.e., “Santa Ana Pozos where¿”
in English; line 16), the call-taker indicates that although the geographical formulation is

180
complete, it is institutionally insufficient by itself. In doing so, the call-taker makes
relevant another type of place formulation – a landmark formulation. The caller
formulates the place with a landmark (i.e., the Valle del Sol condominium), but does not
provide the distance-related information. Instead, the caller provides only a vague
indication of the direction of movement (lines 18-19), given that it is possible to access
that landmark from different directions. Next, the call-taker solicits the location: “Pero
cuál sería la dirección caballero¿” (“But what would the location be sir¿” in English;
lines 21-22), thus indicating that the caller’s previous formulation was unclear or
insufficient. The caller then makes a second attempt and reformulates the place of the
party (lines 24, 28-29), but this time with a complete landmark formulation that includes:
(a) a bank as a landmark (“De:l:: HSBC¿” or “From: the:: HSBC¿” in English; line 24),
(b) a distance from the landmark (“Un kilómetro” or “One kilometer,” in English; line
28), and (c) the “direction” of movement (“en dirección hacia el condominio Valle del
Sol” or “towards the Valle del Sol condominium,” in English; lines 28-29). This
reformulated landmark formulation expresses the direction of movement by referencing
the incident’s location in relation to another landmark (i.e., the direction of movement
from a bank to a condominium).
As seen in this section, once the geographical formulation has been gathered, calltakers solicit where exactly the incident is occurring. By soliciting additional details, the
call-takers are making landmark formulations institutionally relevant. Landmark
formulations include three components: the landmark, the distance of the incident from
the landmark, and the “sentido” (“direction,” in English) of movement. Both callers and
call-takers orient to these three components as one single interactional activity when

181
formulating place. The data show that participants tend to express the “sentido” of
movement by using cardinal directions when the incident occurs inside (e.g., in a house
or store), or by referencing the incident’s location in relation to another landmark or town
when the incident occurs outside (e.g., in the street or on a highway). It could be argued
that this difference in expressing the direction according to the area in which the incident
occurs (i.e., by indicating cardinal direction if the incident occurs inside or by referencing
the incident’s location in relation to a landmark or town if the incident occurs outside)
shows the caller’s epistemology to the incident.
“Otras señas” (“other signs,” in English) formulations
“Otras señas” (“other signs,” in English) formulations are place formulations that
describe the details or physical characteristics of places. These descriptions increase the
granularity of the formulation by zooming in on particular features of the location and its
environment. “Otras señas” (“other signs,” in English) formulations may include the
materials from which buildings are constructed and/or the color of buildings. When the
Police Department is the first responder to the incident, 9-1-1 Costa Rica instructs for
call-takers to solicit the color of the house as part of the location formulation. Each
responder submits to 9-1-1 Costa Rica a set of questions to ask callers according to each
type of incident. In the case of the Police Department, this entity requires 9-1-1 to solicit
the color of the house, among other details. This is an institutional constraint that shapes
the interaction between callers and call-takers when co-constructing the location
formulation. Although call-takers of 9-1-1 Costa Rica are explicitly instructed to solicit
the color of the house when the incident is transferred to the Police Department, calltakers may also solicit this information when the incident is responded to by another

182
responder (i.e., by another responder other than the Police Department) Furthermore,
callers sometimes offer this information as part of their location formulations without a
solicitation from call-takers. In this section, I will show that “other signs” formulations
may either be offered by callers or solicited by call-takers.
When calling emergency services, callers may provide the visual attributes of
places when formulating the location of the incident. In other words, they may choose to
describe particular features of the place depending on the resources available in their
environment. For instance, callers may provide the color or construction material of the
place if the incident occurs inside (e.g., in a house or store), or they may describe their
surroundings if the incident occurs outside (e.g., in the street or on a highway). In the call
entitled “Papaya colored house” (Excerpt 14 below; also analyzed as Excerpt 9 above),
the caller formulates the place using a landmark formulation (i.e., “The location is one
hundred meters from the La Esperanza school”; lines 35-36) and an “other signs”
formulation (“The second house papaya colored”; line 38).

183
The caller offers the color of the house and, in doing so, increases the granularity
of the formulation. In other words, it is not just any house located one hundred meters
from the school, but rather the second house that is also papaya colored.
Call-takers may also solicit “other signs” formulations as part of the location
formulation. In the call entitled “Her blood sugar dropped” (Excerpt 15 below), the
geographical information is gathered (data not shown). Next, the call-taker solicits where
exactly the incident is occurring (line 17). The caller then provides a landmark
formulation (i.e., “from the catholic church um five hundred meters west”; lines 18-19).
After a pause, the call-taker solicits the building material of the house: “Casa de
ceme:nto:::, casa de madera::?” (“Cement hou:se:::, wooden house::? in English; line
21). The caller subsequently responds by providing the building material and adding the
color of the house as “azul claro” (“light blue,” in English; line 22).

The two calls above show that “otras señas” (“other signs,” in English)
formulations may either be offered by callers (e.g., in the call entitled “Papaya colored
house”; Excerpt 14 above) or solicited by call-takers (e.g., in the call entitled “Her blood
sugar dropped”; Excerpt 15 above). The level of granularity in the place formulation that
is considered to be sufficient may be negotiated by the caller and the call-taker, since
there are many details regarding the location that may be considered “other signs.”
The call entitled “Potato chip factory” (Excerpts 16a, 16b below) shows how
“otras señas” (“other signs,” in English) are considered to be part of a place formulation.
The call is a report of domestic violence – the caller hears that her neighbor is being
attacked by her husband (i.e., the neighbor’s husband). When asked about the location of
the incident, the caller formulates the place via a landmark formulation and the call-taker
initiates repair in order to solicit the geographical formulation (data not shown). After the
geographical formulation has been gathered, the call-taker solicits additional details of
the location, incorporating into said solicitation the landmark provided by the caller (line
36 below). The caller then responds with an “other signs” formulation (lines 37-41) that
includes a mention of a public telephone, a description of a street, and a descriptions of
what is found in the surroundings (i.e., a clay house and a marble workshop).

The call-taker solicits confirmation of the location: “De la fábrica La Marianita”
(“From La Marianita factory?”; line 36). The caller then formulates the place by
providing a public telephone as another landmark (“from the public telephone”; lines 3738). Next, the caller provides an “other signs” formulation, thus increasing the granularity
of the place. The “other signs” formulation includes the descriptions “hay una entradita”
(“there is a little entrance,” in English; line 38), “una casa de adobe y una marmolería”
(“a clay house and a marble workshop,” in English; line 39), and “es una callecita

The caller has already formulated the location using a public telephone as a
landmark (Excerpt 16a above) and has explained that the location is the fifth house in a
little entrance (line 57; Excerpt 16b above). The call-taker then solicits further details
about the house, such as the color: “la casa de qué color es?” (“the house what color is
it?,” in English; line 60). The design of the question shows a syntactic fronting of the
subject (“la casa” or “the house,” in English), as it has been topicalized (C. W. Raymond,
2015). The solicitation of the color of the house makes relevant the formulation of the
location using “other signs” as an appropriate institutional formulation. Additionally, this

187
solicitation shows the call-taker’s institutional orientation to obtaining the description.
The caller hesitates to responds; however, since the house “no está pintada” (“[it] is not
painted,” in English; line 62), she responds by describing the construction (“e:s de block”
or “it i:s made of blocks,” in English; line 62-63), in addition to providing the color of the
door (“black”; line 65) and the gate (“yellow”; line 66).
As discussed in this section, “other signs” formulations include salient physical
characteristics (such as colors and the materials of buildings) of the location being
formulated. Furthermore, these descriptions increase the granularity of the formulation.
Contrary to geographical formulations and landmark formulations, “otras señas” (“other
signs,” in English) formulations do not seem to be made up of basic components, since
their descriptions could include any salient feature (or features) of the location or its
surroundings. Additionally, “other signs” formulations may either be offered by callers or
solicited by call-takers. As will be shown in the section entitled “When is a location
institutionally sufficient?”, “other signs” formulations are institutionally relevant, but not
institutionally mandatory, when building up an institutionally sufficient location
formulation.
Assembling a location formulation
In the previous sections, it has been shown that participants formulate the location
of the incident by using the three different formulations with differing levels of
granularity: geographical formulations, landmark formulations, and “otras señas” (“other
signs,” in English) formulations. In this section, it will be shown how these three
practices are combined when formulating place in calls to 9-1-1; that is, how the callers
and call-takers negotiate the location according to their perspectives on what constitutes a

188
sufficient location formulation, as well as according to the attributes of the places (e.g.,
inside vs. outside).
The call entitled “Varicose veins” call illustrates a location formulation that is
assembled using geographical formulations, landmark formulations, and “other signs”
formulations (i.e., the incident occurs inside of a building). The call is presented in three
separate excerpts (Excerpts 17a, 17b, 17c below) in order to easily illustrate the
formulation of the location. At the start of Excerpt 17a below, the greeting of the caller
(line 3) is followed by her locational identification using a geographical formulation (i.e.,
San Pablo is the district and Barva is the county; line 4).

After the opening of the call (Excerpt 17a above), the call-taker solicits the reason
for calling. The caller then presents the problem: her mother suffers from varicose veins,
some of which have burst and her mother is bleeding (data not shown). When asked
about the location of the incident (line 16; Excerpt 17b below), the caller provides a
landmark formulation in which the direction of movement is expressed by referencing the
incident’s location in relation to another landmark.

Once the call-taker has secured the geographical formulation (i.e., “in San Pablo”;

line 16), he solicits the location: “in San Pablo what location?” (line 16). The caller then
responds by providing the location using landmarks (i.e., the school and the bridge), and

190
the distance of the incident from said landmarks (lines 20, 23). In line 17, the caller
responds by geographically formulating the location (i.e., “>San Pablo of Barva<”), and
then adds a landmark in lines 17 to 18 (i.e., “from the school in San Pablo”). Next, the
caller provides the distance from the landmark (i.e., “two hundred and seventy five
((meters))”; line 20) and the direction of movement by referencing another landmark (i.e.,
the bridge; line 21). After no uptake from the call-taker (see the gap in line 22), the caller
repairs and provides the direction of movement using a cardinal direction (i.e.,
“southeast”; line 23) as an alternative formulation. The caller reformulates the location,
provides the direction of movement, and also adds the direction in relation to a landmark
(lines 23-25).
The call-taker solicits confirmation of the landmark formulation (lines 26-27;
Excerpt 17c below). After confirming (i.e., “yes”; line 28), the caller offers a granular
description of the surroundings of the place (lines 28-35), including the mention of stores
and a person working at a furniture workshop.

subsequently confirms (i.e., via “yes.”; line 28). Next, the caller adds another landmark to
the location formulation: “the Las Espinas workshop” (line 29). After a gap (line 30),
during which there is no uptake from the call-taker, the caller produces a more granular
location formulation (i.e. by adding “furniture workshop;” line 31). The caller then

192
abandons the reference to the shop (line 32) and instead explains that there is a man
working with furniture right in front of her house (lines 33-35). In line 39, the call-taker
moves on to solicit the name of the caller; this shows that the location provided by the
caller is considered to be sufficient by the call-taker.
The call entitled “Varicose veins” shows that geographical formulations and
landmark formulations are necessary when building up an institutionally sufficient
location formulation. While there are “other signs” formulations in this call, this is not the
case in the call entitled “Huacas” (Excerpt 12). The absence of “other signs” formulations
in the call entitled “Huacas” suggests that such formulations are not mandatory when
assembling an institutionally sufficient location formulation, which is precisely what will
be discussed in the next section.
When is a location institutionally sufficient?
The practices that callers use to formulate location when calling 9-1-1 (practices
which have been shown thus far in the data), are: geographical formulations, landmark
formulations, and “otras señas” (or “other signs,” in English) formulations. These three
practices are used together when formulating place and are institutionally relevant in the
co-construction of the location of incidents. However, geographical formulations and
landmark formulations specifically are the two practices that call-takers accept as those
that constitute an institutionally sufficient location formulation. On the other hand, “other
signs” formulations tend to be optional when building up an institutionally sufficient
location formulation. When offered by callers, “other signs” formulations are accepted by
call-takers (as seen in Excerpts 14, 16a, 17c above). Sometimes, but not always, calltakers solicit “other signs” formulations when they are not offered by the callers (as seen

193
in Excerpts 15, 16b above). In this section, I will show that a location formulation may be
institutionally sufficient when it includes only geographical and landmark formulations
(i.e., when it does not also include “other sign” formulations).
The call entitled “Small collision” (Excerpt 18 below) shows that both
geographical and landmark formulations are required. In this call, the caller does not
offer any location information during the presentation of the problem (data not shown).
When asked about the location of the incident (line 8), the caller responds with a
landmark formulation (line 10), but does not offer a geographical formulation.

The caller’s response is a landmark formulation that only includes one of the three
components of place formulations: the landmark “Es de la contraloría” (“By the
government accountability office,” in English; line 10). There is a 1.3-second long gap
(line 11), in which typing sounds can be heard on the call-taker’s side. Next, the calltaker solicits clarification of the landmark: “De la contraloría de dónde?” (“By the
government accountability office of where?” in English; line 12). By soliciting
clarification of the landmark, the call-taker not only indicates that the place formulated by
the caller is incomplete (i.e., it lacks institutionally relevant geographical formulation),
but he also shows his orientation to fulfilling the institutional task of entering the district

195
into the computer application. The caller then provides the full name of the landmark and
adds the name of the neighborhood (i.e., a geographical formulation) in which the
incident is located (lines 14-15). After a go-ahead from the call-taker (line 17), the caller
provides the remaining components of the landmark formulation: the distance (lines 18,
22) and direction of movement (lines 19, 22). After a 6.7-second gap in which typing
sounds can be heard (line 23), the call-taker then moves on to verifying the caller’s
information (i.e., telephone number; line 24). This particular call that call-takers consider
both geographical and landmark formulations as being institutionally required and, in this
case, as a sufficient way to formulate place.
The call entitled “Vaginal infection” (Excerpt 19 below) is another example of a
location formulation in which geographical and landmark formulations are treated as
institutionally sufficient. The caller designs the request for help to include a complete
geographical formulation (lines 5-7). After the call-taker’s solicitation of a more precise
location (line 9), the caller then provides a complete landmark formulation (lines 13-16).

During her first turn-at-talk, the caller includes a geographical place formulation:
“Es para ver si nos mandan una ambulancia aquí a Dulce Nombre de San Isidro de
Alajue:la¿” (“((I’m calling)) to see if you can send us an ambulance here in Dulce
Nombre of San Isidro of Alajuela¿” in English; lines 5-7). In these lines, the caller offers
a complete geographical formulation that includes the neighborhood, district, and

197
county/province. After 3.7-second gap, in which typing sounds can be heard (line 8), the
call-taker solicits the exact location of the incident: “Y la dirección exacta?” (“And the
exact location?” in English; line 9). Next, the caller is heard offline asking a third person
(“TP”) for the location (lines 11-12), and the third person then responds (lines 13-14).
The caller then formulates the place using a landmark formulation: “Quinientos oeste de
la iglesia católica¿” (“Five hundred ((meters)) west of the Catholic church¿” in English;
lines 15-16). Thus, the landmark formulation is complete, since it includes the church as
the landmark, the distance of the incident from the landmark, and the direction of
movement expressed using cardinal directions. After a 5.0-second gap (line 17), the calltaker moves on to verifying the caller’s information (i.e., telephone number; line 18).
This indicates that the call-taker has accepted the caller’s location formulation and
considers it to be institutionally sufficient.
These data show that institutionally sufficient location formulations must – at the
very least – include both geographical formulations and landmark formulations (as shown
in Excerpts 8, 11, 13 above). On the other hand, “other signs” formulations are not
always mandatory, but these formulations may be offered by callers (Excerpt 15 above)
or may (or may not) be solicited by call-takers (Excerpts 14, 16a, 17c above).
Summary of findings
In this chapter, I have examined the interactional activity of formulating place in
calls to 9-1-1. The data show that interactants rely on the resources available in the
community and that they use three different practices when formulating the locations of
incidents: geographical formulations, landmark formulations, and “otras señas” (“other
signs,” in English) formulations (see Figure 9 below).

Geographical formulations are place formulations that use the territorial divisions
of the country and are made up of three basic components: provinces, counties, and
districts. Additionally, two additional components may also be included in geographical
formulations: towns and neighborhoods. Callers tend to provide some kind of
geographical information in their requests for help; however, when this information is not
offered by callers, it will be solicited by call-takers.

199
Landmark formulations are place formulations that anchor the location to a
particular landmark. These formulations are comprised of three basic components: the
landmark, the distance of the incident from the landmark, and the “sentido” (“direction,”
in English) of movement. Landmarks are salient places in the community (e.g., churches,
parks, stores) that are used as the starting point for the location. The distance of the
incident from the landmark can be expressed using metric units (e.g., meters or
kilometers) or by using a side of the landmark (e.g., behind, in front of). The direction of
movement can be expressed using cardinal directions when the incident occurs inside
(e.g., in a building, a store, a house), or by referencing the incident’s location in relation
to another landmark or town when the incident occurs outside (e.g., in a street or on a
highway). These three components of landmarl formulations (i.e., the landmark, the
distance of the incident from the landmark, and the direction of movement) are all
required elements in the landmark formulations.
Otras señas” (“other signs,”in English) formulations are descriptions of places
that can include the color and construction material of buildings, the physical
characteristics of the places, or descriptions of the surroundings. These formulations
increase the granularity of the place formulation by zooming in on particular features of
the places. Additionally, these formulations may be offered by callers or solicited by calltakers.
Given that 9-1-1 Costa Rica is a centralized system, geographical formulations are
required in order to be able to assign the incident to the corresponding local dispatch
center. This type of place formulation shows a level of low granularity. By pursuing
geographical formulations, call-takers align with the needs of the institution (i.e., call-

200
takers are required to enter the district into the computer application in order for the
system to automatically input the corresponding county and province). Once this
information has been entered, call-takers proceed to enter the exact location, which
callers tend to formulate by means of landmark formulations (i.e., a type of place
formulation with a middle level of granularity) and “other signs” formulations (i.e., a type
of place formulation with a high level of granularity). Once the call-taker moves on to
verifying the caller’s information, he or she (i.e., the call-taker) indicates that the location
formulation is institutionally sufficient.
Lastly, callers and call-takers have different perspectives regarding what
constitutes a sufficient location formulation. These differences in perspectives may be
due to the institutional needs of a nation-wide emergency system and the constraints of
the computer application used by call-takers to enter the information about the call.
Additionally, callers might assume that call-takers are located in the same geographical
area as them and, therefore, might only provide landmark formulations. The data showed
that call-takers consider a location to be institutionally sufficient when it consists of both
geographical and landmark formulations. Call-takers may solicit “other signs”
formulations and accept them when they are offered by the callers; however, these
formulations are not mandatory in order for a place formulation to be considered
institutionally sufficient by call-takers. Thus, callers and call-takers work together to
build a location formulation that would make dispatching help possible.

Chapter 7
Conclusions and Implications
This dissertation examined interactions during calls to the 9-1-1 Emergency
System in Costa Rica. The aim of this dissertation was threefold. First, I explored the
overall structural organization of the calls in light of linguistic and institutional
peculiarities of the 9-1-1 system in Costa Rica. Second, I examined how callers design
their reason for calling the service. Third, I analyzed how incident locations are
formulated in this context. In what follows, I summarize the findings of the dissertation
and then discuss some implications of this research.
Overall structural organization of emergency calls
The overall structural organization of emergency calls is comprised of the
following constituent activities: an opening sequence, a reason for calling, an
interrogative series, a response of assistance, and a closing sequence. Overall, the
findings are in line with prior research. However, there are some linguistic and
institutional differences that seem to be particular to the dataset at hand. During the
opening sequence, call-takers open the call with a self-identifying statement, whereas
callers acknowledge having reached the service. Besides the acknowledgment token “sí”
(“yes,” in English), callers may also use the greeting form “buenas” (“good day”). In
their first turn-at-talk, callers may use a “buenas” pro-forma greeting, followed by the
reason for calling the service. In such a sequential environment, the pro-forma greeting
operates as an acknowledgment token, similar to “sí” (“yes,” in English), given that it
orients to the matter at hand. During their first turn-at-talk, callers may also use a full

202
greeting form with a rising intonation that invites a response from call-takers. In this
sequential environment, the full greeting form works as a summons, with callers seeming
to orient to check whether they can proceed with the call. In addition to the
aforementioned practices, callers may respond the call by apologizing (i.e., “disculpe,” or
“sorry,” in English) for calling and by thanking (i.e., “gracias,” or “thank you” in
English). Explicit apologies seem to preface a request that is not relevant to or in
accordance with the services offered by 9-1-1. More research is needed in order to better
understand the practice of initiating an emergency call via the phrase “thank you.”
During the interrogative series, call-takers collect information about the location
of the incident and nature of the problem. In addition, 9-1-1 Costa Rica instructs calltakers to verify the caller’s contact information (i.e., name and telephone number), as a
way to distinguish between prank calls and real incidents.
During the response of assistance, call-takers of 9-1-1 Costa Rica are instructed
not to promise help. This is in accordance with the nature of the emergency system (i.e.,
it serves as the linking organization for the responding organizations). In other words,
call-takers do not grant the assistance because that is the local dispatchers’ responsibility.
As call-takers cannot grant the assistance, they instead use a combination of any of the
following three components: (a) informing the caller that the information was/will be sent
to a dispatch center, (b) informing the caller that the dispatch center is in charge of
granting the assistance, and/or (c) instructing the caller to await the assistance.
During the closing sequence, callers and call-takers bring the call to an end. Calltakers initiate the closing of the call by providing their identification number. Callers tend
to thank call-takers for the service and, in doing so, orient to the closing of the call. Call-

203
takers may accept callers’ “thank you” by using an expression of service, such as “con
gusto” (“you’re welcome,” in English), “para servirle” (“I’m here to help,” in English),
or “a la orden” (“at your service,” in English).
Requesting help in calls to 9-1-1
The reason that individuals call 9-1-1 is to receive some sort of assistance. Callers
are found to use the following three forms in their reason for the call turns: explicit
requests, reports, and descriptions. The particular request design sheds some light on
callers’ orientations to their entitlement to the requested service and on the contingencies
involved in receiving the help.
Explicit requests solicit a particular service, such as a fire truck or an ambulance.
In designing their requests, callers may use: (a) practices that orient to the contingencies
involved in receiving the assistance, and/or (b) practices that orient to low entitlement to
the request. The grammatical form employed in the requests that contain the phrase “para
ver si” (“to see if,” in English) conveys the contingent nature of receiving the assistance
granted via the conditional nature (i.e., the use of the word “if”) of the phrase. The
request may also use “favor” and “amabilidad” (“kindness,” in English) constructions,
which present the caller as perceiving him or herself to have low entitlement to the
service. Additionally, the request turns may also include a variety of mitigating devices
(e.g., conditionals, modals). This typically happens when the incident is non-lifethreatening. These mitigating devices may downgrade the urgency of the incident and
present the outcome of the request as even more uncertain.
The reason for calling may be designed as a report, which uses a report-style
frame in combination with a police-relevant category that clearly classifies the incident

204
(e.g., as a fire, a car accident, an assault). By using a police-relevant category, callers
orient to the self-evident policeability of the reported incident. Callers who design the
request for help using a report-style frame present themselves as benefactors, or people
not directly involved in the incident. The findings show that reporting an incident can be
designed via the verbs “reportar” (“to report,” in English) and “denunciar” (“to
denounce,” in English), both of which share the meaning of communicating news and
seem to be used in similar interactional circumstances.
Descriptions are tellings that provide some kind of detailed information about the
nature of the incident. The findings show that there are two practices used by callers
when designing the request as a description: (a) practices orienting to low contingencies
in receiving the assistance, and (b) practices orienting to high contingencies of receiving
the assistance. In the first case, descriptions are designed as single-unit turns in which the
policeability of the incident is presented as being self-evident (i.e., via the use of policerelevant categories). In the second case, descriptions are commonly designed as multiunit turns that provide detailed information about the incident without labeling it in a
police-relevant way. In such cases, callers use prospective indexicals (e.g., the phrase “a
problem”) and then explain the situation via an extended telling.
Formulating place in calls to 9-1-1
Formulating the place of the incident is a fundamental activity during calls to 9-11, as the assistance needs to be dispatched to a particular place. The findings show that
three practices of place formulation exist: (a) geographical formulations, (b) landmark
formulations, and (c) “otras señas” (“other signs,” in English) formulations. These
practices correspond to different levels of granularity in the description of the place.

205
Geographical formulations mention the territorial divisions of Costa Rica. Three
mandatory components of this particular type of formulation were found: the province,
county, and district. Additionally, two optional components were also discovered: the
neighborhood and town. Callers tend to provide some sort of geographical formulation in
their requests for help. When this information is not offered by callers, call-takers will
solicit these formulations, as they are necessary in order to redirect the incident log to the
corresponding dispatch center.
Landmark formulations associate the location of the incident with a landmark.
The basic components of these formulations are: the landmark, the distance from the
landmark, and the “sentido” (“direction,” in English) of movement. Landmarks are the
starting point of the formulation, and they tend to be salient places in the community
(e.g., schools, churches, gas stations). The distance from the landmark can be expressed
using metric units (e.g., kilometers or meters), or by stating the side of the landmark (e.g.,
in front of, behind) in reference to something else. The direction of movement can be
expressed using cardinal directions if the incident happens inside (e.g., in a house or
building), or by referencing another town or landmark if the incident happens outside
(e.g., on a highway or street). Both callers and call-takers orient to deliver these three
basic components as a complete package.
“Otras señas” (“other signs,” in English) formulations are descriptions of places
that zoom in on particular features of the location. These formulations tend to include the
color and/or material of buildings, but they may also be descriptions of the surroundings
or physical characteristics of places. These formulations may be proffered by callers or
solicited by call-takers. Finally, a place formulation is institutionally sufficient when it

206
includes geographical formulations and landmark formulations. “Otras señas”
formulations, on the other hand, are optional.
By examining the activity of formulating place in the context of emergency calls
in Costa Rica, one is able to gain insight into how cultures organize their social world.
For instance, one learns about what a community considers to be a culturally salient
place, given that people make sense of places in different ways according to the cultural
practices of their community. For example, schools, churches, parks, bars, and town halls
are significant landmarks for Costa Ricans. These places index the Spanish heritage
implicated in the construction of settlements, given that the majority of the cities
conquered by Spain have the same urban configuration: a symmetrical block layout, in
which religious, civic, and entertainment establishments are either situated next to each
other or built around a football field.
By examining place formulations, one is able to gain access to a community’s
collective memory and social history. For example, some location formulations found in
the dataset referenced a “casa de abode” (“clay house,” in English) or a “pulpería”
(“small traditional grocery store,” in English). These are not only buildings – but also
social institutions – that tell us about the social history of Costa Rica in its early
independent life, as they take us back to the point in history in which clay houses and
“pulperías” were widespread throughout the country. Besides these two social
institutions, flora and the color of buildings are also salient in place formulations. For
instance, trees are commonly used as landmarks, and call-takers might solicit the color of
houses. Houses in neighborhoods may not have a number, but it is, however, very likely
that they are painted a certain color. Thus, it is common practice in Costa Rican

207
communities to use the color of the building as a way to locate a given place. By
examining place formulation in a Costa Rican context, one learns about other practices
that this community uses. It would be beneficial to extend this type of research to place
formulations within other linguistic and cultural communities around the world, since
little is currently known about how places are referred to when addresses are not readily
available.
Implications
This research contributes to this particular field of study in three different ways.
First, the dissertation contributes to Conversation Analysis and, particularly, to our
understanding of such conversational activities (e.g., requests and place formulations). By
exploring the activity of requesting help, this dissertation sheds light on the design of the
request in relation to the urgency of the incident. Using Costa Rican Spanish as a case
study, this dissertation demonstrated that the certainty/uncertainty of the requested
assistance may be already encoded in the language used. For example, I showed how the
grammaticalized phrase “para ver si” (“to see if,” in English) displays the caller’s
orientations to the uncertainty of receiving the requested help.
Furthermore, by examining the activity of formulating place, this dissertation
contributes to gaining a better understanding of how exactly participants formulate place,
as well as what practices are used by callers according to cultural and institutional
differences. Although the practice of using landmarks to formulate place is not exclusive
to Costa Rica, given that other communities might use similar practices, little research
has been conducted on place formulation from a conversation analytic perspective. Using
Costa Rica as a case study, I was able to identify and describe other practices (i.e., those

208
which entail formulating place in ways other than using an address) and the interactional
resources employed by participants. For example, describing the practice of formulating
place via landmark formulations informs us about the basic components of a landmark
formulation (i.e., the landmark, the distance from the landmark, and the direction of
movement), and about how participants orient to deliver those components as a complete
package. This dissertation sheds light on the practice of formulating place in a general
sense, and in the particular institutional context of calls to 9-1-1 services.
In addition, this dissertation contributes to Conversation Analysis by extending
research to languages other than English, (i.e., to Spanish in this particular case). While it
is true that prior research has examined interactional phenomena in Spanish (e.g., identity
negotiation via pronoun distinction, and bilingual and monolingual question design),
most of the conversation analytic research has been conducted in English-speaking
countries (e.g., the U.S. and the U.K.), and little research has been conducted in Spanish
in the context of emergency services. Examining interaction in other languages besides
English can identify new interactional phenomena specific to a particular culture, as well
as give us a more nuanced understanding of interactional phenomena that had only
previously been analyzed in English.
This dissertation also sheds light on the similarities among different kinds of
formulations, such as place formulation and person reference. Describing the activity of
place formulation in Costa Rica has the potential to inform about how person recognition
is secured. For example, Costa Rican place formulations highlight the importance of
recipient design in that the speaker has to select easily-identifiable landmarks in order to
secure place recognition. A similar process may apply to person references, as the

209
speaker has to select, out of a variety of possible references, the one best suited for
recognition by the addressee.
Second, this research extends one’s understanding of interaction on emergency
phone services. By analyzing the overall structural organization of emergency calls, this
dissertation serves to advance our understanding of all of the constituent activities in light
of cultural, linguistic, and institutional differences. For instance, we can witness cultural
differences in the use of greetings during the opening sequence. A linguistic difference
can be seen in the expression of uncertainty regarding the requested help via the
grammaticalized phrase “para ver si” (“to see if,” in English). Institutional differences
can also be seen in at least two constituent activities of calls: the interrogative series and
promise of assistance.
For example, the 9-1-1 service in Costa Rica instructs call-takers to verify callers’
information (i.e., name and telephone number) as a way to distinguish between prank
calls and real incidents; however, in several emergency centers in other countries, callers
remain anonymous. Additionally, call-takers from emergency centers in other countries
function as gatekeepers of the service who either do or do not grant the requested
assistance. On the other hand, call-takers of the 9-1-1 service in Costa Rica cannot
promise to provide assistance, as the system is a network that simply links callers to
responding teams. In addition, by examining the overall structural organization of calls
and by using the 9-1-1 service in Costa Rica as a case study, one gains a better
understanding of how other emergency centers are organized (e.g., as a linking network),
and how their goals are made visible to callers through talk-in-interaction (e.g., by
verifying callers’ information).

210
Third, in practical terms, this dissertation has the potential to inform, and possibly
improve, four main areas of the emergency service: the opening of the call, the request
for help, the formulation of place, and the promise of assistance. It was found that, after
the automatic recording which states the institutional identification during the opening of
the call, callers may initiate a repair in order to check whether to proceed with the call.
Opening the call with just the automatic recording (i.e., not followed by a categorical
self-identification from a human call-taker) seems to be problematic for callers, as they
are not sure whether they are talking to a human. By opening the call with both the
automatic recording and the categorical self-identification from a human call-taker, this
situation may be avoided and the progressivity of the interaction might not be halted to
check on the connection. Additionally, an alternative could be to not use the automatic
recording at all.
During the request for help phase, it was found that the request design is related to
the urgency of the reported incident. For example, via the grammaticalized phrase “para
ver si” (“to see if,” in English), callers display their orientations to the uncertainty of
receiving the assistance. Callers tend to use this phrase when reporting non-lifethreatening incidents, such as when requesting an ambulance for an asthmatic patient or
requesting a patrol car to check on a loud party at night. Requests for help for incidents of
“marginal urgency” tend to be designed using linguistic constructions that already encode
the uncertainty regarding receiving the assistance. This practice informs us about the
urgency of the incident; thus, it may also be helpful for call-takers when classifying the
incident in the incident log.

211
During the interrogative series, the location of the incident, as well as other type
of information, is gathered. Place formulation in Costa Rica is commonly seen as chaotic;
however, it was found that, in the context of emergency calls and as is the case with any
other interactional activity, it is an organized activity. This is because callers tend to
provide some sort of geographical formulation along with the reason for calling, followed
by landmark formulations. This research informs us about practices used by callers and
call-takers when co-constructing the location of the incident, as well as about when a
place formulation is institutionally sufficient in the context of 9-1-1 services in Costa
Rica.
In the promise of assistance phase, call-takers of 9-1-1 services in Costa Rica
cannot grant the assistance, as the system simply serves as the link between callers and
the responding teams. Instead, call-takers use a combination of components to inform
callers that the responding team has received the information and that the team will be in
charge of either granting or not granting the assistance. One of these components
employed by call-takers is the “esté pendiente” construction, the meaning of which is
ambiguous. On the one hand, it could mean that the caller should “keep an eye out for the
assistance,” or, on the other hand, that the response team should “be alert for the incident
log.” It was found that this particular component was flagged by call-takers, as it could be
hearable as a virtual promise of assistance. This creates false expectations among callers
regarding receiving the service and assistance, and it also negatively impacts the
institutional image of 9-1-1 services in Costa Rica. The latter was mentioned by 9-1-1
officials during the interviews. Therefore, when call-takers avoid using the “esté

212
pendiente” construction, callers may not hear a virtual promise of help, and the
emergency service thus avoids receiving complaints from callers.
The findings of this dissertation might be used to design training workshops for 91-1 Costa Rica in order to address some of the common problems that participants
experience during calls to the emergency service. Training materials could also be
developed in order to address issues such as: how to ensure the progressivity of the
interaction during the opening of the call; how callers might request help and how the
design of the request may relate to the urgency of the call; how to navigate place
formulations to ensure to collect adequate locational information; and how to promise
assistance, keeping in mind the institutional constraints of the Costa Rican emergency
service.

Appendix A
Conversation Analytic Transcription Conventions

The dissertation uses the conversation analytic transcription system developed by
Jefferson (Jefferson, 1984). All transcript lines are numbered. Participants are identified
as call-takers (CT), callers (C), supervisors (SP), dispatch center (DC), and third parties
(TP). The following conventions were used throughout this dissertation (for a complete
description, see Hepburn and Bolden 2013):

[

]

a=a

Square brackets: overlapping talk
Equal sign: latching or no hearable silence
between turns

(0.5)

Numbers in parentheses: silence measured in
seconds

(.)

Period in parentheses: a micropause

.

Period: falling intonation

?

Question mark: strong rising intonation

,

Comma sign: slightly rising intonation

¿

Inverted question mark: rising intonation that
is stronger than the comma sign, but not as
strong as the question mark sign

aaa

Underlining: emphasis in one particular element
of the word

220
AA

Upper-case letters: high volume or loud talk

ºaº

Degree signs: quiet talk

ººaºº

Double degree signs: very quiet talk, whispering

>a<

Greater-than and less-than symbols: rushed talk

<a>

Less-than and greater-than symbols: slow talk

a:

Colon: elongation of a sound

a-

Hyphen: cut-off in the production of a sound

#aa#

Number sign: creaky voice

((a))

Double parentheses: annotations of events

(

Single parentheses: uncertain hearing

)

a/b

Slash: two possible hearings

.hhh

period and “h” letter: aspiration or in-breath

hhh

outbreath

221

Appendix B
Leipzig Glossing Rules

The glossing system used in the interlinear transcription is based on the Leipzig
Glossing Rules (Comrie et al., 2015). However, this dissertation does not strictly follow
all the conventions. Due to this dissertation’s objectives, some modifications have been
made and they will be clearly layout out. As mentioned in Chapter three “Methodology
and Data”, this dissertation uses a three-line transcript: the first line is the object-language
(i.e., Costa Rican Spanish), the second line is the meta language (i.e., a gloss with some
grammatical information), and the third line is an idiomatic translation into English.
Excerpt 1 (below) shows how this three-line transcript works:
(1) ECR-172 Driving lesson
002

CT:

Emergencias nueve uno uno¿
Emergencies nine one one¿
Nine one one emergency¿

(first line)
(second line)
(third line)

In what follows I will describe the Leipzig Glossing Rules used in this
dissertation.
Rule 1: Word-by-word alignment. The object-language (i.e., Costa Rican
Spanish) and the metalanguage (i.e., the gloss) are aligned word-by-word. It is a vertical
and left-alignment that only applies to the first and second lines of the transcript.
(2) ECR-215 Crash in the Escazú park
025

CT:

Okey cuál
es su
nombre disculpe¿
Okay which is your name
pardon.3SG
Okay what is your name please¿

222

Rule 2: Word-by-word correspondence. According to the Leipzig Glossing
Rules, the gloss is a morpheme-by-morpheme correspondence between the objectlanguage and the metalanguage. However, due to the objectives of this dissertation, this
rule has been modified and morphemes have not been marked in Spanish. In this
dissertation, the correspondence between Spanish and the metalanguage is a word-byword glossing.
(3) ECR-172 Driving lesson
037

C:

Solo ahí
en la plaza.
Only there in the plaza
Just there in the plaza.

Rule 3: Grammatical category labels. The gloss will mark some relevant
grammatical categories following the standard abbreviations. The abbreviations used in
this dissertation are:
1

first person

2

second person

3

third person

COND

conditional

DIM

diminutive

FUT

future

INF

infinitive

IMP

imperative

IND

indicative (default mode, therefore, not marked in the gloss)

PL

plural

223
SUBJV

subjunctive

SG

singular

(4) ECR-178 Fire in a slum
019

CT:

Permítame
señor.
Allow.IMP.2SG-me sir
Hold on sir.
