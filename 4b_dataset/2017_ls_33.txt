ABSTRACT
Novotny, Rebecca Maria, The hidden roles of the school librarian. Doctor of Education
(Educational Leadership), May, 2017, Sam Houston State University, Huntsville, Texas.
Purpose
The purpose of this mixed methods study was to define the roles of school
librarians as perceived by librarians and principals in regard to the ALA/AASL Standards
for the Initial Preparation of School Librarians (2010). This study was designed to
explore the perceptions of librarians and principals on the role of the librarian in the
school and library. The views of librarians and principals were explored on how the
library enhances student achievement.
Method
A mixed methods approach was used to learn the perceptions of the librarians and
principals on the role of the librarian. The study was conducted in a school district in
Texas. All of the principals and librarians in the district were invited to participate. The
survey was sent to 57 librarians and 23 principals. The data was collected using a survey
that was administered through the online tool SurveyMonkey. The survey consisted of
twenty-one questions that were a combination of Likert scale and open-ended questions.
Findings
The librarians rated their library programs as good, but with room for
improvement under the standards. When the librarians were asked to define their roles in
their own words, they defined themselves as librarians, teachers, leaders, and managers.
When asked how they believed that their principals view the role of the librarian, many
thought that they were viewed as clerks and support staff. Some of the librarians stated
that their principals saw them as teachers and literacy leaders. The librarians felt that

iv

their library programs enhance student achievement, but that more support would allow
them to enhance student learning even more.
The principals rated their library programs and librarians as excellent under the
standards. When asked to define the role of the librarian in their own words, the
principals called them literacy advocates, cheerleaders, team players. When the
principals were asked to define the role of the librarian in the school, they stated teacher,
leader, and literacy advocate. The principals felt that the library enhanced student
achievement, and the librarians support student learning by encouraging reading as well
as teaching skills that reinforce what is learned in the classroom.

KEY WORDS: School librarians, Principals, Librarian roles, ALA/AASL Standards for
the Initial Preparation of School Librarians, Student achievement

CHAPTER I
Introduction
What exactly do school librarians do all day? That is a question for the ages.
When this question is asked of teachers and administrators, the answers tend to vary, but
a common answer is that librarians read books all day. The answer tends to be what most
people remember from their own experiences with school librarians who they often saw
with books, reading, checking in and out, and shelving. However, those in the
profession know this answer covers only a small part of the role most librarians play in
their schools since it does not matter âwhether it is high school, middle school, or
elementary school, the library media specialist hits the ground running each day. For
many, their background is the classroom, and, as media specialists, they have taken on
the largest classroom in the schoolâ (Dees et al, 2007, p. 10). In this âclassroomâ,
librarians may read to students or review materials for teachers, but most of their reading
is done outside of the school setting as they focus on their studentsâ and teachersâ
becoming lifelong readers and learners. Every school district has its own job description
for school librarians, but all tend to include concepts and language that relate to the
librarian being a leader, an instructional partner, an information specialist, a teacher, and
a program administrator. In 2009, the American Association of School Librariansâ
affiliate Learning4Life worked to create a sample job description that incorporated the
guidelines in Empowering Learners (Ballard, 2009, p. 78-82). This description expanded
upon the roles that school librarians play in school in order to provide school librarians
with a better understanding of their roles and responsibilities. Under the Leader tag, it
states that a librarian should âdemonstrate his or her role as a visible and active leader

2
within the school community, and advocate for the [school library media program], and
be a professional member of the school library communityâ (Ballard, 2009, p. 80). The
description then lists specific examples of what a librarian in the role of leader and
advocate should be seen doing in the school community. This same format is followed
for instructional partner, information specialist, teacher, and program administrator. The
tasks that are included in the job description include serving on decision making teams,
promoting the ethical use of materials, collaborating with teachers, organizing the
collection for effective use, working with students, and selecting materials for the
collections. While this is not an exhaustive list, it does represent a small portion of the
hidden tasks that librarians do each day in their school libraries.
âSchool Libraries Make a Differenceâ from the website ilovelibraries at
www.ilovelibraries.org is the headline of a collection of research that aims to prove the
importance of school libraries and school librarians. This headline can be juxtaposed
with the headlines from the past few years that announced the loss of school librarian
positions around the country. Tough decisions were (and are still) having to be made on
what programs should be cut, which staff members could be eliminated, and how cuts
will affect student achievement and the school environment. According to the
superintendent of a district in Pennsylvania when asked, âWhat do we value most?â
(Santos, 2011 p. 17), the district chose to protect class sizes, physical education, and
prekindergarten. He stated, âIt was either library or kindergartenâ (Santos, 2011 p. 17).
It is this same choice that many schools face as budgets are being slashed, and some
decision makers feel that âadvances in technology and the wealth of information
available online can appear to make rooms filled with books obsoleteâ (Resmovits, 2011

3
para. 6). It is this very belief that shows why understanding the roles that a librarian
plays in the school is so important. Multiple state studies by the researcher Keith Curry
Lance have shown that schools with a certified librarian and a robust library have higher
achievement scores than those without a librarian or with little to no access to current,
robust library resources. When librarians are afforded the chance to exercise teaching
and leading roles, instead of just being managing books and the rooms that hold them, the
belief that they are not needed is diminished.
In Texas, $5.4 billion dollars in education funding cut by the state legislature led
to some serious soul-searching and cost cutting measures in districts across the state. A
great deal of the budget cuts came in the form of staff reductions. Across the state, â3
percent of counselors, 2 percent of teachers, 1 percent of nurses, and 9 percent of
librarians were cutâ (Michels, 2013 para. 3). According to statistics from the Texas
Education Agency, there were 5,061 full time equivalent (FTE) school librarians serving
4,651,516 students in the 2007 to 2008 school year (Texas Library Association, 2009, p.
10). That number decreased to 4,602 FTE school librarians serving 5,151,923 students in
the 2013 to 2014 school year ("School Libraries," 2014). The cuts in school librarians
lead to each librarian providing services to over 1119 students. In the Houston
Independent School District [HISD], the largest district in the state, approximately 60%
of the schools did not have a certified librarian in 2013 (Mellon, 2013). Several of the
surrounding districts stated that they had kept at least one certified librarian on each of
their campuses. With principals being in charge of hiring at their schools in HISD, the
decision to have a library and/or a librarian can be a difficult one when budgets are being
cut each year, enrollment projections change, or there is a lack of understanding of the

4
role of the librarian. The lack of understanding of the roles and impact that a certified
librarian has on student achievement, as well as a lack of state and federal regulations
requiring school librarians on the campus, has led to cuts in school librarian positions. In
Texas, school districts have authority over whether library programs are staffed or funded
("Standards and Laws by Library Type: School Libraries and Librarians," 2010).
Problem Statement
This lack of understanding of the role that school librarians play in building (a)
the literacy skills of their students, (b) the academic growth of their campus, and (c) the
culture of the school itself has led to a trend of removing certified professional librarians
from schools and placing non-certified personnel or parents in the libraries in their place
(McCracken, 2001).
When librarians themselves are asked what their role in schools is, they are often
unable to clearly articulate what they do or should be doing as leaders, advocates, and
teachers. The answers that librarians often give relate to the programing for which they
are responsible, the administrative and clerical work required for the library, and other
duties given to them by the administrators of their schools. These tasks, while often- but
not always- part of the job, describe only part of what librarians do in their buildings.
The library related tasks that librarians do are necessary to the running of a successful
library program such as cataloging, repairing books, and shelving as well as running the
circulation desk. These tasks are necessary, but they are often the only ones that teachers
and administrators observe librarians doing. Often forgotten is the fact that school
librarians are teachers; in fact, the role of teacher should be a major one that librarians
play. While the tasks that librarians perform are needed to have a strong library

5
program, the roles of teacher, instructional partner, leader, advocate, information
specialist, and program administrator are what truly allow the librarian to build a
successful student-centered library program that helps the academic growth and culture
of the school.
When librarians are not able to articulate the importance of their roles, they fail to
advocate for themselves, for their library programs, the reading and academic enrichment
that they provide, the collaboration with teachers that leads to student success and a
positive school environment. Zmuda and Harada (2008), in their article on librarians as
learning specialists, found that âthe crux of the problem is that most administrators and
staff fundamentally do not understand what is possible (despite many valiant efforts by
teacher-librarians to explain it). Administrators cannot separate out the librarian from the
library because of minimal to no knowledge of the professionâ (Zmuda & Harada, 2008
p. 15). This lack of understanding by administrators and librariansâ inability to verbalize
what they do that leads to confusion and misunderstandings about the roles that librarians
play in creating lifelong readers and learners as well as inclusive and positive school
cultures. When librarians are able to articulate their roles and programs, student
achievement and interest in learning and reading grow. Therefore it is important for
librarians and administrators to fully understand the roles that librarians play in building
student achievement and a culture of learning in schools. Without this understanding,
librariansâ importance in schools will continue to be invisible and library programs not
used appropriately to enhance student achievement.

6
Purpose
Through this study, I developed an understanding of how the American Library
Association/ American Association of School Librarians (AASL) Standards for Initial
Preparation of School Librarians (2010) were being implemented with respect to the role
of school librarians in an urban/suburban school district in Southeast Texas. The purpose
of this mixed methods study was to define the roles of school librarians as perceived by
both the librarians themselves and the administrators in their schools in regard to the
ALA/AASL Standards for the Initial Preparation of School Librarians (2010). In this
study, I focused on how both librarians and principals perceived the role of the librarian
and how the librarians implemented the ALA/AASL Standards for Initial Preparation of
School Librarians (2010) to develop a vibrant library program that enhanced student
achievement.
Significance of the Study
This study will be significant in determining how school librarians may impact
both the culture and the academic performance of schools by examining the perceptions
of librarians and administrators in terms of the AASL Standards. As a result of this
study, a clearer definition emerged regarding the roles school librarians played in literacy
growth, studentsâ academic growth, and the culture of the school environment. Through
this study, I developed recommendations for how administrators can best utilize
librarians in their schools. Hopefully, this knowledge will lead to a better understanding
for school librarians and administrators as to the roles that librarians play in schools as
well as impact the policies and decisions have in relation to school librarians and school
libraries.

7
Since the first study was published in 1993 by Keith Curry Lance with a focus on
Colorado school libraries, there have been many studies that have connected student
achievement growth with the presence of certified school librarians on campuses.
Starting in 2000, many states conducted studies based on the original Lance study that
produced the same results. In 2000, the state of Texas conducted a study on school
libraries that became known as the Texas Study. The authors found that schools staffed
with librarians had students that performed higher on state tests than those with no
librarians. In 2011, the Pennsylvania School Library Study was conducted to take a
snapshot of school library programs and their effect on student achievement. With only
73% of schools participating, the researchers found that approximately 200,000 students
were affected when library programs were eliminated or reduced. The researchers also
found that schools with full-time certified librarians had students with stronger reading
and writing scores than those schools without full-time certified librarians. An impact
that the researchers found interesting was that having a full-time certified librarian,
affected writing scores more than it did reading scores.
Research Questions
The following research questions guided this study:
1.

How do school librarians describe their role in schools?

2.

What do principals perceive as the role of the school librarian in the
school?

3.

In what ways do school librariansâ and principalsâ perceptions overlap and
diverge in terms of the 2010 ALA/AASL Standards for the Initial
Preparation of School Librarians?

8
Conceptual Framework
The framework that was used in this study was the American Library Association
(ALA) and American Association of School Librarians (AASL) Standards for Initial
Preparation of School Libraries (2010). The American Library Association is the oldest
and largest association in support of librarians in the world. Its mission is âto provide
leadership for the development, promotion and improvement of library and information
services and the profession of librarianship in order to enhance learning and ensure
access to information for allâ ("About ALA," n.d. para. 2). The American Association of
School Librarians, an affiliate of the American Library Association, is the only national
organization focused solely on school librarians. It became a part of the American
Library Association in 1951 and its function is to empower school librarians to support
and transform the learning community and the library. Both of these organizations are
involved with creating standards that are used by states to develop state level standards
and with the accreditation of librarian certification programs. The standards that were
used in this research project were the most current at the time; the national organizations
were in the process of rewriting the standards for the preparation of school librarians.
The Standards were also approved by the Specialty Areas Studies Board (SASB)
of the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE), both
certification boards. In 2013, the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher
Education consolidated with the Teacher Education Accreditation Council to become the
Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation (CAEP). âCAEP goals are to raise
the performance of candidates as practitioners in the nationâs P-12 schools and to raise
standards for the evidence the field relies on to supports its claims of quality. By meeting

9
these goals, NCATE and TEAC leaders believe they will raise the stature of the
professionâ (Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation (CAEP), n.d. para. 2).
The Standards were meant to guide and prepare librarians and librarian candidates
to develop and manage programs for and in school libraries (âALA/AASL Standards for
Initial Preparation of School Librarian,â 2010). There were five standards with four
elements that further clarify what librarians and librarian candidates should be able to
demonstrate. Table 1 below lists the standards and their clarifying elements. The
standards also included a rubric for each standard that could be used to measure the
librarian candidatesâ knowledge. These standards and competencies helped to define the
roles that school librarians play, as well as give a framework for this this study.

Delimitations
For this study, I chose to limit the site choice to one suburban school district in
the state of Texas, using a convenience method for selecting the district. I selected my
sample using a purposive criterion sampling process and limited the study to the K-12
librarians and principals in the district. The degree of generalizability of the study was
limited to districts that had a similar composition to the district being studied. This study
was also limited by the research questions. The research was confined to the perceptions
of the librarians and principals on the role of the school librarian in the school. Another
delimitation was the use of the ALA/AASL Standards for the Initial Preparation of
School Librarians 2010. At the time that this study was completed, the ALA/AASL
Standards were being revised, but this study was done with the most current standards
that were available. The time period of this study was also a delimitation. This study
was completed during the end of the 2015-2016 school year. During that time, testing and
other considerations made contact with the participants difficult.
Limitations
One limitation of this study was the believed accuracy of the responses provided
by participants on the self-report questionnaires. Surveys were kept confidential, and as

12
the researcher, I assumed that all participants were completely honest in their responses.
The questions in the survey were created to be as free of bias as possible.
My role as both the researcher and one of the librarians in the district may have
been a limitation. I was a member of the school community where the research was
conducted and knew many of the participants. I worked to ensure that my own
perceptions were free from bias as I analyzed the data. Another limitation was the
number of participants in the study. The amount of study participants for the study
consisted of all of the librarians and all of the principals in the district. This sampling
placed the size of the group of participants at about 80 people in each group.
Assumptions
An assumption of the study was that the information shared by the participants in
the questionnaire was accurate and honest. In order to ensure that the questions on the
survey aligned with the research questions, I conducted a pilot study of the questionnaire
with three teachers, two librarians, and two administrators to establish content validity.
An assumption was that the librarians and principals in the selected district willingly
participated in the surveys and were not coerced to participate in any way.
Summary
The purpose of this mixed methods study was to define the roles of school
librarians as perceived by both the librarians themselves and the administrators in their
schools in regard to the ALA/AASL Standards for the Initial Preparation of School
Librarians 2010. As budgets are being tightened, and jobs and programs are being cut, it
is important to understand the role that school librarians play in enhancing student
achievement and developing a school-wide culture of literacy and learning. This study

13
used the ALA/AASL Standard for Initial Preparation of School Librarians 2010 as a
framework to answer the following research questions:
1.

How do school librarians describe their role in schools?

2.

What do principals perceive as the role of the school librarian in the
school?

3.

In what ways do school librariansâ and principalsâ perceptions overlap and
diverge in terms of the 2010 ALA/AASL Standards for the Initial
Preparation of School Librarians?

The conclusions drawn from this research study were then used to inform the
participating district how to develop a stronger library program that values the roles that
librarians play in student achievement.
Organization of the Study
This study is presented in five chapters. Chapter I included the background and
purpose of the study, statement of the problem, research questions, and definitions of
terms, delimitations, limitations, and assumptions. Chapter II included the review of the
literature organized around the five standards that make up the ALA/AASL Standards for
Initial Preparation School Librarians. It included a section on the history of the school
library and the history of the library standards as well as a review of administratorsâ
perspectives of the school library and the role of the library. The chapter closed with a
review of the Texas and Pennsylvania library studies as well as a summary of any
recently published studies. Chapter III contained a description of the methodology,
including the design of the study, the sampling and site choice, and descriptions of the
survey. The third chapter also included a description of the data collection that I engaged

14
in, the trustworthiness of the research, and my subjectivity as the researcher. Chapter IV
included a presentation of the data. The final chapter, Chapter V, contained an analysis
of the data as well as a discussion of the findings and suggestions for further research.

15
CHAPTER II
Literature Review
American School Librarians have a short but active history. The evolution of
school libraries started in American in 1892 when New York State passed legislation for
the development of school libraries (Jeffus, 2002, p. 13), but it was not until 1914 that the
American Association of School Librarians (AASL) was formed as the School Library
section of the American Library Association (Jeffus, 2002, p. 13). The first set of school
library standards was adopted in 1920 (Jeffus, 2002, p. 13). In 1945, the school library
committee of AASL created its first set of standards titled, School libraries for Today and
Tomorrow Functions and Standards, which was a revised version of ALAâs Certain
Standards (Jones, 2004). These standards differentiated between the duties of school
librarians and public librarians as well as the different services that were offered to and in
schools (Jones, 2004). These standards also emphasized that collaboration with teachers
and planning as well as the need for collection analysis and statistics should be used in
budget requests (Jones, 2004). These groundbreaking standards were revised in 1960
with the newly revised standards focusing on the development of the student (Jones,
2004). The librarianâs role was expanded to become an important part of classroom
instruction and not just limited to library instruction when teaching library and research
skills (Jones, 2004). The standards emphasized that library programs should be student
centered and focus on individual student development. It also urged librarians to
collaborate with teachers when purchasing and using materials in the library. For the
first time, audiovisual materials were also placed under the scope of the librarian (Jones,
2004). Revisions to the standards occurred and in 1969, AASL and the Department of

16
Audio-Visual Instruction developed the Standards for School Media Programs (Jones,
2004). These standards placed an emphasis on librarians working with teachers to
incorporate technologies and other materials into classroom instruction as well as the role
that librarians play in developing studentsâ reading, listening, and viewing skills (Jones,
2004). From that time, the standards have been updated and edited until the current
standards were adopted in 2010.
In the state of Texas, the first account of a school library is in a New Braunfels
school in 1854 (Paris, 2010). According to Janelle Paris (2010), the Texas Library
Association was established in 1902, and within ten years the school libraries in Texas
rose from 450 to 1,978. Paris (2010) found that most of these early libraries lacked
standards, support, and trained personnel. They also were mainly places to store the
supplementary reading materials that were used by the students (Paris, 2010). Besides
teachers and students raising money to support and supplement the school libraries, the
public libraries and the Texas State Library were also supplying or checking out books to
students and school libraries (Paris, 2010). In 1915, the Texas State Teachers
Association added a library section that worked to create standards for school libraries
and to raise the status of school librarians among professional librarians (Paris, 2010).
The State Department of Education added a school library specialist to its staff in 1946
and that became a catalyst for the development of the school library program in Texas
(Paris, 2010). What followed were decades of positive changes and growth for school
libraries and librarians in the state of Texas (Paris, 2010).

17
History of Library Standards
School libraries and librarians have appeared in Texas schools for years, with the
earliest recorded account being a library started in a New Braunfels school in 1854 (Paris,
2010). The Texas Library Association (TLA) was established in 1902, (Paris, 2010) and
the American Association of School Librarians (AASL) was created as a division of the
American Library Association (ALA) in 1951 (Adcock & Ballard, 2015). Through these
developments in the library world, two sets of school library standards were developed
and followed. The first was Standard Library Organization and Equipment for Secondary
Schools of Different Sizes which was published in 1920 by ALA. The second set,
created in 1925, was entitled Elementary School Library Standards (Adcock & Ballard,
2015). In 1943, Frances Henne called for the development of one set of standards for
both elementary and high school libraries (Jones, 2004). These standards, published in
1945, were called School Libraries for Today and Tomorrow (Adcock & Ballard, 2015).
Since that first set of joint standards was published, it has been revised in 1960, 1969,
1979, 1988, 1998, and finally in 2007 with the AASL creation of Standards for the 21stCentury Learner. The 2007 standards focused on learners and led to the creation in 2009
of Empowering Learners: Guidelines for School Library Programs and Standards for the
21st-Century Learner in Action (Adcock & Ballard, 2015). Empowering Learners:
Guidelines for School Library Programs is a set of guidelines for school librarians to
build school library programs that meet the needs of the changing school library program
and environment. This resource gives school librarians as shown in Tables 2 through 4, a
set of goals and principles to use when designing and/or updating a school library

18
program. In the book, each principle and guideline has a set of actions for school
librarians to follow in order to meet the guideline and principle for empowering learners.

The school library program promotes reading as a
foundational skill for learning, personal growth, and
enjoyment.

Addressing Multiple Literacies

The school library program provides instruction that
addresses multiple literacies, including information
literacy, media literacy, visual literacy, and technology
literacy.

Effective Practices for Inquiry

The school library program models an inquiry-based
approach to learning and the information search process.

Assessment in Teaching for
Learning

The school library program is guided by regular
assessment of student learning to ensure the program is
meeting its goals.

Under the guideline of teaching for learning, librarians are shown to be
instructional partners and leaders of change. This is important as librarians are teachers
and should be seen as collaborators with classroom teachers when working with students.
The librarian acts as a model for implementing inquiry lessons, reading for enjoyment,
addressing learning in multiple literacies, and student assessment. By partnering with
classroom teachers, librarians are able to help demonstrate and assess the use of student-

19
centered inquiry models that help students to use and interact with information in a way
that builds their learning and achievement.

Planning and Evaluating the School
Library Program

The school library program is built on a long-term strategic
plan that reflects the mission, goals, and objectives of the
school.

Staffing

The school library program has a minimum of one full-time
certified/licensed librarian supported by qualified staff
sufficient for the schoolâs instructional programs, services,
facilities, size, and number of teachers and students.

The Learning Space

The school library program includes flexible and equitable
access to physical and virtual collections of resources that
support the school curriculum and meet the diverse needs of
all learners.

The Budget

The school library program has sufficient funding to
support priorities and make steady progress to attain the
programâs mission, goals, and objectives.

Policies

The school library program includes policies, procedures,
and guidelines that support equitable access to ideas and
information throughout the school community.

Collection and Information Access

The school library program includes a well-developed
collection of books, periodicals, and non-print material in a
variety of formats that support curricular topics and are
suited to inquiry learning and usersâ needs and interests.

Outreach

The school library program is guided by an advocacy plan
that builds support from decision makers who affect the
quality of the school library program.

Professional Development

The school library program includes support for school
librarian and teacher professional development to sustain
and increase knowledge and skills.

20
Table 3 focuses on the guidelines that librarians should follow when building the
learning environment. The library program itself should be built on a solid plan that
reflects the mission of the school. It is important that the library program be developed
as a collaboration between school administrators and the librarian so that the missions,
plans, and goals of the school and the library work in sync to develop a community of
learners and build student achievement. This also allows for the librarian to advocate for
the staff, materials, and support that is needed to have a successful library program.
While at the same time ensuring that the school administration and community
understand the importance of the library program and library to the school community.

The Standards for the 21st-Century Learner in Action takes the standards that
were first introduced in Standards for the 21st-Century Learner and provides examples
and benchmarks for what those standards look like in action. This is a resource and guide
for librarians as they develop programs that implement the standards. It provides
examples of how the skills can be taught at different grade levels as well as what skills
students should be able to demonstrate by certain grade levels. These two books, along
with the Standards for Initial Preparation of School Librarians, were revised in 2010 and
are currently used by librarians today to build strong libraries and library programs.

21
Description of Library Standards for Initial Preparation of School Librarians
In this study, I used the American Library Association and American Association
of School Librarians Standards for Initial Preparation of School Librarians (2010) as a
framework and to define what skills and roles school librarians should be demonstrating
in schools. The standards were created for use by certification programs to guide and
prepare librarians and librarian candidates to develop and manage programs for and in
school libraries ("ALA/AASL Standards for Initial Preparation of School Librarians,"
2010). There were five areas around which the standards are organized. Each standard
had four elements that further clarified what librarians and librarian candidates should be
able to demonstrate evidence of know and doing as part of a library program. A rubric
was also included for each standard to measure the candidatesâ knowledge.
This set of standards was developed beginning in 2007 when the Specialty Areas
Studies Board required a review of the preparation standards for school librarians
("ALA/AASL Standards for Initial Preparation of School Librarians," 2010). The
standards were revised using public comment, research inquiry, and the assessment of the
preparation standards of other organizations as well as AASLâs own Standards for the
21st-Centrury Learner (2007), Standards for the 21st-Century Learner in Action (2009),
and Empowering Learners: Guidelines for School Library Programs (2009). The
revisions from the 2003 standards used for the preparation of school librarians addressed
and focused on critical aspects of the work that librarians do in schools. Each standard
included a focus on student learning with elements that were clear and measurable, see
Table 1 for details on the standards and elements. The standards document also

22
contained a rubric for each standard and research that explained and supported each
standard.
Roles of Librarians based on the Library Standards
Standard 1: Teaching and Learning. The first standard is titled âTeaching and
Learning.â Under this standard librarians and librarian candidates focus on teaching
skills and being instructional leaders. All four of the elements that make up the standard
focus on the instructional aspects of the librariansâ roles as teachers. Librarians are
teachers and must demonstrate knowledge of learning styles, the development of students
as learners, and instructional design ("ALA/AASL Standards for Initial Preparation of
School Librarians," 2010). All of these skills are measured in the first element and are
skills that help librarians influence student achievement because librarians are âno longer
simply the âkeeper of books,â todayâs teacher-librarians are instructional leaders whose
activities are woven throughout the schoolâs curriculumâ (Lamb & Johnson, 2008, pp.
74). Zumda and Harada (2008) in their article for Teacher Librarian, discussed a
problem faced by school librarians is the lack of understanding by their administration of
their roles. They shared that a librarian can be categorized as both a teacher and a
learning specialist as âthey view their work as âthe schoolâs workââ¦because the
significance of the learning that is conducted in the library is at the heart of the schoolâs
missionâ (Zumda & Harada, 2008, pp. 18). As they teach in the library and work
collaboratively with teachers, librarians are able to âmonitor student learning and [make]
adjustments in âreal timeâ without compromising studentsâ opportunity to learnâ (Zumda
& Harada, 2008, pp. 18). Each time a librarian works with students, he/she is acting as a

23
teacher to build 21st century skills in students as well as working to create lifelong
readers and learners.
The librariansâ ability to be an effective and knowledgeable teacher for his or her
students is the second element under standard one ("ALA/AASL Standards for Initial
Preparation of School Librarians," 2010). School librarians are also teachers and, as
such, they are knowledgeable about learning styles, instructional strategies, and
assessment tools to use when presenting to students and staff. This is demonstrated by
the librarian who states that âvarying the instructional materials and assignments allows
me to teach â¦ [the same] units [to different grade levels] while stressing different
learning objectives at each level thus preventing repetitionâ (Kachka, 2009, pp. 20).
Librarians do this each time that they adapt materials to meet the needs of their students
and staff as well as providing choices of materials that can be used successfully by
students and teachers who are at different levels. According to Kachka (2009), who in
her article for School Library Media Activities Monthly found that using a differentiated
instruction technique helped her elementary students understand and develop the 21st
century skills that they need. The knowledge of learning styles, instructional strategies,
curriculum, and school communities allows for a diverse library collection that is unique
to the school community and the needs of the students and staff who use the library for
knowledge and pleasure.
In addition to being effective and knowledgeable teachers as described in element
two of the standard, librarians also must be instructional partners with their fellow
teachers. Element three describes the way that librarians should be collaborative partners
in the school community for both student and professional development. Kristine Woods

24
(2014) in her article, âA Footprint for Collaborationâ in Teacher Librarian on the
importance of collaboration, found that âcollaboration between teacher librarian and
classroom teacher produces positive results (pp. 13).â These collaborations lead to higher
student engagement and more quality work (Woods, 2014). When collaborative
relationships are created, then an environment is built âin which people feel safe to take
risks, to try something new to improve professional practices and develop new
instructional strategiesâ (Woods, 2014, pp. 16).
Another aspect of being a strong teacher librarian is described in element four
which focuses on librarians being advocates for 21st century learning and teaching in the
school community. In the article, âThe school librarian as teacher: What kind of teacher
are you?â for Knowledge Quest, Buffy Hamilton (2011) discusses how âthe possibilities
of the library as a learning space disrupt traditional precepts of the library as a data
warehouse and instead establish the library as a site of participatory culture.â Creating
collaborative relationships with teachers, being knowledgeable and active teachers, and
advocating for information literacy leads to a participatory culture of learning from
students, teachers, and librarians in both the library and classrooms of the school
(Hamilton, 2011). The use of multiple literacies to teach content, critical thinking, and
emerging technologies are part of the strategies that librarians use to integrate 21st
century skills and standards in to the library. When librarians and teachers collaborate
during lesson planning and teaching, librarians are able to advocate and demonstrate the
use of information literacy skills. This type of advocacy and team teaching helps to build
valuable skills needed for students to succeed and transforms the learning environment
(Woods, 2014).

25
Standard 2: Literacy and Reading. The second standard emphasizes literacy
and reading. This standard focuses on what is considered the more traditional aspects of
librarianship - âreading for learning, personal growth, and enjoymentâ ("ALA/AASL
Standards for Initial Preparation of School Librarians," 2010, pp. 6). Here candidates
and current librarians stay current on trends and growth in literature, the multiple formats
of literature, and how they are used to support reading instruction and pleasure. The
skills that are developed and measured in standard two are used to build patrons into
lifelong readers. The standard also supports standard one by reiterating the knowledge of
reading strategies and instruction that librarians have which help support classroom
teachers build readers.
The first element under standard two concerns literature and reinforces that
librarians and library candidates should be familiar with a wide range of materials from
childrenâs, young adult, and professional writings. âAs the most information-rich, printrich, media-rich environment in a school, school library media centers are treasure troves
for learners of all agesâ (Moreillon, 2009, pp. 24). This is why the standards and
elements emphasis how important it is for the librarian to be familiar with the multiple
formats and styles that material can be presented in ("ALA/AASL Standards for Initial
Preparation of School Librarians," 2010).
Reading promotion and the ability of the librarian to promote reading for personal
enjoyment to create lifelong readers is discussed in the second element. One way that
librarians work to promote reading is âby providing students with access to high-interest
reading materials and by allowing students an opportunity for self-selected readingâ
(Shin, 2001, pp. 15). The self-selection of books and the availability of a diverse

26
collection of materials give students a more positive view of reading and help to create
lifelong readers who read for both pleasure and knowledge (Shin, 2001). With this
element, the librarian should also be a model of reading for enjoyment and personal
knowledge.
Element three focuses on the knowledge and ability of the librarian to have a
diverse collection ("ALA/AASL Standards for Initial Preparation of School Librarians,"
2010). The libraryâs collection should be diverse in materials and formats and should be
built to meet the needs of the patrons it serves. In the secondary school library, the
librariansâ knowledge of young adult literature and capacity for building a diverse
collection of contemporary selections is âa useful tool for engaged reading among
adolescentsâ (Ivey & Johnston, 2013, pp. 257). This element can be one that many
librarians struggle with as they know that âschool libraries are obligated to provide
equitable access to a rich environment of electronic, audiovisual and print resourcesâ
(Stripling, 1996, pp. 653). Many school libraries deal with a lack of funding due to
school budgets being cut and a lack of understanding of the importance of libraries and
librarians in schools. As the focus of libraries changes from being a repository of
materials to a place of active learning, it is more important than ever that a diverse
collection that has equitable access for all patrons is achieved. With better advocacy and
collaboration, librarians must work to show the important impact on student outcomes
that diverse, equitable, accessible collections create.
The final element in the standard relates to standard one by connecting knowledge
of teaching reading strategies to help students connect to text as well as build reading
ability and interest ("ALA/AASL Standards for Initial Preparation of School Librarians,"

27
2010). Barbara K. Stripling in the article âQuality in School Library Media Program:
focus on Learningâ (1996), found that âstudents do not learn effectively from collections
of facts; new information must be put into a meaningful context for it to become
knowledgeâ (pp. 638). This concept is not new to librarians as they work to present
information and materials that are meaningful and relevant to their students. Working to
build the necessary skills in students to make meaning and connections with texts and
concepts allows librarians to present information in multiple formats using different
teaching strategies to engage students in their learning and better prepare for future
classes and jobs.
Standard 3: Information and Knowledge. The third standard addresses
equitable access to and ethical use of materials, as well as the librarianâs knowledge of
sources and services that support student growth. This standard also addresses the ability
of the librarian to use evidence and research to build his or her own knowledge as well as
ways to improve the library and its services.
This standardâs first element measures the ability of the librarian to support the
studentsâ needs when it comes to gathering information and performing research. This
idea is one shared by Buffy J. Hamilton (2009) in her article âTransforming Information
Literacy for NowGen Studentsâ when she stated âin addition to finding and evaluating
information, we enjoy talking with our students and teachers about creating information
and representing knowledgeâ (pp. 51). The librarian should be able to demonstrate
multiple ways to find, evaluate, and use materials for different purposes. The librarian
should also teach and model ethical behavior when it comes to finding and using
materials because âin todayâs mash-up world of information, a plethora of resources are

28
available via the Internet, including podcasts, blogs, social bookmarks, social networks,
videos and video streaming, wikis, and RSS feeds through your favorite aggregatorâ
(Hamilton, 2009, pp. 52). This is why it is important that âinformation literacy
instruction must include helping students learn to pick and evaluate the best resources, for
their personal learning networks from print, subscriptions, and free sourcesâ (Hamilton,
2009, pp. 52).
The second element describes how librarians work to provide and support library
services that are diverse, accessible, and flexible for their patrons because âopen access at
the point of need has been a cornerstone of school librarianship from the very first...â
(Moreillon, 2009, pp. 24). Librarians work to create environments that are open and
welcoming as well as available to all of their patrons. Part of that service is the ability of
the librarian to develop solutions for addressing any needs or barriers that a patron might
face when accessing materials or the learning environments of the library. Open access
and diversity is important not just in the collection and resources, but also in what is
taught and promoted, since âschool library media specialists function as sponsors of
literacy by promoting traditional forms of information literacyâas well as new
literaciesâto encourage many voices of discourse and representations of informationâ
(Hamilton, 2009, pp. 52).
The librarianâs ability to work with and engage studentsâ learning with electronic
resources is defined in element three of this standard. With the rise of mobile devices
and online resources for students that motivate reading and research, a librarian should
âwelcome the responsibility for providing access to sources that supportâ¦studiesâ
(Moreillon, 2009, pp. 26). Librarians should demonstrate and model ethical and

29
appropriate use of digital tools for research, learning, and communicating in school and
daily life because âschool librarians serve a crucial role as the bridge for bringing
information to the diverse individuals they support, acquiring an extensive amount of
possible information in a faster timeframeâ (Ballew, 2014, pp. 65). The librarian should
also work to stay up-to-date on current and emerging technologies to use with patrons
because it is imperative that librarians âdevelop technological skills to provide just-intime services to students and teachersâ (Moreillon, 2009, pp. 25). As information
specialists, librarians work to âhelp our students navigate both traditional and
nontraditional informationâ (Hamilton, 2009, pp. 49). Staying up-to-date on resources
and technology and being able to model how to ethically use them is an important part of
the role that librarians have as information specialists and teachers.
The support of the library program through the use of evidence and research is
defined in the fourth element. Librarians use data to lead to improvements in library
services since âthe school librarian, working as a curriculum-partner leader, moves the
instructional agenda forward from the informational to the transformational and
ultimately to the formational, with the end result being the transformation of learningâ
(Geitgey & Tepe, 2007, pp. 11). Howard and Eckhardt focused on the role of action
research and leadership of librarians in their article âWhy action research? The leadership
role of the library media specialistâ for Library Media Connection in 2005. This type of
research is important for librarians as âthe results of action research do not need to be
adapted to your school; they are about your schoolâ (Howard & Eckhardt, 2005, pp. 32).
Action research lets librarians develop and evaluate programs and services so that they
are providing the best for their patrons. Because of âtodayâs world of data-driven

30
decision making, the library media specialist must develop the skills to work with his or
her staff in using data for program improvementâ (Howard & Eckhardt, 2005, pp. 32).
The use of data to improve the library program allows the librarian to advocate for the
program, better collaborate and teach with his or her staff, and work with students to help
them develop into lifelong learners and readers. Librarians that have this âknowledge
will be able to focus their instructional work and collect data from students on how they,
the librarians, helped to improve that area of studentsâ academic achievementâ (Geitgey
& Tepe, 2007, pp. 12).
Standard 4: Advocacy and Leadership. The first three standards that candidates
and librarians work with focus on the teaching roles that librarians participate in;
however, the fourth standard moves away from the teaching aspect and into the
leadership and advocacy roles that librarians have. Within standard four, librarians act as
advocates for their library programs and students. They are also leaders of and for their
programs, students, and staff. They provide development for both students and staff to
contribute to student achievement and to build libraries and library programs that are
diverse, equitable, and available to all of their patrons.
Networking within the library community is the focus of the first element under
this standard. Librarians do this when they lose their âoccupational invisibilityâ
(Steadman Stephens, 2011, pp. 19) and âsacrifice personally, moving outside our school
libraries and our comfort zones as we forge new instructional alliances with individuals
and organizationsâ (Steadman Stephens, 2011, pp. 20). They work to create connections
with other librarians for collaboration, resource sharing, and support. When librarians

31
network with other librarians, they are able to work with others to create and develop
strong library programs and programing that are beneficial to their students and schools.
The second element explains the commitment to professional development that
the librarian must have. This also includes being involved in professional organizations
that offer trainings, leadership opportunities and chances for networking. âParticipation
can help them keep abreast of new technologies, share and exchange ideas and techniques
and continue to develop leadership and presentation skillsâ (Lamb & Johnson, 2008, pp.
77), all of which help the librarians to better demonstrate their roles as instructional
leaders on campus. Professional trainings and leadership opportunities that are offered
by schools and districts add to the librarianâs ability to advocate and network for his or
her library program and patrons.
Leadership is the emphasis of the third element. It is within this element that
librarians show that their leadership role is a daily activity âvia interaction with
administrators, teachers, students, parent volunteers, and community partnersâ (Dees et
al, 2007, pp. 11). As leaders, librarians use data and research to develop and promote
their library programs and the programsâ impact on student learning. Librarians often act
as servant leaders in schools as they have realized that âleadership does not always mean
being in the front of the line; sometimes leadership is walking beside as an encourager or
behind as a supporterâ (Dees et al, 2007, pp. 13).
Advocacy by the librarian for the library program makes up the final element in
standard four. âDespite initiatives attracting much needed attention to school libraries,
positions and funding across the country continue to be reduced or eliminated and little is
understood about how teacher-librarians advocate for school library positions and

32
programsâ (Ewbanks, 2010, pp. 87). This is an especially important thought because
being an advocate for students and student achievement should be a large part of the
work that librarians do when working with others. While working in their roles as
advocates, librarians work on networking and sharing about their programs with
stakeholders, communities, and patrons. Librarians also use data and research to create
advocacy plans and information to share with stakeholders to build programs that are
centered on their patrons and student outcomes.
Standard 5: Program Management and Administration. The final standard
concentrates on the role that librarians play in program management and administration
of the library. This includes planning, development, implementation, and evaluation of
the programs, services, and resources.
The role of the librarian as the manager and administrator of the collections and
resources the library has is the focus of the first element. This is also the element that
clarifies the role played in evaluating and choosing resources for the library. With this
element, the librarian is also working to create a diverse collection that meets the
classification standards and needs of his or her students. By building and maintaining a
diverse, robust collection of print and digital materials, librarians are better able to teach,
share a love of literature, and be a source of information for students and teachers. This
also allows librarians to collaborate with teachers to build student achievement.
The second element concentrates on the role librariansâ play in relation to the
professionsâ ethical principles. It is here that librarians develop and display their
administrative roles with regards to privacy, intellectual freedom, and digital citizenship.
With student privacy a concern in schools, it is important to remember that âschool

33
librarians are among the strongest proponents of privacy, the subject is rarely discussedâ
(Adams, 2011, pp. 2).
The librariansâ role of administrator with regard to the funding, facilities, and
personnel that are part of the library program is the third element. It is here that the
librarian demonstrates his or her ability to handle the people who work with the library
program as well as the budget and facilities. This can include implementing policies and
procedures, creating access, and evaluating everything that is connected to the program.
The final element of the standard concerns the administrative role that librarians
play when dealing with strategic planning and assessment. It is here that librarians
demonstrate an ability to work with stakeholders to plan and develop library programs
that connect the resources and goals of the library to address the needs of the community.
This is also where librarians demonstrate their ability to use data to assess the needs of
the library and community as well as plan appropriately for the future growth of the
library program. It is with data and stakeholder communication that librarians âfigure out
how our services should change in order to meet the needs of teachers and students who
do use the internet, to remain absolutely vital to schools that are strapped for funds and to
be seen as important by decision makers who do allocate funds in a zero-sum gameâ
(Johnson, 2003, pp. 27). As librarians work to create diverse, open collections and
programs, it is important that principals see the changes and positive results that occur.
When building a program and asking for support, a principal or stakeholder âshould
observe the vibrant school librarian in a number of roles in order to serve the needs of
21st century studentsâ (Castro, 2010, pp. 20). Using researched based initiatives and

34
programs that benefit the students and strong advocacy, librarians are able to demonstrate
their abilities to be strong teachers and leaders in their buildings.
Administratorsâ Experiences and Perspectives
When principals have a clear understanding of the role of the librarian, then
âschool librarians, whether experienced or new to the job, realize how important the
principal is to the success of their library program. Unfortunately, school principals often
have a limited understanding or appreciation of the school librarianâs roleâ (Shannon,
2012, pp. 17) in schools. While this is a general statement, it is true that many teacher and
principal preparation programs do not cover library services and administration. Often
principals do not have extensive training, even in their administrator preparation
programs about the services that librarians and the library program can play in their
school. When asked how they learned about school library services in a study by Donna
M. Shannon (2012, pp. 18), two-thirds of administrators stated that they learned about
library services through professional literature, though school library related articles do
not appear often in administrative journals. Principals, like school librarians, have âa
very demanding and very isolated jobâ (Wong, 2014, pp. 26) and have âmany different
hats that must be worn simultaneouslyâ (Wong, 2014, pp. 26). This varied set of tasks,
responsibilities, and roles, can make it difficult for principals and librarians to understand
how important they are to one another and the success of the school.
Some of the lack of understanding regarding the role of the librarian can be traced
back to many principalsâ outdated notions of what libraries are and what librarians do.
As Ryan Steele, in his article âthe Principal-Librarian Relationshipâ in Teacher Librarian
from 2015 (pp. 27), stated, âI viewed my librarian as the person in charge of the space

35
where books were stored, not as a key player in the student-learning experience.â It is this
mindset that is common among many principals. For some administrators, this mindset
comes from a past history of visiting the library as a student or bringing students to the
library as a teacher and âwith their perceptions rooted in stereotypical images, many
principals still see media centers as libraries and libraries as warehouses of materials to
be managed and checked out to studentsâ (Hartzell, 2002, pp. 93). In many schools, this
stereotype is what the library or media center still embodies. In addition, media
representations of librarians such as âMarian the librarian in the Music Man and the
alternative destiny of Mary in Itâs a Wonderful Life are perfect examplesâ (Hartzell,
2002, pp. 99) that reinforce administratorsâ perceptions of a stereotypical librarian.
While many librarians are working to advance the library into a student-centered learning
environment, they are unable to overcome the stereotypical images that many
stakeholders have of the library. Strong relationships between administrators and staff
are important components of successful schools, and misperceptions about roles can
serve as barriers to such relationships. What this can mean to the librarian is that âtoo
few principals really seem to understand the value of the media center and specialist.
And it signals that principals and school library media specialists do not often enjoy the
kind of solid working relationship that provides mutual benefit to all parties concerned
and maximizes the contributions of each to the organization as a wholeâ (Hartzell, 2002,
pp. 94). To establish more effective relationships âprincipals who hold any desire of
supporting a school library program that contributes to studentsâ achievement must first
jettison the outdated view of the school library as a place of solemn conformityâ (Castro,
2010, pp. 20). A mindset change that occurs because of exposure, research, and positive

36
library experiences is important to help principals understand the positive roles and
impact of librarians and school libraries on students and teachers.
Partnerships between Principals and Librarians
The principal of every school should be an advocate for, and the biggest support
of the library program. Just as principals are advocates and supporters of athletics, arts,
and other programs in schools, they should âas the instructional leader[s] of the schoolâ
(Church, 2008, pp.5) be a strong advocate and supporter of the school library program.
Due to a lack of understanding or interest, principals may not put collaboration with the
librarian as an important part of their schoolâs culture. While principals may expect that
teachers and librarians will collaborate, they may not recognize how important their own
support can be to the program. Principals âset the tone and establish the learning
environment within their schools. For full implementation of the library media program
to occur, principals must establish a culture of collaboration and set the expectation with
teachers that the library will make an active contribution to instructionâ (Church, 2008,
pp. 6). This is why it is important that librarians cultivate positive relationships with their
principals to help show how important strong collaborative and advocating relationships
are to library programs. When principals have a better understanding of how a strong
collaborative relationship with the library can benefit both the library and school, they are
more likely to be strong advocates for the library program in the school itself and in the
school community at large.
âIn order to shift school library media programs in new directions, forwardthinking school library media specialists need the encouragement and support of their
administratorsâ (Lamb & Johnson, 2008, pp. 78). This support is crucial to a library

37
program and librarian as they constantly change and update their programs and goals to
better support school programs and student achievement. âWith administrative
understanding and support, the SLMS [school library media specialist] is empowered to
take the calculated risks associated with new program endeavorsâ (Lamb & Johnson,
2008, pp. 78). These risks can be as simple as generifying the library or as difficult as
changing from a fixed to a flexible schedule. Being empowered by having the support of
the schoolâs administration can allow the librarian to begin building or strengthening a
collaborative school learning community that is based on student success. Just as having
the support of the administration is important, âit is critically important that buildinglevel [school library media specialists] have the ability to communicate with their
principalsâ (Church, 2010, pp. 16). Open communication is an important aspect of
building a strong partnership that allows for risks to be taken in the library program and
builds a culture of collaboration and communication in the school. Having open
communication and support can lead to âsolid relationships [that] are based on
understanding each otherâs roles and functions and trusting in each otherâs competence,
expertise, dedication, and honestyâ (Hartzell, 2002, pp. 94).
Librarian Occupational Invisibility
A âfundamental factor that shapes principal perceptions of media specialists is the
invisibility factorâ (Hartzell, 2002, pp. 95). According to Hartzell (2002), âlibrarians are
perceived as staff members who assist those who foster student achievement, and not as
line performers directly responsible for student- and certainly not for teacher and
administrator- progress and successâ (pp. 95). This distinction is important as it distracts
administrators and teachers from noticing the magnitude and importance of what

38
librarians can, should, and do contribute to the school and student achievement. To be
honest, the way librarians work often helps to foster this perception. The nature of their
work, as well as the specialization of the job, leads to this invisibility. In many schools
today, there is only one librarian, so he or she is also in a state of âprofessional isolationâ
(Hartzell, 2002 pp. 95). This lack of a partner or team adds to the invisibility that the
librarian develops. While librarians may contribute to their own invisibility, it is also
created by the lack of articles on librarians and librarianship in research and trade
journals aimed at administrators as well as the lack of information provided in
administration classes.
When looked at separately, each contributing factor plays an important role in
creating âoccupational invisibilityâ (Steadman Stephens, 2011, pp. 19). A significant
aspect of the librarianâs work is to enable students and teachers to be successful by
sharing knowledge and skills that will build them into life-long independent learners.
This means that the information and skills that a librarian teaches are often âabsorbed into
a teacherâs lessons or a studentâs projectâ (Hartzell, 2002, pp. 95). This information then
becomes a part of the teacherâs and studentâs knowledge base and a part of who the
patron is, thereby taking the librarian out of the picture. This âabsorbabilityâ (Hartzell,
2002, pp. 96) of the librarianâs work and services adds to the distorted view that
administrators can have of what librarians do, how they can be successful teachers, and
how they contribute to the academic success of the school. Such clouding of perceptions
can sometimes lead to principals âwithholding recognition and makes them more ready to
interfere with library operation when pursuing other goalsâ (Hartzell, 2002, pp. 96).

39
In a way, invisibility is built into the job for many school librarians due to their
isolation and their buildingsâ schedules. When librarians are solo in their buildings, they
are often unable to leave the library to help teach classes, to embed themselves into
content areas, practice outreach, or even run a library cart with books down to the lunch
room for quick checkouts. This lack of visibility outside the confines of the library
makes it easy for administrators to miss the positive impact that a librarian can have on
learning and reinforces the idea held by many administrators and staff members that
librarians are viewed âmore as support resources than as colleaguesâ (Hartzell, 2002, pp.
96). The schoolâs schedule or the fixed schedule that the library has can also lead to
isolation and invisibility. When librarians are required to be in the library to provide
services during common off-times or planning, they are often unable to build
relationships with staff and students and implement outreach opportunities that can create
and build student and teacher success. This lack of visibility due to the inability to leave
the library can lead people to forget that the librarian is a member of the staff who can be
called upon to help plan, teach, and offer support. It then becomes easy for teachers and
administrators to ignore the importance of the role and the person who fills it. As a
result, the librarian is often replaced by uncertified individuals, changing in the status of
the role to more warehouse than teacher and collaborator. When principals help to
facilitate a more open and flexible library schedule, risks can be taken in the program that
allow the program to meet the needs of the patrons while limiting the invisibility that a
librarian experience on a more fixed schedule that limits collaboration (Church, 2009, pp.
40).

40
A lack of information in administration classes and professional presentations and
publications is a third factor contributing to the occupational invisibility that librarians
experience. One reason that administrators lack understanding of and appreciation for
librariansâ roles and contributions is that information about library programs is rarely
included as part of administration course work. Unless âEdAd professors accept library
impact research, it will have no influence with the people who prepare and certify school
leadersâ (Hartzell, 2012, pp. 2). Until educational administration professors see the
research and recognize its importance, new administrators will continue to miss the
importance of librarians and the library program and contribute to librariansâ invisibility.
Established administrators also lack exposure to research relating to librariansâ
roles and library programs. While librarians do write for journals and conduct research, it
is primarily aimed at and shared with other librarians (Hartzell, 2002, pp. 96). As a result,
administrators miss information that might make librariansâ roles clearer and their
contributions more apparent. Similarly, when librarians present at conferences to
audiences made up of other librarians, those outside the library world are left without
current library data and information on which to base staffing, budget, and support
decisions. âPrincipals in their field, like media specialists in theirs, stay attuned to
problems and possibilities through their own journals and meetingsâand library media
and media specialist have been conspicuously absent from these information sourcesâ
(Hartzell, 2002, pp. 97). They do not know or pay attention to what they do not see.
Since administrators are exposed to little or no library research either through their
administration or through professional publications and presentations, it is easy for them
to be unaware of the occupational invisibility that librarians can experience.

41
In the face of occupational invisibility, budget cuts, and a lack of understanding
about their roles, librarians must advocate for themselves to show others what they do
and the positive impacts their programs have on student learning. Librarians must âstand
upâ and become visible to principals. It is important that they provide research, not just
from journals, but action research that they conduct with their own patrons as well as
periodic reports on the library programs themselves. Joel Castro, in his article âAre We
Speaking the Same Language?â in the Spring 2010 edition of Texas Library Journal,
stated that it is important for librarians to remember that âvery unfortunate decisions have
to be made with respect to school and school district budgetsâ (pp. 20). This is a valid
point for librarians to consider as âevery program must prove its value; every program
must be held accountable by an appropriate measureâ (Castro, 2010, pp. 20). Because
principals often think about the economy of the school and the data that is needed to
make decisions, librarians must build a similar mindset about the importance of data. In
addition, they must learn to speak the language of data regarding the roles the librarian
and library program plays in meeting their state library standards, the ALA/AASL
Standards for the Preparation of School Librarians, and other standards that have been
created to develop and build the role of the librarian into a teacher and collaborator as
well as a manager of resources. It is that numerical data, as well as research and
observations, that principals look for when they are looking at student achievement and
success in their buildings.
Pennsylvania Library Study
In 2011-2012, Lance, Kachel, HSLC-a statewide library co-operative, the
Pennsylvania School Librarians Association, and the Education Law Center of

42
Pennsylvania used a National Leadership Grant from the Institute of Museum and Library
Services to complete a statewide study on the impact of school librarians and libraries on
student achievement. The study was completed in two phases, the first focused on library
infrastructure and its correlation with the state testing systemâs reading and writing
scores. The second phase of the study included surveys of administrators, teachers, and
librarians on library activities that were engaged in by the participants, what they valued
in libraries, and how they related to student achievement. For the second phase of the
study, the AASL 21st century learner standards were used as a benchmark for the skills
that the students should attain. A trend observed in the study was that the majority of
administrators who felt that the key library practices that were focused on were essential
to a good library program also gave an âexcellentâ rating to the instructional role that the
program plays when teaching the AASL standards. âThis trend is consistent with at least
the past two decades of research about the impact of school libraries and librariansâ
(Lance & Kachel, 2013, pp. 10).
Administrators who were more likely to give librarians âexcellentâ ratings on the
four AASL standards also considered teacher and librarian collaboration essential. These
administrators were more likely to consider these collaborations as part of teacher
evaluations, making it more likely that such collaborations would occur (Lance &
Kachel, 2013, pp. 10). This data showed that those administrators who viewed the
library program as essential also viewed collaborations between the librarian as teachers
as an important way to build student achievement. The survey also found that when
school administrators believed it was essential to appoint librarians to school committees,
they were also more likely to give an excellent rating to the library programâs teaching of

43
the writing and reading state standards when related to other subjects and college and
career readiness. When comparing library instruction in inquiry-based learning and
reading and writing test scores, schools with administrators who believed their students
received excellent instruction in inquiry-based learning during library instruction also
showed that students consistently scored advanced on the reading and writing tests
(Lance & Kachel, 2013, pp. 12). One major finding in the study was that âthe most
successful programs are those in schools where administrators value libraries and
librarians most highly-- putting them where they belong: at the heart of teaching and
learning, where they can promote and sustain inquiry, critical thinking, collaboration, and
independent learningâ (Lance & Kachel, 2013 pp. 13).
Texas Library Study
In 2000, the state of Texas completed the Texas School Libraries: Standards,
Resources, Services, and Studentsâ Performance study otherwise known as the Texas
Study. The study focused on three objectives:
(1) Examine school library resources, services, and use, on the basis of the School
Library Programs: Standards and Guidelines for Texas and determine the need
for updating these standards and guidelines so that they better serve
communities across the state.
(2) Determine the impact that school libraries have on student performance as
measured by the percent of students who met minimum expectations on the
reading portion of the statewide standardized test, the Texas Assessment of
Academic Skills (TAAS).
(3) Highlight library practices in the best performing schools (Smith, 2001, pp. 1).

44
The data for the study was collected from a random sample of 600 Texas school
libraries. The survey data was supplemented with data from the 1999-2000 Texas
Education Agencyâs Public Education Information Management System (PEIMS) on
school characteristics and student TAAS Performance and with community economic
data extracted from the Federal Reserve Boardâs Federal Financial Institution
Examination Council (FFIEC) web site (Smith, 2001, pp. 1).
The authors of the study found that schools with librarians had higher TAAS
performance than those schools that did not have a librarian. The Texas Study also
showed that library variables held a small but significant portion of the variances in test
performance in all levels (Smith, 2001, pp. 1). The Texas Study pointed out that in 2000
âlibrary staffing levels, collection sizes, librarian interaction with teachers and students,
and library technology levels have a positive association with TAAS performance at the
elementary, middle/junior high, and high school levelsâ (Smith, 2001, pp. 3). When
different variables were examined, the analysis revealed that libraries played a role in
helping students succeed in school.
When the data was analyzed in conjunction with the School Library Programs:
Standards and Guidelines for Texas, interesting information was revealed. In 2000, it was
found that there were âsignificant gaps between recommended library funding levels and
actual funding levels in elementary, middle/junior high, and high school librariesâ
(Smith, 2001, pp. 3). The conclusion formed based on these findings was that those
schools with larger operating budgets were able to have more current collections and
more personnel to better support their students and staff. The researchers also found that
there were âsignificant gaps between recommended staffing levels and actual staffing

45
levels. Libraries in schools with more than 350 students are generally understaffedâ
(Smith, 2001, pp. 3). This trend has continued since 2000 as districts cut school library
budgets and librarians for economic and other reasons. Examples of this trend included
the Houston Independent School District cutting 43% of its school library positions
during a five-year period between 2000 and 2015 and California having âhemorrhaged
school librarians to the point where it now has the worst ratio- 1-to-7,000 librarians-tostudents- of any state in the nationâ (Kachel, 2015, pp.1). The Texas study also found
that schools with both a librarian and an aide offered more services and longer hours to
provide patrons with greater access to support and materials.
When researchers analyzed data on how librarians spend a majority of their time,
it was found that schools were understaffed; more time was spent on clerical services
than on administrative duties, collaboration, training, teaching, and professional
development activities. Included with the administrative duties was management of the
collection to keep it current and up-to-date. A finding from the study was that âcurrency
and size of the library collection are factors in student achievementâ (Smith, 2001, pp. 5).
When school libraries had the staff and funding they needed, they were better able to
support student achievement through teaching, collaborating, and providing the resources
to help students achieve, not just on standardized tests, but as knowledgeable members of
society.
The 2000 study presented the interesting fact that âat all educational levels over
10 percent more students in schools with librarians than in schools without librarians met
minimum TAAS [Texas Assessment of Academic Skills] expectations in readingâ
(Smith, 2001, pp. 14). The authors also found that âthe libraries in schools with the

46
highest TAAS performance have more resources than the libraries in the low performing
schools and spend more time on collaborative teaching-related (curriculum integration)
activitiesâ (Smith, 2001, pp. 15). This information led to the conclusion that staffing and
funding did matter when it came to student achievement and a vibrant current library
program. Ultimately, the Texas study âdemonstrated that libraries can play a very special
role in providing enrichment to the students who come from economically disadvantaged
backgrounds and who need additional help to develop the skill they will need to succeedâ
(Smith, 2001, pp. 3).
The Needs of Texas Public School Libraries Report 2008
In 2008, the 80th legislature of the state of Texas instructed the Texas State
Library and Archives commission (TSLAC) and the Texas Education Agency (TEA) to
study Texas public school libraries to determine what the needs of the libraries were, who
could best meet them, and to issue a report on their findings. The commission created a
study based on the School Library Programs: Standards and Guidelines for Texas (Joint
Report: The Needs of Texas Public School Libraries, 2008, pp. 2). The survey was
completed online and the respondents were given a list of 17 needs and were asked to
pick the eight that the respondents felt were the most critical to the success of the
libraries. The survey respondents were also asked to choose which agency would be the
best to meet the need for that issue. The respondents were given the chance to add
critical needs that were not included on the list. The top three needs that a majority of the
respondents marked as critical included funding needs, resource needs, and librarian and
library program recognition in relation to student success (Joint Report: The Needs of
Texas Public School Libraries, 2008, pp. 10). For these critical needs, the survey

47
respondents felt that the local districts and TEA share the role of meeting these needs.
When the critical needs that were written in by the participants were examined, they
mirrored the need for funds, resources, and library program recognition. Respondents
also wrote in a need for âmandatory, enforced standards for school library programsâ
(Joint Report: The Needs of Texas Public School Libraries, 2008, pp. 11).
The commission outlined recommendations in seven areas for strong school
library programs. The first was that there must be appropriate committed funding from
the local districts and the state to create successful standards based library programs.
When school libraries are adequately funded, then the second recommendation could be
met which was to have the ability to purchase the materials, resources, and staff
allocations that are need for strong library programs. This would also allow for more
schools with the help of the state to purchase online research resources. Collaboration
with teachers must be seen as important to a student achievement. A call to make the
state library standards mandatory would help to show the importance of the librarian and
library program as well as make sure that money and resources were committed to the
program. As with mandatory standards, the collection of statistics on library programs
and resources was also found to be an important recommendation from the commission.
The final recommendation that the commission shared was on importance of having
certified school librarians with support staff as part of the library program. The 2008
Texas report shared many recommendations for the state on how to enhance public
school library programs and focused on the needs of the library community based on the
standards leading to discussion in districts about the importance of their library programs.

48
Current Research: New York State
Radlick and Stefl-Mabry in their study Statistical Causal Modeling and the Effect
of School Librarians on Academic achievement: Moving beyond Descriptive Statistics
and Simple Correlations (2015), part of the School Librarian Effect on Student Academic
Achievement in New York State Research Project that is funded by the Institute of
Museum and Library Services (IMLS) award RE-04-15-0081-15, found that many
studies on school librarians connection to student achievement design weaknesses with
very limited empirical approaches leading to few large-scale studies appearing in peerreviewed publications (Radlick & Stefl-Mabry, 2015, p. 2). In their study, Radlick and
Stefl-Mabry wanted to address the weaknesses found in other studies as well as answer
the question of how student achievement is affected by having a certified librarian in the
school. Under the three-year IMLS grant, the studyâs authors furthered their research by
focusing on âthe relationships between student achievement and both school library
characteristics and library services within the context of these causal modelsâ (Radlick &
Stefl-Mabry, 2015, pp. 3).
In their study Statistical Causal Modeling and the Effect of School Librarians on
Academic achievement: Moving beyond Descriptive Statistics and Simple Correlations
(2015), Radlick and Stefl-Mabry looked at the English-Language Arts Performance Index
grades 3-8, Math Performance Index grades 3-8, English Regents, and Integrated Algebra
Performance Indexes in New York state for the years of 2012-2013 of schools in New
York City and then for schools outside of the city. They also included in their data sets
the changes in the performance indexes from the 2011-12 school years to the 2012-13
school years. They also tried to control for prior academic achievement, student

49
demographics, and the schoolsâ characteristics. What was found was that there was a
statistically significant effect on English-Language Arts student scores in schools with at
least one full-time certified librarian in New York City. For schools outside of New York
City, there was no statistically significant difference in scores for schools with and
without a full-time certified librarian. There was not a statistically significant difference
in math performance scores in schools with or without a certified full-time librarian.
When looking at all of the effects on student achievement, the effect of the school
librarian was found to be relatively small. The studyâs authors found that continued
research looking at other causal factors to identify the effects of school librarians on
student achievement. While most past studies have been conducted using descriptive
correlations, Radlick and Stefl-Mabry are moving school library research forward with
their use of statistical causal modeling.
Summary
From the beginning of school libraries, librariansâ roles have evolved from the
keeper of materials to administrator to teacher to collaborator. In the present day,
librarians hold a variety of roles as they work with students and teachers to build a
vibrant library program that is current, diverse, and focuses on creating life-long learners.
Standards for measuring the effectiveness and achievement of the librarians, library
programs, and student achievement connected to the library have evolved over time as
well. When librarians collect data based on these standards, the information gathered can
then be used to advocate for their programs with principals who are often unclear on what
librarians can do and how library programs can benefit schools. As schools and libraries
move toward 21st century learning environments and expectations, it is important for

50
librarians and principals to have a strong knowledge of the roles that librarians play in
schools and how those roles can help build student achievement and make libraries into
vibrant learning communities.
Most of the literature on school librarians centers on the role of the librarian and
the endemic tasks that librarians do. What is missing is how administrators perceive and
view the standards and roles that are focused on librarians and libraries. There is also a
lack of research on the role of the librarian as a part of the school instructional leadership
team. This lack of understanding of the standards and roles that librarians play in schools
has led to a lack of the shared perceptions of what it takes to create a library program that
is central part of creating a literate student-centered school environment.
The search methods used for the literature review included the use of the Sam
Houston State University Newton Grisham Library databases and Google Scholar to
search for articles on the roles that librarians play in schools. The ALA/AASL Standards
for Initial Preparation of School Librarians 2010 standards were also researched to better
understand how each standard was connected to the different roles that librariansâ play in
schools and student achievement. I searched for articles on how administrators perceive
librarians and on administratorsâ understanding of the roles librarians and libraries have
on student achievement and on schools in general. Recent studies done by Lance and
Kachel on the importance of school librarians were also reviewed (2013). The invisible
nature of many of the roles that librarians play was also explored.

CHAPTER III
Method
I used a quantitative-dominant sequential mixed methods design to develop the
study on the perceptions that school librarians and principals have regarding the roles that
school librarians have in schools. The study included one urban-suburban school district
with a total of 85 schools/libraries. The design included a survey of quantitative
questions to collect data from the librarians and principals.
Purpose and Research Questions
Through this study, I developed an understanding of how the American Library
Association/American Association of School Librarians (AASL) Standards for Initial
Preparation of School Librarians (2010) were being implemented with respect to the role
of school librarians in an urban/suburban school district in Southeast Texas. The purpose
of this mixed methods study was to define the roles of school librarians as perceived by
both the librarians themselves and the administrators in their schools in regard to the
ALA/AASL Standards for the Initial Preparation of School Librarians (2010). In this
study, I focused on how both librarians and principals perceived the role of the librarian
and how the librarians implemented the ALA/AASL Standards for Initial Preparation of
School Librarians (2010) to develop a vibrant library program that enhanced student
achievement.
The research questions that guided the study are:
1. How do school librarians describe their role in schools?
2. What do principals perceive as the role of the school librarian in the school?

52
3. In what ways do school librariansâ and principalsâ perceptions overlap and
diverge in terms of the 2010 ALA/AASL Standards for the Initial Preparation of
School Librarians?
Design of the Study
The design of this study was a quantitative-dominate sequential mixed method
study. It was designed to compare the perceptions of school librarians in their own roles
in schools and the perceptions that principals have of the roles of school librarians.
According to Shea and Onwuegbuzie (2008), âthe quantitative phase tends to come first,
with the qualitative phase being used to explain, expand, clarify, or develop the
quantitative findingsâ (pp. 53). For this research study, the quantitative phase consisted
of surveys provided to both librarians and principals that would gather data on the
perceptions of school librarians and principals on the roles that school librarians have in
schools. The research objectives for the quantitative phase were both exploratory and
descriptive (Johnson & Christensen, 2012). Using the conceptual framework of the 2010
ALA/AASL Standards for the Initial Preparation of School Librarians, I was able to
explore and describe the perceptions of both the principals and librarians. The themes
that were developed using the standards and objectives informed the development of the
recommendations of the study.
Permission to complete the research study was gained first from the participating
district and then from the university Internal Review Board. Once permission to conduct
the study had been gained from the dissertation committee, the school district, and the
university, I worked with the district appointed research partner to gather the informed
consent forms, send out the surveys, and collect the responses. When the responses had

53
been collected, I analyzed the data and developed themes on the perceptions that the
participants hold on the role of the school librarian.
Sampling
The participants for this study were chosen using a purposeful criterion process
(Shea & Onweigbuzie, 2008). The sampling for this study included the entire population
of certified librarians and principals in a district in southeast Texas. Criteria sampling
was used to make sure that the participants in the survey met the guidelines for the study
to include only the certified librarians and principals in the district. At the time of this
study, several librarian positions were open. The principals at those schools were not
excluded from the study as the responses from the participants were not matched in any
way. The participants were sent a consent form and those that returned it marking that
they were willing to participate in the study were sent the link to the online survey.
Site Choice
The setting of this mixed methods study was an urban-suburban district in the
southeast region of Texas. The district had over 111,173 students and 13,312.5 staff
members ("Snapshot 2014 District Detail," n.d.). Of the total staff for the district 3.7%
were school administrative and 7.9 % were professional support staff ("Snapshot 2014
District Detail," n.d.). The librarians in this district are considered professional support
staff as defined by the Texas Education Agency ("2011-12 AEIS Glossary," n.d.).
Each traditional campus had a certified librarian on campus. The district had four
specialty campuses that did not have a librarian or library. The district did not have a
professional library or a library director but did have a district level library coordinator

54
who also supervised several other departments for the district. Only traditional
campuses were included in this study.
The ability to obtain permission to conduct research in the district was also a
factor in the site choice for this study. To request district permission, I had to contact the
Office of School Improvement and Accountability for the district to obtain the districtâs
Instructional Review Boardâs documents. The review board, which met once a week,
reviewed my research application and approved it. The district also assigned a district
representative to act as research sponsor for the district. This person contacted the study
participants with the consent forms. This research sponsor collected all completed
consent forms from the participants. The research sponsor then provided me with the
signed consent forms so that I could share the survey link with the participants. My
sponsor did not have access to the data that was collected from the participants, but did
keep track of those who had given consent and those who had opted out of the study.
Survey
The surveys used in this research project were based on the PA [Pennsylvania]
School Library Project curated by Kachel (2011). The PA School Library Project
included surveys given to school administrators, school librarians, and teachers. The data
from the surveys were analyzed and reported by Lance and Bull Schwarz. I selected to
use these surveys because the surveys aligned with the standards I was investigating. I
received permission from Kachel and Lance to use the surveys for school administrators
and librarians. Permission was also given for me to adapt the surveys by editing the
wording of questions and adding others. Both surveys included demographic data and
questions that covered all five of the standards that make up the ALA/AASL Standards

55
for Initial Preparation of School Librarians (2010). The surveys for this study were field
tested with three teachers, two librarians, and two administrators to establish content
validity.
District librarians and principals were asked to complete an online survey. The
surveys were designed to collect data regarding insights and information from each group
on what they each see as the role of the librarian in the school community based on the
2010 ALA/AASL Standards for Initial Preparation of School Librarians. The surveys
were created using SurveyMonkey surveys. To help ensure that the data from the
surveys were kept private, I created a SurveyMonkey account specifically for collecting
the data from the surveys. This helped to keep the information anonymous, adding a layer
of protection for both me and the participants. The response summary options included
in SurveyMonkey data collection were used to help me develop themes and connections
between responses.
At the beginning of the data collection phase of the study, the participants were
first sent the consent form by the research sponsor. Once the consent forms were
returned, the participants were sent the link to the online survey. The participants were
given two weeks to complete the survey with a reminder sent out by the research sponsor
after one week. As the surveys were completed, I began to develop the themes that were
used to create the interview questions.
Data Collection and Analysis
A variety of types of questions, including multiple choice and ranking questions,
were used in both the surveys and interviews to better collect a variety of data to use in

56
the analysis portion of the study. The data was then analyzed for themes and connections
to the 2010 ALA/AASL Standards for Initial Preparation of School Librarians.
The survey data was collected using SurveyMonkey surveys and included both
Likert scale and short answer questions. The analysis portion of SurveyMonkey helped
me with the basic statistical analysis and to begin developing patterns in the answers.
These patterns were then analyzed into themes and coded according to whether the
answer relates to a role or a task for the librarian.
I looked for patterns that emerged based on the responses that were shared. These
patterns were also coded to show whether the answer related to a role or a task for
librarians. This information was then analyzed and compared to the roles that are
described in the 2010 ALA/AASL Standards for Initial Preparation of School Librarians,
and conclusions were drawn on the role of librarians in schools. These conclusions were
used to recommend further research and suggestions for both librarians and principals in
the district to further support and develop the library program at the district and school
levels.
Trustworthiness
The trustworthiness of the research was based on the assumption that the
participants in the study were being honest in their answers. The participants in the study
were given the survey based on their positions as librarians or principals. The
participants in each group were given many of the same questions with some that were
more specific to the respondentsâ role in the school.

57
Researcher Subjectivity
As a librarian in the district at the time of the study, I served on several districtwide library committees and was a mentor for new librarians. Before this study began, I
worked with the district librarians to help create a mission statement and portrait of a
librarian for the district. My own experiences with creating a librarian appraisal form for
the district as well as mentoring new librarians might have influenced my perceptions of
the answers given and the patterns that were developed. I have also completed a program
evaluation of the librarian mentoring program to help determine its usefulness and the
changing needs of its participants. To ensure that my views did not influence that data,
all analyzed data was reviewed by colleagues from outside the district and the library
field to help monitor my subjectivity.
Summary
Chapter Three focused on the design of the study. I used a mixed methods design
for my surveys to develop a study of the perceptions of school librarians regarding the
roles they play in schools and the perceptions that administrators have regarding the roles
that school librarians play in their schools. A mixed methods design was most
appropriate for this study that focused on one urban-suburban school district as both
qualitative and quantitative data were collected. The data was collected and analyzed
using an online program to develop connections and themes that I used to draw
conclusions on how librarians and their role in the school community were perceived by
administrators and the librarians themselves. These conclusions were used to suggest
ways that the library program at both the district and school level can be better developed
and offer topics for further research.

58
CHAPTER IV
Results
The purpose of this mixed methods study was to define the roles of school
librarians as perceived by both the librarians themselves and the administrators in their
schools in regard to the ALA/AASL Standards for the Initial Preparation of School
Librarians (2010). In this study, I focused on how both librarians and principals
perceived the role of the librarian and how the librarians implemented the ALA/AASL
Standards for Initial Preparation of School Librarians (2010) to develop a vibrant library
program that enhanced student achievement.
The research questions that guided the study were:
1. How do school librarians describe their role in schools?
2. What do principals perceive as the role of the school librarian in the school?
3. In what ways do school librariansâ and principalsâ perceptions overlap and
diverge in terms of the 2010 ALA/AASL Standards for the Initial Preparation of
School Librarians?
Results of Data Collection
The data for this study was collected using a survey that was administered using
SurveyMonkey. The participants were sent the link to the survey after completing and
returning a signed consent form. The survey was sent to 57 librarians and 23 principals to
complete. The consent forms were sent out and collected during the month of August,
and the survey was open from mid-August to mid-September. The survey consisted of
twenty-one questions. There five demographic questions, with the rest a combination of
ranking, multiple choice, and open-ended questions. The data was analyzed using a basic

59
statistical analysis and a triangulation of constant comparison analysis, classical content
analysis and keywords-in-context of the qualitative data. Through this study, I developed
an understanding of how the American Library Association/American Association of
School Librarians (AASL) Standards for Initial Preparation of School Librarians (2010)
were being implemented with respect to the role of school librarians in an urban/suburban
school district in Southeast Texas.
Demographic Data
Both surveys included several demographic data questions. I asked each group what
their school level was, the years of experience teaching, their years in the district, years as a
librarian or principal, and what certification type they had. I also asked what type of library
schedule the library program had. I asked these questions to gain a better understanding of who
the survey participants were.

Librarians. The school district where the survey was conducted had eighty-four
librarians, not including the researcher herself. Of the 84 librarians that were sent the
consent forms, 57 returned them and were provided with the survey.

The first question

asked the librarians what level school level they were at. Fifty percent of the librarians
who completed the survey were at the elementary level. The remaining fifty percent of
the respondents were at the secondary level. Middle school librarians made up 29.17% of
the respondents and 20.85% were at the high school level. The Table 5 shows the school
levels of the respondents.

The second demographic question asked the librarians for their years of teaching
experience. Sixty-six percent of the respondents had 16 or more years of experience
teaching. This could include their years as a librarian as well. Table 6 shows the

Question six on the survey asked the librarians what their library certification
was. Table 9 showed that the librarians all have a masterâs degree as well as the school
library certificate. A majority, 88%, of the librarians earned a Master of Library Science
degree as well as their School Library Certificate.

The final question in the demographic section, question 7, asked the librarians to
share the type of library schedule that their library program uses. The schedule types
were not defined in the survey. A majority, 60%, of the librarians responded that their
library program is run on a combined fixed and flexible schedule. This data is shared in

The one librarian that marked other specified that the schedule he/she used was a
âfixed schedule but students are free to come anytime with a pass.â
Principals. The principals of the district were invited to participate in the research
project. Of the 85 principals invited, twenty-two completed the survey. The principals
were asked the same demographics questions that the librarians were. The only change
was that they were asked about their principal certification instead of library certification.

As with the librarians, the principals were asked what their degree and principal
certification were. For this question, the principals were given an option of other; this
allowed the principals to state an alternative way that they had earned the principal
certificate. None of the participants marked other. Table 15 displays the data collected
from this question. A majority of the respondents have a Master of Educational
Leadership with a Principal certificate. Almost 70% of the respondents had a Master
degree in Educational /leadership or Administration with a Principal certificate.

The rest of the questions in the survey focused on the roles and tasks that
librarians play in school. There was also a focus on the ALA/AASL Standards for the
Initial Preparation of School Librarians (2010). The questions were ratings, rankings,
and open-ended questions.
Research Question One: How do school librarians describe their role in schools?
The answers to research question one were obtained from data the remaining
fifteen survey questions. These questions could be divided into three sets. The first set
of questions asked the librarians to rate a list of twenty-four activities that were a
combination of roles that the librarians play and tasks that they do as to their importance
and the time that are normally spent on them in an average week. The second group of
questions focused on the ALA/AASL Standards for the Initial Preparation of School
Librarians (2010). Each standardâs element statements were listed and the librarians
were asked to rate their libraryâs programs or themselves based on those standard
statements. The final group of questions was a combination of rating and short answers

69
that asked for the librarianâs perspective about their roles and how their principals view
them.
Question eight asked the participants to rank a list of twenty-four activities that
were a combination of roles that librarians play and tasks that they do. They were asked
to rate the activities as essential, highly desirable, desirable, not desirable, and donât
know/ need more information. The activities that were ranked highest under essential
were planning library instruction lessons at 80%, purchasing books at 70%, and teaching
research lesson to students at 62%. Under the highly desirable rating the highest ranked
activities were: âcreate and supervise reading incentivesâ at 48%, âco-teach lessonsâ at
42%, and âpresent workshops to teachersâ at 42%. When looking at the remaining
activities, the participants marked âcreate displaysâ at 50%. Forty-two percent marked
âshelve booksâ as desirable for their role in the library and 40% marked âmanage interlibrary loansâ as desirable. Fifty-eight percent of the participants marked that âclass or
group monitorâ was not desirable as part of their role in the library. They also marked at
24% that âprocessing and/or repairing booksâ and at 20% that âshelving booksâ was an
undesirable part of their in the role in the library. In the donât know/need more
information category, 20% marked âpractice embedded librarianshipâ and 10% marked
âreaderâs advisory.â The Table 17 shows the ranking of each activity.

Looking at the results of this question, I noticed that many of the librarians marked both
roles and tasks as being essential and desirable in the role of librarian in their school
building. This question was important because it allowed me to understand what tasks
and roles that the librarians feel are essential to their job and role as the librarian.
Question nine focused on the approximate hours each week that the participants spent on
the activities from the first question. The options that the participants were given were

72
less than an hour a week, 1-3 hours a week, 4-8 hours a week, 9-12 hours a week, 13 or
more hours a week, and not applicable. In the less than one hour a week category, the
highest ranking was given to âcreate displaysâ at 60%. The respondents marked âpresent
workshops to teachersâ ranked at 54%, âclass or group monitorâ at 50%, âmanage interlibrary loanâ and âpurchase booksâ at 48%. In the category of where they spend 1-3
hours a week, the respondents marked both âcreate and supervise reading incentivesâ and
âparticipate in school committeesâ at 50%. From there, they marked both âplanning
library instruction lessonsâ and âplan digital literacy lessonsâ at 48% of their time. The
next highest percentage was 46% at âprocessing and/or repairing books.â In the 4-8
hours of the week category, 34% marked âplanning library instruction lessonâ and 26%
of the respondents marked âteach research lessons to students.â Twenty-two percent of
the respondents marked âshelve books,â âorder books,â and âreaderâs advisoryâ as where
they spend their time. The respondents marked âcheckout booksâ at 26% in the 9-12
hour category. They also marked âcheck in booksâ at 20% and âwork one-on-one with
studentsâ at 18%. The final category was 13 or more hours a week that respondents
could mark for the activities. In this category, 34% marked âcheck out booksâ, 24%
marked âcheck in booksâ, and 20% marked âshelve booksâ. In the not applicable
category, 30% marked âco-teach lessonsâ, 24% marked âpractice embedded
librarianshipâ, and 22% of respondents marked âreaderâs advisoryâ. The librariansâ
answers can be seen in Table 18.

Interestingly enough, âcheck in booksâ appeared in several different time categories. In
the district where the survey was conducted, only the high schools are required to have an
aide and those may only be dedicated to the library for half a day. In the elementary and
middle schools, it is up to the discretion of the principal to use an aide allotment for the
library. Due to that, a majority of the libraries do not have an aide. Those that do, only
have the help for a limited amount of time, which only may cover the lunch of the

75
librarian, if that as there are libraries that are closed so that the librarian can have lunch
since they are not given coverage. This question was important because it helped me to
understand where the librarians spent their time while running the library program. The
three activities that have the highest amount of time devoted to them are all tasks that the
librarians do, not roles that they play.
The second group of questions in the survey focused on the five standards and
elements of the 2010 ALA/AASL Standards for the Initial Preparation of School
Librarians. None of the questions specifically mentioned the standards by name but did
mention that each question was made up of standard statements. The participants were
asked to rate either their library programs or themselves based on the standard statements.
Question ten focused on teaching standard statements for the standard:
Candidates are effective teachers who demonstrate knowledge of learners and
learning and who model and promote collaborative planning, instruction in
multiple literacies, and inquiry-based learning, enabling members of the learning
community to become effective users and creators of ideas and information.
Candidates design and implement instruction that engages studentsâ interests and
develops their ability to inquire, think critically, gain and share knowledge.
(ALA/AASL Standards for the Initial Preparation of School Librarians, 2010, pp.
1)
The participants were asked to rate their programs based on the teaching statements. The
ratings were Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor, and Donât know/not applicable. Table 19
shows the answers for the question: how would you, as the librarian, rate your library
program based on the following teaching standards statements?

As seen in Table 19, under the excellent rating, 50% of the participants marked
âinstruction is based on student interests and needs and supports student achievement.â
Part of the vision and philosophy that underpins the library department in this district was
one of creating lifelong learners. With this, the librarians focused on helping to build
student achievement with their lessons. Under the good rating, there was a close
percentage for the remaining three statements. The ratings ranged from 58%-54%. This
illustrated that the librarians believed that their library programs that were strong in the
teaching standards. The percentages under the fair rating ranged from 16% to 6% for
each statement and there were no responses in the last two ratings categories.

77
The second standard, Literacy and Reading, was the focus of question 11. The
standard states:
Candidates promote reading for learning, personal growth, and enjoyment.
Candidates are aware of major trends in childrenâs and young adult literature and
select reading materials in multiple formats to support reading for information,
reading for pleasure, and reading for lifelong learning. Candidates use a variety
of strategies to reinforce classroom reading instruction to address the diverse
needs and interest of all readers. (ALA/AASL Standards for the Initial Preparation
of School Librarians, 2010, pp. 6)
Table 20 illustrates the data collected from question 11. The participants were asked to
rate their programs based on the teaching statements. The ratings were Excellent, Good,
Fair, Poor, and Donât know/not applicable.

Three of the four element statements were rated very high in the excellent category. 74%
of the participants marked âI am familiar with a wide range of childrenâs, young adult,
and professional literature. I promote and encourage reading for learning, information,
and pleasure.â The statement âI am developing a collection that is diverse in formats and
materials to support my patronsâ reading for enjoyment and learningâ was marked at
68%, and âI promote and model reading for personal enjoyment and to promote lifelong
reading in my patronâ was marked at 78%. The standard statement âI collaborate with
teachers to teach and reinforce instructional strategies that help students understand what
they are readingâ was rated highest in the good category at 52%. This statement received
24% under the excellent category, 22% under the fair category, and 2% under the poor
category.
Question 12 of the survey asked the librarians âhow would you, as the librarian,
rate your library program based on the following information and knowledge standards
statements.â The eight statements that the librarians were asked to rate were the elements
for the following standard:
Candidates model and promote ethical, equitable access to and use of physical,
digital, and virtual collections of resources. Candidates demonstrate knowledge

79
of a variety of information sources and services that support the needs of the
diverse learning community. Candidates demonstrate the use of a variety of
research strategies to generate knowledge to improve practice (ALA/AASL
Standards for the Initial Preparation of School Librarians, 2010, pp. 10)
This standard focused on the information needs of the students as well as their ethical
behavior and access to that information. The ratings scale that the participants used to
rate their library programs was excellent, good, fair, poor, and donât know/not applicable.

Three of the statements had the donât know/not applicable rating marked by the
participants. The statement âI am or have created a flexible, open access libraryâ was
ranked in each category: 56% as excellent, 32% good, 4% fair, and 4% donât know/not
applicable. The second statement that also had a participant respond in the donât
know/not applicable category was âI plan, design, and teach activities that engage
students and authentically use print and digital tools.â The ranking spread for this
statement was a little closer. The participants ranked excellent at 42%, good at 50%, fair
at 6%, and donât know/not applicable at 2%. While none of the participants marked
poor, one did mark donât know/not applicable. The final statement which participants
marked donât know/not applicable was âI use evidence-based, action research to collect
data about my program. I use that data to improve my library program.â The rankings for
this statement were excellent at 10%, good at 48%, fair at 32%, poor at 6%, and donât
know/not applicable at 4%. These rankings made sense as many of the librarians in this
district used monthly statistics to help develop and improve their library programs. The
10% percent of participants who ranked this at either the top or the bottom of the scale

81
for their library programs might have needed a better understanding of what action
research was and how it could be collected and used in the library.
Advocacy and leadership abilities were the focus of the fourth standard in the
ALA/AASL Standards for the Initial Preparation of School Librarians (2010). The
standard itself states:
Candidates advocate for dynamic school library programs and positive learning
environments that focus on student learning and achievement by collaborating and
connecting with teachers, administrators, librarians, and the community.
Candidates are committed to continuous learning and professional growth and
lead professional development activities for other educators. Candidates provide
leadership by articulating ways in which school libraries contribute to student
achievement. (ALA/AASL Standards for the Initial Preparation of School
Librarians, 2010, pp. 14)
There were seven element statements for the standard that the participants were asked to
rank in question 13. The ranking scale for each element statement was excellent, good,
fair, poor, and donât know/not applicable. Table 22 displays the data collected from the
librarians.

There were two statements that participants marked as donât know/not applicable. The
first statement, âI articulate the role and relationship of the library programâs impact on
student growth and achievementâ was ranked 30.61% at excellent, 53.06% at good,
12.24% at fair, nothing at poor, and 4.08% at donât know/not applicable. This spread
showed that librarians felt that they were good at advocating for the library program.

83
However, the fact that about 16% of the participants marked fair or donât know/not
applicable, indicated that support was needed for those who were unsure about how to
advocate for the program and its support of student achievement. The second statement,
âI use evidence-based practice and information to help communicate with stakeholders
the importance of the library program and how it can enhance school improvement
effortsâ had a wide rankings spread with participants marking every ranking category;
16% marked excellent, 40% marked good, 36% marked fair, 6% marked poor, and 2%
marked donât know/not applicable.
Table 23 displays the data for question 14 which asked the librarians to rate their
library programs based on 11 element statements for the final ALA/AASL Standard for
the Initial Preparation of School Librarians (2010). The standard states:
Candidates plan, develop, implement, and evaluate school library programs,
resources, and services in support of the mission of the library program within the
school according to the ethics and principals of library science, education,
management, and administration. (ALA/AASL Standards for the Initial
Preparation of School Librarians, 2010, pp. 17)
It used the same rating scale as the other standards questions of excellent, good, fair,
poor, and donât know/not applicable.

Nine of the eleven statements had high ratings in the excellent category. Two were over
80% and 3 were over 70%. The two statements that were not ranked as excellent had
their highest ranking in the good category and both were above 50%. Three of the
statements had rankings in the donât know/not applicable category. Those included âI
practice the ethical librarianship and advocate for my patronsâ intellectual freedom and
privacyâ, â I apply best practices when planning, budgeting, and evaluating resources for
the library programâ, and âI communicate with stakeholders the library mission and how
the program aligns with the schoolâs mission and goals.â Interestingly enough, the first
two statements were also in the 70% rankings in the excellent category. For all three of
the statements, it was only one person that ranked them donât know/not applicable. The
statement that had the highest rating in any category was âI organize the library collection
according to current cataloging and classification standards and in ways that will benefit
my patrons the most.â This statement was rated at 82% in the excellent category. As
readerâs advisory (working with students to find the right book for them) was a large part
the librariansâ daily jobs, it was important to make the collection work for both librarians
and patrons. The statement with the second highest rating was âI work to develop a
collection that meets the diverse needs of my patronsâ at 80%. This relates back to the

86
idea of working with students to meet their needs and to provide them with access to
materials. It is interesting to note that only 50% marked excellent and 44% marked good
for the statement âI evaluate print and digital resources using evaluation criteria and
selection tools.â
The last two questions in this grouping of questions about the standards asked the
librarians to rank the five standards in order of importance and to then explain their
reasoning for the ranking. Question 16 asked for the librarians to rank the standards in

When reviewing the short answer responses, the overall theme that developed in
relation to the participants rating Literacy and Reading as the most important standard
was that the job of the librarian was to create readers and learners. Several participants
wrote about the importance of âpromoting a love of reading and learning.â It was

87
repeatedly stated that the librarianâs purpose was to âcreate lifelong readers and promote
that love for books.â A theme that developed relating to the second most important
standard, Teaching for Learning, was the development of lifelong learners. Others shared
variations of ânothing is more important than helping them understand informational
integrity and where to gain knowledge.â Several of the respondents made statements
that their focus was on their students and everything works around them. One stated
simply âIt's all important and changes daily.â Many respondents indicated that it was
difficult to rank the standards because all were important.
The final questions on the librariansâ survey asked the librarians to share their
perceptions of their roles, their perceptions of their programsâ roles in enhancing student
achievement, their principalsâ perceptions of the librarianâs roles in the library and in the
school as a whole. These questions could be grouped into two sets, one that focused on
librariansâ perspectives of themselves and one that focused on how the librarians believe
principals see them. Question 15, the first in the set included a list of 12 roles and asked
the librarians to mark the ones that they see themselves holding in their library programs.

When asked to answer in short answer form for question 22 to define their role as
a school librarian, many of those who answered commented that they were teachers and
librarians. Responses from the forty-six participants who answered indicated that they
were the ââgo toâ person for resourcesâ, that they âsupport teachers and staff members,â
and that they encourage âreading and literacy within all subject areas.â The theme of
being a teacher, librarian, and motivator, repeated over and over again, showed how the
librarians see themselves. A second theme that developed was connected more to
technology. Statements indicated that librarians are often the âleader in the school on
how to integrate technology to support instruction and learning.â The wording varied,
but the idea overall was that the librarians âtry to show easy ways to promote the use of
various technology and reach more students of the 21st century.â Ultimately, the
librarians stated in many different ways that they see themselves as a âconduit for

89
informationâ and that they âsupport students, staff, and administrationâ as an âencourager
of lifelong learning.â Overall, the librarians felt that their role âis administrator,
advocate, teacher, leader, and instructional partner.â
When asked if they see whether their library programs enhance student
achievement, 98% of the participants said yes and 2% said no. When asked to explain
their reasoning, the respondent who marked ânoâ gave the reason âNot yet! The collection
is old and I am working to bring it into the 21st century!â This statement made sense as
many of the libraries in the district are older and have not been weeded, updated, or
renovated to allow for creating a learning commons style setup. Besides having older
libraries and collections, the district where the research was conducted had not always
provided money to purchase books. Technology updates for all areas had just begun, and
while libraries would eventually be updated that would not happen with any immediacy.
This left the librarians doing what they could to update their libraries with what they had
or could purchase. Several of the librarians marked yes, but in their responses added
several reasons why their libraries were struggling to show how they enhanced student
achievement. For some, the reason boiled down to âif you boil student achievement
down to THE TEST, then I cannot draw a straight line from my work to those scores.â
With the focus on testing so strong in this state, many librarians found that visits to the
library were curtailed so that students could work more on testing subjects. Another
librarian stated that âour emphasis on good first instruction and small group participation
is leaving little time for creativity and exploration which current data shows is important
to learning.â Many of the librarians, especially at the elementary level, were being asked
to teach concepts for the first time in subjects such as history or science in addition to

90
teaching library skills, research skills, and digital citizenship. A majority of the librarians
made fully positive statements, sharing ideas such as âyes, since I create an inviting
environment and strive to do the best for the students.â Several of the librarians also
added comments to share what they were struggling with. For example, one librarian
wrote: âno, since I have absolutely no support within the library. I feel like the library
suffers on a daily basis since I am the only individual in the library. I am the librarian,
book processor, circulation assistant, [book] shelver, administrator, discipline
management person, etc. It is virtually impossible to do a great job with all of the hats
you are expected to wear.â Overall, though, the librarians mentioned that they âfill our
library with books that support student interests and support curriculum goals,â and that
âreading is fundamentally important to success in education.â Several themes developed
from comments that were repeatedly made about how library programs enhanced student
achievement because it was a welcoming environment that helped create a love of
reading and made available a variety of materials, topics, and choices. Respondents
stated that they collaborate with teachers whenever possible, and that the library was an
extension of the classroom. All of these ideas related back to the standards for teaching
and learning as well as literacy and reading. Those two standards were ranked as the
most important by the librarians, and it was reflected in how they viewed their own roles
and how they developed and focused their library programs to enhance student growth.
The final group of questions asked the librarians to think about how they perceive
their principal sees them in the school, how the principal perceives their role in the
school, and what tasks the principal values most in their role as the school librarian.
Question 18 asked âmy principal sees me as beingâ along with a list of roles that were

91
based on the ALA/AASL Standards for the Initial Preparation of School Librarians 2010.
For each role, the rankings were always, most of the time, sometimes, never, and donât

Librarian Survey,â SurveyMonkey, Inc. Palo Alto California, USA.
www.surveymonkey.com
Question 20 asked the librarians to describe how they think their principal
perceives their role as the school librarian in their own words. Each answer was unique

92
to the participant, but overall the answers could be categorized according to the following
roles: âadministratorâ, âteacherâ, âleaderâ, âadvocateâ, âmanagerâ, and âclerkâ. There were
also several answers that were rather ambiguous, with the focus of the answers more
connected to the library program rather than the role that the librarian plays in that
program. On being a teacher, the participants made statements such as âshe recognizes
my teaching abilities and values my curriculum backgroundâ and âhe sees me first as an
expert on literature, second as a teacher/collaborator.â Those that mentioned
âadministratorâ made statements such as âI am assigned a role in virtually every school
committee and expected to attend almost every administrator meeting. I think she
perceives my schedule as being very flexibleâ and âIt is my job to take care of all things
related to the library as well as any other roles that benefit our students.â As a leader, the
librarians stated that they believed that their principals saw them as âa leader who is
fiercely protective of the library, our program, and my time with studentsâ and âas an
expert in my field. Iâm not perfect but based on my evaluations, she trusts me to fulfill
my job as assigned-and some that arenât!â A majority of the respondents made
comments about being a leader and contributor to programs and technology trainings for
staff in the building and âa leader on campus.â The idea that they were seen as âa leader
but not in an official capacityâ was an idea that was repeated in different ways through
several of the answers. Being seen as an âadvocate,â especially in relation to encouraging
the love of reading in students, was an idea repeated by several of the respondents. They
commented that âhe knows I am a strong advocate of libraries and reading,â and âmy
principal wants me to encourage a love of reading and gives me the autonomy to achieve
that.â Overall, for those that were seen as advocates, the feeling was that âmy principal

93
understands the importance of reading and literacy and promotes library efforts to help
students succeed.â
While many of the comments had some aspect of being considered a âleader,â an
âadvocate,â a âteacher,â or an âadministrator,â just as many had comments that mentioned
being considered a âmanagerâ or a âclerk.â The perceptions of the librarians showed that
they felt that their principals saw them through this lens. âI think she views my primary
role as the keeper and manager of the booksâ and âas a support to teachers.â There was
also a belief that the principals saw the librarians as âthe perfect person for projects that
really have nothing to do with the library, but he knows that I will get it done to his
satisfaction.â It appeared that in some schools the librarianâs role and the library program
itself was understood only on âa surface level not a really deep levelâ and that the
principals âsees the library as a (limited) hub of the school.â Even with specific
connections to roles that the librarians perceived the principal connected with them, many
gave an ambiguous answer as well as a specific role. These answers gave the idea that
they âdo not think my principal knows what I do at all.â This was because âhe/she has
never been in to see what happens-period!â or âI donât think she really knows everything
that goes into being a librarian. She sees students coming and going, the volume is
sometimes louder than she would like. I feel that she and our Reading IS see the library
as a quiet place where students check out books and leave. She knows that we have
several different activities and clubs going on, but I donât think she sees it tying the
library together.â As the researcher and a librarian in the district, I think that the most
honest answer shared was âI honestly have no idea.â This and the comments about the
principals not being aware of what happened in the library, the planning that went into

94
making lessons happen, and the labor involved in developing collections highlighted a
major issue that led to the realization that the librarians âneed to be a better advocate for
[their] programs and what all goes on in the library.â
The final question in the survey, Number 21, asked what tasks their principals
valued most that you perform in the role as the school librarian. A majority of the
respondents gave roles that the principals valued most rather than the actual tasks that
they do. Those that did share tasks gave the answers of monitor students, purchase
resources, check in and out books, find materials, and organize the library. Those that
mentioned roles listed motivator, advocate, relationship builder, leader, teacher, manager,
and promoter. Some did not list either a task or a role, but instead gave an action that
they do such as, âproviding books to kidsâ and âthe ability to get kids excited about
reading.â The confusion between tasks and roles was obvious with this question but had
appeared in several others as the respondents seemed to be confusing what they do with
who they are.
The fifty-seven librarians who participated in the survey shared their perceptions
of their roles in the school and the library program. They also shared their knowledge of
their library programs and the tasks and roles that are routine parts of the librarianâs job
and of running the library program. They rated their library programs based on the
ALA/AASL 2010 Standards for the Initial Preparation of School Librarians. All of this
information helped to define how the librarians in the district viewed their roles and the
library program in the district.

95
Research Question Two: What do principals perceive as the role of the school
librarian in the school?
The answers to research question one were obtained from data the remaining
fifteen survey questions. These questions could be divided into three sets. The first set
of questions asked the librarians to rate a list of twenty-four activities that were a
combination of roles that the librarians play and tasks that they do as to their importance
and the time that are normally spent on them in an average week. The second group of
questions focused on the ALA/AASL Standards for the Initial Preparation of School
Librarians (2010). Each standardâs element statements were listed and the librarians
were asked to rate their libraryâs programs or themselves based on those standard
statements. The final group of questions was a combination of rating and short answers
that asked for the librarianâs perspective about their roles and how their principals view
them.
Question 8 asked the principals to rate a list of twenty-four activities in the order
of their importance to the schoolâs library program. The ratings used included essential,
highly desirable, desirable, not desirable, and donât know/need more information. None
of the activities rated higher than 77%, and only four had ratings in the donât know/need
more information category. Table 27displays the results of the question.

This activity was rated at 9.09% for both highly desirable and desirable, and at
4.55% not desirable. The second highest rated activity was âpurchasing booksâ with
68.18% rating it essential, 18.18% rating it highly desirable, 13.64% rating it desirable,
and 0% rating it not desirable or donât know/need more information. The third highest
rated activity was âcheck in books.â The essential rate received 59.09%, and highly

98
desirable was rated 13.64%. The percentage at highly desirable was higher than for
âcheck out books,â which was interesting because the principals seemed to have felt that
it was more important for librarians themselves to check in books than to check out
books. It was interesting to note that 4.55% of the principals rated it as desirable and
22.73% rated it as not desirable. This high rating for not desirable led to questions about
why some rated it as desirable and some did not.
The activities that received the highest percentage under the highly desirable
category were âplan digital literacy lessonsâ at 59.09% and âparticipate in district
committeesâ at 54.55%. For the activity of âplan digital literacy lessons,â 36.36% rated it
essential, and 4.55% rated it donât know/ need more information. The second highest
activity in the highly desirable category was âparticipate in district committees.â This
activity also received a 27.27% rating as essential and 18.18% as desirable. Under the
category of desirable, three of the activities received the same rating of 45.45%: âclass or
group monitor,â âstudent/staff mentor,â and âco-teach lessons.â Of these three, âclass or
group monitorâ is the one that stood out. It is interesting that the same activity was the
highest rated in the not desirable category at 27.27%. There were two activities that had
high rankings in the donât know or need more information category that should be noted.
They were âreaderâs advisoryâ at 27.27% and âpractice embedded librarianshipâ at
36.36%. These ratings showed that the principals were not sure of the definitions of
these activities. They did each receive ratings in the other categories, but a majority of
the principals were not quite sure of them.
Question 9 asked the principals to look at the same list of twenty-four activities
from question 8 and mark the approximate amount of time that they believe the librarians

99
send on each. The choices for time frames that they were able to choose from were less
than an hour a week, 1-3 hours a week, 4-8 hours a week, 9-12 hours a week, 13 or more
hours a week, and not applicable/unsure. Table 28 displays the data for this question.

Note. Adapted from data collected from âThe Hidden Roles of School Librarians:
Principal Survey,â SurveyMonkey, Inc. Palo Alto California, USA.
www.surveymonkey.com
Eight of the activities were rated about 50% in the less than an hour a week
category. These activities included: âpresent workshops to teachersâ at 59.09%, âplan
with teachersâ at 54.55%, âcreate displaysâ at 50.00%, âmanage interlibrary loanâ at
59.09%, âparticipate in school committeesâ at 50.00%, âparticipate in district

101
committeesâ at 63.64%, âattend district meetingsâ at 59.09%, and âco-teach lessonsâ at
59.09%. The two activities that stood out here were âplan with teachersâ and âco-teach
lessons.â Although these were both activities that principals marked as desirable in
response to the last question, principals viewed them as being done less than an hour a
week. The highest percentage of 77.27% was given to âplanning library instruction
lessons,â but it was only marked as being done 1-3 hours a week Both âcheck out booksâ
and âcheck in booksâ were rated highly in the previous question, but the principals
marked them both highest under the category of 1-3 hours a week. The activity that
received the highest percentage in the 9-12 hours a week category was âteach research
lessons to studentsâ at 22.73%. While principals felt that librarians spent relatively little
time planning lessons, they seemed to realize that the librarians did spend a great deal of
time during the week teaching. Very few of the activities were given high percentages in
the 13 or more hours a week category. The two activities that stood out in this category
were âcheck out booksâ at 18.18% and âcheck in booksâ at 18.18%. This was interesting
as they also received the highest percentages in the 1-3 hours a week category. There
were several activities that were marked in the not applicable/unsure category.
âReadersâ advisoryâ was marked at 40.91%, possibly because the principals did not
understand what the activity was. âPlan with teachersâ at 13.64% seemed to show that
some of the principals were not sure if planning with teachers was being done or for how
long. The activity of âpractice embedded librarianshipâ received 50.00% again this could
be because the principals were not sure about the activity. âCo-teach lessonsâ received
22.73%.

102
The second set of questions focused on the ALA/AASL Standards for Initial
Preparation of School Librarians (2010). These questions were the same ones that the
librarians were asked, but they were asked based on the principalâs perspective, belief, or
understanding of their library program and librarian. The first question, number 10,
asked how the principal would rate his or her library program based on the teaching
standards. They were asked to rate the statements as excellent, good, fair, poor, or donât
know/not applicable. Table 29 displays the data from question 10.

All four of the statements were given excellent ratings above 50%. Three of the
statements, âlibrary instruction is based on student interests and needs and supports stunt

103
achievement,â âthe librarian provides student and staff learning activities demonstrating
how to be effective users of library and information resourcesâ, and âthe librarian uses
technology to enhance learning and support student achievement,â were all rated 68.18%
excellent. The final statement âlibrary instruction is given using a variety of learning
strategies and resourcesâ was rated at 50% excellent. Of the other ratings, only one, âthe
librarian uses technology to enhance learning and support student achievement had a
rating of poor at 4.55%. While this was only the rating of one principal, it shows that he
or she was not seeing technology being used to enhance student achievement.
The second question of this group, number 11, asked the principals to rate their
library programs based on four literacy and reading statements. The ratings were
excellent, good, fair, poor, and donât know/not applicable. Table 30 displays the data
results for the literacy and reading statements.

As with the first question all of the statements received strong percentages in the
excellent category. The first statement: âthe librarian is familiar with a wide range of
childrenâs, young adult, and professional literature. He/she promotes and encourages
reading for learning, information, and pleasure,â received 95.45% in the excellent
category and 4.55% in the good category. This standard statement is might have received
such a high response because it shows the strength of the librarians knowledge,
something that principals could easily observe and recognize. The second statement,
âThe librarian collaborates with teachers to teach and reinforce instructional strategies
that help students understand what they are reading,â received rating sin four of the
categories. It received 54.55% in the excellent category, 36.36% in the good category,
4.55% in the fair category, and 4.55% in the poor category. This indicated that, while
collaborations with teachers were not always observed, library lessons reflected
communication with teachers and addressed studentsâ needs. The statement âThe
librarian develops a collection that is diverse in formats and materials to support his/her

105
patrons reading for enjoyment and learningâ was rated at 77.27% in the excellent
category, 18.18% in the good category, and 4.55% in the fair category. These ratings
showed that some principals might have been unaware of librariansâ efforts to build
diverse collections, and, indicated that some advocacy on collection development might
be needed. The final standard statement on literacy and reading, âThe librarian promotes
and models reading for personal enjoyment and to promote lifelong reading in his/her
patrons,â was rated 77.27% in the excellent category and 22.73% in the good category.
While these ratings showed that a majority of the principals who answered the survey
were seeing that their librarians and library programs were promoting lifelong reading,
not all were seeing it consistently. This along with the other lower ratings given to the
statements in this standard, led to my realization that more advocacy and education were
needed for both the librarians and principals on ways the library program could enhance
student learning and success with literacy and reading.
Question 12 focused on information and knowledge standards statements. The
principals were asked to rate their library program using the scale of excellent, good, fair,
poor, and donât know/not applicable. There were eight statements for the principals to
rate and the data is displayed in Table 31.

All eight of the standard statements were given a rating above 50% in the
excellent category. The highest rated statement was âMy librarian has created a flexible,
open access libraryâ at 90.91%. It also received a 4.55% rating under good and 4.55%
rating under poor. The high rating under the excellent category could mean that the
principals had learned about the libraries online databases and eBook collections that
allow students to access the library collections and research databases anytime and
anywhere that they have internet access. Only two of the statements received a rating in
every category. The first statement âMy librarian plans, designs, and teaches activities
that engage students and authentically use print and digital tools,â was rated 63.64%
excellent, 13.64% at both good and fair, and 4.55% at poor and donât know/not
applicable. The second statement was âMy librarian uses evidence-based, action
research to collect data about my program. He/she uses that data to improve the library
program.â It was rated at 50.00% excellent, 22.73% good, 13.64% fair, 4.55% poor, and
9.09% donât know/not applicable. This standard focused on information and knowledge,
and this range of ratings showed that the principals and the librarians in the district
needed to spend more time sharing how data was used in the library program.
Question 13 asked the principals to rate his or her librarianâs leadership and
advocacy abilities based on seven standard statements. The rating scale was again
excellent, good, fair, poor, and donât know/not applicable. Table 32 displays the data
from question 13.

. There were two statements that had a rating of 81.82% in the excellent category.
The first was âMy librarian collaborates and connects with other librarians in the district
to share resources, ideas, and lessons.â This statement was also rated at 13.64% good

109
and 4.55% at donât know or not applicable. The second statement âMy librarian
participates in professional growth opportunities by attending training, conferences, and
webinars,â rated 13.64% in the good category and 4.55% in the fair category. The
librarians in this district attended monthly meetings and share sessions that allowed for
training, collaboration, and networking with the other librarians in the district. There
were two statements with ratings that bore looking at. The first was âMy librarian reads
professional publications to stay current on the profession.â The statement was rated
57.14% excellent, 9.52% good, and 33.33% donât know or not applicable. The high
percentage of principals that marked donât know or not applicable showed that there was
a need for the librarians in the district to do a better job of sharing the professional
research on librarianship with their principals and other stakeholders. The second
statement, âMy librarian uses evidence-based practice and information to help
communicate with stakeholders the importance of the library program and how it can
enhance school improvement effortsâ received a rating of 54.55% excellent, 22.73%
good, 4.55% fair, 4.55% poor, and 13.64% donât know or not applicable. The spread of
the ratings and the high percentage in the donât know or not applicable category led me to
believe that, while there might have been qualitative anecdotes that were shared with
stakeholders as librarians were wont to share stories of success, there might have been a
lack of quantitative data that principals were more familiar with being shared. This is
important as the use of evidence based quantitative data is as important as qualitative data
when advocating for the library program.
Question 14 asked the principal to rate the program management and
administration of their library program. There were eleven statements that were rated in

110
the following categories excellent, good, fair, poor, and donât know or not applicable.
The data from this survey question is displayed in Table 33.

Several of the statements had ratings of 4.55% in the donât know or not applicable
category, two, though, had higher percentages. The first âMy librarian evaluates print
and digital resources using evaluation criteria and selection tools,â was rated at 27.27% in
the donât know or not applicable category. It was also rated 45.45% excellent, the lowest
excellent rating of all the statements, and 27.27% in the good category. The high rating
in the donât know or not applicable and low rating in the excellent category were
surprising as the use of evaluation tools and criteria was an important part of the selection
policy that librarians in the district followed. The second statement âMy librarian
models, promotes, and teaches digital citizenship to his/her patronsâ was rated at 9.09%
in the donât know or not applicable category and 54.55% excellent, and 36.36% in the

112
good category. The librarians in this district did not turn in lesson plans, so there would
be no way other than observing them to be sure what lessons had been taught.
Questions 16 and 17 asked the principals to rank the five standards from most
important to least important and then to explain why they ranked them the way they did.

The principals ranked Literacy and Reading at the most important followed by
Teaching for Learning. Literacy and reading are so intertwined with the librarian
profession that not having it ranked first would have been shocking. As school librarians
were also teachers, having Teaching for Learning ranked second was also to be expected.
The third place ranking was given to Information and Knowledge. As the profession
moved toward becoming more digital and connected more to technology than physical
books, the importance of this standard was understandable. The rankings of the final two

113
standards were more of a surprise for me. The fourth place ranking was given to
Advocacy and Leadership with the fifth place ranking going to Program Management and
Administration. When asked to explain why they ranked the standards the way that they
did, only eighteen of the participants responded, but a majority of the respondents stated
something to the effect that âliteracy and reading should be the most important aspect of
any librarianâs job.â One also stated that âthe media center is best viewed as a classroom
by staff and students. Knowledge should flow out of its doors daily!â These views were
repeated in different forms throughout the responses.
The final grouping of questions that the principals were asked focused on how the
principal saw his or her librarian, the librarianâs role in the school, and how the library
program affected student achievement. The question 15 asked what roles the principals
saw their librarians holding in the school and library program. Table 35 displays the data
of how the principals rated the list of twelve roles that they were given.

The highest rated role was reading motivator at 90.91%. This correlated to the
answers that the principals gave when asked to rank the standards, with Reading and
Literature being the one rated most important. The next highest rating was 81.82% and
was given to both the teacher role and the role of instructional resources manager. As
the teaching standard was rated as second most important by the principals, the role of
teacher getting a high percentage was not surprising. The role of instructional resources
manager being marked so high was a bit of a surprise as the principals ranked program
management and administration as the least important standard. The lowest rated roles
were curriculum designer at 4.55% and co-teacher at 18.18%. The low ranking for the
role of co-teacher was, however, surprising. It was as if the principals did not make the
connection with co-teaching between librarians and teachers and the benefits to students.
Another surprising rating was for the role of clerk; 31.82% of the principals marked it as
a role that they saw for the librarian, higher than the librarian being a co-teacher.
Question 18 asked a similar question; instead of asking about the role that the
librarian played in the school, it asked the principal to rate ten different roles that the
librarian played and to what extent he or she played them. They were asked to rate each

115
role on a scale of always, most of the time, sometimes, never, and donât know or NA.

The statement âknowledge about literatureâ received 86.36% in the always category and
13.64% in the most of the time category. The second statement, âan advocate for the
library program,â received the same percentages. Being âan effective and knowledgeable

116
teacherâ received 68.18% in always, 27.27% in most of the time, and 4.55% in
sometimes. These lower scores were a surprise as the standard that focused on teaching
was rated high by the principals. Only one of the statements received a marking in the
never category; âknowledgeable about the effective use of technologyâ marked 4.55% in
sometimes, never, and donât know/NA; as well as 63.64% in excellent and 22.73% in most
of the time.
For question 19, the principals were asked if they saw their library programs as
enhancing student achievement. The principals were asked to answer yes or no and then
explain their answers. Of the twenty-two participants, only 16 answered the yes or no
portion of the question, and six answered the explanation portion. All sixteen
participants answered yes to the question of whether they see their library programs
enhancing student achievement. All six comments mentioned something about the
librarian adding to the learning of students and the impact of literacy on every subject
taught. The strongest statement was âAbsolutely! Whether directly related to the class or
preparing kids for ACT/SAT or enrolling them as voters to a host of other areas, the
library program is essential for broadening kidsâ horizons and making them more
effective students.â For these principals, the positive connection between library
programs and student achievement was obvious as it dealt with reading and technology.
The last three questions in the survey were qualitative questions asking the
principals to share their views on the role the librarians played in the library program and
school community, as well as on what were the librariansâ most important tasks. The
first, question 20, asked âWhat tasks are most important to you that your school librarian
does and why.â This question was meant to find out the tasks that the principals valued.

117
There were several questions early in the survey that had tasks and roles to be rated, but
this question asked for the specifics from the principalsâ views. Of the twenty-two
participants, only sixteen answered this question. As with the librarians, the principals
combined roles with tasks when answering this question, but most answers related to
promoting reading such as âpromotes reading, literacy and love for booksâ and
âmotivating our students to read and helping teachers find resources.â Several others
focused more on clerical, administrative, or teaching tasks. One principal stated that the
most important tasks of the librarian were âengaging lessons, reshelving books to keep
the library organized and making books easy to find for students and promoting reading
across the campus.â Several of the principals mentioned technology use in their
comments. The ideas of librarians promoting and teaching technology use appeared
several times in answers given throughout the survey. Ultimately the principals seemed
to find that a most important task for the librarians was âproviding accessâ to students
and teachers.
The principals were also asked what they perceived to be their librariansâ roles in
the school library and to explain their thoughts. With this question, the principals did
focus on roles using terms like âteam player,â âtechnology champion,â and âinstructional
leaders.â The principals stated comments such as âShe is the heart of the school and a
true team player,â âShe is one of our instructional leaders,â and âOur librarian is an
information specialistâ focusing on the librariansâ role as teachers. They also
commented on their librariansâ role of advocate by stating that âShe is the Resource
Centerâs biggest cheerleader, always communicating what it has to offerâ and âOur
librarian is not always IN the library, she is out and about being sure that we all know

118
that library resources are not bounded by four walls.â Two of the comments were
positive but showed that work was needed on the part of the librarians to fully develop
their roles in the eyes of the principals and, most likely the staff of the school as well.
One principal stated that his or her librarian was âgood with room for enhancement,â and
another stated that âmostly, he/she orders books that he believes students will want to
read and I believe he/she does a great job at it. At the beginning of the year he/she will
teach some lessons to each grade level, but not throughout the year.â In relation to the
role of administrator, one principal put it this way: âShe is in charge of the school library.
She makes decisions regarding every aspect of our library and its utilization in our
schoolâs overall program.â In a way, this comment summed up the role of the librarian in
the library program.
The principals in question 22 were asked to share what they perceived as the role
of the librarian in the school community as a whole. As with the other two questions,
only sixteen of the participants answered the question, and there was a combination of
roles and tasks in the answers. Many of the answers were similar to the question about
the role of the librarian in the library but with some wider focuses. Again many of the
comments mentioned promoting reading and âsharing her love of books with students.â
The principals stated that the role of the librarian was that of a resource, that âShe is a
key resource to parents as well,â and that a key role was âto keep the community
informed of available resources and to promote use.â Ultimately, they felt that the
librariansâ role in the school community was to be âa key support system in our school.â
The twenty-two principals who participated in the survey shared their perceptions
of their librariansâ roles in the school and the library program. They also shared their

119
knowledge of their library programs and the tasks and roles that were routine parts of the
librarianâs âjobâ and the running of the library programs. They rated their library
programs based on the ALA/AASL 2010 Standards for the Initial Preparation of School
Librarians. All of this information helped to define how the principals in the district
viewed the librarians and library program in the district. Overall, they had a positive
view, showing that the program was a good one, but that work needed to be done to make
it better and to make better connections between the library program and student
achievement.
Research Question Three: In what ways to school librariansâ and principalsâ
perceptions overlap and diverge in terms of the 2010 ALA/AASL Standards for the
Initial Preparation of school Librarians?
This question looked back at both surveys and to find where they were similar and
different in the perceptions about the roles of the librarian in the library program and in
how they enhance student achievement. Of the eighty-four librarians that were invited to
participate in the survey, only fifty completed the survey. Of the eighty-five principals
that were invited to participate, only twenty-two completed the survey. The principal and
librarian from each campus were asked to participate, but the surveys were not connected
in any way that would allow a direct comparison between the perceptions of the librarian
and principal for each school. One more principal than librarian was asked to participate
because the principal for the school where I, the researcher, am the librarian was given
the option to participate in the survey. As the surveys were anonymous, I have no way of
knowing if she completed the survey or not. Both sets of surveys had twenty-two
questions, and those questions were broken into four sets. The first was the

120
demographics, the second focused on the library program, and the third focused on the
ALA/AASL 2010 Standards for the Preparation of School Librarians and the elements for
each standard. The final set of questions asked the principals and librarians about their
own perceptions about the roles of the librarian in the school and the library program. To
answer this question, I have chosen not to look at the demographic questions as the two
groups cannot be compared or contrasted by certification levels or years in the district.
The first set of questions after the demographic section were focused on the
library program. The questions asked about the type of library schedule the program had,
the rating of activities made up of roles and tasks of the librarian and the approximate
amount of time each week was spent on doing the task or performing the role. When
looking at question 7 about the type of library schedule that the library program had, both
groups gave the combined fixed and flexible schedule the highest markings, chosen by
60% of librarians and 50% of principals. Table 37 shows the data from both surveys.

The second question, Number 8, asked the participants in both surveys to rate the
importance of 24 activities to the school library program. The interesting aspect of this
diverging of what was considered essential was that the principals only marked one role,
that of book purchaser, while the rest that had high percentages were tasks that librariansâ
do. The librarians, on the other hand, gave many of the roles high percentages in the
essentials category. Table 38 shows the roles and tasks that the principals and librarians
marked that were similar and different.

Principal Survey,â and âThe Hidden Roles of School Librarians: Librarian Survey,â
SurveyMonkey, Inc. Palo Alto California, USA. www.surveymonkey.com
Under the essential category, there were several roles and tasks that the librarians
and principals diverged on regarding their importance to the library program. Eighty
percent of the librarians marked âplanning library instruction lessonsâ as the most
essential role, that of teacher, for the library program. After that, 70% marked
âpurchasing books,â a role and then âteach research lessons to students,â a role, at 62%.
The principals, on the other hand, had the highest number, 77.27%, marking the task of
âcheck out booksâ as the most essential. Of the librarians, only 46% marked this task as

122
essential. Sixty-eight percent of the principals marked âpurchasing booksâ as the second
most essential role that a librarian does, similar to the 70% of the librarians who marked
it as essential. Only 50% of the principals marked âplanning library instruction lessonsâ
as essential. An interesting role that the librarians play is that of a reading motivator, but
under the task of reading advisory-which means talking to others about books and
helping them to find books that meet their purpose for reading. Forty percent of the
librarians said it was an essential activity, and 10% did not know what that activity was.
With the principals, 22.73% thought it was essential, and 27.27% did not know what the
activity was. The high level of participants who were unsure of what the activity was
showed a need for educating both groups on this activity.
The next question in the survey asked the participants to look a list of activities
and mark the approximated amount of time that was spent on each one in a week. Again
there were some roles and tasks on which the two groups agreed, and some where they
diverged. For the role of teacher with the activity of âplanning library instruction
lessons,â a majority of the librarians, 48%, marked that they did this between 1-3 hours
per week. On the principal survey, a majority of principals, 77.27%, also thought that the
librarians did this between 1-3 hours a week. While there was an understanding between
both groups of participants, the fact that both groups put it as such a low amount of time
showed that planning instruction was not a priority in the library program either because
the schedule did not allow it, or it was not considered important for the librarian to have
planning time. âCheck out booksâ was the most essential task on the principalsâ survey,
and on the question about time spent, 40.91% believed that the task was done for 1-3
hours per week. On the librarian survey, only 22% of the librarians marked that this was

123
a task that is only done 1-3 hours per week. A majority of the librarians, 34%, marked
that they did this task for 13 or more hours a week, only 18.18% of the principals marked
this time frame. There could be several reasons for this wide difference in answers. The
two that came to mind are that the librarians in this district were solo librarians and very
few at the elementary and middle school levels had aides to help with the clerical task of
checking books in and out. The second possible reason was that often the librarians were
not observed for more than a few minutes at a time, so often there was no true
understanding of what happens in the library and how long some tasks took. The activity
âteach research lessons to studentsâ was marked as essential by the librarians. However,
when looking at the time that the activity takes each week, 34% of the librarians marked
that they did it for less than an hour a week and 32% marked that they did this for 1-3
hours each week. The principals on their survey marked similarly high percentages with
36.36% marking that it was done for less than an hour a week and 22.73% marking that it
was done from 1-3 hours a week. As with planning lessons, if this was not considered
important by those in charge and it if it was not scheduled in, the lack of time that was
devoted to this activity made sense. The final activity that was considered essential by
both groups was âpurchasing books.â When looking at the survey questions on the
amount of time spent on activities, 48% of the librarians marked that they spent less than
an hour a week on this activity, and 59.09% of principals marked that they thought that
between 1-3 hours a week were spent on the activity. Through personal experience as a
librarian, I know that this activity is not done every week, so both of these timeframes
made sense. Because this was an essential activity for the library program, it tended to be
done when there was money to be spent. The final activity that stood out from the

124
previous question, âreaderâs advisoryâ was important to examine as so many had marked
that they were unsure of what the activity was. The librarians were pretty evenly spread
on the time that they do the activity each week, with 20% saying less than an hour, 22%
marking 1-3 hours, 22% marking 4-8 hours, and 22% marking they did not know. The
principals were also spread, but not as evenly, 13.64% marked less than an hour, 31.82%
marked 1-3 hours, and 40.91% marked that they did not know. This lack of
understanding about the activity, which in most libraries was probably done more than 13
hours a week since when librarians talked about books and made suggestions to their
patrons it was reading advisory, could be attributed to not understanding the librariansâ
roles and tasks as well as being unfamiliar with the vocabulary of the job. This and the
other divergent answers showed why continued conversations about the library program
and the role of the librarian were important.
The second group of questions that the participants were asked focused on the
ALA/AASL 2010 Standards for the Initial Preparation of School Librarians. Each
question was about one standard with its elements. The participants were asked to rate
their library programs, librarians, or themselves on a scale of excellent, good, fair, poor,
and donât know or not applicable. Question 10 asked the participants of the survey to
rate the of the library program based on the teaching standard. Table 39 shows the data
differences in the ratings.

For the librarians, the only element that was rated excellent above the 50% ranking was
âInstruction is based on student interests and needs and supports student achievement.â
However 68.18% of principals marked this statement as excellent. The other three
statements were ranked above 50% in the good category by the librarians, while the
principals marked the rest of the statements above 50% in the excellent category.
Question 11 asked that the participants rate the library program based on
statements that focused on the elements of literacy and reading. Unlike with the first
question in this group, the librarians and principals had a closer match. Table 40 displays
the data from the comparison.

The librarians marked three of the four statements above 50% in the excellent category.
The only one that they did not mark as excellent was marked at 52% in the good
category. The statement âI collaborate with teachers to teach and reinforce instructional
strategies that help students understand what they are readingâ was given the lowest
excellent rating at 54.55% by the principals. While that separation in answers was
interesting, the one that I found most interesting was the ratings difference for the
statement âThe librarian is/ I am familiar with a wide range of childrenâs, young adult,
and professional literature. He/she/I promote(s) and encourage(s) reading for learning,
information, and pleasure.â The librarians gave this the highest rating, but only at 74%,

127
and another 26% marked it as good. The principals, on the other hand, had 95.44% in the
excellent category and 4.55% in the good category.
The third question in the set, number 12, focused on the information and
knowledge standard. As with the previous two questions, the principals marked every
standard statement high in the excellent category. The librarians, on the other hand, only
marked three of the eight statements highest in the excellent category. The others were
marked high in the good category.

On the librariansâ surveys, none of the scores in either the excellent or good category rose
above 62%. The principals, though, marked the statements in the excellent category from
50% to 90.91%. Interestingly enough, the statement that the principals marked at
90.91%, âMy librarian has created a flexible, open access library,â was rated at only 56%
by the librarians; it received the second highest ranking in the excellent category by the
librarians. The highest rated statement for the librarians was âI work to develop equitable
access to resources, services, and facilitiesâ at 62%. The principals gave it the second
highest rating of the category at 81.82%.
The fourth standards question was about the librariansâ leadership and advocacy

The lowest, but still high, percentage of 54.55% was given to the statement âMy librarian
uses evidence-based practices and information to help communicate with stakeholders the
importance of the library program and how it can enhance school improvement efforts.â
The principals gave the same statement a 22.73% in the good category and 13.64% in the
donât know or not applicable category. The librarians only marked two statements in the
excellent category and the rest received high percentages in the good category. For the
evidence based practices statement, the librarians only marked 16% in the excellent
category, 40% in the good category, and 2% in the do not know category. The statement
that received the highest rating from the librarians was âI collaborate and connect with
the other librarians in my district to share resources, ideas, and lessonsâ at 62% in the
excellent category. The principals marked the statement at 81.82% in the excellent
category.
The final standard question, 14, focused on the project management and
administration of the library program. The participants were asked to rate eleven element
statements. The principals rated each of the statements at the excellent category, but none
reached above 81%. Of the eleven statements, the librarians only gave nine of them the

librarianship was important and something that was practiced. The second statement
âMy librarian works to ensure equitable access to the resources and services of the

SurveyMonkey, Inc. Palo Alto California, USA. www.surveymonkey.com
Literacy and Reading was ranked first, Teaching for Learning was ranked second,
and Information and Knowledge was ranked third. For the final two standards, the
librarians and principals did not agree on the rankings. The librarians put the order as
Program Management and Administration in the fourth place with Advocacy and
Leadership in the fifth place. The principals switched the order of the last two standards.
When looking at both sets of answers to determine why the standards were ranked as they
were, I noticed that a majority of the respondents, in question 17, wrote statements such
as âLiteracy and Reading should be front and foremost in a library program.â Another
thought that was repeated by the librarians was that âthe children and their learning come
first.â This idea truly helped to explain why the librarians put the first three standards in
the order that they did. I think that the two comments that truly explained the reasoning

133
of the participants came one from each group. From the principals, the best quote to
explain the reasoning was âAll are important, however the librarian need to have the
knowledge and love of literacy and reading, along with managing an organized program
to ensure the needs of the teachers and students are begin [sic] met.â On the librarian
side, while the overall theme that was repeated was about helping students develop a love
of reading, this statement resonated with me âwith a staff of one, students are my main
focus. The rest just waits until I have time.â As the librarians in the district were all solo
librarians, the idea of focusing on their students is what takes priority in the library
programs. The ALA/AASL 2010 Standards for the Initial Preparation of School
Librarians are what is used by school library certification programs to help librarians
learn the roles that they hold in their library programs. The ranking of the first three
showed that those in charge of the school library programs valued reading, teaching, and
information knowledge when it comes to the roles that librarians played in the library and
in the school.
The final grouping of questions asked the participants more specifically for their
perceptions on the roles the librarians played and the tasks that they did. Because these
questions were based on personal perceptions, the two sets of questions were not exactly
the same. Question 15 listed twelve roles and asked the librarians to mark the roles that
they saw themselves holding in the library program and the school. The principalsâ
question was the same but asked what roles the principals saw the librarians holding.

roles received high percentages on the principalsâ survey. The role of collaborator was
ranked at 72.73% but was not one of the top three roles. The top three roles that the
principals marked were reading motivator at 90.91%, instructional resources manager at
81.82%, and teacher at 81.82%.

Question 18 asked the roles question in a slightly different way. On the
librariansâ survey, participants were asked to mark how often principals saw him/her in
particular roles. The principalsâ survey asked them to rate how often they saw their
librarians in those same roles. Table 46 displays the rankings from each group.

Note. Adapted from data collected from both âThe Hidden Roles of School Librarians:
Principal Survey,â and âThe Hidden Roles of School Librarians: Librarian Survey,â
SurveyMonkey, Inc. Palo Alto California, USA. www.surveymonkey.com
When looking at the answers, it was interesting to notice that even though the librarians
marked all ten roles high in the always category, they also marked every single one of the
roles in the donât know or N/A category. The principals, on the other hand, had very few
markings in the donât know or N/A category. Instead, they marked answers mainly in the
always and most of the time categories. The principals saw their librarians as always
âdemonstrating ethical information-seeking behaviorsâ (90.91%), âknowledgeable about
literatureâ (86.36%), and âan advocate for the library programâ (86.36%).
The next several questions were qualitative in nature and asked the participants to
give their perceptions of the roles of the librarian in the library and the school community
as well as about the tasks that the principals thought were most important. The
qualitative questions were asked to give the participants the chance to expand their ideas
and to share any other roles or tasks that had not been listed in other questions. Question
20 asked the librarians what they thought their principals perceived their roles to be. The
principals were asked what they perceived the librariansâ roles in the library were. Both
were asked to explain their answers. The librarians answered the question âHow do you
think that your principal perceives your role as the school librarian?â Most gave detailed

137
answers that could be filtered into several different roles including administrator, teacher,
leader, advocate, manager, and clerk. Several of the answers were ambiguous, giving
tasks or explaining why the participant believed the principal did not truly âseeâ the
library at all. The principals were asked âHow do you perceive your librarianâs role in
the school library?â The principals, when given the chance to define the role of the
librarian in the school library in their own words, defined the librarian as a âteam player,â
âtechnology champion,â âcheerleader,â âadvocate,â and âinformation specialist.â There
were several answers that were ambiguous about the role of the librarian, instead
commenting on the librarian himself or herself. When changing the question, number
21, to ask about tasks that were valued most by the principal, the librarians had a more
difficult time sharing just tasks. Many shared that they felt they were valued for
providing books to students, checking out books, or providing technology help. Others
listed off the roles that they held such as being an advocate, leader, or teacher. The
principals shared more tasks, but even when listing off roles, they were written as action
verbs. The principals listed tasks such as âpromotes readingâ, âproviding booksâ, and
âordering books.â
Question 22 was similar to the previous two questions but was worded differently
for the two groups of participants. The librarians were asked to define their roles as
school librarians. When asked to share in their own words how they view their roles, the
librarians stated that they saw themselves as librarians, teachers, motivators, coaches,
managers, administrators, technologists, and collaborators. They saw themselves as
professionals who played important roles and completed tasks that allow them to do their
roles the best that they could. One librarian stated âI define my role as school librarian as

138
the âgo toâ person for resourcesâ¦â Another stated that âmy role is to support teachers
and staff members so that they are more effective in their instruction/job.â An overall
thought was âI am a resource of information, a teacher of information gathering skills,
and an encourager of life-long learning.â
The principals in Question 22 were asked what role they saw their librarians
playing in the school community at large. It was in the answers to this question that the
principals shared more of the professional roles that the librarians played calling them
advocates, teachers, and leaders. Many of the answers, as with the previous question,
relate to promoting books and reading as that was the overall role of the librarian. On
principal stated that âshe is a key support system in our school.â Another stated that the
librarian is âa true leader and wanting the best for our students.â
Question 19 asked both groups of participants âDo you see your library program
as enhancing student achievementâ. The participants were asked to answer yes or no and
then to explain their answers. On both of the surveys, âyesâ was the overwhelming
response. With the librarians marking yes at 98% and the principal marking yes at 72%.
The librarians did have a single ânoâ vote on their survey. When asked to explain the
answer, the librarian respondent said that it was because âthe collection is old, and that I
am working to bring it into the 21st century.â That idea did appear in different variations
throughout the librarians answers. The overwhelming majority of the answers from the
librarians stated that they did their best to create programs and have materials that were
of interest to their patrons and would help to develop lifelong readers and learners.
Several of the answers, while positive in nature, did include some negative ideas, such as,
âif you boil student achievement down to THE TEST, then I cannot draw a straight line

139
from my work to those scores.â The principals did not have a single respondent say ânoâ
in answer to this question. There were very few who chose to explain their answers, but
those that did focused on the idea that âdevelopment of literacy impacts all subjectsâ and
âmany of the content skills are reinforced through the library program.â
Through the use of surveys that included quantitative and qualitative questions,
librarians and principals in a single district in Southeast Texas shared their views of their
library programs and the roles and tasks of the librarians. The questions were based on
the ALA/AASL 2010 Standards for the Initial Preparation of School Librarians. Each
survey was twenty-two questions long and could be broken up into three sets of focused
questions.

CHAPTER V
Discussion and Recommendations
As someone who has served as a school librarian for ten years, I was curious
about how librarians and administrators viewed the essential tasks associated with the
role of the school librarian. After participating in discussions with fellow librarians, I
began to wonder how librarians and principals view the role of the librarians and how
each group believed that the librarian enhances student achievement. I also was curious
about how both groups view the roles that librarians have and the tasks that they do. I
wanted to know if the two groups view the tasks similarly or were there differences?
How were these tasks as identified by the American association of school Librarian
Standards implemented? Was there consistencies or inconsistencies in the way these
tasks were viewed?
The purpose of this mixed methods study was to define the roles of school
librarians as perceived by both the librarians themselves and the administrators in their
schools in regard to the ALA/AASL Standards for the Initial Preparation of School
Librarians (2010). In this study, I focused on how both librarians and principals
perceived the role of the librarian and how the librarians implemented the ALA/AASL
Standards for Initial Preparation of School Librarians (2010) to develop a vibrant library
program that enhanced student achievement.
The research questions that guided the study were:
1. How do school librarians describe their role in schools?
2. What do principals perceive as the role of the school librarian in the school?

141
3. In what ways do school librariansâ and principalsâ perceptions overlap and
diverge in terms of the 2010 ALA/AASL Standards for the Initial Preparation of
School Librarians?
The data for this study was collected using a survey that was administered using
SurveyMonkey. The participants were sent the link to the survey after completing and
returning a signed consent form (See Appendix D). The survey was sent to 57 librarians
and 23 principals to complete. The consent forms were sent out and collected during the
month of August, and the survey was open from mid-August to mid-September. The
survey consisted of twenty-one questions. There were five demographic questions, with
the remaining questions a combination of ranking, multiple choice, and open-ended
questions that were broken up into three sets. The first set focused on the library
program. The second set focused on the 2010 ALA/AASL Standards for the Initial
Preparation of School Librarians. The final set of questions focused on the participantsâ
perceptions of the librarianâs role in the program and in the school.
The information gained from the data that was collected was both surprising and
expected. It confirmed some of the misconceptions about the work of the school librarian
as described by both the school librarians themselves and their administrators. However,
some of the data from the survey also confirmed a deep understanding of the importance
of the librariansâ tasks as evaluated by librarians and administrators.
Discussion
Research Question 1. How do librarians describe their role in school
libraries? After reading the responses on the librariansâ surveys, I was surprised by some
of the responses. I expected the librarians to assess themselves and their programs

142
through a narrower lens than someone who is not in the library every day. For the most
part, I could see that narrower lens in the responses that were given. Several of the
responses were not the answers that I expected the librarians to give.
The first set of questions on the survey asked the librarians to rank a list of
twenty-four activities that represent some of the roles and tasks that librarians preform.
The second question asked the librarians to estimate the amount of time each week that
the librarians spent on the same list of activities. For example, when asked about the
activities that they consider essential and how much time was spent on each activity,
librarians listed âpurchasing booksâ as essential, but marked that they spent less than an
hour on it each week. They marked âshelve booksâ as both desirable and not desirable,
but put it in both the 9-12 hour slot and the 13 or more hours slot. The amount of time
spent on the activity was not surprising, really, as the librarians in the district are solo
librarians and less than half had an aide or parent volunteers in the library. What was
surprising was that this activity was rated both desirable and not desirable. This task
falls under the standard of Program Management and Administration for librarians.
Under this standard, the librarian is responsible for the management of the library
resources and how the library program is implemented. When the books and other
materials are shelved correctly the librarian and patrons are able to access and use them
to further their learning. This also allows the librarian to evaluate the collection and
make decisions on what is needed or should be removed from the collection. The fact
that it was also marked as an activity that was not desirable demonstrates that while it is a
valuable and needed task, the amount of time that is spent on it each week is not desired

143
and makes it difficult to work with patrons and fulfill the elements in the Teaching for
Learning standard.
The second group of questions focused on the ALA/AASL Standards for the
Initial Preparation of School Librarians. Each one of the standard specific questions had
high marks in the excellent and good categories but several of the standards statements
also had responses that were marked as donât know or not applicable. There tended to be
only one or two respondents who answered this although I do not know if they were the
same people each time. What made those responses significant were the questions that
they raised. Were these new librarians who did not know or have not been a librarian
long enough to be able to answer, or were these experienced librarians who did not
understand the question? Each one of the elements listed under the standards was a
concept or skill that librarians were taught during their degree program. For example,
under the Program Management and Administration standard, librarians work on
collection development and using tools to build, weed, and update collections. Part of
that is having an understanding of what materials a library has in its collection and on its
shelves. Several of the standards questions had a statements that mention sharing
information about the library program with stakeholders. These statements each had a
respondent mark the donât know or not applicable category. This connects directly to the
role of advocate that librarians should be playing. If the librarian is unsure about being
advocates for their library program and patrons, then it is important for the library leaders
in the district to add advocacy training to future staff developments that are offered to the
librarians. Having a lack of experience in a library program would be understandable for
new librarians and even for experienced librarians who were adapting to the changing

144
school library landscape, but a lack of understanding of what the element or standard
meant was a concern that needed to be addressed in formulating professional
development for the librarians in the district.
I expected that the librarians were going to be tougher on themselves and their
library programs when they took the survey, so there was little surprise in how many only
voted their programs or themselves in the good and fair categories rather than the
excellent category. This can be attributed to the fact that the librarians have a vision of
what their library program should be to have the most positive impact on student
achievement and they always know that there is room for growth as well as what can be
accomplished when they are provided the resources to do so. In analyzing responses to
these first two sets of questions, I realized that there seemed to be some confusion about
the library-specific vocabulary used in the surveys. When talking to the librarians at
meetings or during one-on-one conversations, they all spoke about working with students
to find appropriate books, but they did not seem to connect that with the activity of
readerâs advisory listed in the survey. This led me to realize that, even though librarians
performed the activities, they often did not think of them in the professional terms of
librarianship, but instead in the lay terms that each used on a daily basis and when
advocating for the school library program. This is curious as the âlibrary jargonâ should
be something that all librarians are familiar with since it is so often used in the
professional literature that we read and the trainings we take. When replicating this study
in the future, I would define any vocabulary that is specific to the library. This would
allow me to ensure that the librarians were able to answer all the questions with the full
knowledge of what they were being asked. By lessening the ambiguity of some of the

145
information, I could then gain a better understanding of what further trainings and/or
support is needed to help the librarians do their jobs better. As well as defining the
vocabulary in any future studies, I would also make sure to review the ALA/AASL
standards, so that the librarians are familiar with how the standards are written. This
would allow them to better answer the questions and to better evaluate their needs.
The final group of questions on the survey allowed for the librarians to share their
opinions about the librarianâs role in student achievement, their roles as administrative
staff, and their role as school librarians in written statements. The librarians gave both
positive and negative statements about what they believed to be their roles in the library
and school as well as what they believed their principals perceptions to be. There were
few surprises in the statements as many of the librarians felt that their principals did not
see them as anything more than support staff or clerks, with one librarian stating âshe
views my role as a support to teachers.â Another stated that âI believe that my principal
sees me as a resource manager.â At the same time, there were times their principals saw
them as teachers, administrators, managers, and advocates for the library and library
program. One librarian stated that âI believe that she sees me as an expert in my field.â
Another stated that âshe sees me as an important contributor to programs that support
students and teachers to improve the quality of education our students receive.â Overall,
the librarians felt that their principals only had a surface understanding of their roles in
the library and of the library program. As one stated, âI do not think my principal knows
what I do at all. He/she has never been in to see what happens-period!â Librarians also
indicated that they were doing the best they could with little support or understanding of
what they did and how they supported their schools. One librarian stated that âthe

146
biggest problem the library has in being effective is understanding and support among
teachers. If teachers are unwilling to learn how to use technology-linked resources, then
students are routinely denied the opportunity to learn about the same resources.â Another
librarian responded to the question asking of he/she sees the library as enhancing student
achievement, âno, since I have absolutely no support within the library. I feel like the
library suffers on a daily basis since I am the only individual in the library. I am the
librarian, book processor, circulation assistant, [book] shelver, administrator, discipline
management person, etc. It is virtually impossible to do a great job with all of the hats
you are expected to wear.â While there were several negative statements, overall the
librarians felt that they are enhancing student achievement as seen by this librarianâs
response, âI work with teachers to offer the best resources delivered in varied and
effective ways to enhance student achievement.â The librarians in the district had an
overall favorable view of their library programs and their roles in the schools. They see
themselves as professionals and describe themselves that way as well. When looking at
the ALA/AASL Standards for the Initial Preparation of School Librarian, the librarians
felt that they were doing a good job meeting the standards, but that there was room for
improvement. They are also unsure about how their principals feel about their role as the
librarian as well as the librarianâs impact on student achievement. This shows that while
the librarians feel that they are supporting their patrons, they need to work on their
communication and advocacy of their library programs and themselves.
Research Question 2: What do principals perceive as the role of the school
librarian in the school? The principals completed a similar survey to the librarians, but
they were asked for their opinions regarding the role the librarian played in the school

147
and in the library as well as about the tasks that the librarian performed that were valued
the most by the principal. I went into this research with the assumption that the
principals in the district being studied had some idea of what their librarians did and the
role that the library played in student achievement. I was not sure how familiar they were
with the terminology often used in relation to school library programs. As with the
librarians, I intentionally did not add any explanations of the library terms so that I could
see to what extent the principals were aware of their library programs and the roles that
their librarians played.
The first set of questions asked about the library schedule about tasks and roles of
the librarian, and about time spent on/in these roles and tasks. When asked what kind of
schedule their library program followed, a majority of principals stated that their libraries
ran on a combination fixed and flexible schedule. This was a bit of surprise, as I have
learned through conversations with elementary librarians in the district, that a majority of
the elementary libraries in the district have very strict fixed schedules for class and
students visits. This, and the answers that were given when asked about many of the
tasks, such as readerâs advisory, that were asked about in questions 8 and 9, showed that
the principals needed more guidance on the tasks, activities, and roles in which librarians
engage. When looking at Table 27 the principals marked each activity and role in the
essential and/or highly desirable categories, but five of the listed activities also had
principals who marked in the donât know or need more information category. Those
activities include: plan digital literacy lessons, readerâs advisory, create displays, manage
inter-library loans, and practice embedded librarianship. With the exception of practice
embedded librarianship, the rest are activities that the librarians should frequently, in

148
some cases daily, be engaging in. These are the type of tasks that principals should see
and as with digital literacy lessons, realize their connection to enhancing student
achievement. Similar results could be seen in Table 28. The difference with this data
though was that for almost every activity or role listed, the principals marked not
applicable/unsure on the amount of time that librarians spend on the listed task or role.
This was unexpected but refreshing as it shows that the principals who participated in the
survey were willing to admit a need for more information on the tasks and roles they
were asked to rate.
In the second set of questions, focusing on the ALA/AASL Standards for the
Initial Preparation of School Librarians 2010, the principals were generally positive, in
rating most of the elements in the excellent or good categories. However, there were
several elements that were marked high in the donât know/ not applicable category as
well. The majority of these elements came from the standard that focused on the
librariansâ Leadership and Advocacy. This lack of knowledge about the leadership and
advocacy roles of the librarians established that librarians needed to do a better job of
advocating and educating others on the âroles.â Regarding the final standard, Program
management and Administration, a few principals marked donât know or not applicable
category, but not at the same high numbers as for the previous standard. These last two
standards were not ones that were often observed during a quick pass by of the library,
and so were often unknown to the principal. When principals know and understand the
different aspects of the library program and take the time to gain an understanding of the
tasks and roles that the librarian has, they are better able to evaluate the program and its
impact on student success and achievement. When principals do not understand tasks

149
that the librarian does, such as readerâs advisory, which is working with patrons to find
books that fit their needs and/or interests, they are unable to fully evaluate the library
program and the librarian him or herself. By not having a strong understanding of the
components of the program, principals may recognize when the library program is
reaching its potential and is supporting student learning or when there should be changes
in the program to enhance the program and help with the mission of building life-long
readers and learners. They may miss when support is needed for the librarian are when
people, decisions, or perceptions are keeping the library program as a quiet place filled
with books instead of a vibrant place filled with learning.
The final set of questions asked the principals for their thoughts on the role of the
librarian in the school and in the library program. The principals, like the librarians, were
given the chance to write out in short answers to allow them to give more detail. There
were also questions that asked the principals to rate how often the librarian played
different roles in the school and the library program. Both of these had different answers;
one ranking reading motivator highest, and the other demonstrating ethical informationseeking behaviors. This showed that the principals saw the librarians in their foremost
role of literacy advocate, and that they followed ethical behaviors. One principal wrote
that the librarian was âan advocate for the school and lifelong learning! The librarian is
integral to the success of the entire academic and often extracurricular program.â Another
stated that the librarian âprovide[s] a safe and inviting environment for students and
staff.â When asked if they believe the library enhanced student achievement, the
principals gave a resounding yes. One of the principals explained why by stating
âAbsolutely! Whether directly related to the class or preparing kids for ACT/SAT or

150
enrolling them as voters to a host of other areas, the library program is essential for
broadening kidsâ horizons and making them more effective students.â The district where
the research was conducted has a history of being very supportive of the library program
and its connection to student learning, so the overwhelming belief of the principals who
answered the question was not surprising. However, the campus level administration did
not always show their support or recognize that the library was important. Ultimately,
though, when asked, the principals felt that their librarians were a key support system for
the schools and programs.
Research Question 3: In what ways do school librariansâ and principalsâ
perceptions overlap and diverge in terms of the 2010 ALA/AASL Standards for the
Initial Preparation of School Librarians? The final research question involved
comparing the two sets of surveys and finding where the librarians and principals
thoughts aligned and where they diverged. A majority of both groups marked that their
library programs had a combination fixed and flexible schedule. This showed that the
librarians and principals were communicating, in this case about the schedule, which
facilitated advocacy and program management. Responses were less similar to questions
about tasks and roles that librarians had and the time is spent on each. The librarians felt
that planning instruction was one of their most essential tasks whereas the principals felt
that checking out books was the most important task. When I reviewed the answers given
to the list of twenty-four tasks and roles, it was interesting to note that the principals
marked under the essential category only three roles while the rest were tasks. The
principals marked the role of teacher when marking the activities of planning library
instruction lessons and teach research lessons to students. They also marked the activity

151
attend district meetings which falls under the role of administrator. These are important
roles that librarians play and it is good that at least with these activities, the principals
recognize the librarians as both teachers and administrators. Though these roles were
marked as essential, several tasks were marked higher in the essential category. These
included check out books, purchasing books, shelve books, and check in books. The
librarians gave the activities that represent the role of the teacher the highest ratings with
the activities of plan library instruction lessons, planning digital literacy lessons, and
teach research lessons to students. The one task that the librarians gave a very high
essential rating to was purchasing books. This led me to believe that the principals saw
the librarians in terms of what they did instead of who they were. This idea was further
confirmed by analyzing the qualitative responses of both groups. While the remarks from
the principals were mainly positive, they did not always use professional terms to
describe the librarians, instead calling them cheerleaders and team players. When asked
about the librariansâ roles in the school community at large, the principals used the more
professional descriptors of teacher and administrator, but tended to focus more on the
actions and tasks related to those roles rather than on the roles themselves. The
librarians, throughout the survey, mainly referred to themselves and what they did in
professional terms such as administrator, leader, teacher, and manager. This was
consistent whether they were giving their own opinions or the perceptions of what their
principals believed. This disconnect between the how the two groups are view the role of
the librarian is obvious in the terminology that each used. This occurs when there is a
lack of understanding on the side of the principals for what the librarian does and on the
librarian side, when the librarian is unable to articulate and advocate their roles. The

152
repercussions of this are seen in the treatment of the librarian as support instead of as a
professional. When they are not looked at as a professional librarian, teacher, leader, or
even as an administrator, then it is easy to discount what the librarian does and how much
he/she effects student learning and the school culture. This can also lead the librarian to
feeling that he/she is not respected and that the library is not seen as important in relation
to student achievement and the school culture.
Analyzing the standards individually showed that the principals marked a
majority of the elements in the excellent category while the librarians marked more good
than excellent. This might have been a reflection of the fact that the librarians had high
expectations for their programs and felt that they were not meeting them. The principals
tended to only see a portion of the program and might not have entirely realized what was
missing or how their programs could be improved. This was not true across the board, as
there were many principals who made the time to learn about their librariesâ programs
and to work with the librarians to develop strong, student-focused programing. They
may also have seen that the librarians handled things and did not look too closely at the
program to see where the program excelled and where it needed help.
When both groups were asked to rank the standards in order of importance, both
groups ranked Literacy and Reading in the top spot, followed by Teaching for Learning
and Information and Knowledge respectively. This commonality for the two groups
showed that they all understood and grasped that the main focus and roles of the librarian
revolved around literacy, teaching, and knowledge. With the last two standards, the
principals placed advocacy and leadership in the fourth slot and program management
and administration in the fifth slot. The librarians switched those. This shows that they

153
felt that program management and administration had more importance than advocacy
and leadership in the running of a strong library program.
The last set of questions were not exactly the same for librarians and principals as
they requested the personal perceptions of the participants on the roles of the librarians
and the tasks that they did. Both sets of participants were given a list of twelve roles and
were asked which they saw themselves or the librarian filing in the library program and
school. The librarians and principals marked reading motivator and teacher in the top
two spots. This made it obvious that both groups saw those as librariansâ most important
roles in the school, which matched the standards that both groups felt were the most
important. When the librarians were asked how they thought their principals perceived
them regarding the list of roles, they marked both always and donât know for each role.
The principals mainly marked always or most of the time. This showed that the librarians
really did not know exactly how their principals saw their roles while the principals
clearly saw them as advocates and as knowledgeable about literature. This indicated a
need for better communication and education between both groups. When asked to
explain what each group perceived the role of the librarian to be in their own words, the
librarians used the professional terms of teacher, manager, and advocate whereas the
principals used more descriptive terms such as cheerleader, technology champion and
team player. A few did use the terms of advocate and information specialist, but the
majority of principals used terms that described librarians or their roles in casual terms in
regard to the library program. The principals did use professional descriptions when
asked about the librariansâ role in the school community at large. This disconnect shows
that while the librarians always see themselves as professionals, the principals on the

154
other hand only view the librarians as professionals in the general school setting. Unlike
with a teacher in the classroom, a majority of the principals have never been librarians
and therefore have a lack of understanding as to the entire scope of the library program
and all of the roles that librarians hold within that program. This becomes a problem
when the principal then uses the library and librarian to act as cheerleaders, clerks, and
teacher support without looking at how that effects the role of the library program and its
connection to student achievement. That lack of understanding also means that principals
may discount and/or underutilize the expertise that the librarian has as a teacher, leader,
and administrator in the building. Overall, both sets of participants often confused the
roles and the tasks of the librarians in their responses to a majority of the questions. This
led me to realize that more education was needed for both groups to help increase
understanding of the role of the librarian and what tasks were performed as part of
executing the role. Both groups agreed that their library programs enhanced student
achievement. This was a positive for the librarians as it showed that their advocacy for
the library program and their work with teachers and students had been noticed.
Recommendations
Throughout this study I focused on the perceptions of the librarians and principals
to define the role of the librarian in the school. I used the 2010 ALA/AASL Standards
for the Initial Preparation of School Librarians as my base. I chose these because the
standards and elements were the basis for all school library training programs. In looking
at the results of the surveys completed by the librarians and principals, it became obvious
that the librarians tended to rate themselves harder on each element and standard, did not
feel that their principals understood their roles in the school or library, felt that they were

155
not supported, saw themselves as professionals, and felt that their library programs
enhanced student achievement. The principals, on the other hand, gave high marks to the
library program and librarian in most of the elements and standards, marked when they
did not know, and generally had praise for the librarians and library programs.
Depending on what was being asked, the principals used either professional terms or
descriptive adjectives to describe the role of the librarian and his or her roles. Based on
these results, I developed recommendations for the librarians, principals, and the district
being studied to better support and develop librarians and library programs.
Librarians. For the librarians in this district, continued professional development
is needed. The professional development that the librarians participate in needs to be
reworked to focus on leadership and advocacy skills. Based on how the librarians rated
their programs under the leadership and advocacy program as well as it being rated as the
least important standard shows the need for development in these areas. The librarians
need to learn to better advocate for their programs and learn how to share the positive
impact that the library programs and librarians have on student achievement and on the
school as a whole. The information and knowledge and advocacy and leadership
standards both had statements that asked about the librarians using evidence-based
practices and action research for data collection and communication. With both of these
standards the highest scores were in the good and fair categories. The librarians need to
learn about action research and data collection and how it can be used to develop a
standards based library program and to advocate for the library. This is important
knowledge for the librarians to have and use as quantitative data is what stakeholders and

156
decision makers want when evaluating programs. The appropriate use of qualitative data
is also important for the librarians to know and use to advocate for their programs.
As this district library program is made up of solo librarians, it is important for
them to have the opportunity to meet for collaboration. Professional development
opportunities need to be offered that allow the librarians to share and learn lesson
planning, technology, and programming for the library. When asked about what
activities the librarians feel were essential, 80% marked planning library instruction
lessons and 50% marked plan digital literacy lessons. These are activities that the
librarians need opportunities to collaborate on and share with each other. While time is
provided during the monthly meeting days, other share session times should be offered to
the librarians to get together and work with each other. The library leaders in the district
should also work with the district technology department to learn how to use the new
technology that the district introduces as well as how to better implement it into the
technology program. This is needed as the librarians only rated this as good when asked
about technology when rating the program based on the teaching standard as well as
under the information and knowledge standard.
Time should be spent in monthly meetings and professional development sessions
should be developed to study each of the state and national school library standards. This
is vitally important as both the state and the national school library associations are
rewriting their standards and will be releasing the new standards in 2017 and 2018.
These new standards, along with a push to make school libraries more future ready,
mean that librarians must spend time working with the standards to be sure they are being
implemented in the school library program. The librarians need the time to learn the

157
different elements of each of the standards. The time is also needed to evaluate the
current library program at the school and district levels to learn what needs to be done to
bring the program into compliance with the new standards. Once the librarians have an
understanding of what the new standards entail, they must work on educating their
principals and other district administrators on the standards and how the library program
enhances student learning and school culture.
The librariansâ inability to separate who they are from what they do is a hindrance
to their ability to advocate for themselves. They are also unable to articulate how, they as
the librarians, help student achievement in terms of the tests, standards, and evaluations
that they are judged on now. Instead, they discuss how they support lifelong learning,
which is important but is not observable in the data that is currently collected. The
librarians must work to show how they support current patrons as well as how they will
support those in the future. To do this, it is important that librarians create measureable
goals and lessons that will align with the schoolsâ goals and show how the program
enhances student achievement. Librarians must also collect both quantitative and
qualitative data to be shared with principals and stakeholders. This data is a good way to
document the role of the librarian and the library program in student achievement and is a
great tool to advocate for the library program.
Principals. For the principals the recommendations are similar. There should be
professional development for principals and other administrators in the district that focus
on the role of the librarians and the library program. Given the changing state school
library standards and the lack of exposure in most administration programs, having the
district provide professional development that focuses on the librarian and library

158
program would help with communications and building relationships between the
principal and librarian. Creating and requiring professional development for district and
campus administrators that focus on specific aspects of the library program, such as
collection development, programming, the library standards, and the district evaluation
tool, would be helpful to supporting and developing strong library programs.
By creating these professional development sessions along with the library
department, the district would open up communication between the two groups. Having
open communication would allow the principals to opportunity to learn the different
aspects of the library program and how it, with the help of the librarian, can be utilized in
ways that will enhance student learning. Open communication would also lead to more
transparency between the two groups. When the librarians feel comfortable speaking
with their principals about the library program, as well as any problems and innovations,
the level of openness and transparency will lead to a stronger program and more student
achievement. This openness will also lead to more inclusion of the librarian and library
program in the school. With added transparency and inclusion, the principal can ensure
that the librarian does not become an invisible staff member and instead is seen and
accepted as a valuable member of the school staff.
Another recommendation for the principals is to work out a schedule to meet with
their librarian and discuss their library programs as well as to evaluate what is happening
in the program. This evaluation needs to include observations as well as measurable data.
It should be based on the district evaluation tool as well as the national and state
standards. Principals need to include their campus librarian in administrative team and
department chair meetings. This will show that the librarian is a professional in the

159
building and help to connect the library program to the school and its work developing
student growth and learning.
District Recommendations. It is also important for the librarians to be included
in the Leadership Academies that the district runs for administrators and teachers. This
would help to reinforce the idea that librarians are leaders and teachers in the district and
that they play an important role in student achievement. Such an opportunity would also
help the librarians work on their leadership and advocacy skills.
Finally, providing necessary monetary and staff support is also recommended to
help the librarians provide a higher level of services and support for their students and to
ensure that students achieve and become lifelong learners. By providing the necessary
monetary support to the library program, the librarians are better able to purchase the
books, databases, and supplies that are needed for their patrons and for running a library
program. The addition of library support staff would allow the librarian to turn over
many of the clerical tasks that they do, such as shelving and processing books, and
instead spend more time in the roles of librarian, teacher, and administrator. This would
give the librarians the opportunity to spend more time on readerâs advisory, teaching
research and digital literacy lessons, as well as practice embedded librarianship. All of
this would help to build a strong library program that focuses on student learning and
achievement.
Recommendations for Further Research
This research needs to be repeated with the new standards that are being
developed both at the state and national level. As the new standards are presented, they
should be integrated in to the library programs, and the individual library programs

160
should be evaluated using those standards. When the individual library programs are
evaluated, it will allow both the librarian and the principal to gain an understand of how
the program is enhancing student learning as well as how the program can change and
adapt to the needs of its patrons and school communities.
The district library program as a whole should also be evaluated using the newest
standards in a program evaluation format. This will provide the librarians and district
leaders valuable information on how the program is doing overall and where changes can
be made. It will also provide insight into the needed support and professional
development that would help the librarians better develop student-centered programs.
It is important for the district and the library department to continuously evaluate
the district and campus library programs to ensure that student achievement is being
enhanced and that the role of the librarian and the library program is evolving to meet the
needs of the students and staff of the district. The continued evaluation of the library
programs and the roles of the librarians will also lead the district to creating future ready
libraries and schools.
While it is important to look at districts as a whole when reviewing the library
program, future research should also include looking at the different grade levels. By
looking at each roles of the librarian and the library programs at the different levels,
support cam then be tailored to the needs of the librarians at those levels. By separating
the levels when doing the research in the future, the researcher and the librarians will
have a better understanding of what the roles the librariansâ play at the different levels as
well as how both the principals and librarians view the library program. This will also
allow for targeted professional development of the librarians and principals.

161
Another option for future research would be to include space for the participants
to include specific examples that show how the standards are incorporated into the library
program. This would allow the participants to describe their library programs and how it
and the librarians themselves enhance student achievement. By sharing specific
examples, the librarians would be able to show how their library program is a standards
and evidence based program. It would also allow the principals to show that they have a
good understand of their library program and the role of the librarian in their schools.
The collection of specific examples would also strengthen the qualitative data that is
collected and allow for a better analysis of the program and the role of the librarian.
Conclusion
School librarians are often invisible staff members in school buildings even
though they work to support students and staff in ways that helps their patrons to grow
and learn. Often what is taught by the librarian is absorbed and used by students without
any connection back to the librarian. Collaboration with teachers is often informal and
rarely observed by administrators. This invisibility leads the librarians to feel
unsupported and out of place in the school community. By taking the time to understand
the roles that librarians play as well as advocating for the librarian and the library
program, the librarian and principal will be able to create a strong library program that
supports the learning and achievement of everyone in the school community.
