DEDICATION
This dissertation is dedicated to my parents, John and Carolyn Dawkins, without
whose unwavering support, I would have never undertaken such a daunting endeavor.
They are two of the kindest, most hard-working people I know, and have provided me
with wonderful opportunities to grow even when it has taken me far away from them.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
I am grateful for the support of a number of people, but most important for the
ongoing support of my mentor and dissertation committee chair, Karen Gavigan. Her
encouragement and constructive criticism have made all the difference. She has provided
guidance from my application to join the doctoral program through searching for a
faculty position of my own. I am also grateful to my committee members, Audrey
Church, Heather Moorefield-Lang, and Susan Rathbun-Grubb. All have contributed in
unique and meaningful ways on my journey.
This journey would not have been possible without the visionary leadership of the
faculty members of the NxtWave program: Gail Dickinson, Audrey Church, Becky
Pasco, and Jody Howard. The Institute of Museum and Library Services funded Nxtwave
program allowed me to delve deeper into school library research and explore leadership
opportunities at the national level. Without this program, my doctoral experience would
not have been such a rich one.
I am also grateful to Helen Adams whose insights into intellectual freedom have
helped me to consider the broader implications of intellectual freedom for students and
school librarians. She generously met an unknown doctoral student for breakfast and then
has continued to be a sounding board and source of encouragement.
I wish to say a big thank you to my roommate for the past two years and fellow
doctoral student, Liz Hartnett. I am so glad that we had the opportunity to become friends
because we both joined this program.

Finally, I am grateful to the many hardworking, dedicated school librarians who
work every day to provide service to their students selflessly. Without their generosity,
this dissertation would not have been possible.

ABSTRACT
Intellectual freedom is one of the basic tenets of the library profession. However,
most librarians will face attempts to censor or control access to information at some point
in their careers. School librarians might choose to self-censor because they fear facing a
challenge that calls into question not only their professionalism but also their personal
values and ethics. While there have been numerous studies on censorship in other types
of libraries, there is little research in the area of censorship and intellectual freedom as it
pertains to the school library field. The purpose of this study is to understand the
decisions being made by school librarians when choosing or not choosing materials for
addition to the collection. To that end, the following research questions were the focus of
this study:


How do school librarians describe their own selection process?



To what extent do school librarians engage in self-censorship as part of the
collection development process?



When school librarians engage in self-censorship, what are the ways they do it
and the factors that influence their decision making?
This study used a mixed methods design composed of two phases: an initial

survey distributed to school librarians in North and South Carolina and follow-up
interviews with school librarians who volunteered to be interviewed. Four hundred
seventy-one responses were collected as part of the initial survey. Out of this sample, one
vi

hundred thirty of the responders volunteered to participate in the interview portion of the
research. Using purposeful sampling in order to obtain representation from both states
and the different types of school settings, forty-nine school librarians were interviewed.
The survey instrument was designed to collect demographic data, as well as to test the
usefulness of a scale to measure the likelihood of self-censorship. The interview
questions included nine questions designed to elicit descriptions of the selection process
and censorship experiences of school librarians.
The following themes emerged through analysis of the survey and interview
responses:
1) Communication with those who presented concerns to materials in collections
was key in allaying concerns and avoiding a full, written challenge;
2) Support of administration for school libraries and during the challenge process
varied widely and influenced the decisions school librarians made when choosing
materials and when choosing whether or not to defend them;
3) The grade levels of a school greatly impacted the decision making of school
librarians when choosing to add materials, with middle school librarians finding
the issue of age appropriateness especially difficult;
4) The awareness of and implementation of both materials selection policies and
reconsideration policies influenced both the selection of materials and the
successful defense of challenged materials;
5) School librarians sometimes chose to voluntarily remove or restrict access to
materials when they thought they might face a full, formal challenge;
6) The funding of school libraries varies widely both within districts and across

vii

states;
7) LGBTQ content was particularly troubling for school librarians when undergoing
the selection process;
8) Librarians at combination schools (elementary/middle, middle/high) faced unique
challenges when making selections and providing access to materials;
9) School librarians’ perceptions of the community environment, particularly those
located in rural communities, impacted their decision-making process.
The findings of this research suggest that school librarians are influenced by multiple
factors when making selection decision and better preparation on dealing with
controversial materials may assist them in avoiding self-censoring or censoring
behaviors.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION
When Susan Patron’s children’s book, The Higher Power of Lucky, won the
prestigious Newbery Medal for Children’s Literature in 2007, an immediate controversy
arose. A huge discussion ensued on multiple blogs and listservs among elementary
librarians discussing whether or not it was appropriate to include the book in their
collections because it contained the word “scrotum” with many vowing to exclude it from
their collections (Johnson, 2007). Why would school librarians choose not to add a book
to their collection because of one word? Fear. School Library Journal conducted an
anonymous survey in 2008 with 654 respondents. The survey results showed that 70% of
school librarians would choose not to purchase controversial materials because they were
afraid of how parents might react (Whelan, 2009b). School librarians are supposed to
select materials for libraries based on curriculum and the reading needs of students.
However, Pat Scales, formerly president of the Association of Library Services to
Children says, “But if you reject a book just because of its subject matter or if you think
that it would cause you some problems, then that’s self-censorship. And that’s going
against professional ethics” (Whelan, 2009a, 28).
The defense of intellectual freedom is one of the basic tenets of the library
profession. However, most librarians will face attempts to censor or control access to
information at some point in their career. Challenges happen most often in schools and
libraries and are usually begun by parents (American Library Association, 2015).

1

Because school librarians serve children and young adults almost exclusively, more
attempts to censor or control access to information occur in this setting than in other
types of libraries. One-third of schools have experienced at least one challenge (Hopkins,
1991). Although this number might seem low, it is estimated that only 20-25% of all
challenges are reported (International Reading Association, 2001). In addition, ALA’s
Office of Intellectual Freedom only reports written challenges which means that many
oral complaints and unwritten removals of materials are unaccounted for. School Library
Journal’s self-censorship survey conducted in 2008 found that nearly half (49%) of the
respondents had dealt with a challenge (Whelan, 2009b).
In this research study, school librarians from two states in the South were studied
to determine the factors involved when they are choosing or not choosing materials for
addition to their library collections. The purpose of this study was to learn more about
how school librarians make collection development decisions and to what extent selfcensorship plays a role in their decision making process. Using a mixed methods
approach, I surveyed the school librarians and then conducted follow-up interviews.
1.1 STUDY CONTEXT
One of the most difficult experiences a school librarian can undergo as a
professional is facing a challenge to an item in his/her library collection. Every time a
school librarian faces a challenge, this causes a rise in stress (Hopkins, 1991, 1998). A
school librarian’s ability to successfully manage a challenge is influenced by his/her
knowledge of the legal protections of the First Amendment, the case law surrounding
student rights, and the support or training he/she has received.

2

When faced with the almost inevitable challenge, school librarians must decide if
they wish to become selectors or censors themselves. As previously mentioned, handling
challenges to the collection is stressful for school librarians. As a result, some may
choose to self-censor or not purchase materials that have the potential for challenges.
Self-censorship can be defined as “a secret practice [that is] the least obvious but
arguably most powerful and pervasive form of censorship which is informal, private, and
originates with the decision maker” (Dillon & Williams, 1994, p. 11). In an article for the
UMKC Law Review, Huston (2004) referred to self-censorship as “silent censorship” and
saw this as more harmful than a challenge because “when a book is challenged for
removal it often opens a discourse about the book and its themes. If a book never makes
it to the shelves, discussion about its content never happens, and its themes are
preemptively struck from the minds of children and their parents” (p. 242). It is extremely
important to understand the decisions school librarians make in selecting materials, since
they often serve as the conduit by which students learn about reading materials and
information that can be used in their own information search processes. Information
behavior studies of school librarians could explain the process by which school librarians
make decisions about what to add to their collections. However, no such studies have
been conducted. Peripheral studies of students discuss the role that school librarians play
as mediators of information for their patrons (Meyers, Nathan, & Saxton, 2007).
Therefore, when school librarians choose to select or reject materials they are also
choosing to select or reject materials for their students.
A study by Meyers, Nathan, and Saxton examined the barriers to information
seeking by adolescents in high school libraries. They studied this by framing their study

3

in Kuhlthau’s Information Search Process model. They postulated that they could use
Kuhthau’s model of intermediation to “understand how the practice of teacher-librarians
may conflict with the purpose of creating an information seeking and learning
environment” (Meyers, Nathan, & Saxton, 2007).
Kuhlthau’s model of the Information Search Process (1991, 2004) includes two
stages which make the role of the school librarian significant for students: selection and
exploration. During both of these stages, students are seeking information and often
consult others in that process. School librarians are natural intermediaries for students
when they seek information. Therefore, it is essential to understand how and why school
librarians are making decisions about what information they are providing for their
students. A study of the selection process of school librarians would provide insight into
their information behavior and possible self-censoring behaviors.
As the researcher, I have a personal interest in this work. I became a high
school librarian in 1999, and served in three different school systems from 1999 to
2014. Over the course of those fifteen years, I actually never had a challenge take
place in a library where I worked, but I was very familiar with challenges around
North Carolina and in the last school system where I worked. Although I never had a
formal challenge, I certainly had people (primarily teachers) who questioned the
presence of some of the materials I had chosen to add to the library collections. The
conversation usually started with “Why would you choose to put this in the library?”
Usually this was said in a very accusatory tone that called into question my
professionalism and ethics. Fortunately, I was prepared for questions. I knew that I
might get asked why I had materials that some community members might find

4

questionable especially since I was working at the time in a rural, conservative
community. Because I was prepared to respond, I never faced a full, written complaint
or request for reconsideration. However, school librarians are not always prepared
when this happens, or they face entrenched, organized opposition to what some people
consider “inappropriate” or “dirty” books. I want to understand what factors influence
school librarians when they make selections and how they can overcome their fear of a
challenge in order to make the best decisions they can when selecting materials for
their students.
1.2 RESEARCH QUESTIONS
The purpose of this study is to understand the decisions being made by school
librarians when choosing or not choosing materials for addition to the collection. To that
end, the following research questions are the focus of this study:


How do school librarians describe their own selection process?



To what extent do school librarians engage in self-censorship as part of the
collection development process?



When school librarians engage in self-censorship, what are the ways they do it
and the factors that influence their decision making?

1.3 SIGNIFICANCE
It is extremely important to understand the decisions school librarians make in
selecting materials as they often serve as the conduit by which students learn about
reading materials and information that can be used in their own information search
processes. While there have been numerous studies on censorship in libraries, the world
of school library research has little theory surrounding the area of censorship and

5

intellectual freedom. Previous censorship studies have either been simple surveys,
checklist-based analysis of collections, or limited interviews with small samples. This
study has the potential to identify factors that influence selection as well as provide
insight into ways school librarians might become more self-aware about self-censoring
behaviors. Finally, this study has the potential to assist educators of school librarians
better prepare their students to become champions of intellectual freedom.
1.4 DEFINITIONS
For the purpose of this study, the following terms are defined;
1. School librarian(s) – a librarian that serves in a school with a student population in
any combination of grades from kindergarten to twelfth grade. They may serve in
different types of schools: public, private, or charter.
2. Collection development – the systematic process by which librarians add to the
materials in their collection in multiple formats.
3. Selection – the choosing of materials for addition to a library’s collection based on
their merits, content, usefulness, or other factors
4. Censorship – the removal of materials from a collection based on an intent to protect
the reader from objectionable material. In the context of a library, this term is most
often used when referring to attempts to remove or exclude materials by an outside
entity.
5. Self-censorship – the decision to exclude materials from a collection prior to purchase
due to either external or internal factors.

1.5 CONCLUSION
In this chapter, I provided the background for my study. I introduced the problem
underlying my study how school librarians make decisions when choosing or not
choosing materials for addition to the collection. I followed with an overview of the
research problem. Next, I stated the research questions. Finally, I described the
significance of the study and defined relevant terms. The following chapter, Chapter II,
presents an overview of the literature pertinent to the study, and Chapter III outlines the
method.

CHAPTER 2
REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE
It is impossible to place this research into context without an examination of the
rights of students and the relevant case law. In addition, the professional ethics and
beliefs of school librarians about the right of students to access information must be
understood. This literature review will examine the legal basis for intellectual freedom,
the American Library Association’s policies associated with intellectual freedom,
previous studies on censorship and school libraries, and a theoretical perspective on selfcensorship.
For the purposes of this literature review, Sections 2.1 and 2.2 will
examine the first amendment of the U.S. Constitution and its application in the right to
receive and the Supreme Court decisions that impact censorship and school libraries.
Those sections are followed by Section 2.3, 2.4, and 2.5 which will examine the
American Library Association’s (ALA) statements that pertain to intellectual freedom.
Section 2.6 will examine previous censorship studies that involve school libraries or
school librarians. The final two sections, Sections 2.7 and 2.8 will examine the Spiral of
Silence theory and the Willingness to Self-Censor Scale.
2.1 THE FIRST AMENDMENT AND THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE
The First Amendment is applied to public education through the application of
three basic rights “(a) freedom of expression, (b) the right to receive information, and (c)

8

the absence of an established religion within governmental institutions” (Burns, 2001, p.
2).
The First Amendment includes the right to free speech which has been expanded
to include the right to receive information. Bezanson (1987) explains that the court has
problems applying First Amendment rights when the persons involved are minors. The
Supreme Court refers to the right to access information as the right to receive (access to
library materials that board members and parents question). However, there has been “no
systematic attempt by any court to provide a fully reasoned basis for the decision
rendered” in court cases that uphold the right to receive (p. 339). Right to receive is an
extension of First Amendment protection given to speakers and messages to those who
receive the information. The Supreme Court protects the right to receive through four
forms of communication: mail, mass media, personal distribution of literature, and public
speaking. The courts have also extended the freedom to learn and the right of inquiry
through its defense of the right of expression in Tinker v Des Moines. Tinker is the
foundation for extending protections to minors within public schools. Bezanson argues
that the Supreme Court has implicitly extended the rights of free expression to include the
right to have free access to other viewpoints even when school boards object. Objections
to this interpretation question the function of school libraries and the extent of the
authority of the school board.
2.2 THE PICO CASE (1982)
The only Supreme Court case to directly address censorship and school libraries is
Board of Education, Island Trees Union Free School District v Pico (1982). This case
was initiated because a conservative activist group – Parents of New York United

9

(PONY-U) compiled a list of nine books that they wished to have removed from school
libraries. The local school board chose to remove the books from the high school and
junior high libraries referring to them as “anti-American, anti-Christian, anti-Semitic, and
just plain filthy” (Pico, 1982 at 857), despite the recommendation of a committee of
parent and faculty. After the board members removed titles without a formal review
process, a group of parents filed suit against the district claiming a violation of their First
Amendment rights. Pico was remanded for trial and the school board voted to return the
books to the shelves in order to avoid further litigation (Klinefelter, 2010).
Pico is the first and only Supreme Court decision to address a student’s right to
receive information; however, it does not provide a clear explanation of the breadth of the
school board’s right to restrict access. The fact that all nine of the Supreme Court justices
wrote opinions with a wide range of views did not contribute to clarity (Burns, 2001).
Justice Brennan’s opinion in Board of Education v Pico emphasized the rights of
students, saying the “special characteristics of the school library make that environment
especially appropriate for the recognition of the First Amendment rights of students”
(Burns, 2001, p. 15). In writing his concurring opinion about Board of Education v Pico,
Justice Newman explained that the removal of a book from the school library sends the
message to students that the book is unacceptable (Bezanson, 1987).
Pico has been interpreted to allow school boards some latitude in choosing to
remove a book. There are two standards that were discussed in the justices’ opinions
which might allow for removal: pervasive vulgarity or lack of educational suitability
(DeMitchell & Carney, 2005). Unfortunately, the problem is associated with interpreting
these two standards. In a review of First Amendment Rights and collection development,

10

Klinefelter (2010) explains that the use of those standards were supported by the opinions
of four justices, and therefore, is a non-binding but persuasive authority for lower courts
when reviewing censorship cases.
2.3 UNITED STATES V AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION (2003)
Although United States v American Library Association (2003) does not
specifically address censorship in school libraries, it is seen as an example of the erosion
of student rights since Pico (Peltz, 2005). In US v ALA, ALA challenged the
constitutionality of filtering in public libraries. In its decision, the Supreme Court allowed
federally mandated filtering of public library internet terminals. None of the opinions
reference Pico even though the two decisions might come into conflict “suggesting an
affection for new-federalist deference to local authorities vis-à-vis children’s civil rights”
(p. 104). ALA’s case was only intended to challenge federal authority in public libraries,
although the federal ruling has been applied to school libraries.
2.4 LIMITS ON THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE
In only two cases has the Supreme Court limited minors’ rights to receive
information when the adults’ constitutional rights remained broader. In Pico’s plurality
decision, the court gave schools a good bit of latitude to restrict access to information if
the school’s decision is based on the fact that that information is “educationally
unsuitable” rather than a subjective disagreement with or disapproval of the content. The
decision to remove the material and declare it “educationally unsuitable” requires a factbased inquiry and testimony from educational experts. If the decision to remove materials
is based solely on the ideas the books expressed, then that decision was deemed
unsuitable (Magi & Garnar, 2015). An additional restriction on minors’ rights to receive

11

information came in Ginsberg v New York. This decision allows states to decide that
some materials are obscene for minors even if those materials are protected for adults.
According to the decision, states can adopt a “distinct, broader definition of obscenity for
minors (Magi & Garnar, 2015, p. 128). Despite this decision, the Supreme Court has
made clear that school boards cannot simply ban access to a full category of speech and
must not ban material as unsuitable for minors without considering the entire population
of minors including older teens.
2.5 ALA’S POSITION ON INTELLECTUAL FREEDOM
The American Library Association (ALA) has adopted a number of policies that
support intellectual freedom and oppose attempts to censor materials in all types of
libraries. Interestingly, ALA has never officially defined intellectual freedom. Jones
explains that the term has been used to mean “the right of every individual to both seek
and receive information from all points of view without restrictions” (Magi & Garnar,
2015, p. 3). There are four core ALA statements that act as the foundation for intellectual
freedom in libraries: Libraries: An American Value, Library Bill of Rights, Code of
Ethics of the American Library Association, and the Freedom to Read Statement
(American Library Association, 1999; American Library Association, 1996; American
Library Association, 2008; American Library Association, 2004). These policies are
endorsed by the American Association of School Librarians (AASL) and can often be
found within selection or acquisition policies for school libraries. Censorship issues are
more likely to occur when there is no policy to guide selection or reconsideration. Kamhi
(1981) discusses this in her summary report on the survey “Book and Materials Selection
for School Libraries and Classrooms: Procedures, Challenges, and Responses”. She

12

concludes in her findings that “schools that do have written selection policies and
reconsideration procedures appear to resolve conflicts with few restrictions on the
instruction and library materials available to students” (p. 22). This lack of written policy
can lead to arbitrary removal of books without any due process or consideration.
First adopted in 1939, and amended five times since, the Library Bill of Rights is
a cornerstone document for intellectual freedom. Three of the six articles deal with
intellectual freedom and censorship, with article II explaining the need to present all
points of view in a collection. In addition, in 1993, the ALA Intellectual Freedom
Committee adopted a statement that the use of the word “origin” in Article V, which
refers to a person’s right to use a library, includes the idea of “age.” This statement
emphasizes that a person’s age should not limit their access to materials (Magi & Garnar,
2015). AASL takes it a step further by approving ALA’s “Access to Resources and
Services in the School Library Media Program: An Interpretation of the Library Bill of
Rights” (rev. 2005). This encourages school librarians to fight against censorship efforts
from outside forces as well as avoid internal barriers – such as restricted shelving, age or
grade level restrictions (ALA, 2014).
The Code of Ethics of the American Library Association was adopted in 1939 and
subsequently amended three times, most recently in 2008. The purpose of the Code of
Ethics is to make known to members of the library profession and the public the ethical
guidelines for librarians and other professionals who provide information services.
Article II of the Code of Ethics states that “We uphold the principles of intellectual
freedom and resist all efforts to censor library resources” (Magi & Garnar, 2015, p. 17).

13

The Freedom to Read was first adopted in 1953 by the ALA Council and the
Association of American Publishers Freedom to Read Committee. It has since been
revised four times, most recently in 2004. This statement begins with an essay about the
need for free access to information as a cornerstone of democracy. Following the essay,
the statement includes seven propositions which are grounded in the Constitution.
Included in explanatory text for proposition 4 is an explanation of one purpose of
guaranteeing the freedom to read as a responsibility
to prepare the young to meet the diversity of experience in life to which they will
be exposed, as they have a responsibility to help them learn to think critically for
themselves. These are affirmative responsibilities, not to be discharged simply by
preventing them from reading works for which they are not yet prepared. (Magi &
Garnar, 2015, p. 25)
This statement explains the importance of providing diverse and challenging materials for
young people.
Adopted in 1999, Libraries: An American Value is the most recently developed
and adopted statement that is part of the foundation for intellectual freedom. This
statement is written as a contract between libraries and the communities that they serve.
The statement explicitly mentions that one purpose of libraries is to defend the
constitutional rights of all to use the materials, services, and resources of the library. This
statement specifically mentions including children and teens as individuals whose rights
will be defended (Magi & Garnar, 2015).
Despite the protections afforded by the first amendment, Supreme Court
decisions, and the intellectual freedom statements provided by ALA, censorship still

14

occurs in all types of libraries. External pressures often attempt to censor what is
available in libraries, but internal factors can also play a part. Previous censorship studies
have attempted to understand the internal and external factors that lead to censorship and
self-censorship.
2.6 PREVIOUS CENSORSHIP STUDIES
One of the earliest guides for librarians who serve children was published in 1930,
Library Service for Children. Although the author devotes three chapters to book
selection, there is no mention of the inclusion of controversial materials or censorship
(Power, 1930). First published by the American Library Association in 1930 and then in
subsequent editions, The Library in the School also discusses book selection. However, in
its fourth edition from 1947, this discussion does include a brief discussion of
controversial materials referring to them as “Books of opinion.” Fargo explains that
“Because the school library serves the immature reader the school library has always
recognized an obligation of censorship” (Fargo, 1947, p. 156). This implies that
censorship in school libraries was an accepted practice. However, Fargo does explain
further that in certain fields such as politics, economics, and society, students need to be
prepared by being exposed to opposing viewpoints but only when that exposure is guided
by classroom instruction.
The earliest discussions of the issue of self-censorship came from an article by
Lester Asheim (1953) in the Wilson Library Bulletin. In this article, he discussed the idea
that when librarians are involved in creating library collections, they are going through a
process of selection as no single collection can contain everything that is published. As a
result, librarians must be careful to select but not censor. While some might argue that the

15

practice of selecting books for inclusion in a collection is in itself an act of censorship,
Asheim refuted this, saying:
Selection…begins with a presumption in favor of liberty of thought; censorship,
with a presumption in favor of thought control. Selection’s approach to the book
is positive, seeking its value in the book as a book and in the book as a whole.
Censorship’s approach is negative, seeking for vulnerable characteristics
wherever they can be found – anywhere within the book, or even outside it.
Selection seeks to protect the right of the reader to read; censorship seeks to
protect - not the right – but the reader himself from the fancied effects of his
reading. The selector has faith in the intelligence of the reader; the censor has
faith only in his own. (Asheim, 1953, p. 67)
Thirty years later, Asheim revisited this issue pointing out the gatekeeping role that
librarians play in access to information (1983). Asheim further discusses why librarians
choose to defend materials:
So what we are saying, when we resist the removal of materials that have been
selected for the library's collection or take exception to the restriction of materials
that have already passed the test of relevance for a particular library, is not that
questions may not be raised about the librarian's choices. It is that one segment of
the library's total constituency should not be permitted to interfere with another
segment's rights and that it is part of our responsibility to protect the rights of all.
(p. 181)

16

Asheim continues by discussing the positive and negative connotations of creating a
“balanced” collection and the impact that organized censorship efforts can have on
selection.
The earliest landmark study of censorship of libraries took place in California.
Fiske and a team of researchers interviewed 204 participants in twenty-six communities
in California. For each community, they interviewed the head librarian in the city library,
a head librarian in a county library system (if there was one), the school superintendent or
his/her designee, senior high school principals, and school librarians (Fiske, 1960, 2). She
found that librarians in school and public libraries engaged in a degree of self-censorship
in the selection process. In her conclusion, she stated that "beliefs in the concepts of
intellectual freedom did not always translate into actual ... practices" (Fiske, 1960, 110).
Fiske felt that the censorship behaviors of librarians could be divided into "conscious"
and "subconscious" acts during the selection process. Conscious censorship happens
when a librarian rejects a book based on the content of the book or the personal
background of its author. Nearly two-thirds of the Fiske participants said that the
controversial nature of the author or the book itself could result in it not being purchased.
Subconscious censorship occurs when a librarian states a different, more legitimate
reason for the rejection of a controversial book; therefore, its content is not necessarily
the main reason given for rejection. For example, the librarian may say that the decision
to not purchase an item was due to its content being too mature for young children, when
in reality the true reason is because the content included a non-traditional family that had
two mothers. Fiske found 40 percent of the librarians who stated strong intellectual
freedom beliefs practiced subconscious acts of censorship (Fiske, 1960, p. 64-65). Her

17

study also revealed that librarians do not “feel strongly enough about themselves as
professionals to uphold intellectual freedom values when the community voices censure
towards library materials” (Niosi, 1998).
Additionally, Fiske found several other factors that lead to greater self-censorship
or awareness of the controversial nature of books. Fiske found that school librarians in
larger municipalities were less likely to purchase controversial materials than those from
smaller cities. However, Fiske attributed this to the size of the bureaucracies involved
rather than to a rural versus urban divide. Fiske also noted that librarians with
professional training were less likely to avoid controversial materials than those with no
professional training. One of the biggest factors was the length of work experience held
by the librarian. Fiske reported that 56 percent of people who had worked less than ten
years did not take the controversial nature of a book into account when making
selections, while 24 per cent of those with twenty years of experience or more avoided
controversial materials in their selections (Fiske, 1960, p. 66-68).
Another early study into censorship and school libraries was conducted by Farley
(1964) as his dissertation research. Farley sought to discover what book censorship was
taking place in senior high libraries in Nassau County, New York. He examined both
voluntary and involuntary censorship. For this study, Farley used qualitative methods
including detailed, structured interviews with the head librarian in 54 high school
libraries. These interviews took place during the 1961-1962 school year. The interviews
focused on principles and practices in selection including why certain books were
rejected and what internal and external pressures were involved in the selection process.
In the interviews, Farley focused on three topics that were controversial and asked

18

participants to talk about specific titles. At the time of the interview, Farley also
examined each library’s holdings, card-catalog, and closed-shelf/restricted circulation. He
also obtained and analyzed the district’s official book selection policy. He held four
follow-up interviews to clarify initial responses. A strength of this study is the wealth of
information that Farley had to analyze. He had gathered rich data and responses from
many participants. However, Farley only interviews high school librarians. By only
including this group of participants, his conclusions might not be applicable in other
grade levels. Additionally, Farley conducted his research in a single county in New York.
One questions whether his findings would hold true in other locations in New York or
elsewhere in the country. Finally, this study was conducted in 1961. Because of this,
newer research would need to be conducted to determine if the training of school
librarians in intellectual freedom matters has changed, or if self-censorship has become
less or more prevalent.
More recently, Coley (2002) examined the collections of Texas high school
libraries to determine if self-censorship might be occurring. Coley defines self-censorship
as “the process by which a librarian chooses not to purchase a given book because of the
item’s potential for being challenged” (p. 6). Coley examined the online patron access
catalogs of one hundred high school libraries to determine if they included any of a list of
fifty titles that contained controversial content. Based on previous studies, he concluded
that the school librarian engaged in self-censoring behaviors if their collections did not
have at least half of the titles. This study found that self-censorship was more likely to
occur in small, rather than large, schools, but this may be due to smaller budgets and

19

student enrollment. Coley also explained that librarians in smaller schools may not have a
support structure in place to assist with controversial selections.
Several additional dissertation research projects that focus on censorship in school
libraries were conducted by Bump (1980), Cordell (2008), Rickman (2007), and Franklin
(2006). Bump’s study (1980) was an attempt to determine if high school librarians were
influenced by previous censorship attempts when making selections about what to add to
their own collections. Bump surveyed 608 public high school librarians in Colorado,
Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, and Oklahoma and had a 70% response rate. The
questionnaire provided the librarians with a list of 25 books that had a high degree of
censorship and asked them to reveal if those books were in their collections. They were
then asked to rank the books 1 – 25 in order of choice if they were to purchase all 25,
assuming they did not already have them in the collection. Additional questions were
used to determine if the librarians had any restricted shelves, books they found personally
offensive, and additional censorship questions. Bump found that previous censorship
attempts did not impact selection by the librarians; however, books that personally
offended the librarian were usually not included in the collection. Bump suggested that
this finding could mean that these librarians needed to reexamine their attitudes about
reading and access to materials.
Cordell (2008) conducted interviews with twelve high school librarians to
determine the extent to which they participated in self-censoring behaviors. This study
found that they did self-censor, primarily books with homosexual themes. Cordell
explains that self-censorship can take place both pre- and post-selection. Pre-selection is
described as “avoiding the purchase of materials that are known to be controversial or

20

that are distasteful in some regard to the person(s) selecting” (p. 18). Post-selection often
involves the “surreptitious” removal of titles from classrooms, lists, libraries or schools
when there is a threat of a challenge (p. 19). Post-selection censorship occurs most often
when the school librarian or the school itself has already had to deal with previous
challenges. Cordell concluded that “Despite the fact that almost all of the policies
specifically mentioned First Amendment rights and the importance of the Library Bill of
Rights, many of the librarians violated those principles in their collection development
procedures” (p. 135-136). Cordell found that community pressure was the strongest
factor influencing self-censorship while school building administrators typically
supported the professional judgment of the school librarian.
Rickman (2007) examined self-censorship by school librarians in Arkansas,
Delaware, and North Carolina to determine if the factors influencing self-censorship were
internal based on an individual’s belief system, external resulting from pressures within
the school system or external resulting from pressures from the community. Rickman
used a questionnaire to examine the selection process used by school librarians as well as
to determine what impact undergoing a challenge might have on their decision-making
process. Unlike the previously discussed studies, Rickman determined that, overall,
school librarians were not likely to self-censor. However, four factors led to selfcensoring behaviors: being aged 60-69; not holding professional licensure as a school
librarian, being at a high school, or having 15 or fewer years of experience as an
educator. A study to examine if these results are generalizable is necessary.
Franklin’s dissertation (2006) is different from the other dissertations previously
mentioned because of its use of private school librarians as opposed to public school

21

librarians. Franklin conducted an exploratory two-phase study including a survey and
follow-up phone interviews of private college preparatory school librarians in the
southeast United States. The purpose of Franklin’s study is also slightly different from
the previously discussed dissertations: she wished to determine if private college
preparatory school libraries experienced challenges and if they did, what factors
influenced how the challenges might be resolved.
Similar to Bump’s study, Woods and Salvatore (1981) created a survey to
determine if high school librarians were self-censoring. The survey included a list of 52
titles which had previously had two or more censorship attempts between 1966 and 1977.
The survey was used to determine how many libraries had these materials in their
collection, if they might be on restricted access, and of those who did not own them, if
they would be willing to purchase them. Woods and Salvatore came to the conclusion
that librarians did seem to be practicing self-censorship either through the exclusion of
the materials or through placing them on restricted access. A drawback of this checklistbased research is that it does not examine any additional factors to determine why these
materials might not be in the collection.
Checklist studies are not always conducted using surveys or questionnaires.
Fliger’s study examined the online public access catalogs of elementary schools in Iowa
to determine if the school librarians were choosing to add controversial books from the
ALA Notable Children’s Book Lists from 2002-2009 (2010). Fliger’s study only takes
into account the geographic location within the state of Iowa and does not consider other
reasons for choosing or not choosing to add materials to a collection.

22

Serebnick (1982) conducted an analysis of this type of checklist-based research
on self-censorship to discuss what the purposes of this type of study might be, how they
define self-censorship, and how they determine what titles to include in their checklists.
Serebnick examined more than 15 different studies going back to 1881. Serebnick found
that the studies greatly varied in scope, with some simply analyzing the holdings and
circulation of controversial books. Some of the studies have included insight into the
reasoning behind the exclusion of titles. Several also included either limited or extensive
demographic data about librarians, their communities, and other related items. Serebnick
points out several potential drawbacks for the previous studies using this type of research,
including a lack of explanation for why certain titles might be included, the labelling of
librarians as self-censors with little or no definition of what that means, and little
explanation of how many of the pre-determined list of titles should be included in the
collections (if not all).
Additional research has been conducted to examine the factors that influence
school librarians when they are making selections. Another significant study of
censorship was conducted by Hopkins (1991). Hopkins implemented a national survey of
censorship in school libraries in 1989-1990. This study examined whether the school had
a selection policy, how many media specialists were in each school, whether school
librarians felt pressure when selecting materials, and if they fielded either oral or written
complaints from 1986-1989. Hopkins found that most school librarians felt little or no
pressure in selecting materials; however, where challenges had occurred, the percentage
who felt under pressure was double the number of librarians who had not reported
challenges. In a subsequent study, Hopkins (1998) examined the support needed by

23

school librarians when facing a challenge. Her previous studies in 1991 and 1993 showed
that when school librarians sought assistance, the challenged material was more likely to
be kept in the library. She identified possible forms of support that could benefit school
librarians who were facing a challenge.
The only attempt to place the study of censorship within the context of a theory
located by this researcher was undertaken by Frances McDonald in 1993. She based her
study design on Kohlberg’s theory of moral development. McDonald surveyed school
librarians in Iowa, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. McDonald designed her study to examine
the relationship among the attitudes of school librarians toward intellectual freedom and
censorship. The survey actually included two instruments: a survey on intellectual
freedom and censorship attitudes and another to measure the level of moral reasoning.
McDonald’s research was intended to explain the gap between what librarians might
believe as professionals and their actual practices. Her study validated previous studies
where researchers found that the level of education was a variable indicating a tendency
to censor materials. McDonald went on to propose that there might be a gap between
what is being taught in terms of ethical beliefs of the profession and training in how to
implement those beliefs (McDonald, 1993, p. xiii).
Little research has been conducted to examine the role that administrators,
particularly principals might play in censoring materials in library collections. Hopkins
(1995) noted that when a challenge was initiated by principal the result was usually the
removal or restriction of the challenged item. Her study also explained that in those
situations the relationships between the school librarians and principals was not seen as
one of partnership. In reporting on a specific case of censorship in Kansas City in 1993,

24

Principal magazine discussed the parameters of the case and the role that school and
district administrators played in violating the First Amendment. The article warns,
“School principals and district officials must assiduously resist the temptation to quell
controversy that occasionally arises concerning school library holdings by summarily
removing the source of the controversy” (Zirkel & Gluckman, 1997, p. 62). In a Canadian
study conducted in 1989 which surveyed 400 principals in two provinces, Rainey found
that over half of the principals believe they should be able to remove materials from the
school library. Additionally over half believed that it was acceptable to place restrictions
on content instead of removing challenged materials (1989).
In 2016, School Library Journal chose to update its previous study on
controversial books that had been conducted in 2008 (Whelan, 2009b). A random sample
of school librarians was emailed the survey, and 574 U.S. school librarians responded.
This study found that 9 out of 10 school librarians who served at the elementary or
middle school level had chosen to not purchase material because of the potential for
controversy. At the high school level that percentage was lower. One significant change
from the previous study results was an increase in the use of content labels. Additionally,
the results showed that previous challenges had an impact on the purchasing decisions by
school librarians. This impact was increased when the challenge arose from an
administrator as opposed to originating with a parent (School Library Journal, September
28, 2016).
School librarians might choose to self-censor because they fear facing a challenge
that calls into question not only their professionalism but also their personal values and
ethics. The library literature provides little theoretical basis for self-censoring behaviors.

25

However, an examination of communications and journalism literature does provide a
possible explanation of why school librarians might choose to reject materials.
2.7 SPIRAL OF SILENCE THEORY
Elizabeth Noelle-Neumann proposed the Spiral of Silence Theory in 1974.
Noelle-Neumann’s research centered on the field of public opinion research, and it
particularly focused on the formation of public opinion. Her study was designed to
understand why people chose to censor themselves when their opinions were not those of
the majority. In her work, she connected public opinion and the interaction of individuals
with their social environments. She posited that “fear of isolating oneself (not only fear of
separation but also doubt about one’s own capacity for judgment) is an integral part of all
processes of public opinion” (Noelle-Neumann, 1974, p. 43). Noelle-Neumann suggested
that in order to avoid isolation, individuals used a “quasi-statistical organ” to observe and
assess their social environment to determine if a viewpoint might be successful (1974, p.
44). Noelle-Neumann describes the spiraling process as following certain steps:
1. Witnessing a struggle between conflicting opinions or positions;
2. Determining where you stand as an individual;
3. If you agree with the prevailing opinion, self-confidence is enhanced and this
personal opinion is more likely to be expressed without fear of isolation. If you
disagree with the prevailing opinion, the less likely you are to express that
opinion;
4. The more the individual perceives either widespread or less acceptance of his/her
view, the more that person’s opinion will adapt to fit the situation. (1974, p. 44).

26

The Spiral of Silence Theory has several key components including a fear of isolation,
unwillingness to speak against perceived majority opinion, and the belief that public
opinion tends to keep people in line (Weiss, 2009). The theory has fascinated researchers
since its first publication and numerous studies have been published on the topic
(Peterson, 2012). Peterson in an introduction to a Spiral of Silence Theory focused
special issue of the International Journal of Public Opinion Research, discusses its
appeal as a theory rooted in reality and yet the difficulty that researchers have in
conducting empirical studies to test the theory.
In her later work, Noelle-Neumann came to view public opinion as a force that
needed to be studied in order to determine its effect on society (Noelle-Neumann, 1991,
p. 257). In particular, an understanding of how individuals come to assess the climate of
public opinion was needed. How do people develop a quasi-statistical sense, “the ability
to estimate how strong opposing sides are in the public debate?” (Noelle-Neumann, 1991,
p. 268). Noelle-Neumann’s Spiral of Silence Theory suggests that understanding of the
climate of public opinion comes from two sources: observations by individuals within
their own environment and life experience and indirect observation that takes place
through mass media (1991, p. 270). Noelle-Neumann claimed that the most important
conclusion from the spiral of silence theory is “its potential for creating an understanding
of our dual nature, subject to the polarity between individuality and social nature” (1991,
p. 282). This might also explain the disparity between school librarians’ professed belief
in intellectual freedom and their practical application of it.
The Spiral of Silence Theory has been used extensively in mass communication
and journalism research (Kennamer, 1990). However, this researcher only found one

27

instance when it has been used in the field of library and information science. Luarn &
Hsieh (2014) used the theory to explore user anonymity in virtual online communities
and the role anonymity plays in the willingness to express opinions. The field of school
librarianship is not an anonymous one. In addition, the decision to select or reject
materials is not a matter of opinion but of following selection policies. However, the
study of self-censorship behaviors is still applicable to this field. In particular, the study
of whether or not a person is more likely to self-censor could predict the behavior of
school librarians in selecting materials, or it might be used to inform and enlighten school
librarians in order to prevent that behavior.
2.8 THE WILLINGNESS TO SELF-CENSOR SCALE
In order to understand the personal characteristics that might lead to selfcensoring behaviors, Hayes, Glynn, & Shanahan (2005) developed an 8-item selfreporting instrument to measure the individual difference of willingness to self-censor.
The Willingness to Self-Censor Scale (WTSC) has been tested using students and nonstudents. They found evidence of the validity of the WTSC through findings that show
that those who self-censor are more anxious about social interaction and communication,
tend to be shy, are concerned about how others judge them, and less argumentative. The
scale can be administered orally or in writing and includes the following statements
which the respondents reply to by marking strongly disagree, disagree, neither agree nor
disagree, agree, or strongly agree:
1. It is difficult for me to express my opinion if I think others won’t agree with what
I say.

28

2. There have been many times when I have thought others around me were wrong
but I didn’t let them know.
3. When I disagree with others, I’d rather go along with them than argue about it.
4. It is easy for me to express my opinion around others who I think will disagree
with me.
5. I’d feel uncomfortable if someone asked my opinion and I knew that he or she
wouldn’t agree with me.
6. I tend speak my opinion only around friends or other people I trust.
7. It is safer to keep quiet than publicly speak an opinion that you know most others
don’t share.
8. If I disagree with others, I have no problem letting them know it. (p. 306)
Two studies followed the initial study in working to validate the usefulness of the
Willingness to Self-Censor Scale. The first was an experimental study that asked
participants to take the scale and then followed-up with a hypothetical scenario which
included interaction with a group with opinions different from the participants (Hayes,
Glynn, & Shanahan, 2005b). The study found that those who scored high on the WTSC
were more likely to avoid voicing their opinion publicly. The second study conducted the
test in a conversational setting instead of a hypothetical situation (Hayes, Uldall, &
Glynn, 2010). Once again, the scale was validated.
Three other studies have been conducted where the Willingness to Self-Censor
Scale was used to examine behaviors of high school and college newspaper editors and
advisors (Filak & Miller, 2008; Filak, Reinardy, & Maksl, 2009; Filak, 2012). These
three studies provide a better link between this study and the behaviors of school

29

librarians. The Filak and Miller study (2008) gathered results from a nationwide survey
of high school newspaper advisors. They concluded from their findings that
self-censorship is most likely to occur when individuals are faced with situations
that dictate they go against the grain, socially. To that end, advisers of high school
newspapers who rate high in self-censorship will most likely demonstrate a lack
of comfort in regard to controversial topics. The desire to please and the instinct
to suppress are clearly components of this measurement (p. 22-23).
This suggests that similarly placed school personnel, such as school librarians might
engage in the same behaviors.
It is beneficial to examine the first Filak and Miller study (2008) and the Filak,
Reinardy, and Maksl study (2009) when examining school library censorship issues,
since high school newspaper advisors share many characteristics with school librarians.
Both, typically, are the only persons on their school campuses who hold their positions.
They each make decisions about what information is made available to the student body.
Often that information is controversial. Both school librarians and school newspaper
advisors have a concern about a potential outcome for their decisions that is not shared by
others in spiral of silence research: fear of losing their jobs (Filak, Reinardy, & Maksl,
2009, p. 371). The survey instruments used in these two studies were designed to test the
Willingness to Self-Censor Scale and determine if self-censorship was situational or
intrinsic. The researchers did this by including the scale as part of the survey. In addition,
they included a section asking newspaper advisors to react to a list of controversial topics
and how comfortable they would feel in including articles on these topics in their
newspapers. In addition, the survey concluded with three brief questions to assess the risk

30

advisors feel associated with speaking out (Filak & Miller, 2008; Filak, Reinardy, &
Maksl, 2009). One limitation of these studies is the lack of inclusion of other outside
variables such as community pressure, parent organizations, or support from other
advisors.
2.9 CONCLUSION
As seen in Chapter Two, the issue of censorship in school libraries and,
specifically, self-censorship has been studied for more than fifty years. The study of the
factors that lead to self-censoring behaviors is needed in order to better prepare school
librarians in their work to create diverse collections that meet the needs of all of their
students. Chapter Three discusses the proposed methodology for a study of school
librarians in North and South Carolina.

31

CHAPTER 3
METHODOLOGY
As the review of literature indicates, previous studies on censorship in libraries
have used three different methodologies: quantitative with the use of surveys, qualitative
with the use of interviews, or checklist-based collections analysis. This study used a
mixed methods approach, in order to more completely determine the factors that
influence school librarians when they make collection development decisions.
As stated in Chapter One, the purpose of this study was to understand the
decisions being made by school librarians when choosing or not choosing materials for
addition to the collection. To that end, the research was guided by the following
questions:


How do school librarians describe their own selection process?



To what extent do school librarians engage in self-censorship as part of the
collection development process?



When school librarians engage in self-censorship, what are the ways they do it
and the factors that influence their decision making?
This study used a mixed methods approach to examine the behaviors that school

librarians use when making decisions about selecting materials for their school library
collections. The researcher gathered data using both quantitative and qualitative methods,
in order to determine the variables that lead to self-censoring behaviors. The first phase

32

of the study was a survey administered in two states, and the second phase consisted of
forty-nine interviews with school librarians conducted virtually.
This methodology chapter is divided into subsections. First, an overview and
explanation of the research design is provided. Then, I provide a description of the setting
and research participants. The third section explains the methods of data collection. In the
fourth section, I explain the anticipated methods used for analysis of the data that is
collected from participants. The fifth section includes the anticipated limitations of the
study. The final section includes an analysis of the demographics of those who chose to
participate in this research and a brief conclusion.
3.1 RESEARCH DESIGN
Creswell defines the mixed methods approach to research as
an approach to inquiry involving collecting both quantitative and qualitative data,
integrating the two forms of data, and using distinct designs that may involve
philosophical assumptions and theoretical frameworks. The core assumption of
this form of inquiry is that the combination of qualitative and quantitative
approaches provides a more complete understanding of a research problem than
either approach alone. (2014, p.4)
The strength of using a mixed methods of approach is that it draws on the strengths of
both quantitative and qualitative research, while avoiding the limitations of using these
approaches in isolation. Practically, mixed methods is a more sophisticated way to
conduct research that avoids oversimplification of complex issues such as selfcensorship.
33

For the purpose of this study, I used the explanatory sequential mixed methods
design:

Figure 3.1. Explanatory Sequential Mixed Methods Design
The intent of sequential mixed methods design allows for the collection and analysis of
quantitative data with a follow-up collection of qualitative data from participants from the
quantitative data results. The intent is to conduct follow up interviews to help explain
survey responses. The quantitative data analysis can also be used to sharpen and focus
interview questions.
3.2 SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS
The research was conducted with school librarians in North and South Carolina.
These two states have strong school library associations and state level support for school
library programs. The potential sample size for each state was quite large. Surveys were
distributed electronically through each state association’s listserv. Membership in the
North Carolina School Library Media Association (NCSLMA) is over 1,000, and
membership in the South Carolina Association of School Librarians (SCASL) is over
600. Because not all school librarians in these states are members of their state-level
school library associations, the survey was also distributed in North Carolina through the
Department of Instruction’s listserv for district level school library supervisors. In South

34

Carolina, the survey was distributed through a SCASL listserv that serves district level
school library supervisors. The participants in the second qualitative phase of the research
were drawn from the survey participants. Survey participants were asked to include a
contact email address if they were willing to be interviewed. Interview participants were
selected based on purposeful sampling with the intent to include participants from a range
of grade levels and school settings. According to Creswell, purposeful sampling means
that “the inquirer selects individuals and sites for study because they can purposefully
inform an understanding of the research problem and central phenomenon in the study”
(2007, p. 125). In particular, I used stratified purposeful sampling because it “illustrates
subgroups and facilitates comparisons” (Creswell, 2007, p. 127). The sample size for
interviews was forty-nine.
3.3 DATA COLLECTION
The explanatory sequential mixed methods design calls for two distinct phases
including quantitative sampling in phase one, followed by purposeful sampling during the
qualitative phase. Creswell explains that “the quantitative results typically inform the
types of participants to be purposefully selected for the qualitative phase and the types of
questions that will be asked of the participants.” The results can be used to “plan (or build
on to)” the qualitative phase (2014, p. 224).
The first stage in the research process gathered data through the use of a survey
(Appendix A). The survey is a self-reporting instrument, largely using Likert scales for
responses. Likert scales are often used in surveys where respondents are given a choice of
five or seven predetermined responses with a neutral point. These scales allow the

35

participants to express the extent to which they either agree or disagree with statements.
The survey will have several sections:
1. Demographic data – age, gender, years in current school, total years as a school
librarian, professional credentials – certification, National Board licensure; total
years in education; grade level of current school; location of school (rural, urban,
suburban), awareness of district selection policy
2. Administration of the Willingness to Self-Censor Scale (Hayes, Glynn &
Shanahan, 2005a, 2005b)
3. Controversial topics inclusion - The survey will ask the respondents to rate a
number of controversial topics based on how comfortable they would feel about
purchasing materials. The topics will be drawn from the general topics that have
been identified by ALA’s Office for Intellectual Freedom (American Library
Association, 2015) as those that are most often challenged in libraries.
4. Perception of principal – Take the same list of controversial topics and have them
rate how comfortable they feel that their principal would be about inclusion of
materials on these topics in the library collection.
5. Perception of their job – How do they feel about their job?
The second stage in the research process included individual interviews with
school librarians. These participants were purposefully selected from those who
volunteered to be interviewed. They had the opportunity to volunteer by including
contact information at the conclusion of the survey. Each interview lasted between
twenty and forty minutes. Most of the interviews were conducted using a virtual video
chat using Google Hangout, Skype, or FaceTime. Two interviews were phone interviews.

36

Interview participants were given the opportunity to read the transcript of their interviews
and provide further clarifying comments. The interview questions were developed to fill
in gaps in the survey in order to answer the research questions. In the initial, there were
five questions to be asked of all participants and three additional questions to be asked of
those participants who had experienced a full, formal challenge to materials. These
questions were reviewed by the proposal committee and several practicing school
librarians. After the first interview, it became clear that an additional question was
needed to elicit information about the level of support that all participants felt they
received from their school administrations. (See Appendix B for questions.)
3.4 DATA ANALYSIS
Data analysis is in three parts: quantitative results discussed in Chapter Four,
qualitative discussion in Chapter Five, and then synthesis in the final chapter. The
quantitative data analysis includes descriptive and inferential statistics. The survey data is
used to determine which variables would most likely predict a school librarian’s comfort
level with the purchase of library materials on controversial topics. The data is analyzed
using hierarchical regressions to determine to what degree a school librarian’s
demographic variables, sense of the principal’s comfort level regarding a topic, and
willingness to self-censor will predict the school librarian’s comfort levels when
choosing to purchase materials. Hierarchical regression analysis is used to “investigate
relationships within and between hierarchical levels of grouped data” (Woltman,
Feldstain, MacKay, & Rocchi, 2012).

37

Qualitative analysis was undertaken by completing several rounds of coding
cycles (Saldana, 2016). I used two coding cycles for each interview using the following
coding methods:
1. Attribute coding – basic descriptive coding about the interview participant &
interview itself (Saldana, 2016, p. 83).
2. Structural coding – links data from interviews to larger data set such as from
survey data (Saldana, 2016, p. 98).
3. “In vivo” coding - allows for the use of the participants’ voice (Saldana, 2016, p.
105-106).
4. Emotion coding – coding of emotions expressed by participants – both verbal and
nonverbal - (Saldana, 2016, p. 124-125).
5. Values – beliefs and motivation (Saldana, 2016, p. 132).
6. Versus coding – allows the researcher to explore contrast between belief and
action/practice (Saldana, 2016, p. 136-137).
The initial round of coding focused on attribute, structural, and in vivo coding seeking to
focus on answering the research questions of this study and finding parallels between the
interviews and survey data. The second round of coding employed emotions, values, and
versus coding seeking to determine the participants’ beliefs about the selection process
and handling controversial material and the reality of responding to questions about
content. Due to the large amount of data collected through the interview process, NVivo
coding software was used to code the data and then conduct analysis examining
frequency of responses for individual codes. Additionally, as coding was being
conducted, I wrote analytic memos. The purpose of analytic memos is to provide a record

38

of my reflections on “coding processes and code choices; how the process of inquiry is
taking shape; and the emergent patterns, categories and subcategories, themes, and
concepts” (p. 44).
3.5 LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY
As this study was conducted in two states in the southeastern United States, there
is a limit to the generalizability of the research. The conservative nature of the geographic
region might also have skewed the results. To be generalizable, a similar study needs to
be undertaken that includes a wider array of geographic regions of the United States. In
addition, since this research focuses on censorship and controversial topics, people might
have chosen not to participate.
An inherent limitation of survey research is the question of representation of the
sample. Using the membership of two state-wide school librarian organizations provided
access to a large sample of the population. In addition, an online survey has advantages
over a paper, mailed survey. As most school librarians have access to email, online
surveys are easy for the participant to take, and can allow for the direct downloading of
data. Because the survey was distributed via email, one difficulty that might have
occurred is that a school system’s spam filter might have rejected an email with an
attachment or link embedded in the email.
The qualitative portion of this study has limitations as well. I asked for volunteers
to participate. These volunteers might have had a specific interest in my research topic
and, therefore, my results might be less representative of the sample population. In
addition, the issue of censorship is a difficult topic that might have lead some participants
to say what they think I wanted to hear or what they might deem to be acceptable. The

39

promise of anonymity, hopefully, alleviated any concerns. I hope that the participants felt
that having their voices heard outweighed any possible risks. I believe that the greatest
area of risk was the potential feelings of frustration that might arise when discussing the
difficulties in selecting materials and the fear of challenges to materials.
3.6 PARTICIPANTS
Over five hundred school librarians completed portions of the survey; however, as
every question was voluntary, not all of the respondents answered sufficient questions to
be included in the results. Four hundred seventy school librarians had mostly complete
survey responses. Several specific actions were taken to protect the privacy and
confidentiality of participants. Survey responses were confidential. Demographic
information from the surveys was confidential. Interviews were conducted one-on-one in
a private setting. Any names used in reporting results from interviews were anonymized
to protect participant privacy. In addition, each participant could opt out at any point in
the survey or interview process. This section discusses the demographics of the
respondents from both states to provide an overview of the school librarians who chose to
participate in this research study.
The number of respondents in North and South Carolina was relatively close in
number. Table 3.1 below shows the breakdown of school librarians by state and
geographic setting. The survey did not define rural, urban, or suburban for participants,
but allowed them to self-identify the school setting. The breakdown by setting depicted in
Table 3.1 shows that the number of school librarians in rural settings in both states were
very similar, 102 in North Carolina and 105 in South Carolina.

More urban school librarians responded in North Carolina, while more suburban school
librarians responded in South Carolina. The 2010 United States census provides data
about rural versus urban population distribution but does not include suburban data. By
combining the suburban and urban results from the survey, the percentages come close to
the actual urban and rural results from the census. The 2010 census showed that North
and South Carolina were extremely similar in terms of urban and rural population
distribution with North Carolina being 66.09% urban and South Carolina being 66.33%
urban. However, it is important to note that the total populations of the two states are
quite different with North Carolina having over 9.5 million residents and South Carolina
having 4.6 million residents (U.S. Census Bureau, 2015).
School librarians were also asked to provide information about their age at the
time the survey was completed. Only two hundred seventy-one school librarians chose to
answer this question. The boxplot below shows the range and concentrations of ages of
those school librarians who chose to answer this question.

41

Figure 3.2 Boxplot of School Librarians’ Age by State
The boxplot shows that the bulk of the respondents were quite similar in age for each
state. The graph and data show that North Carolina’s respondents were slightly younger
than South Carolina’s. Table 3.2 shows the five-number summary and averages for the
ages of the school librarians.

Additionally, it is important to note the gender of the respondents. School
librarians are almost overwhelmingly female. The respondents to this survey followed
this same pattern. Figure 3.3 below shows the gender breakdown of the respondents of
this survey. Again, respondents had the option to skip this question, others chose to

42

respond in a third category “Other/Prefer not to answer.” Four hundred sixty-nine school
librarians responded to this question. Table 3.3 shows the breakdown in terms of
percentages and total counts.

Figure 3.4 Race or ethnicity of school librarians by state
School librarians in North and South Carolina are required to hold a state license
in order to work in a public school. However, some school librarians begin working in
44

school libraries before completion of their coursework or licensure. The survey asked the
respondents if they currently hold a state license in school library media for K-12. Almost
all of the respondents in both states indicated that they currently hold that license. Table
3.5 and Figure 3.5 illustrate these responses.

Figure 3.5 School librarians holding licensure by state
School librarians can also pursue National Board (NB) certification. The National
Board for Professional Teaching Standards is an advanced licensure program for

45

teachers, school librarians, and school counselors. The license is transferable across state
lines and is considered to be a step above state level licensure. NB certification in school
library media was first offered in 2002 and is renewable every ten years. There was some
difference between the two states in the number of school librarians with NB licenses.
This is likely caused by North Carolina’s previous state-level financial support of those
who wished to pursue licensure. Table and Figure 3.6 show the responses for this item.

An additional consideration when examining the demographics of the respondents
is determining how much experience they have had as a school librarian. Each school
librarian was asked to indicate their level of experience. Figure 3.7 and Table 3.7
illustrate the responses to this question.

Figure 3.7 Years of experience as a school librarian by state
It is interesting to note that there are some differences between the two states when
looking at the years of experience of the school librarians. South Carolina had more
school librarians with less than one year of experience and more librarians with more
than twenty-five years of experience. North Carolina’s years of experience was more
heavily represented in the one year to 20 years of experience. Perhaps an explanation for
this difference is that North Carolina has five school library preparation programs in the
state, while South Carolina only has one.

I chose not to limit the respondents to the survey to public school librarians.
However, the respondents to the survey were almost all public school librarians. Because
of the very small sample size of non-public school librarians, I did not conduct analysis to
determine the differences in selection behaviors between these groups. Table 3.8 and
Figure 3.8 illustrate the types of schools represented by the respondents to the survey.
Additionally the table provides a list of several kinds of schools not represented by the
survey choices.

Figure 3.8 School type by state
Because any school librarian in North and South Carolina could choose to
participate in this study, respondents worked in a variety of grade level settings. I asked
school librarians to indicate the grades that their schools served. I then recoded the date to
reflect that they served in an elementary, middle, or high school setting. Elementary
grades included pre-K through 5th grade. A few of the schools were early elementary
serving Pre-K through 2 which I chose to recode as elementary. Others were later
elementary serving grades four through six, which I also chose to recode as elementary.
Additionally, there were a number of schools who served all grades or other
combinations of grades. Figures 3.9 and 3.10 separately illustrate the grade levels for
each state while Table 3.9 show the breakdown of schools in terms of elementary,
middle, high school, and other. I also created a table (3.10) with a breakdown of the other

3.7 CONCLUSION
Based on the analysis of the demographic data from the survey, the respondents
from the two states are quite similar in terms of age, school levels, state-level
certification, race/ethnicity, and gender. As a result, in the remaining analysis of the data,
I discuss the data gathered from the two states without distinguishing between them. In
this chapter, I have explained the methodology for my research study. I have outlined the
mixed methods design that I used to gather data. Then, I explained the choice of setting
and participants. In the next two sections, I discussed the survey and interviews I that
used for my data collection, as well as how I planned to analyze the data that was

51

collected. The next section examined the demographic characteristics of the participants
from both states. Finally, I concluded with the expected limitations of the study.

52

CHAPTER 4
QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS
For the purpose of this study, statistical analysis of the survey data was conducted
to examine factors that could be used to predict self-censoring behaviors. This chapter
examines the presence of policies that guide selection and reconsideration, materials
selection budgets, and the application of the Willingness to Self-Censor Scale. Qualtrics
Survey Software was used to administer the survey and collect responses from survey
participants. Analysis was conducted using the embedded Qualtrics analytics as well as
more advanced statistical analysis using the R statistical programming language and R
Studio. R programming language is an open access program language used for statistics.
R studio is a free, open-source user interface for using the R programming language.
This chapter is divided into several sections. Section 4.1 examines the level of
awareness of school librarians about the presence of selection and reconsideration
policies within their districts and schools. Section 4.2 of this chapter provides analysis of
the materials selection budgets of the respondents to the survey. Section 4.3 includes
analysis of the administration of the Willingness to Self-Censor Scale and its usefulness
in predicting self-censoring tendencies. Section 4.4 reports on the level of job security
that school librarians feel when they add controversial material to the collection.
4.1 SELECTION AND RECONSIDERATION POLICIES
Examination of the presence of selection and reconsideration policies is important
when understanding how school librarians choose to add materials. A materials selection

53

policy (sometimes called a collection development policy) is intended to guide school
librarians in determining the types and qualities of materials that should be added to a
school library collection.
Within the survey, I asked school librarians if their district had a selection policy,
and if their district did not have one, if they had a school-level policy to guide their
selection. Table 4.1 corresponds to the question “Does your school district (local
education agency) have a selection policy for choosing library materials?”

The survey then asked school librarians, “If your school district does not have a selection

responses to that question.

The response seems inconsistent with the previous responses. I would expect to have
responses from only the 111 who indicated that their districts did not have a policy. I
believe this is a mis-reading of the question by the respondents. Another possibility is
that specialized schools, such as magnet schools, in a district might have their own
selection policy. Perhaps using skip-logic in the survey would have been better in order
to have school librarians who indicated their districts have a selection policy skip over
this question.
Table 4.3 corresponds to the question, “If you work at an independent school (not
affiliated with a school district), does your school library a selection policy for choosing
library materials?” The responses to this question are more in line with those who
indicated they were from independent schools.

Reconsideration policies are used to guide the process when materials called into
question are considered for removal from library collections. The presence of a
reconsideration policy and process are needed to ensure that consistent procedures are
followed when challenges to materials are placed.

Table 4.4 provides responses to the question, “Does your school district (local
education agency) have a reconsideration policy (and form) for possible removal of

It is interesting to note that a higher percentage of school districts had reconsideration
policies than selection policies, indicating a more reactive policy than proactive policy.
The data from Table 4.5 has the same issue as Table 4.2 above. I would expect that only
29 people would respond to this question based on the responses to the question about
district level reconsideration policies. The question this raises is whether or not schools
have separate reconsideration policies that are different from their districts. The question
was, “If your school district does not have a reconsideration policy, does your school
library have its own reconsideration policy?”

The presence of a selection policy serves little purpose if school librarians do not have
funds with which to purchase materials. The next section of analysis examines the level
of funding that school librarians have.
4.2 BUDGETS
In examining funding for school librarians, the survey asked school librarians two
specific questions: “Is your school a designated Title I school?” and “What do you
estimate your current school year’s budget to be for the purchase of school library
materials (books, databases, other information resources)”? While these two questions
can provide some insight, further analysis into how the funding translates into purchasing
based on student population, school poverty, and setting is important.
Title I schools are assigned this status by the U. S. Department of Education. Title
I (Part A) is part of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). Title I status
indicates that the school has either high numbers of or high percentages of children from
low-income homes (U.S. Department of Education, 2015). Table 4.7 shows the

57

breakdown of school librarians serving in Title I schools. Often, these schools qualify for
additional federal funding.

A little less than half of the school librarians who responded to the survey indicated that
their schools held Title I status. To examine this further, I broke down the information
based on geographic setting of the schools. Table 4.8 shows this analysis.

This table indicates that Title I schools are largely located in rural settings. The graph on
the next page (Figure 4.1) illustrates the table above.

Figure 4.1 Title I Schools by Geographic Setting
An examination of funding for school library materials is important. If school
libraries have no funds for materials, the selection policy and process serves little
purpose. Each school librarian was asked to indicate his/her school library’s level of
funding for the 2015-2016 school year. They were not asked to indicate the source of the
funds. Figure 4.2 below shows their responses.

At this point, it is important to determine if Title I status had any impact on the budget
levels for the school libraries. As these schools are already located in poverty-stricken
areas, have the school libraries been provided with additional funding? Table 4.10
provides the overview of the budgets based on Title I status.

Figure 4.3 Budget by Title I Status
This finding is particularly troubling, since it indicates that high poverty schools are also
receiving the smallest budgets for materials despite the additional funding provided
through Title I status.

61

While the overall budget information is important, it is necessary to determine if
those funding levels are on equal footing based on the student populations in each school.
A school with 1,000 students needs to receive funding appropriate for that number of
students. Each year, School Library Journal (SLJ) using data from Follett compiles a list
of average book prices that have been sold in a specific time frame. Figure 4.4 (from SLJ)
below shows the average prices for books in both public library and school library
settings (School Library Journal, March 6, 2017). The average price for a hardcover book
for children in 2016 (from January to March) was $18.01, and for young adults was
$22.74. So, if a school library is allotted $500 for the purchase of materials they could
purchase between 22 and 27 new books for the year. For many libraries, this would not
cover replacements of damaged or lost titles.

Figure 4.4 SLJ Average Book Prices 2017 (Source: School Library Journal)

62

As part of the survey, school librarians were asked to estimate their school’s student
population. This data was then used to determine the funding level based on school size.
Figure 4.5 illustrates this analysis. Table 4.11 provides the numerical information
corresponding to the figure.

Figure 4.5 Estimated 2015-2016 Budget Based on School Size
While the smallest schools did receive the smallest budgets, it is troubling to note that
schools larger than 500 pupils received budgets of less than $1000 indicating that the
funding was less than $2 per student. One concern is that the category of less than $1000
also includes school libraries who receive no funding at all.

4.3 WILLINGNESS TO SELF-CENSOR SCALE AND CONTROVERSIAL TOPICS
Funding is an important aspect of the selection process. However, school
librarians are also personally making decisions about whether or not to add items to their
collections largely based on selection policies. In order to understand the process more
completely, the survey asked school librarians to examine their own tendencies to selfcensor and their comfort with the inclusion of controversial topics.
School librarians were asked to respond to eight items to determine their reaction
to perceived public opinion. For each statement, the respondents were asked to indicate
their response on a Likert scale, saying if they strongly disagreed, disagreed, somewhat
disagreed, neither agreed nor disagreed, somewhat agreed, agreed, or strongly agreed.
Once again, participants had the option to not respond to this question. Four hundred and

64

sixty participants responded to all of the items. Table 4.12 on the next page shows the
results of the scale.
Two items of the WTSC Scale were written to be reverse coded: It is easy for me
to express my opinion around others who I think will disagree with me; and If I disagree
with others, I have no problem letting them know it. I then was able to examine the
average scores for each of the items on the scale. Table 4.13 below shows the average
scores for each item in the scale. The higher the average, the more likely a person is to
engage in self-censoring behaviors.

than argue about it.
4. It is easy for me to express my opinion around others who I
think will disagree with me.
5. I'd feel uncomfortable if someone asked my opinion and I
knew that he or she wouldn't agree with me.
6. I tend to speak my opinion only around friends or other
people I trust.
7. It is safer to keep quiet than publicly speak an opinion that
you know most others don't share.

After reversing the two items from the scale, I found Cronbach’s alpha to be
0.863. Cronbach’s alpha measures internal consistence or how closely related items are in
a group. This is a measure of scale reliability. The coefficient of 0.863 suggests that the
items in the scale have relatively high internal consistency. A reliability coefficient of
0.70 or higher is acceptable in social science research. This allowed me to combine the
items into a single scale score that can be used to develop models to conduct hierarchical
linear regressions to determine if the score is predictive of school librarians’ comfort
level with the addition to their collections of materials that contain controversial topics.
To examine this relationship, the survey asked school librarians to react to six
different topics in terms of how comfortable they would be in adding materials to their
collection that contain the topics. The question also said that the materials in question
would be developmentally appropriate for their schools with positive reviews from
respected review sources. Table 4.14 on the next page shows the responses.
It’s important to note that approximately twenty fewer responses were recorded
about the perceived principal’s comfort level. This could be that the school librarian did
not feel he or she had sufficient information to judge their principal’s comfort level.
Additionally, three areas showed the greatest differences between the school librarian’s
comfort and their perceptions of their principal’s comfort level: LGBTQ content, drugs,
alcohol, and smoking, and sexually explicit materials. In all three cases, the school
librarians indicated a higher level of comfort with those materials. The differences
between the comfort levels on all six topics can be seeing through the paired graphs
beginning on page 69. Each graph depicts comfort levels to the left and discomfort to the
right.

uncomfortable.

In order to test the Willingness to Self-Censor Scale, it was important to
determine how school librarians perceived their principals’ level of comfort with
controversial topics. Then, I paired the scale score and the perception of principals’
comfort to determine their impact on the school librarians’ own comfort levels. Table
4.15 on the next page shows the full list of means for all of the variables.

The means of the comfort levels are fairly consistent with the religious viewpoint
averaging the lowest. More interesting are the standard deviations. Standard deviation
tells me the variation in the answers. The higher the standard deviation the wider the
range of responses. If the standard deviation is low for the principal prediction or the
Willingness to Self-Censor, then that would tell me that these two variables would be
unlikely to explain the variation in the school librarians’ comfort level. It is important to
note here that the standard deviations for the principal predictions are all higher than that
of the Willingness to Self-Censor (WTSC) score. This result led me to believe that upon
constructing my models, the principal predictions would have a greater impact on the
variation in the school librarians’ comfort level than the Willingness to Self-Censor

75

score. If the WTSC score’s standard deviation had been even lower, I most likely would
have dropped it as an explanatory variable.
I created a correlation matrix using the six dependent variables (School
Librarians’ Comfort with Controversial Topics) and seven of the demographic variables
that the survey collected: experience, selection policy, reconsideration policy, job
security, setting, grade levels served and budget. The purpose was to determine if any of
these demographic variables would correlate with the dependent variables. Only one of
the demographic variables showed some slight correlation: grade levels. However, review
of the literature shows that two additional demographic variables also correlated in
previous studies so I chose to also include them in the models I tested. Those variables
were experience and budget. Therefore, I chose to use the grade level, experience, and
budget as covariates in my models.
To determine if the explanatory variables, WTSC score and Perceived Principal’s
Comfort (PP) Level, provide an explanation for the variation in the school librarians’
comfort level with controversial topics, I conducted a series of hierarchical linear
regressions with the first block including the covariates of experience, budget, and grade
levels. In the first six models, I included the WTSC score as the second block. In the next
six models, I included the PP level. Finally, I created six models using both the WTSC
score and the PP level. Each model represented one of the different topics representing
school librarians’ comfort level (SL) with controversial materials. Here is an example of
a model from the third round of models:
Model 13 <- SL(religion) ~ experience + level+budget+WTSC+PP

76

When running the models I was looking for p values of less than <0.05 for the
explanatory variables. This tells me that the explanatory variable is stable and a predictor
for the response variable (the school librarians’ comfort levels). If the p value was less
than 0.05, I was then looking at the Coefficient of Determination (adjusted r-squared).
The Coefficient of Determination tells me how well the model explains the variation in
the response variable.

In the first six models, I used the WTSC score only. The p value of the WTSC
score was below 0.05 in all six models; however, as seen in Table 4.16 the coefficients of
determination were very low, particularly for religion. I then ran six additional model
with the PP score only. Again, the p value for the PP score was below 0.05. In these
models, the coefficients of determination increased significantly telling me that the
addition of the PP score explained more of the variation in the school librarians’ comfort
level than the WTSC score alone. At this point, I decided to build six additional models
using both the WTSC score and the PP score to see if by using both explanatory
variables, the coefficients of determination would increase significantly. This was not the
case. The coefficients of determination changed only slightly. This tells me that while the
77

WTSC score did have some impact on the school librarians’ comfort level, the PP score
was more important.
I tested six additional models using the covariates only. The coefficient of
determination for that model was 0.046. The difference between these models and the PP
only models was about 0.3. This difference shows how much more of the variation in the
response variable is being explained by the PP score above and beyond the covariates.
Finally, examination of the models shows that for every 1 point increase in the PP score,
the school librarians’ comfort level will increase on average by 0.7 after controlling for
the covariates. This is true for all of the different topics, except religion. In the case of
religious topics, the PP score had less effect. The impact of the PP score in the models
tells me that external forces are having an impact on school librarians’ comfort levels
with controversial material.
4.4 JOB SECURITY
The final section of the survey asked school librarians to provide information on
their perception of the support that they receive from their school level and district level
administrations. The school librarians were also asked to state whether they felt their job
might be on the line if they were to choose to add controversial materials to their school
library collections. Interestingly, over ninety-four percent of the school librarians felt
supported by their school level administrations when making decisions about their
collection. That number was only slightly lower at eight-five percent feeling supported by
district level administrations. Table 4.17 on page 79 provides the data. Figure 4.18 on the
following page illustrates this information.

78

Figure 4.18 Job Security
I also examined this data by taking into account other factors such as experience and
geographic setting and found that the other factors had no impact on the school librarians’
feeling about job security. I expected that those with less experience might feel less
secure in their positions. However, the data did not show this. Figure 4.19 on page 82
illustrates the responses to the statement, “I feel my position could be in jeopardy when I
choose material that has a potential for challenges.” While the pie charts show that the
level of job security the school librarians felt increased the longer they held their
positions, even the most inexperienced school librarians still felt relatively safe in their
positions when they chose controversial materials. However, even the small chance of
losing a position based on the decision to add controversial content to the collection
might make a school librarian think twice about adding it.

4.5 CONCLUSION
Quantitative analysis of the survey data shows that school librarians largely have
access to district-level selection policies to guide their addition of materials to the
collection. However, even more school librarians have district level reconsideration
policies to guide the process when material is called into question. Funding of school
libraries is an important part in the decision-making process for school librarians. The
data collected by the survey showed a wide discrepancy between funding levels in school
libraries, often with the most poverty-stricken schools receiving the least amount of
funding. Additionally, the budgets did not always reflect the increased needs of larger
student populations. After examining the impact of the WTSC score and the perception of
principals’ comfort score on school librarians’ comfort levels, the perception of the
principals’ comfort was a better predictor of the school librarians’ comfort. The analyses
of the school librarians’ comfort with the controversial topics and their perception of their
principals’ comfort showed some differences. Most importantly, school librarians
believed they were more comfortable than their principals for all six of the controversial
topics.

CHAPTER 5
QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS
Interviews with thirty-nine school librarians were conducted from May 9 to June
11, 2016. Of the group, I was acquainted with nine of the school librarians prior to this
study. The first section of this chapter explains the methodology used for analysis.
Subsequent sections include the analysis of the interviews ordered by the interview
question asked. After discussion of the interview responses, I outline the themes that
emerged from the interviews and several interesting topics that emerged from the
conversations.
5.1 INTERVIEW METHODOLOGY
Of the 471 survey respondents, one hundred thirty school librarians in North and
South Carolina agreed to participate in a follow-up interview. Purposeful sampling was
used to ensure collection or rich and meaningful data. There are several types of
purposeful sampling types. I chose to use maximum variation sampling which Glesne
describes as selection of “cases that cut across some range of variation” (2016, p. 51).

In the table above, a single asterisk represents that the number includes an interview with
a non-Caucasian and a double asterisk represents the inclusion of an interview with a
male librarian.
The interviews were conducted using a variety of virtual methods including
Google Hangout, Skype, FaceTime, and phone conversations. All interviews were
recorded with the permission of the participants. To preserve the anonymity of the
interview participants, each participant was assigned a pseudonym: School Librarian (SL)
followed by the number of their interview. For example, the fifth interview participant is
denoted as SL5. To further ensure anonymity and confidentiality, no specific descriptions
of schools or school locations or names will be used in the discussion of their responses.
Once the interviews were completed, verbatim transcripts of the interviews were
created. These transcripts were shared with the participants who then had the opportunity
to make corrections or additions to the content. The transcriptions were then analyzed
using two rounds of coding including in the following types of codes: vivo, emotion,
structural, attribute, and versus (Saldana, 2016). The coding rounds resulted in 162
unique codes.

5.2 INTERVIEW QUESTION RESPONSES
The first six questions were asked of all participants. The final three questions
were only asked of the thirteen librarians who indicated they had experienced a formal
challenge.
Question 1 Responses: Tell me how you go about the process of choosing what
materials you add to your collection.
Several of the librarians interviewed indicated that they used a formal, planned
process when choosing materials to add to their collection. Eight explained that they had
a written long range plan for collection development for their individual school.
Additionally, eight school librarians mentioned that they consulted their district’s
selection policy for guidelines in making decisions. Only one participant discussed tying
her selections to the library’s stated mission; however, two others tied their selection
decisions to the school-wide plan for improvement.
Library management software was also part of the selection process for some of
those interviewed. Thirteen of those interviewed conducted a routine, yearly collection
analysis using their library management software, in order to decide areas of weakness in
their collections. Five school librarians discussed the role that circulation statistics played
in determining what interested their students, so they could determine future purchases.
A large number of those interviewed indicated that their selection process
included providing materials based on either student requests (35) or teacher requests
(25). Some of those interviewed had a formal process for taking requests, including
surveys or suggestions boxes, while others, simply wrote down requests as they were
presented.

85

Other school librarians explained their process as a more informal one where they
used multiple methods to determine what to add to the collection. One participant stated:
In my head I know what I'm doing. I don't sit down with paper and pencil and
work this all out. I'm just constantly evaluating my collection and how it meets
the needs of my kids. It's really more of an internal thing than a systematic forum
or anything like that. (SL22)
Additionally, almost all (thirty-nine) of the school librarians discussed the
importance of using reviews from professional sources such as the following as part of
their selection process:


School Library Journal;



Kirkus;



Booklist; or



Library Media Connection.

Similarly, twenty-one of those interviewed indicated that they also used specific sources
for purchasing materials for their collections and heavily used those sources for seeking
reviews. Eleven school librarians specifically mentioned using Junior Library Guild’s
subscription services to assist in making selections for their collection.
Some of the participants used additional sources to discover and select new
materials for their collections. Two school librarians cited specific blogs, such as Mr.
Schu Reads (http://mrschureads.blogspot.com/) and Debbie Reese
(https://americanindiansinchildrensliterature.blogspot.com/), as sources of reviews for
new materials. Five school librarians visited bookstores in order to examine titles in
person. Fourteen used published recommendation lists from either state or national

86

organizations to help in selection. Eight discussed using social media sources for reviews
from non-professionals. Only two mentioned actually looking at catalogs from
publishers.
Question 2 Responses: What are some of the factors that determine if you will add
certain materials or not?
One of the first factors mentioned by many of the participants was that materials
with positive reviews would more likely be added to the collection. Some participants
mentioned that their selection policies required that an item have either two or three
positive reviews before they could consider an item. After the use of reviews, many
school librarians (21) indicated that if a book was a nominee for or winner of an award at
either the state or national level, then it would be seriously considered for addition.
The findings revealed that the participants valued student interest when it came to
selecting materials for their collection. In fact, student interest was the most influential
factor in determining what materials were added to the librarians’ collections. Two
interviewees discussed the importance of student interest when deciding what was to be
added to the collection. When discussing choosing materials based on student interest,
one school librarian had this to say:
I'm not one to really limit what they read. I want the kids reading, and so I'm not
going to tell them, "Oh, you can't read that. That's not appropriate for you,"
whatever. If a kid wants to read it and I've got it, great. If they want to read it and
I don't have it, then I'll find a way to get it. When I'm trying to acquire materials, I
don't look at appropriateness for a school library and all that. I'll deal with
challenges to materials as they come up. That's not something that I'm too

87

concerned about. As far as acquiring things, if it's something that I think would
meet our collection needs and that would appeal to the students, then I'm going to
get it. (SL24)
Several mentioned that they did not wish to waste funds on materials that would not be of
interest, and therefore would not be used. Often the discussion of student interest was tied
to the decision to continue purchasing series of books. Sixteen school librarians indicated
that continuation of a series was a major factor in deciding to purchase some titles.
Age appropriateness was discussed by thirty-one of those interviewed. The
discussion was not limited to any school level, but was discussed by elementary, middle,
and high school librarians. Many indicated that it was a factor in their decision-making;
however, that was not every participant. One high school librarian stated, “I don't really
go for looking at appropriateness, because I think everything's appropriate.” (SL24)
Almost exclusively mentioned by elementary school librarians was the need for
books to have visual appeal for young students. Eight of the nine participants who
mentioned visual appeal were serving in elementary schools. The ninth served in a
middle school. No high school librarians discussed the need for visual appeal in their
selections. Another area that was discussed almost exclusively by elementary school
librarians was the physical sturdiness of the books being a factor in their decision to add
an item to their collections.
Seven of those interviewed explained that they wished to meet the needs of
special populations within their schools. One participant discussed the need to provide
materials for students with various cognitive and physical disabilities. Four school
librarians searched for high interest, low reading level books to help students who

88

struggled with reading on grade level. Additionally, ten school librarians mentioned the
need to increase the diversity of their collections, either to better reflect the diversity of
their school’s student population or to bring awareness to their largely homogeneous
school community.
Question 3 Responses: Describe a time when you chose not to add something. What
influenced that decision?
School librarians also discussed factors that might lead to the decision to exclude
items from their collections. The following controversial topics were most likely to lead
to exclusion or serious consideration for exclusion:


profanity (17);



mature, sexual content (18);



drugs and alcohol usage (6);



violence (10);



lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) content (17);



religion (1).
While some school librarians indicated that they would avoid controversial

content, others discussed how they would examine materials with controversial content
more closely. For example:
I never want to censor in any way, but I do look for, what's the language? What's
... any sort of maturity, sexual content, anything like that. That's the kind of stuff
that's red flags that I want to look more into and maybe look for additional
reviews before I pull the trigger and purchase that. (SL25)

89

Additionally, several school librarians discussed their concern about titles that
might upset members of their communities. One school librarian said, “I've been known
to not select books that might challenge community standards” (SL33). LGBTQ content
seemed to be an area that quite a few of the school librarians (17) had difficulty with,
particularly those serving in elementary and middle schools. One school librarian
discussed her difficulty in considering LGBTQ materials:
What I'm really struggling with is like sexual orientation, those kind of books. I
don't know what to do. I have not gone there. I think there are a few in my library,
but I haven't sought that out. I can see some of my kids who are obviously gay
looking for things that reflect them, so I know I've got to think about it. (SL28)
Additionally, several participants (4) discussed the need to maintain a balanced collection
where multiple perspectives on topics were provided. Religion was one area where
balance was discussed.
I have to be really sensitive about what Muslim topics I choose, make sure that
they're books that are very positive about Islam, more about working together
than promoting Islam because we are a military community as well, so I guess it's
kind of a sensitivity choosing the books that are going to be a positive addition on
the topic instead of just slapping you in the face, here's a controversial issue.
(SL21)
Several librarians mentioned the conservative nature of their communities when
explaining the decision to exclude an item from their collection, one saying,

90

It's rural, very Baptist, very country and so I don't purchase books that I know will
spark ... That will cause people to object to what's in here. I look for books that
are going to be accepted. (SL42)
Often the discussion of community standards was used to explain the decision to not
acquire materials that dealt with LGBTQ topics, believing that “that is just like asking for
a challenge” (SL22).
When faced with controversial topics, school librarians rely heavily on reviews.
One of those interviewed said, “Typically I will err on the side of caution and not
purchase it unless it is so strongly, so well recommended, that I would feel like I would
be doing more of disservice by not getting it” (SL36).
Several school librarians explained that their decision to not add material to the
collection was largely based on the reaction that their principal or other school
administrators might have. One school librarian, not speaking of herself but of others
within her district, stated that “Some people just don't want to cause their principal any
heartburn, so they preempt it by not ordering it.” (SL33).
Question 4 Responses: If you had an unlimited budget, what types of materials
would you choose to add to your collection that you are not adding now?
When asked what they would add to their collections, if given an unlimited
budget, the largest number of participants indicated they would add graphic novels or
manga to their collections. Seventeen school librarians discussed the impact that graphic
novels were having on students and on their circulation statistics. One librarian explained,

91

I would also expand my graphic novels greatly! We have a lot. We ended up with,
this year especially, I ordered in some sets and said, "Just let me see what
happens." They were heavily circulated. (SL30)
An additional type of material that those interviewed mentioned is formats other than
print books. Three school librarians discussed adding audiobooks to their collections.
Sixteen school librarians discussed including more eBooks in their collection; however,
only two mentioned a possible issue with technology or wireless access for their students.
One interesting topic that sixteen librarians mentioned is that with additional
funds they would engage in heavier weeding of their collections. Sixteen librarians
discussed weeding either to improve the copyright age of their collection or to discard
and replace items that were worn or in poor condition. One librarian explained what she
would do with an unlimited budget:
Well, one of things I would like to do is I would love to be able to weed more so
that I can add more recent materials. My science section is horrible as far as their
age. The average age of my collection is 1997. I need to replace things, a lot of
outdated materials. I don't really think I have anything specific and special that I
would do, but I would just like to get rid of some of the old stuff and get some
newer things in there. (SL13)
Several librarians indicated that if they weeded everything that really needed to be
weeded they would have empty shelves.
Six school librarians discussed their desire to add multiple copies of individual
titles to their collections indicating that they wished to meet student interests when books
were very popular. Citing the cost of the titles, one librarian said, “I would buy more

92

multiple copies, to be honest, because what's popular with our kids is really popular”
(SL2).
Question 5 Responses: Tell me about a time when someone questioned items in your
collection.
When discussing instances when a person questioned items into their collections,
the participants identified three sources of concern: students, teachers, and parents. Eight
school librarians mentioned a time when a student brought a book to them and asked
about its inclusion, often pointing out content they thought might be questionable.
Depending on the age of the students that they serve, school librarians find different types
of material questionable. For example, an elementary librarian described a time a student
pointed out a book she might like to remove, “I do have children come up sometimes
like, ‘Ms. [SL7], this is inappropriate. It's got the D word in it or the S word.’ That's my
favorite. It's the S word. I don't know what the S word is because usually for them it's
shut-up” (SL7). At a high school, a student approached another school librarian saying
“This is a great book. But I got to show you some stuff in here. It was like f this, and f
that” (SL27). What might be controversial content for an elementary school librarian was
not controversial at all for a high school librarian.
Many of those who were interviewed took this as an opportunity to have a
conversation about student choice and censorship. A high school librarian explained how
she handled this discussion:
A student actually questioned me about a book called Living Dead Girl, which I
love that book, and we had a conversation about it and decided that she felt
uncomfortable with it, she just shouldn't check it out. But I do now, when the kids

93

check that book out, I will talk to them and make sure that they can handle the
content of that particular book. (SL39)
The ability to discuss questionable materials was also important when school librarians
had items questioned by members of their own faculty. Eight participants indicated they
had experienced a teacher raising concerns about an item in their collection. Objections
raised might be based on the teacher’s own beliefs, rather than based on curriculum. One
librarian discussed a time when a teacher’s beliefs contradicted collection content, “(a)
math teacher who was like super fundamentalist Christian who was just horrified and
appalled that I had gotten a copy of An Inconvenient Truth and she sent me this real
passionate email” (SL12)
Other objections from teachers occurred because they did not see the academic
merit of some materials, particularly graphic novels. One librarian explained her
objections by saying, “Mostly I think that the teachers just think that they're not worthy to
be read, that they're not the equal of the written word. They don't see the value in it”
(SL22). Other teachers raised concerns about content being inappropriate. In discussing
books classified as urban literature (meaning about inner-city teens of color), a school
librarian said:
I've had some of the sixth and seventh grade teachers return those books for their
students with concerns about content. It has always been a non-issue. I just sort
of, "Yeah, thank you very much. Remember, we serve lots of students." I knock
on wood have not had anything ever escalate beyond that (SL15).

94

As indicated in the quote above, the teacher concerns that were discussed by the school
librarians did not result in full challenges to items. Again, the power of conversation was
able to resolve the issue.
Using a conversation to diffuse parent concerns was sometimes successful.
Twenty-two school librarians indicated they had experienced instances when parents
questioned items in their collections. One librarian explained how she handled a parent
concern:
We tried to use those selection and censorship words. We really targeted those.
When you say to a parent, "That's censorship," or, "You're a censor," that often
shuts down a lot of what ... Not name calling, but just saying, "This is what you
want for your child. We'll be glad to provide an assignment, but now you're
talking about ... I mean I have children at this school. I'm talking about my child's
inability to access that. You're talking about making those decisions for me as a
parent," and most of them, that cuts it right off. (SL16)
Those interviewed also indicated their surprise when an objection was raised that was not
really what they expected. One librarian told about such a time, “They didn't object to the
dead man in the creek. They objected to the fact that there were teenagers drinking in the
woods” (SL26).
Conversation was not always the solution to objections. In fifteen instances,
school librarians chose to remove a book from the collection when faced with the
possibility of future objections to the material or the possibility of a full, formal challenge
to an item in their collection. One librarian explained, “I just pulled it off because that
one probably could have made it into the papers with the parent that was complaining”

95

(SL42). In six other instances, school librarians chose to send the book to another school
that had older students. One elementary librarian sent The Graveyard Book (Gaiman,
2008) to a middle school saying, “I actually sent that to the middle school because it was
too graphic for elementary, and I had a parent who wasn't happy, and my principal
couldn't back me up on it” (SL22).
Question 6 Responses: How would you describe your administration’s involvement
or support of your library program?
Responses to this question fell into four categories:


administrations that were supportive of the library program but either could not or
did not support it financially;



administrations that were supportive and provided adequate funding;



administrations who seemed to be supportive but were largely unaware of the
library program; or



administrations who did not support the library program.
Some librarians indicated that while they felt supported by their administrations in

the programs or services they provided, that support did not always extend to financing
their programs at an adequate level. One librarian stated:
I'm really, really blessed with a great principal and two fantastic vice-principals,
assistant principals. I feel like they're very, very supportive. They've really
embraced a culture of reading in the school, and we've done a lot of really, really
cool things since I've been there, with them. They're great in supporting the
program itself. Budget-wise, I don't know if it's me still being kind of new and not
realizing that they can do more than they're able to do or if they really can't do a

96

whole lot more than they're able to do. I don't know. I feel like the budget is a
little restrictive for what I'd like to be able to provide to our students and our staff.
But as far as what I want to do, I've never had anything, and I've come up with
some wacky ideas, I never had them say no to anything. So they're very
supportive unless it's money. (SL25)
Several librarians indicated that without the support of their administration, they would
make different purchasing decisions. One librarian said, “If I did NOT have a supportive
administration, I might think twice about what my purchases were going to be” (SL26).
Another librarian also explained that her purchasing decisions were based on funding,
and not necessarily on what she really felt was needed for the collection: “You're
prioritizing what you purchase, based on how much money you have” (SL38).
Ten of the school librarians indicated that they did receive adequate funding either
through district budgets, school-based decisions, book fairs, or Parent Teacher
Organization support. One participant described the on-going support she received from
her school administration:
My principal is also very supportive and pretty much gives me free range, to be
honest with you. I had $300,000.00 to spend when we opened up the new school
in August of 20XX. He gives me an additional $5,000.00 a year to buy what I
need. (SL27)
Twenty-seven school librarians indicated they received little or no budget allocation from
either their school or district. Some rely almost entirely on funds from book fairs.
Some librarians indicated that their administrations seemed either uninterested or
indifferent in what occurred in the library.

97

I think he would support anything I did, but he's not involved. Does that make
sense? The only thing he's told me before is that he hates empty shelves and he
wants it to be full of books because our kids struggle with reading and that kind of
thing, but he's not involved in the sense of managing the library. He just kind of
leaves it up to me, which is fine, but sometimes I wish he would give me a little
more guidance. (SL6)
Sometimes, the participants described the administration as providing token, not real,
support, “They're supportive in name, the library's the heart of the school yada yada yada,
but when it comes down to really pushing the library, it's ... nah”(SL44).
Most disturbing were the statements from librarians who felt they did not receive
support from their administration at all.
They are not supportive of it at all. This year I did not get a budget at all, I
approached my administration about the budget and was deferred and ignored for
the entire school year until it was too late to spend money. Then when I
approached him about that, he was very defensive and got very upset with me and
basically told me that he's not going to ever talk to me about funding, and that
funding the media center is a waste of money. (SL39)
For some of those interviewed, the changes in administration in their schools also meant
changing levels of support from principals. One librarian explained that her previous
principal completely backed her; however, “The administration I have right now would
not back me at all because she is so concerned about how we're viewed in the community
that she doesn't have a clue” (SL7). Another explained that she changed schools and felt a
completely different level of support from her new principal:

98

She did not come in the library one time to see me teaching all year. Not a dropby, not a formal observation, and the school I was coming from, my principal was
in my classroom once a week, if not more. She doesn't really have a clue about
what I'm doing. (SL45)
Question 7 Responses: Describe what it was like going through the process of
reconsidering materials. (If they have experienced this.)
The thirteen librarians who experienced a full, formal challenge explained how
the process occurred in their schools or districts. Most indicated that the process included
a written complaint, review by a school committee and, if the complainant was
unsatisfied with the school-level decision to retain or remove an item, the complaint
would then be reviewed at the district level.
In every case, the school librarian served on the school’s committee often
becoming the book’s advocate:
Unfortunately the school committee made the decision to remove the book from
the shelves. Following our district procedure, I decided I was going to serve as the
book's advocate. I appealed the decision to the district level. They convened the
district committee. They put that process into motion. It was reviewed by the
committee. They recommended to the school board that the book be retained with
no restrictions and the board approved that. (SL18)
Even when the item in question was not be challenged for retention in the school library
but as inclusion in a classroom’s curriculum, school librarians served on the review
committees and advocated for a book’s retention, explaining “As a librarian, we take up

99

that mantle and we know that going into our profession” (SL16). Six participants were
involved with challenges about classroom materials.
Going through the reconsideration process did not always result in retention of the
material, and sometimes the process itself was subverted either by administrators, or by
school librarians themselves. One librarian explained, “I had a parent write a complaint.
They wrote up the form and submitted it. So that I wouldn't have to ... I took it off the
shelf” (SL42). Several years later, the same librarian explained that when another
challenge occurred several years later, “I had the support from my principal and the
county and it stayed on the shelf” (SL42). One librarian explained that despite the
decision by her school’s Media and Technology Advisory Committee (MTAC), “One of
the books that was challenged was a non-fiction book and my MTAC chose to leave it on
the shelf and my principal chose to override us” (SL1).
Another participant discussed the difficulty of the process when different levels of
administration within her district could not agree on how the policy would work.
I think that our county is trying to go a little more for a county advisory
committee with that instead of just flat out school. We discussed it because
looking ... like our school board policy really didn't say much of anything about it.
There was the form to fill out, but really nothing else. We were switching to kind
of a state school board policy and if you read the state school board policy, it
refers everything to the principal. The principal has the power to do anything first.
We had a media meeting about it and we were like, no, that's not how it works,
the principal does not have the power to pull the book off the shelf. (SL29)

100

After that experience, the district’s school librarians worked to review the district’s
reconsideration policy to provide more guidance.
School librarians described a variety of emotions about going through a challenge.
Some experienced frustration with the process or the subversion of the process. Others
simply felt upset with the outcome. When asked to describe the reconsideration process at
her school, one of those interviewed began her description with a simple sentence, “I
hated it” (SL13). Another explained that “I was unhappy about the decision. Unhappy is
not the word” (SL18).
Question 8: Describe any support you received during the reconsideration process.
If you did have support, where did it come from? If not, how did it make you feel?
The school librarians who experienced a challenge talked primarily about the
support they received from fellow teachers, school or district administrators, or other
school librarians in their districts. Only three mentioned that they had asked for or
received support from the American Library Association’s Office for Intellectual
Freedom. None indicated that they had contacted their state-level school library
associations for support or information.
Some participants did receive support from their districts. One school librarian
described her support as:
The superintendent was wonderful. He thought it was all ridiculous. I remember
sitting in my principal's office with him. It was my principal, my superintendent, our
public relations person, and my supervisor. We were just being very frank and honest
and he said "These people are crazy. They're just crazy." They just are so closed
minded. I had a lot of support from higher ups. (SL13)

101

However, the process itself was not always supported by administrators. One school
librarian explained that despite the decision to retain an item by both school-level and
district-level review committees, a parent chose to then confront a meeting of district
principals who then gave in to her demands to restrict the item so that students could only
check the item out with written permission. She described her feelings, “(I) was very,
very angry about that decision. I didn't feel at the time I really had a whole lot of other
choice but to do that” (SL18). Without outside support, she did not know what to do at
this point.
Question 9 Responses: How do you think facing a challenge has impacted your
decision-making when choosing what to add to your collection?
Of the thirteen who experienced a challenge, seven school librarians do not think
the experience has impacted their process in a negative way. The other six believe they
have become much more cautious and are always thinking about the possibility of a
challenge. The thought of another challenge made one librarian say, “It makes me be very
sensitive to what parents think” (SL10).
Several participants indicated that they felt empowered by going through a
challenge, one saying:
It came to the point where I had to draw a line. Am I going to support what I
believe as the librarian or am I going to cower to this jerk who's a school board
member? I stood my ground and I felt good about it. I can do it again if I need to.
(SL44)
Another explained that he felt a greater responsibility as a school librarian as a result of
experiencing a challenge:

102

It makes me feel a greater responsibility to be fair, to do my best. I think it is
absolutely imperative that we have these policies. I was very grateful that [my
school system] had a written policy in hand. At the same time, I began to really
focus on, because I knew I was going to have money from the book fair and
everything, on presenting a more complete diversity. We have Latino students, we
have a few Asian students, and then, when you look at our collection, and we
didn't have very many African American written, or ... It was weak. I know that
influenced me, in fact, I eyeballed several new wonderful things about African
American culture. I felt like it helped me to be a more responsible media
specialist. (SL49)
Another of those interviewed indicated that her willingness to undertake a challenge was
predicated on the quality of the book:
I think that that's where that phrase that I said, where if it's a book that's worth
fighting for, I'll put it on the shelf. I think that's where that came from when ... It
made me aware that if I put the book on the shelf that might be questionable, it
had to be something I'm willing to fight for. If it is one that I'm willing to fight
for. (SL1)
So, experiencing a challenge impacted how she made selection decisions.
5.3 THEMES FROM THE INTERVIEW DATA
In order to reach a saturation point in the analysis, I reread the interviews a
number of times and conducted several rounds of coding. Based on this careful study, a
number of themes emerged:
1) Communication with those who presented concerns to materials in collections

103

was key in allaying concerns and avoiding a full, written challenge;
2) Support of administration for school libraries and during the challenge process
varied widely and influenced the decisions school librarians made when choosing
materials and when choosing whether or not to defend them;
3) The funding of school libraries varies widely both within districts and across
states;
4) The grade levels of a school greatly impacted the decision making of school
librarians when choosing to add materials, with middle school librarians finding
the issue of age appropriateness especially difficult;
5) The awareness of and implementation of both materials selection policies and
reconsideration policies influenced both the selection of materials and the
successful defense of challenged materials;
6) School librarians sometimes chose to voluntarily remove or restrict access to
materials when they thought they might face a full, formal challenge;
7) LGBTQ content was particularly troubling for school librarians when undergoing
the selection process;
8) Librarians at combination schools (elementary/middle, middle/high) faced unique
challenges when making selections and providing access to materials;
9) School librarians’ perceptions of the community environment, particularly those
located in rural communities, impacted their decision-making process.
The power of communication was discussed by several of those who were
interviewed. School librarians often used conversations within their school communities
about the school library program, the selection process, and the importance of including

104

diverse content as a means of both informing their school communities and as a tactic to
avert challenges.
Communication also played a role in the level of support that school librarians felt
that they had from their administrations. While some felt that their administrators lacked
either interest or awareness in their school library programs, others indicated that their
school-level administrators were involved in on-going conversations about their
programs as well as their selection decisions. This involvement sometimes translated into
increased funding for their selections.
Budgets for school library materials varied widely. Those interviewed also
received funds from a variety of sources with official funding coming sometimes from
school-level decision-making and sometimes directly from decisions made at the district
level. When not adequately funded, school librarians often relied on donations, book
fairs, or fund raisers by Parent Teacher Organizations to either supplement their meager
funds or to provide the only funds they might receive in a school year.
The grade levels served by the school librarians had an impact on their selection
process. Middle school librarians, in particular, often felt that they struggled with the age
appropriateness of materials because they served a transitional age from tween to teen.
Many of their students wanted to have access to young adult materials, but as sixth
graders were perhaps not socially or emotionally ready for them. At the same time, these
school librarians were trying to meet the needs of eighth grade students who were
certainly capable of handling young adult themes and topics.
While only eight participants mentioned selection policies, thirty-one of those
interviewed mentioned the use of reconsideration policies or procedures. The presence of

105

those policies and procedures were used by participants to either justify the inclusion of
material or support them when the inclusion of material was called into question.
When faced with a question about inclusion of controversial content, some
librarians voluntarily chose to remove the content in question by weeding the item from
the collection, sending the item to a school with older students, or by restricting access to
the item. Often, they justified these actions as a way to avoid the hassle of going through
a formal reconsideration process despite their awareness of policy that required that a
process be followed.
Content that included LGBTQ sexuality or characters was often mentioned by
school librarians when discuss content that they chose not to add to their collections.
They discussed spending additional time examining the quality of LGBTQ materials
especially if they felt they would need to justify its inclusion in their collections.
School librarians with larger grade combinations (elementary/middle,
middle/high, or K12) discussed the difficulty of meeting the reading and information
needs of such broad ranges of ages in their schools. Some of those interviewed met this
challenge by having separate physical sections of their libraries for differing age groups.
Others mentioned labelling books as YA (Young Adult) or E (Easy).
When discussing their decision to not include an item in question, several school
librarians mentioned the needs of their school community; however, if they mentioned
their community was rural, the statement was always accompanied by a mention of the
conservative nature of that community. Conservatism was never mentioned in
conjunction with a suburban or urban setting.

106

5.4 UNEXPECTED FINDINGS
Several topics arose during the interviews that merit a mention although they were
isolated conversations. One school librarian mentioned the Accelerated Reader program
as a tool for collection development citing its use to match students to age appropriate
materials and serve as a reading incentive to drive up circulation numbers. Only one
school librarian specifically mentioned her school library preparation program when
discussing being prepared to face potential challenges. Five school librarians mentioned
labelling materials as YA (Young Adult) as a tool for avoiding questions about
controversial content.
When asked what content they would add to their collection if they had an
unlimited budget, I expected some mention of adding content that might be considered
controversial. Not a single librarian discussed controversial content when discussing what
they would add in that situation.
5.5 CONCLUSION
This chapter presented the results from the forty-nine interviews conducted as part
of the study organized by interview question. The next chapter will present a summary of
the study as well as an integration of quantitative and qualitative results. Finally, I will
discuss the implications of this study for theory, practice, policy, and future research.

107

CHAPTER 6
CONCLUSION
How school librarians make decisions about what and what not to add to their
collections has a direct impact on the access that their students have to materials.
Previous research on selection and self-censorship have used a single methodology. Some
have examined self-censoring behaviors by having school librarians respond to surveys.
Some studies attempted to determine if school librarians engaged in self-censorship by
creating checklists of controversial materials and then examining school library
collections. Other studies have used interviews with small groups of school librarians. All
of these studies have their limitations. Additionally, very few studies of self-censorship
attempt to employ theory as a way to explain censoring behaviors. This study is grounded
in the Spiral of Silence Theory which posits that individuals may choose either
consciously or subconsciously to self-censor because they believe their opinion might
contradict the dominant public opinion. This dominant public opinion does not have to be
rooted in fact, but is based on the individual’s perception of opinion. In this study,
dominant public opinion is measured through examination of the school librarians’
perceptions of their principals’ level of comfort with controversial content.
In order to gain a clearer understanding of the selection decisions of school
librarians and their self-censoring behaviors, I chose to employ a mixed design for this
study. This mixed methods study provides insight into the selection process through the
use of two phases. An initial survey gathered data about the school librarians themselves,

108

their policies and procedures, funding, and their comfort with controversial topics. After
the survey data was collected, forty-nine school librarians were interviewed to provide
additional insights into their selection processes and their decisions when controversial
content was being considered. This chapter begins by examining the findings from both
phases of the study and discussing how the data answers the research questions. The final
section discusses implications of the study and recommendations for future research.
6.1 DISCUSSION
Research Question 1: How do school librarians describe their own selection
process?
Some school librarians described their process as a very systematic one, while
others explained that they largely based their purchasing decisions on student interest and
maximum usage of the limited funds for purchasing. Those with a more systematic
process discussed the implementation of a collection development plan which guided
purchasing decisions over a period of years. Additionally, they used formal and informal
methods of gauging student and faculty interest in materials through the use of surveys
and suggestion boxes. Those interviewed also explained that they chose materials based
on curriculum needs or changes based on curriculum mapping of their collections. In
particular, teacher requests for materials were weighed against curriculum needs. Data
from the survey revealed that 63% of school librarians have access to district-level
selection policies to guide their addition of materials to the collection. However, only
nine of the forty-nine school librarians discussed actually using those policies as a
component of their selection process. This suggests that an awareness of a district policy
did not necessarily result in its use. In the interviews, the discussion of the selection

109

policy was centered on its use as a tool when faced with questions about their collections,
and not necessarily as a tool for the actual selection of materials. Data from the survey
shows that almost 86% of school librarians are aware of a district-level reconsideration
policy or process. This higher percentage was also reflected during the interview portion
of this research with thirty-one school librarians mentioning a reconsideration policy or
process when discussing possible challenges to material.
When learning about items to consider for their collections, school librarians
relied heavily on reviews of materials from professional sources or lists of
recommendations or award winners. Thirty-nine of those interviewed discussed the
importance of reading reviews of materials that they are considering for purchase. During
the interviews, some explained that they needed two or three positive reviews for an item
in order to consider it for inclusion in their collections. Others used reviews as a method
to justify adding controversial material. Several mentioned that they had mistakenly
purchased materials because the reviews did not contain warnings about either profanity
or mature content. Despite this heavy reliance on reviews from professional sources, a
number of school librarians indicated that they were beginning to use social media
sources for reviews and recommendations citing the use of Pinterest, blogs, Goodreads,
and reviews on Amazon.com.
The issue of funding was of major concern to school librarians when discussing
their selection process. Data from the survey shows a wide range of funding levels for
school libraries with some receiving less than $1,000 in the 2015-2016 school year for
library materials and a very few receiving over $15,000. Examination of this data by
comparing funding to student populations shows even schools serving more than 2000

110

students sometimes were allocated less than $1,000 to purchase new library materials.
Over half of the school librarians surveyed (236) served in schools with a population of
500 – 999. Examination of the range of budgets they received is indicative of the larger
issue – disparity in funding. Using data from SLJ’s Average Book Prices, to purchase one
new book for student based on a population of 750, school librarians would need
approximately $15,000. Forty-five percent of the schools in the 500-999 population range
indicated they received between $1,001 and $4,999 for the 2015-1016 school year.
The concern about budgets is reflected in the interview comments about funding
selections. Often, school librarians explained that they had very limited funding to the
extent that they resorted to only replacing worn out materials and purchasing award list
titles. Some school librarians indicated they received no funding and in order to have any
money for purchases, they conducted book fairs, collected donations, or applied for
grants. The discussion of budgets surprisingly led to a discussion of weeding practices as
part of the selection process. When discussing a scenario where they had unlimited funds,
school librarians explained that they would engage in more heavy weeding of their
collections, particularly focusing on replacement of damaged or dated materials and
removal of non-circulating items.
A few school librarians also discussed the role of advisory committees in
selecting materials. Some committees took an active role in discussing and suggesting
purchases; however, most of the school librarians who discussed committees explained
that their role was limited to serving more as a way to defend against challenges. In this
way, the material was “approved” by a group instead of by a single person.

111

Research Question 2: To what extent do school librarians engage in self-censorship
as part of the collection development process?
School librarians do engage in self-censorship, often justifying the decision to
exclude material based on age-appropriateness, concern about community reactions to
content, and their own discomfort with controversial content. Community standards was
used to explain the decision to include LGBTQ materials in particular. Often when
discussing excluding materials from the collection, school librarians specifically
mentioned their decision was based on the concern that the inclusion of the material
would result in a challenge.
For those school librarians who had experienced a formal, written challenge that
resulted in a review of the questioned materials, experiencing that challenge led to a more
cautious approach to choosing materials for their collections. However, this is not the
case for all of those interviewed. Several felt that having experienced a challenge, they
were better prepared to defend their selection decisions in the future.
One of the issues when discussing self-censorship is the narrow definition of the
terms, censorship and self-censorship in the research literature. Self-censorship is defined
as the decision to not include material in a collection prior to purchase due to either
external or internal factors. Censorship occurs when material is removed from a
collection after purchase and usually refers to attempts by external forces. The problem is
that there is little discussion of the censoring behaviors that school librarians use after an
item is purchased for a collection. The interviews revealed that many school librarians
were engaging in ex post facto self-censorship: choosing to remove materials from their

112

own school library collections which they themselves had purchased without going
through a reconsideration process.
Research Question 3: When school librarians engage in self-censorship, what are the
ways they do it and the factors that influence their decision making?
Engaging in self-censorship prior to purchase is described by school librarians
primarily as a selection decision. They rarely refer to the decision to exclude material
based on its content as self-censorship. However, school librarians did chose to selfcensor by choosing to exclude materials that they were concerned might result in a
challenge. In particular, they were more likely to exclude LGBTQ content, materials with
profanity, and materials with mature, sexual content. These controversial topics
discussed in interviews were also reflected in the survey responses of the participants.
When examining the data about the comfort levels of school librarians with controversial
topics, the three topics with the highest levels of discomfort were offensive language,
violence, and sexually explicit content. It is interesting that LGBTQ content was not in
the top three in the survey; however, over 45% of those surveyed indicated some level of
discomfort with the topic.
A surprising number of those interviewed indicated they engaged in various forms
of ex post facto self-censorship. Some school librarians chose to mark out objectionable
language or pictures from materials in their collections. Others chose to remove the book
from their collection entirely, referring to this decision as “weeding.” Several school
librarians mentioned transferring the title to a school that served an older population. In
middle schools, young adult materials were often labelled as “YA” or placed on restricted

113

shelving where students needed parental permission prior to access. All of these instances
failed to follow any reconsideration procedure.
Based on discussion in the interviews, two factors that greatly influenced the
decision to self-censor were the concern about community reaction to controversial
content and administrative support of the school library. Both of these are external factors
which suggests that the spiral of silence theory is an explanation for the decision to
exclude content which might be controversial. If school librarians perceived their
community as rural, conservative, or likely to challenge controversial content, they chose
to exclude it from their collections. Similarly, if a principal or school administrator
expressed concern about a topic or if they even thought a principal might be unwilling to
back them in a challenge, those interviewed would choose to exclude material.
Examination of the survey data supports this conclusion as well. When examining
the school librarians’ perception of their principals comfort level with the addition of
controversial content to the collection, they indicated that the principals would be most
uncomfortable with LGBTQ content, violence, and sexually explicit content. The survey
reflected that school librarians believed their principals would be more uncomfortable
than themselves with controversial content in every category. Statistical analysis of the
perception of their principals and their Willingness to Self-Censor score, showed the
impact of these two external forces on the school librarians’ comfort levels with
controversial content. While using both scores as explanatory variables for the school
librarians’ comfort level, the perception of their principals provided a greater explanation.

114

6.2 LIMITATIONS
This study is limited in that the research was conducted in two neighboring states
in the south: North Carolina and South Carolina. The study should be replicated in other
geographic areas of the United States to determine if the findings hold true in those
locations as well. Additionally, the respondents to the survey were largely female and
white and worked primarily in public schools. While these demographics are true of
school librarians in general, studies need to be conducted to examine if school librarians
who are male, ethnically and racially diverse, and work in different types of schools have
differences in their selection processes and self-censoring behaviors.
6.3 IMPLICATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
This section contains both implications and recommendations together. This was
a purposeful choice as I wish to make recommendations for future research based on the
implications that this study has for both the theory and practical application in the field of
school librarianship.
The heavy reliance of school librarians on professional reviewing sources is an
area of concern. While these sources are certainly worthy of consideration, recent
discussion about the lack of inclusiveness and coverage of non-mainstream publishers
raises questions about the reliance of school librarians on these sources. This study
showed that some school librarians were beginning to look outside of traditional review
sources and seeking reviews of new content through social media and blogs that examine
additional materials. A study of the impact of social media and blogs on school
librarians’ selection decisions is needed to examine this trend further.

115

When discussing challenges to controversial material, school librarians primarily
discussed young adult literature in middle and high schools, LGBTQ literature in
particular. While there have been studies specifically about LGBTQ literature and its
inclusion in school and public library collections, little research has been done
specifically about how school librarians choose these materials and about whether or not
challenges to LGBTQ content are handled differently than other types of controversial
content.
School librarians often acted in ways contrary to the Library Bill of Rights and
Freedom to Read by choosing to engage in ex post facto self-censorship. This suggests
that further research needs to be conducted in order to understand how and to what extent
school librarians are prepared to handle challenges to controversial content. Are their
school library preparation programs really preparing them to handle challenges in all of
their forms? If their programs are preparing them to handle challenges, why are they
choosing to voluntarily remove or restrict access to materials? Are school librarians
aware of resources that can assist them when they face questions about controversial
content?
Ex post facto self-censorship was often discussed in conjunction with
reconsideration policies and processes. Many of those who engaged in this form of selfcensorship did so while fully aware of the presence of a reconsideration policy. They
chose to self-censor in order to avoid the formal reconsideration process. An examination
of selection and reconsideration policies is needed. But understanding the policies in
place it not enough, the examination should be accompanied by a study of the actual
implementation of the policies themselves. Who within a school or school district is

116

choosing to follow or subvert policy? Does the subversion of policy cause ex post facto
self-censorship?
Additionally, in one interview in this study, a school librarian explained that a
parent chose to challenge her school library policies about access to materials for students
instead of requesting removal of material. This appears to be an emerging trend in
censorship with conservative activists seeking to attack the entire Young Adult label
within children’s literature and ALA positions on access for children (Gaffney, 2017).
Research into emerging trends in censorship is needed to understand how to better
prepare school librarians to face new kinds of challenges.
Finally, the application of the Spiral of Silence theory to self-censorship behaviors
in school libraries has potential to provide a more theoretically based explanation for this
phenomena. Understanding the power of external forces, particularly, perceived public
opinion, can help us to both better prepare school librarians to avoid self-censorship and
to defend against challenges. I believe that awareness of our own biases and tendencies to
self-censor can help us overcome them. In this study, examination of the WTSC scale in
conjunction with the perceived principals’ comfort levels with controversial topics,
showed that they could serve as predictors for school librarians’ own comfort levels with
controversial topics. However, further study of the interaction between these two
variables is needed to determine if their usage as a tool for prediction is feasible.
6.4 CONCLUSION
The importance of selection of materials for inclusion in a school library
collection cannot be understated. For many children, the school library is their one and
only source of information either for completing their school work or simply exploring

117

the world around them. While school librarians profess their support of the Freedom to
Read, unfortunately sometimes their selection decisions are not grounded in the basic
beliefs we share about access for all. Sometimes school librarians choose materials based
less on quality and curriculum needs, but more on which will least likely draw unwanted
attention in the form of questions about their content. It is imperative that school
librarians understand their own selection biases and habits. Without reflecting on how
they make decisions, school librarians leave themselves vulnerable to engaging in the
very behaviors which they condemn when they are initiated by others.

APPENDIX A - SURVEY QUESTIONS
Dear School Librarian,
I am inviting you, as a school librarian in North or South Carolina, to participate in my
dissertation research. The focus of my research is to understand the decisions being made
by school librarians when choosing or not choosing materials for addition to the
collection.
This survey consists of closed ended questions. Demographic data will also be collected
to describe the respondents to this study. Completion of the survey should take
approximately 10-15 minutes. You are free to answer or not answer any particular
question and have no obligation to complete answering the questions once you begin.
Completing the survey connotes your consent to be a participant in this study.
Your participation is confidential. You will not be asked for any identifying information
in the survey questions. All data obtained in this study will be reported as group data. No
individual can be or will be identified. The only person who will have access to the data
is me, as the Principal Investigator, and my mentor, Dr. Karen Gavigan. There are neither
anticipated risks should you participate, nor anticipated personal benefits from being
involved in the study. However, there will be educational or professional benefit from
this study. The information obtained will be communicated through publication in the
literature and presentations at professional meetings. There is no cost to you for your
participation.
Additionally, at the conclusion of the study, you will be asked if you would like to assist
further by participating in an interview. This is completely voluntary. If you wish to
participate, you will be asked to provide your name and email address, so that I may
contact you to make arrangements to conduct the interview virtually. Pseudonyms will
take the place of participants’ names in order to continue to protect the confidentiality of
participants. I will not share your email address or use your email for any reason other
than to contact you if you are selected to participate in an interview. Your e-mail address
will not be kept or stored with any survey information.
Thank you,
April M. Dawkins
Doctoral Candidate
