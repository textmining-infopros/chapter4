CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION
School Libraries for the 21st Century Measurement Benchmarks
The Library of Michigan, an office of the Michigan Department of Education, is
the official library agency for the state of Michigan. Measurement Benchmarks for
Michigan School Libraries for 21st Century Schools (SL21) is an initiative established in
2009 by the Library of Michigan. A working group consisting of Library of Michigan
employees, Michigan Association for Media in Education (MAME) members, and
certified school library media professionals created the initial instrument. The SL21
initiative was developed to measure the quality of Michigan’s school library programs
within individual buildings. During the 2015-2016 school year, there were 4,832 public
school buildings in Michigan, and 644 of these buildings reported having
Librarians/Media Specialists (CEPI, 2016). “Library of Michigan hopes that the SL21
measures will be an effective educational, professional development and advocacy tool
that assists school library programs to provide the highest quality services to students
and the overall school community” (SL21 Background, 2013, p. 2).
Declines in school funding have caused many library programs to be unable to
provide adequate resources and programming to students. Furthermore, to the
detriment of student learning, certified school librarian positions have been eliminated or
reduced due to these decreases in funding. According to Michigan’s State Board of
Education, (Statement on School Libraries, 2014)
Certified library media specialists serve a critical role in increasing student
achievement by supporting, collaborating, and co-teaching with classroom
teachers in reading development, in integrating information and
technology literacy skills into the content curriculum, and in meeting the
expectations for student research set forth in the Common Core State
Standards. (p. 1)

2
The Library of Michigan requires that school libraries be staffed with certified school
librarians and qualified support staff. Programs not meeting the staffing measure are
classified as at risk.
According to Johnson (2001), “The assessment of a building’s school library
program is a vital task that can lead to improvements in the delivery of library and
technology services, and improve the effectiveness of the total school” (p. 14). The
SL21 program brings attention to the importance of K-12 students having accessible onsite school library facilities and the profound effect this has on student achievement.
According to Achterman (2008), “At a time when achievement on standardized tests is
so strongly weighted in assessing the overall success of schools, investment in a robust
school library program should be a primary goal” (p. 194).
Purpose of the Study
According to Matthews (2007), nearly half of public and academic libraries use
informal customer feedback to measure their success instead of using a quantifiable
measure of success. There is not a systematic body of literature on the reliability and
validity of the School Libraries for the 21st Century Measurement Benchmarks. Thus,
the purpose of this study is to analyze the instrument for the psychometric properties of
internal consistency reliability and construct validity using classical measurement
methodology. The research questions that are guiding this study are:
1. Is SL21 a reliable instrument, as measured by Cronbach alpha’s
internal consistency and split half reliability?
2. Does evidence of construct validity based on internal factor structure
via exploratory factor analysis exist for the SL21 evaluation tool?
The SL21 school library instrument was administered to school employees
throughout the state of Michigan. Secondary data analysis of the SL21 evaluation tool

3
will be utilized to answer the research questions. Swisher and McClure (1984)
discussed the importance of library performance measures,
Carefully selected and intelligently used, performance measures are
perhaps the most important tool the library has to ensure that goals and
objectives are being accomplished, to set priorities for resource allocation,
to justify services and demonstrate accountability to outside funding
agencies, and to identify and set priorities for areas of library activities that
require attention. (p. 37)
Snowball acknowledged, “Children and teenagers are the future adult users of
libraries, and how they are treated in our libraries, particularly school and public
libraries, can cement lifelong memories and habits in these young people” (2008, p. 25).
This research is significant because libraries are vying to remain a relevant source for
information needs. Frequently, school libraries are used to store antiquated resources,
instead of being a robust media program that encourages learning (Rosales, 2014).
The results from the evaluation could be used by make funding decisions and
improve existing programs and services offered by the library media center. Johnson
(2001) recommended that state evaluation standards serve as growth plan for all media
centers. Everhart (1998) noted “Collecting hard data on various aspects of your library
media program lends credence when you communicate program needs to
administrators” (p. 1).
Assumptions and Limitations
The SL21 evaluation is based on a voluntary convenience sample of
respondents. The sample was not selected randomly, therefore no generalizations may
be made about the non-representative sample.

4
Definition of Terms
At Risk Status. School Library Program does not meet minimal benchmarks for
providing services and resources (SL21 Measurement Benchmarks, 2013, p. 28)
Construct validity. The extent to which a set of measured variables actually
represents the theoretical latent construct they are designed to measure (Hair et al.,
2005, p. 707).
Exemplary Status. School Library Program provides highest quality services and
resources. (SL21 Measurement Benchmarks, 2013, p. 28)
Exploratory Factor Analysis. A statistical technique used to define underlying
structures among variables (Hair et al., 2005, p. 773).

services (JCSEE, 1994, p. 208).
Reliability. An assessment of the degree of consistency between multiple
measurements of a variable (Hair et al., 2005, p. 137).
Qualified Status. School Library Program provides essential services and
resources (SL21 Measurement Benchmarks, 2013, p. 28)

CHAPTER 2 REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE
According to Cook, Parker and Pettijohn, libraries are “presently seen as being a
place that offers books for lending but lacking in terms of higher-level technology needs”
(2005, p. 157). Johnson (2003) noted that libraries should capitalize on the qualities that
the Internet is incapable of providing to remain a viable resource. Some of the physical
attributes that libraries can offer over the virtual attributes of the Internet are: the
complimentary use of resources, the expertise of library staff, the social experiences,
and an environment that is comforting and welcoming.
According to Kaplan (2007), library media specialists are responsible for
providing “an instructional program that helps students and faculty become efficient and
effective users of information” (p. 301). Church (2003) noted, “All the data shows that
strong media library programs led by strong library media specialists positively impact
the academic achievement of students” (p. 2). In addition to having a certified school
library media specialist, Kaplan (2007) described the characteristics of a strong library
media program as one in which students and faculty have unrestricted access to
resources, administrators are supportive and encourage collaboration, and the library
program is incorporated into the curriculum of the school.
The role of library media centers has evolved from being just a quiet place to
study for students. In addition to teaching, school librarians are also responsible for
supervising staff, integrating new technologies, managing budgets, preparing students
for standardized test and much more. Unfortunately, Johnson (2001) indicated that
often media specialists are assessed using the same evaluation methods as teachers.
Everhart (1998) noted that often there is only one media specialist employed at a

6
school. Consequently, media specialists are unable to interact with colleagues on a
regular basis, making it difficult to understand how your library programs compares with
others.
School Library Studies
To ensuring the quality of school library media programs, an evaluation of the
program is imperative. Often library programs are evaluated using standards that were
developed by professional library associations. Both state and national level studies
about school libraries have been commissioned using various evaluation techniques.
Several states library studies examined the relationship between school library media
programs and the academic performance of students on standardized test. Additionally,
student perceptions, staffing levels, hours of operation, technology, collections, and
budgets were found to have an impact on the quality of a library program.
Johnson described the process in which standards for school libraries were
developed in Minnesota (2000). The creation of state standards was an initiative of
Minnesota Educational Media Organization (MEMO), a professional organization for
library media specialists. Similar to the creation of the SL21 instrument in Michigan, a
taskforce was used to create state standards for Minnesota’s school libraries. The
standards committee members were comprised of MEMO members, various school
employees, library personnel and state department representatives. The rubric uses
three levels (i.e. minimal, standard, and exemplary) to evaluate the performance of
school library programs. Johnson (2000) noted the importance of the State Standards
“as a potential assessment tool for the status of school library media programs across
the state by providing a single scale” (p. 19).

7
Lance, Welborn and Hamilton-Pennell (1993) examined the relationship between
school library media programs and academic achievement in 221 Colorado public
schools. Data collected for this study were obtained from previously administered
reading tests, school library media center surveys, Colorado department of education
files and Colorado census data. Student achievement was measured using reading
scores from the following grades: first, second, fourth, fifth, seventh, and tenth.
Correlation analysis, factor analysis, and path analysis were the statistical methods
used to evaluate the data. The study found that the best predictor of academic
achievement is the size of the collection and the total number of employees on staff at
the media center. Student achievement was greater in schools with better-funded library
programs, regardless of the education levels of the adults in the community and
socioeconomic status of the schools and communities. Students that attend schools
staffed with library media specialists were shown to have higher academic achievement.
According to Lance et al., “A library media center should be staffed by an endorsed
library media specialist who is involved not only in identifying materials suitable for
school curricula, but also in collaborating with teachers and others in developing
curricula” (1993, p. 92). The media specialists are responsible for making library
acquisition decisions for the collection, which has an overall effect on academic
achievement.
Lance, Rodney, and Hamilton-Pennell (2000) reexamined the influence of school
library media programs on student achievement in the follow-up to the original Colorado
study. Replicating the methodology of the initial study, the second Colorado study was
expanded to examine the impact of the following predictors on student reading

8
achievement: school leadership activities of the media specialists, research technology
access, and principal and teacher involvement with the media program. Student
achievement was measured using fourth and seventh grade reading scores on the
Colorado Student Assessment Program (CSAP), a different assessment from the
previous study. The study identified several indicators of increased student performance
at all grade levels on the CSAP assessment: library program development, library staff
to student ratios, total library expenditures to students, ratio of collection materials per
students, availability of information technology, and the amount of time a media
specialists spends collaborating with teachers. Seventh grade students had higher
reading test scores in schools with media centers that offered flexible scheduling, where
students could the visit the center as a class or individually as needed. The findings of
the study showed that when all library media predictors were maximized, student
achievement was greater in fourth grade achievement (18 percent) and seventh grade
achievement (10 to 15 percent). The predictors of academic achievement were found to
be significant regardless of school or community differences.
Francis, Lance and Lietzau (2010) conducted a third Colorado study to examine
the impact of school library programs with librarians on student achievement. Similar to
the second Colorado study, student performance was evaluated with the CSAP reading
test scores from the elementary level: third, fourth, and fifth grades. Student
performance data were retrieved from archival sources. In addition, the study examined
the percentage of students with proficient or advanced and unsatisfactory performing on
the CSAP. The study evaluated how the following factors influence student
performance: staffing levels, expenditure, student visitation, collection, and achievement

9
gap. The third Colorado study found that student performance on the Colorado Student
Assessment Program (CSAP) was greater with the presence of a strong library
program, echoing the findings of the first two studies. Elementary students
demonstrated higher CSAP performance levels when at least one full-time qualified
librarian was on staff, in comparison to schools that employed librarians with fewer work
hours. This study reiterates the findings of the previous two Colorado studies that
staffing levels play a key role in student achievement.
The New York State School Library Impact Study examined the relationship
between school media centers and media specialists on student achievement (Small,
Snyder & Parker, 2009). Phase 1 of the study also evaluated the influence the school
libraries had on: student motivation for learning, technology use, the relationship
between school administrators and librarians, and the services and resources offered to
students with disabilities. The Institute of Museum and Library Services, a federal
agency, funded the study. The sample consisted of 562 principals and 1,612 school
librarians from public schools in New York. Private and charter schools were not
included in the study, as well as schools without a library or a librarian. The pilot study
established that the survey instrument provided valid and reliable measurements.
Fourth grade English Language Arts standardized test scores were used to evaluate
student achievement. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to compare
student achievement in schools with and without certified media specialist. It was
statistically significant (F=15.854, p < 0.05, partial eta-squared = 0.020). In comparison
to schools without certified media specialist, the study found that student achievement
was generally greater in schools with certified librarians. The mean standardized test

10
score for library programs with certified librarians was 663.5 (SD= 0.6). Schools with
uncertified media specialist had an average test score of 661.6 (SD= 2.2). Thus, it was
suggested that school libraries have a positive influence on student learning.
Rodney, Lance and Hamilton-Pennell (2003) discussed the impact of school
librarians on student achievement in Michigan. The Reading portions of the Michigan
Educational Assessment Program (MEAP) served as an indicator of academic
achievement for all grade levels. The study examined the relationship between having
qualified school librarians and student achievement by comparing the MEAP
performance of schools with librarians and those without. The MEAP sample included
278 fourth graders, 201 seventh graders, and 250 eleventh graders. Rodney et al.
(2003) noted a positive and statistically significant relationship between student
achievement on the MEAP reading test and library programs with qualified school
librarians. School library programs with librarians were shown to have increased reading
performance, at all grade levels, when compared to schools without librarians. The
percent differences between the groups were: 8% for high schools, 23% for middle
schools, and 35% for elementary schools. In addition to library staffing, the study
examined the impact of the following library variables on student reading achievement:
library hours of operation, staff activities, technology, library usage, library collections,
and finances. Although the impact varied by the school level, each variable was found
to have a positive impact on student achievement.
In 2003, the Illinois School Library Media Association and Illinois State Library
funded an evaluation of schools libraries across Illinois (Lance, Rodney, & HamiltonPennell, 2005). Survey data were collected from 657 primary and secondary schools

11
throughout Illinois. Some of the survey variables were: hours of operation, school library
staff and their activities, school library collections and educational technology, library
expenditures and types of library usage. Student achievement was measured using the
reading and writing assessment scores from the following grade levels: fifth, eighth, and
eleventh. Lance et al. (2005) used statistical analyses to evaluate the relationship
between school library survey variables and student achievement, and found positive,
statistically significant relationships. Student achievement was shown to be greater,
across all grade levels, when school libraries offered: flexible scheduling to students
and staff, higher levels of library staffing, collaboration between teachers and librarians,
larger collections, higher operational budgets, educational technology (used as a
supplement to the collection and often available in the classroom), and information
literacy instruction. The Illinois study suggested that high-quality school library programs
have a significant positive influence on the academic performance of students.
The Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education and the
Missouri State Library commissioned a study about the influence library media center
and services had on student achievement on the Missouri Assessment Program (MAP)
test (Quantitative Resources, 2004). The data sample was comprised of 241 schools,
where both school level data and survey data were available. The data from the two
sources were aggregated into the following components: librarian qualifications, library
staff activities, library staffing, library access, library usage, summer reading program,
library budget, library management, technology, library space, and library media center
holdings. To evaluate the relationships between library media center programs and
student performance, the following statistical analyses were performed: bivariate

12
correlation, multiple regressions and partial correlation. The weighted average was
implemented for MAP test results. The study determined that Missouri schools with
library media programs have a positive impact (10.6%) on MAP performance. “No
longer is the connection between school library media centers and student achievement
an opinion or belief. The connection has been confirmed as a statistically significant,
true relationship based on hard data (Quantitative Resources, 2004, p. 6).”
Furthermore, this relationship cannot be explained away by school and community
demographic characteristics. Library access, library usage and summer reading
programs were shown to have a statistically significant impact on student achievement.
Todd and Kuhilhau (2005) examined how effective school libraries helped
students to learn in Ohio. Thirty-nine schools with effective school libraries were
selected to participate in the study. After conducting a pilot study of the survey
instrument, it was determined that students in kindergarten through second grade were
not eligible to participate in the study because of limited experience with libraries and
language skills. The study was comprised of 879 faculty members and 13,123 students
which ages ranged between 7 and 20 years old and represented grades third through
twelve. The student population that participated in the study were White (78.5%),
African-Americans (5.5%) and multiracial (4.1%). A majority of the students are located
in urban or suburban districts (80.9%), the others live in rural areas (9.8%), small cities
(7%) and large cities (2.3%).
The Impacts on Learning Survey, a web-based instrument, were used to collect
both quantitative and qualitative data that included both open-ended and likert scale

13
responses for students. The questionnaire included 48 statements about help at the
school library, and covered the following topics:
1. How helpful the school library is with getting information you need.
2. How helpful the school library is with using the information to complete
your school work.
3. How helpful the school library is with your school work in general.
4. How helpful the school library is with using computers in the library, at
school, and at home.
5. How helpful the school library is to you with your general reading
interests.
6. How helpful the school library is to you when you are not at school.
7. General school aspects (Todd & Kuhilhau, 2005, p. 67).
The data showed that majority of the students (99.44%) perceived effective school
libraries as being helpful in their education in various ways. According to Todd and
Kuhilhau (2005), “Students valued instruction that enabled them to become good
researchers and to explore the world of ideas in depth, and many acknowledged that
this instruction had a positive effect on their grades” (p. 86). Effective school library
programs that helped with student achievement were identified as having all of the
following elements: informational, transformational, and formational.
The Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) is a national survey of public and
private schools and their employees throughout the United States. Both traditional and
charter public schools participated in the 2011–2012 SASS library media centers
survey. According to Bitterman, Gray and Goldring (2013), 90 percent of all public
schools in the United States have a library media center. One-third of public schools
reported that they did not employ a full-time, salaried, state certified media specialist.
Over half of all salaried school library media specialists reported earning a master’s
degree in relevant library program of study. In the United States, public schools with
library media centers generally have 17 computer workstations with Internet access.

14
Eighty-six percent of all school libraries reported offering students access to online,
licensed databases (Bitterman et al., 2013). Respondents were asked about the hours
of operation for independent student use. The majority of the public school libraries
offered both flexible and regular hours (61 percent), while other libraries exclusively
offered either flexible hours (19 percent) or regular hours (19 percent). Library
patronage by independent students was offered during the following times: regular
school hours (89 percent), before school (57 percent), and after school (54 percent).
Public school libraries reported permitting laptop usage outside of the media centers for
school employees (54 percent) and students (40 percent).
Program Evaluation
The Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation defined program
evaluations as “evaluations that assess ongoing activities that provide services”
(JCSEE, 1994, p. 208). According to Patton (2008),
Program evaluation as a distinct field of professional practice was born of
two lessons […]: first, the realization that there is not enough money to do
all the things that need doing; and second, even if there were enough
money, it takes more than money to solve complex human and social
problems. As not everything can be done, there must be a basis for
deciding which things are worth doing. Enter evaluation (Patton, 2008, p.
16).
Program evaluations can be summative and formative. Formative evaluations are
“designed and used to improve an object, especially when it is still being developed”
(JCSEE, 1994, p. 206). Summative evaluations are “designed to present conclusions
about merit and worth of an object and recommendations about whether it should be
retained altered or eliminated” (JCSEE, 1994, p. 209). The formative SL21 evaluation

15
tool can be used as a “as conversation starters with principals and school
administrators” (SL21 Background, 2013, p. 1).
SL21 Instrument
The Measurement Benchmarks for Michigan School Libraries for 21st Century
Schools (SL21) instrument was developed in 2009 to measure the quality of Michigan’s
school library programs within individual buildings. In 2013, the SL21 instrument was
revised by a workgroup, which included librarians, MAME members, and a school
administrator. The Library of Michigan Board of Trustees endorsed the revised SL21
measures. The SL21 instrument is available in a printed format. Respondents are sent
the instrument to complete and return via mail. The 19 items program evaluation
examines the following categories: Building the 21st Century Learning Environment,
Teaching for 21st Century Learning, and Leading the Way to 21st Century Learning.
The instrument uses a 3-point response scale of exemplary, qualified and at risk to
evaluate the status of an individual library program. The Evidence of Practice sections
offer respondents the opportunity to expound upon why their programs are proficient or
deficient in every measurement benchmark.
Knowing the important role of the teacher-librarian in the overall success of the
school library program, the SL21 program evaluation incorporates several measures in
regards to this position, but the developers of the SL21 instrument caution that it is not
an employee evaluation. Haycock (1999) notes that often the evaluation of the media
specialist is “confused with evaluation of the “library program” itself, which is a much
larger and more complex area” (p. 14). Furthermore, it is unfair to hold the teacherlibrarian accountable for an entire library program when there are many factors (e.g.

16
budgets, staffing, and acquisitions) that are not under the direct control of the teacherlibrarian.
Psychometrics
Warwick and Lininger (1975) described a survey as a “method of collecting
information about a human population in which direct contact is made with the units of
the study (individuals, organizations, communities, etc.) through such systematic means
as questionnaires and interview schedules” (pp. 1-2). Measurement consistency and
accuracy is a very important aspect of survey research. According to Warwick and
Lininger, “There are two basic goals in questionnaire design: (1) to obtain information
relevant to the purposes of the survey, and (2) to collect this information with maximal
reliability and validity” (1975, p. 127).
The degree of consistency between multiple measures of a variable is reliability
(Hair et al., 2005). “The degree to which responses are consistent across the item within
a measure” is internal consistency reliability (Kline, 2011, p. 69).
Cronbach’s alpha, which is also called alpha coefficient, is a measure of internal
consistency reliability. Cronbach’s alpha is defined as
=

where

∙ ̅
̅ + ( − 1) ∙ ̅

(1)

is equal to the number of items, ̅ is the average inter-item covariance among

the items, and ̅ equals the average variance. Split-half reliability coefficient is another
measure of internal consistency where the assessment is divided into two parts, and a
correlation coefficient is produced between the halves.

17
The degree to which an instrument measures what it is supposed to measure is
validity. Construct validity is “the extent to which a set of measured variables actually
represents the theoretical latent construct they are designed to measure” (Hair et al.,
2005 p. 707). According to Cronbach and Meehl, “Construct validation takes place when
an investigator believes his instrument reflects a particular construct, to which are
attached certain meanings. The proposed interpretation generates specific testable
hypotheses, which are a means of confirming or disconfirming the claim” (1955, p. 290).
Thus, the accuracy of a measurement is examined by construct validity.
Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) is a statistical technique used to assess
construct validity. Ferguson and Cox (1993) described the EFA process in three
phases: pre-analysis checks, extraction and rotation. Principal component analysis is an
extraction technique to reduce the dimensionality of a data set consisting of a large
number of interrelated variables, while retaining as much as possible of the variation
present in the data set. This is achieved by transforming to a new set of variables, the
principal components, which are uncorrelated, and which are ordered so that the first
few retain most of the variation present in all of the original variables (Jolliffe, 2002).
Varimax is an orthogonal rotation technique that attempts to find a simple structure in
factor analysis (Everitt & Skrondal, 2010).

CHAPTER 3 METHODOLOGY
Design
The current study will employ an ex post facto research design using secondary
data from the Measurement Benchmarks for Michigan School Libraries for 21st Century
Schools (SL21) survey instrument. The data were collected from evaluations
administered from 2014-2015. The SL21 data were obtained after submitting a request
to the Library of Michigan.
Study Population
During the 2015-2016 school year, there were 4,832 public school buildings in
Michigan, and 644 of these buildings reported having Librarians/Media Specialists
(CEPI, 2016). Participation in the SL21 program is voluntary, and all school types (i.e.
charter, private, and public) are encouraged to participate. Research participants are
recruited by the Library of Michigan through professional organizations, conferences,
and presentations. The Michigan Association for Media in Education (MAME) is one of
the professional organizations that partners with the Library of Michigan in recruiting
potential study participants. The school library program evaluation must be jointly
completed by both the school administrator and school librarian, and requires the final
review of District Superintendent before submittal.
Procedures
The survey data from the printed SL21 instrument will be manually entered into a
database for analysis. The names of school library programs will be omitted. The data
will not identify the names of individual school administrators or librarians. The SL21
data obtained will be analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 22.

19
Instrument Reliability
Cronbach's alpha and split-half will be computed using SPSS to assess the
internal consistency reliability of the SL21 instrument. According to Nunnally and
Bernstein (1994), an adequate reliable scale has a minimum reliability coefficient of
0.80.
Data Analysis
After the SL21 data are obtained, the data will be cleaned to ensure quality. The
scores obtained from administering the school library program evaluation are dependent
variables. Listwise deletion will be implemented to exclude cases with missing data from
the analysis. Descriptive statistics (i.e. mean, standard deviation, and variance) on the
scores will be computed for the data set.
An exploratory factor analysis will be used in an attempt to discover factors. The
next step will be to run a factor analysis and factor rotation. Varimax, an orthogonal
rotation technique, is the factor rotation method that will be used. After the rotation is
completed, factor loadings will be examined. Small coefficients with an absolute value
below 0.4 will be suppressed.

20
CHAPTER 4 RESULTS
In this chapter, the psychometric properties of the SL21 instrument are reported.
The sample consisted of 54 respondents who were administered the instrument in 2014
and 2015. All of the surveys were returned and valid for the analysis. Results of the
reliability measures and factor analysis are presented. Multiple measures of internal
consistency reliability were examined for comparison purposes: Cronbach’s alpha,
Subscale Spearman-Brown, and Split-half reliability. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA)
was used to measure construct validity. Three techniques were used in an attempt to
confirm factors: 1) estimate the number of factors to retain with statistical software
(SPSS), 2) visual inspection of a Scree plot to determine the number of factors to retain
and 3) force in to three factors because the instrument has three subscales. The
findings of the data analyses are displayed using the Tables below.
Reliability
The internal consistency reliability was measured by Cronbach’s alpha for the
SL21 instrument. For the overall instrument, Cronbach’s alpha, as well as Cronbach’s
alpha based on standardized items, for the n = 19 items was .807. The item statistics for
each of the SL21 Benchmarks are displayed in Table 1. Curriculum Development was
shown to have the lowest mean and the greatest standard deviation. Climate Conducive
to Learning had a zero variance.

The item total statistics for SL21 Benchmarks, where n=18, is shown in Table 2.
Climate conducive to learning was removed because it had zero variance. Cronbach’s
alpha was .810 and Cronbach’s alpha based on standardized items was .806, for the n
= 18. The final column of Table 2, Cronbach's Alpha if Item Deleted, provides the value
that Cronbach's alpha would be if that particular item was deleted from the analysis.

After reviewing Table 2, it does not appear that deleting any single item would
substantially improve Cronbach alpha.
Cronbach’s alpha, which suffers from attenuation due to the reduction in the
number of items, is projected by the Spearman-Brown prediction formula. The total
scale was reduced to N = 18 items, six for each subscale: building, teaching and
leading. The original scale consisted of N = 19 items, but Climate conducive to learning
was excluded from the subsequent analyses because it had zero variance. The

23
Spearman-Brown based Cronbach’s alpha for the three subscales is reported in Table
4.

In addition to Cronbach’s alpha, the split half coefficient expressed as a
Spearman-Brown corrected correlation was computed for the SL21 Benchmarks. The
scale was split by dividing the items on the instrument in into two halves. The first half of
the analysis contained items: Staffing, Accessibility, Facility, Citizenship & Social
Responsibility, Instructional Materials, Budget, Instruction, Student Achievement, and
Collaboration.

The

second

half

contained:

Reading,

Technology,

Curriculum

Development, Program Effectiveness, Professional Learning Communities, Local &
Global Community Engagement, Policies and Procedures, Inquiry-Based, Research,
and Advocacy. Similar to the Cronbach’s alpha analysis, Climate Conducive to Learning
was not included in the split half analysis. The results of the analysis are shown Tables
4. The Spearman-Brown adjusted the internal consistency reliability estimate
substantially adjusted the Cronbach Alpha for the two parts upward, as indicated in
Table 5 below.

Construct Validity
There are two approaches that can be invoked at this point. When the purpose is
data reduction, the following iterative approach is useful. Suppress all factor loadings
that are less than |.4| and sort the factors by magnitude of the weights. Then, eliminate
all items that either fail to load, or load on more than one factor. This process is then
repeated until all items meet the above conditions. This method is typically used when
there are a large number of potential items in a pool (e.g., several hundred or more).
However, a second approach is more appropriate in this case because there are
initially only a limited number of items in the pool. It is appropriate, therefore, to carry
out the EFA once, and print all items regardless of factor weights. Then, a heuristic
process is used to make sense of the EFA.
The initial factor analysis was conducted by allowing the statistical software to
estimate the number of common factors to retain with eigenvalue greater than 1.
Identified in Tables 6 through 8 are six common factors in the SL21 instrument. The

25
factors were extracted using the principle component method and were rotated using
Varimax. It appears that all of the items in Table 6 contributed to the component matrix.
The total variance explained was 68.6%.

In Figure 1, a scree plot was produced to determine the appropriate number of
factors that should be generated by the analysis. The graph displays the factors on the
x-axis and eigenvalues on the y-axis. A visual inspection of the scree plot indicates the
leveling off of eigenvalues on the scree plot after about four factors.

The next factor analysis was conducted using the four factors derived from the
scree plot. From the analysis, Tables 9 through 11 were created. It appears that all of
the items are contributing to the component in a meaningful way, as noted in Table 9.
However, the explained variance was reduced in this model to 56%.

The last factor analysis was conducted by forcing three factors. The
determination of the number of factors to extract was based on the SL21 instrument
having three subscales: Building the 21st Century Learning Environment Subscale,
Teaching for 21st Century Learning Subscale, and Leading the Way to 21st Century
Learning Subscale. Tables 12 through 14 display the principal component analysis:

After forcing the exploratory factor solution into three factors, the explained
variance was reduced further. The findings derived from the EFA did not tend to support
the original three-factor structure of the SL21 instrument, as is evidenced by Table 15
below. It is essentially the information contained in Table 12 above, with the small factor
loadings suppressed less than |.4|. An inspection of the factor loadings revealed that 5
of the 18 items loaded on the appropriate factors. Two items from the Learning
component, Professional Learning Communities and Local & Global Community
Engagement, cross-loaded on both the Building and Teaching components. Technology
failed to load on any of the three factors.

CHAPTER 5 CONCLUSIONS
Reliability
Measurement Benchmarks for Michigan School Libraries for 21st Century
Schools (SL21) was found to have an adequate reliability. The sample consisted of 54
respondents from school library programs in Michigan. During the 2015-2016 school
year, 644 public school buildings reported having Librarians/Media Specialists (CEPI,
2016). Cronbach’s alpha for the total instrument was 0.807 (n = 19 items). Initially, the
item-deletion method was performed to determine if Cronbach’s alpha could be
improved. First, Climate Conducive to Learning was excluded from the subsequent
analyses because it had zero variance. Next, Inquiry-Based Research and Advocacy
were deleted because the value of “Cronbach’s alpha if item deleted” was greater than
the original estimate of reliability. The reduced item set produced a Cronbach alpha of
0.810 when n=18; 0.821 when n=16. There appears to be no substantive reason to
delete Inquiry-Based Research and Advocacy because the incremental improvement in
reliability was marginal.
In Table 1, Curriculum Development was shown to have the lowest mean (1.61)
and the greatest standard deviation (.656). Although, it is evident that one of the data
points has to be in the lowest or greatest positions. Perhaps, the State of Michigan
should consider examining the curriculum development of school library programs
further. The high variance indicates a wide spread variation in the respondents’
perception of their school library curriculum.
The Spearman-Brown prediction formula was used because of the small number
of items in the three subscales. The analysis consisted of a total 18 items, where n = 6

33
items per subscales can be projected to a total of 12 additional items. Substantial
promise of increased reliability is indicated in all the subscales in Table 4. In the first
subscale, Building the 21st Century Learning Environment, Cronbach’s alpha is
expected to increase from .549 to .79. In other words, this means that if an additional
twelve items of the same psychometric caliber as the initial six items in the subscale
were added, the reliability is projected to increase to .79. Although Cronbach’s alpha
exceeded the recommended minimum of 0.80 by Nunnally and Bernstein (1994), the
reliability could be improved by increasing the number of items, as indicated by the
Spearman-Brown.
The SL21 instrument had a good split-half reliability (.805) which indicated that
the correlation between forms was moderate (0.67). The instrument was split into two
even parts; where, the first half was comprised of the first 9 items, and the second half
contained the last 9 items. As previously stated, Climate Conducive to Learning was
omitted from the analysis. It is important to know how the test was split because the
values of the split-half reliability can vary depending on how the instrument was divided.
Other factors that may have an influence on the analyses are the design of the
instrument and respondent fatigue.
Construct Validity
Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was used to determine if evidence of construct
validity exists for the SL21 evaluation tool. The instrument was designed with three
subscales, and EFA was used to determine if the same structure will be revealed in the
data. The results of the initial EFA discovered that the 3-point scale created 6 factors,
and this does not support the original factor structure. Four factors were revealed after a

34
visual inspection of a scree plot. The last factor analysis was conducted by forcing
SPSS to extract three factors. The results showed that as the number of factors were
reduced, the total variance explained also was reduced. Further examination of the
three factor extraction revealed that 13 of the 18 items failed to load on the appropriate
factors. Technology failed to load on any of the factors. This maybe an indication that
the item was poorly designed or should not have been included in the measure.
The original 3-point scale identified 6 factors. Often, this scale produces data that
are extremely distributed, and is difficult to distinguish the relations among the variables.
This can lead to low inter-item correlations and lower internal consistency. Therefore, it
is recommended that the 3-point scale be recalibrated into a 5-point Likert scale. The
modified scale could possibly increase the internal consistency, display higher inter-item
correlations, and identify two or three factors.

generalizations may be made about the psychometric results of this study.
The SL21 instrument is worthy of further study because of the dearth of literature
that is focused on examining the psychometric properties of evaluation tools for school
library programs. Perhaps a future study will use a revised survey instrument and a
nationally representative sample.

ABSTRACT
RELIABILITY AND VALIDITY OF
MICHIGAN SCHOOL LIBRARIES FOR THE 21ST CENTURY
MEASUREMENT BENCHMARKS

Doctor of Education

The purpose of this study was to examine the psychometric properties of the
Michigan School Libraries for the 21st Century Measurement Benchmarks (SL21). The
instrument consists of 19 items with three subscales: Building the 21st Century Learning
Environment Subscale, Teaching for 21st Century Learning Subscale, and Leading the
Way to 21st Century Learning Subscale. The sample consisted of 54 respondents who
were administered the instrument in 2014 and 2015. Cronbach’s alpha for the total
instrument was 0.807 (n = 19 items). Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was used to
measure construct validity. The findings derived from the EFA did not tend to support
the original three-factor structure. The SL21 instrument is worthy of further study
because of the dearth of literature that is focused on examining the psychometric
properties of evaluation tools for school library programs. Perhaps a future study will
use a revised survey instrument and a nationally representative sample.
