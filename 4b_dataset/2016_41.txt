ABSTRACT
ELIZABETH LEE ENOCHS
A CAUTIONARY TALE: MIXED METHODS ANALYSIS OF ELEMENTARY
SCHOOL LIBRARY FOLKLORE COLLECTIONS
MAY 2016
Using mixed methods and framed in community psychology theory, this
collection analysis study examined the folklore holdings of 77 elementary libraries in one
large, urban school district in order to address three questions for research: What are
features of elementary school library folklore collections? How is folklore used in
elementary school instruction? and Do elementary school library folklore collections
support instruction? Quantitative metrics for analysis included multiple linear regression,
relative use factor, and Spearman’s rho correlations. Most collections comprised 3.96%
folklore titles, well below the 5% recommended in the literature. The majority of
collections were 18 years old. Average folklore circulation accounted for 2.27% of total
circulation. Age was not associated with the circulation of the folklore collection;
however, size of the folklore collection predicted about 15% of circulation, and larger
folklore collections circulated more than smaller. Semi-structured interviews with
teachers from the schools in the quantitative sample furnished a narrative explaining
teachers’ use of library folklore in instruction. Teachers use folklore to teach culture,
math, and science. They provide classroom sets of folklore from the school library during
v

close study of the genre. Merged with the quantitative findings, these interviews
explained the need to care for older collections, to maximize the size of the folklore
collection, and to select well-illustrated folklore titles spanning cultures and reading
levels. A chief lesson from this cumulative collection analysis is that library collections
are best analyzed in the context of the community where they are used.

CHAPTER I
INTRODUCTION
After three months of sheltered instruction in English in a United States public
elementary school, fourth-grade student and recent immigrant Perla reads basic folktales
in English and responds to them in conversations with her teacher. “This grasshopper is
lazy. The ants can put him in the snow to die!” she says of Aesop’s cautionary fable, The
Ant and the Grasshopper. Her moral indignation is amplified by her nascent ease at
expressing it in her second language. Tatar (1992) calls this the folktale’s “relentless need
to teach children lessons,” a corollary to the transformation of the folktale from spoken
word for adults to written literature for children (7).
Statement of the Problem
Modern standards for elementary school curriculum and instruction often include
the study of folktales and traditional literature, whether in the context of literature-based
reading instruction, social studies curricula, character education, or genre study
(Common Core State Standards Initiative 2015a; Texas Administrative Code 2008).
Providing support for the curriculum is a chief mission of the school library. Yet in the
face of diminished funds for education, school librarians often maintain insufficient,
older folklore collections that are rarely examined with formal quantitative or qualitative
measures (Enochs 2014).

1

Recent research argues for expanding the evaluation of school library collections
using quantitative metrics which can substantiate the need for additional funding (Enochs
2014, 2009, 2010a; Gavigan 2014; Lanning and Turner 2010). In particular, examination
of the age, size, and use of elementary school libraries’ folklore collections allows
librarians to acquire materials that support the curriculum while encouraging independent
reading and predicting patron use in an appealing genre (Enochs 2009, 2010a). To that
end, quantitative analysis of school folklore collections suggests “procedures, models,
and routes of inquiry for school librarians” who identify the genre as a fundamental
component of curriculum and instruction in their school communities (Enochs 2010a, 3;
Enochs 2014).
Research also suggests that qualitative interviews with teachers can inform school
librarians’ collection analyses (Oseghale 2008; Gavigan 2014), enabling them to build
collections that support curricula while also making the case for expanded funding. The
technique of mixing qualitative and quantitative methods of collection analysis – a
methodology embedded in the study at hand – comes from academic libraries, where
faculty routinely respond to surveys measuring their perceptions of access, relevance, and
whether or not they perceive the collection as current (Oseghale 2008; Enochs 2014). In
fact, recent studies of effective collection development models suggest that in K-12
schools, evidence-based collection development strategies like faculty surveys and patron
interviews may shorten the process of collection analysis and remove obstacles to its
effectiveness (Enochs 2014). Assessing teachers’ perceptions of the collection provides a

2

primary marker for the alignment of a school library collection with standards,
curriculum, and pedagogy.
Significance of this Research
The purpose of school library collection analysis is to inform the decision making
of the librarian in developing standards-compliant collections that “enable student
learning and support information literacy” (Hughes-Hassell and Mancall 2005, xii). The
purpose of this research is to analyze the folklore collections in the elementary school
libraries of one large, urban school district, and to determine if those collections can
support current practice in literacy instruction – in particular, instruction using folklore.
The significance of this research is three-fold:
(1) Rarely does research examine school library collections using formal,
quantitative methods (Enochs 2014). In fact, just three recent studies report using
statistical methods to explore genre-specific school library holdings (Gavigan 2014;
Enochs 2010a; Lanning and Turner 2010). The study at hand uses circulation and
collection statistics to provide data about the variables of age, size, and circulation of
folklore located in the Dewey classification of 398.2 in the elementary school libraries of
one large, urban school district for one school year. In turn, descriptive and inferential
metrics spotlight trends in the circulation and condition of the folklore collections, and
help to answer several questions. Do newer folktales circulate more than older ones? Do
folklore collections see use relative to their size in elementary school libraries? Does the
age of the folklore collection predict its use?

3

(2) Using qualitative data gathered from faculty interviews, this study establishes
an additional path of inquiry for school librarians and district library directors seeking to
describe the adequacy of the collection in terms of its use by patrons. Recent research
establishes that that examining collections with user-centered data from faculty
interviews and surveys allows librarians to acquire materials that support pedagogy in
individual schools, while also encouraging independent reading and predicting patron use
in a given genre (Enochs 2010a).
(3) Statistical analyses from this study provide data for school districts to use to
compare and contrast their own elementary school library folklore collections with those
in the sample (see Enochs 2010a).
Rationale and Reasons for Research
Folklore and Community Values
To assess the folklore collections in school libraries begs the question of why
folklore is included in modern children’s literacy and language arts curricula, since a
central mission of the school library is to support curriculum and instruction. Others have
embarked on similar exegetic journeys.
Cultural values. In her pivotal research regarding evaluation of 20th century
folktales for children, Del Negro (2007) examined social, cultural, political and literary
influences on the evaluation of children’s folktales, particularly with regard to
establishing their cultural authenticity (3). For Del Negro (1999, 2007), a study of
children’s folktales presupposed a study of the evolving criteria for their evaluation over
time, taking into account changing social mores, increasingly tolerant attitudes toward
4

race and gender, and diminishing stereotypes of the tale’s culture of origin. Del Negro’s
(1999, 2007) work synthesizes a century of published reviews of children’s folklore and
is predicated on the notion that a change in social values will be mirrored in the evolving,
scholarly judgment of a folktale’s authenticity. In turn, curricula and standards which
include folklore in literacy instruction can reflect the folktales’ cultures with a hefty
measure of authenticity. For Del Negro (1999), including folklore in the literacy
curriculum goes beyond using the occasional noteworthy story to teach concepts of plot
and theme; instead, folklore in the children’s literacy curriculum “reveals the social,
political, and aesthetic issues that define what we want our children to read and know”
(579).
The sentiment is not new. Bosma’s (1987, 1992) landmark text for teachers noted
that picture book versions of folktales were particularly suited for sharing a given
culture’s doctrines and customs. Additionally, the universality of themes in children’s
folktales allows the genre to communicate far more than a picture of a particular culture
(Jacobs and Tunnell 2004). Children learn that people share a universal need for “love,
hope, and security and possess feelings of happiness, anger, pride, and loneliness”
(Bosma 1992, 4).
Social expectations. In fact, essential principles of human behavior and prevailing
social values are easy to communicate through folklore for children, given its tendency
toward spare, archetypal characterization (Jacobs and Tunnell 2004, 72). Jacobs and
Tunnell (2004) use Cinderella variants as examples of folktales where characters are
stripped of intricate description in favor of one-sided, symbolic characterization (72). The
5

effect is to highlight the overwhelming odds against a fundamentally virtuous protagonist
who triumphs in the end. Jacobs and Tunnell (2004) call this the ultimate value of
folklore – its ability to communicate to children the value of hope in the face of adversity
(75).
The way these characters in folktales create or respond to life’s exigencies
provides children with examples of social expectations (Vardell 2014). Young (2004)
notes that folklore written expressly for children responds to a fundamental human “need
to transmit values to children and youth” (3). Tatar (2002) frames this in constructivist
terminology, noting the potential of folktales to forge “behavioral codes and
developmental paths, even as they provide us with terms for thinking about what happens
in our world” (xii). Stoodt-Hill and Amspaugh-Corson (2009) note that cultures often use
folktales to perpetuate a culture’s standards and beliefs; conversely, they can also be a
vehicle for reducing stereotypes (Young 2004).
Universal truth. Historically, the use of the folktale in school curricula reflects a
particular regard for this tendency of the story to communicate universal truth – primarily
shared ideas of good and evil. Mid-nineteenth century basal readers for children included
fairy tales and legends, albeit without information about the genre (McGuffey 1857). In
particular, textbooks for pre-service teachers and librarians have been in a unique
position to influence the use of the folktale in curricula (Del Negro 1999, 580), and in
turn, the nature of the folklore collection in the school library. In her painstaking
historical analysis of May Hill Arbuthnot’s seminal textbook, Children and Books, which
was published in nine editions under two authors between 1947 and 1997, Del Negro
6

(1999) remarks that Arbuthnot’s first edition came down squarely on the side of using
folktales to teach children universal, ethical truth (593), using language that remained in
place through every edition of the book – even after the change in author: “Indeed, so
roundly and soundly do these old tales stand for morality that they leave an indelible
impression of virtue invariably rewarded and evil unfailingly punished” (Arbuthnot 1947,
232; Sutherland, Arbuthnot, and Monson 1986, 178; Sutherland and Hyman 1997, 180).
Other, more recent textbooks for teachers of children’s literature are less
prescriptive in their reasons for using folklore in the literacy curriculum, noting mainly
the ease of the genre in presenting moral and ethical truths that children may understand
mostly in light of the delight they take in stock, static characters who represent those
truths. Newer textbooks allude to the satisfaction children find in sharply bifurcated
notions of good and evil (Vardell 2014; Stoodt-Hill and Amspaugh-Corson 2009;
Gamble and Yates 2011), where justice always wins and the wicked get their due.
Gamble and Yates (2011) and others (Vardell 2014; Jacobs and Tunnell 2004) add that
evil and good are personified in traditional literature (e.g. the wicked stepmother and
Cinderella), usually with a minimum of detail.
Engagement of new readers. The universal values embedded in folklore as a
source of engagement for new readers provide another reason for including the genre in
curriculum and in school library collections. One very recent study in China adapted
folktales originating in the Zhejiang Province for use in teaching very young children in
that province. The study found that children engaged with the stories because they were
familiar with the landscape and the stories connected with the children’s daily lives and
7

experiences (Zhang 2014). On the other hand, Stoodt-Hill and Amspaugh-Corson (2009),
Vardell (2014), and Jacobs and Tunnell (2004) note that the imaginary feats
accomplished by folktale protagonists would be impossible in real life, a fact that
children generally understand but the possibility of which they are willing to consider –
over and over again.
Children’s literature scholars generally agree on reasons to include literature –
and particularly folklore – in the elementary curriculum: to illustrate aesthetics of story
and language; to cultivate an understanding of self in social context; to present aspects of
other cultures; and to stimulate cognition by increasing knowledge (Stoodt-Hill and
Amspaugh-Corson 2009, 4; Davidson 1955; see also Nelson-Royes 2012). But the
practice of including literature specifically in the literacy curriculum has evolved over a
century of reading pedagogy, often in fits and starts. In essence, the material used to teach
children to read has progressed over the past two hundred years from the prescriptive to
the popular.
Literature-Based Literacy Instruction
Historical foundations. New England printer Samuel Wood was the first publisher
to print an entire set of graded primers for children, a project he completed twice between
1800 and his retirement in 1836 (Venezky 1990; see also Stanford University Cubberly
Library 2009). Thematic content in the series consisted mostly of what Wood thought
children should read rather than any particular known genre of children’s literature.
Venezky (1990) notes a conspicuous lack of fairy tales and folktales in the primers, a
characteristic of most Quaker texts. The readers were geared toward leveled reading
8

instruction in New York’s earliest Quaker schools for the poor (Venezky 1992, xvi;
Venezky 1990, 21). Venezky’s research into early primers and ABC books for children
concludes that by the end of the nineteenth century, children’s readers had moved away
from firm, religious didacticism and toward more child-friendly content (Venezky 1992,
xiii; see also Venezky 1990), including folktales and fairy tales.
Until the mid-1800s, secular and religious primers were in use side-by-side in
most schools, alongside less didactic, more childlike ABC books. In the mid-1800s,
school districts began the practice of purchasing reusable, leveled textbooks, shifting the
cost away from families (Venezky 1992). Primers in series, like the widely known
McGuffey Reader, offered lesson plans and scripted instruction for teachers (see, for
example, McGuffey 1857, 10), providing the basis for the modern basal reading series
(Shannon 1989). While McGuffey included folklore in the form of fables and legends in
the series – even disclosing the genre of some selections – the organization of content
was not by genre, but by text length and lesson objective (McGuffey 1857, 9-10). The
primers focused on pronunciation, word recognition, vocabulary, spelling, and
comprehension. Features of the genre per se were not included, nor were they a focus of
lesson plans suggested by the author.
Venezky (1992) notes that by the end of the nineteenth century, content in readers
and textbooks had secularized to the point of excluding religious content in favor of
literature that appealed to adult interests, which is why content so frequently adjusted to
changing literary tastes (xix). Reading instruction at the time focused on whole-word
instruction (Sears 2006; Schantz and Zimmer 2005), a method originating in Germany
9

and embraced by progressivist educators like John Dewey, who called for a redefinition
of instructional methods in order to take into account both the way a child learns and the
concept of learning to read in context (1902).
At the time, reading was in the early stages of being taught separately from
English class (Sears, 2006; Shannon 1989). According to Sears (2006) and Schantz and
Zimmer (2005), whole word literacy instruction was the norm until the mid-twentieth
century, finding its way into teachers’ guides for basal readers until the 1950s. The
method, still in modern use as an intervention strategy, emphasizes word recognition
without regard to letter-sound relationships (Faragher and Clarke 2014, 201). Modern
scholars note the limitations of whole word instruction; namely, it is restricted to words
taught and therefore does not support independent reading (Buckley, Bird, and Byrne
1996).
Research into just how children acquire the skills to read began in earnest during
the first two decades of the twentieth century (Sears, 2006, 3), including the unfavorable
comparisons of oral reading to silent reading, and the first notion that oral reading and the
ability to recognize a word on sight might not actually include comprehension of text
(Thorndike 1917; see also Huey 1908, 342-343). The exploration of the phenomenon of
decoding fell primarily upon psychologists, who slowly began to see reading as a holistic
phenomenon, comprising what Thorndike (1917) thought of as a phenomenological
balancing act: “The mind … must select, repress, soften, emphasize, correlate and
organize, all under the influence of the right mental set or purpose or demand” (330).

10

Sears (2006) adds that Thorndike’s conclusion that “reading is thinking” makes him one
of the most cited experts in the field – even in modern times (5).
Oddly enough, Thorndike himself authored three word books, alphabetical lists of
sight words ranked by their prevalence in literature traditionally read by with children
and youth. He proposed that his word books be used in beginning reading instruction
using the whole-word method (Thorndike 1921; Thorndike and Longe 1944, 1972).
Whole word literacy instruction gradually assumed dominance over phonics methods,
particularly when reading researchers in the late 1920s advocated postponing phonics
instruction until the third grade and teaching it only if needed (Sears, 2006, 14; see also
Schantz and Zimmer 2005; Mulder and Curtin, 1955). Historian Nila Blanton Smith, in
her pioneering research tracing curricula for reading instruction, added that most of the
basal readers in place from 1900-1925 all had firm groundings in phonics instruction
(2002). However, Mulder and Curtin (1955) note that by 1927, overt phonics instruction
for beginning readers had fallen out of favor (121), citing Arthur Gates’s (1927) research
which recommended eliminating phonics from instruction in first grade altogether (see
also Sears 2006).
Smith (2002) notes that basal readers were still in use through the 1940s, but that
reading teachers often incorporated the new activity method, which called for teaching
reading solely at the point of need as it “flowed out of children’s interest” (227; 230).
Other arguments against basal readers and programmed literacy instruction in the 1940s
and 1950s essentially came from two camps (Shannon 1989, 38). On one hand, reading
series with basal readers reduce reading instruction to a finite set of skills with little
11

regard for student engagement and transferability of skills (Shannon 1989). On the other
hand, argued Rudolph Flesch (1955), the abandonment of phonics in literacy instruction
had led to a nation of children with substandard reading skills. Sears (2006) also contends
that literacy instruction and research in the 1940s began to address points of failure in
elementary reading instruction. Scholars defined the term “remedial reading” (Gray 1940,
101; see also Sears 2006, 16) and at least one new reading series incorporated excerpts
from content areas other than language arts (18), acknowledging that reading might have
applications previously unaddressed in pedagogy.
Most important for the research at hand, beginning in 1942, Paul Witty, a
professor of reading at Northwestern University, published the Reading for Interest
reading series, acknowledging the power of engaging new readers with literary genre.
Witty was among the first researchers to use the terminology “balanced reading” when
referring to curriculum (1963). His later reading series, Reading Caravan, incorporated
long chapters of tall tales, folklore, fairy tales, and epic poetry into every volume (see
Witty and Freeland 1964, 205). Witty’s attention to genre in the organization of his series
embodied and heralded the changes in literacy instruction that characterized the next fifty
years.
Reading teachers in the 1950s continued to use skills-based reading series as the
anchors of reading instruction, so much so that Shannon (1989) contended that the
standardization of reading instruction was virtually complete in the United States by
1960. School districts adopted basal reading series with teachers’ guides, and
administrators instructed reading teachers to follow scripted lessons with short excerpts
12

or simplified, abridged versions of stories as the lesson’s foundation. Scholars who saw
the promise of using authentic literature in the classroom railed against basals that used
abridgements and stories written according to readability formulas:
It is my conviction that the reading experts ... have, in trying to lessen
vocabulary and concept burdens for the developing readers, accomplished
something ... of an almost disastrous nature. In order to present only
reading material which conformed to their strictly limited vocabularies
and concept patterns, they began to write materials themselves rather than
use traditional literature....That eliminated the fanciful quality from
children's readers and launched the arid school of so-called steam shovel
literature (stories that lacked all story quality and were solely and coldly
designed to inform the child all about firemen, policemen, and garbage
collectors) (Pilant 1952, 431).
Progressive education, which had encouraged a holistic vision of educating the
whole child with experiences tied to instruction, was slowly disappearing (Schantz and
Zimmer 2005), as traditionalists following the whole word instruction method and those
proposing a return to phonics methods argued about the virtues of each (Schantz and
Zimmer 2005). Phonics had never actually been abandoned by most reading teachers, but
the research to that effect was essentially ignored during the controversy (Schantz and
Zimmer 2005; see also Rogers 1958; Smith 1955).
Goodman (1964) published research findings detailing his study of mistakes made
during reading and how a reader’s substitutions and corrections demonstrated a
knowledge of language and its use. The study of these “miscues” (Goodman 1964;
Goodman 2000), along with Goodman’s sociolinguistic approach to teaching reading,
were the foundation of the new whole language reading paradigm. Whole language
reading instruction advocates using comprehensible materials to teach children to read in
13

context. Accordingly, Pearson (2000) labeled this process of using literature to teach
reading skills “contextualizing” instruction. The role of the teacher is to facilitate reading
by providing literature-based, individualized instruction in phonics, vocabulary, and
writing, all at the point of need. The method has held up well in reading research metaanalyses (Krashen 2002). Most importantly for outlining the rationale for the research at
hand, whole language instruction has one fundamental precept: making authentic
literature comprehensible for children as they learn to read. Krashen (2002) defends the
paradigm, noting that it “involves instilling a love of literature, problem solving, and
critical thinking” (32).
Sears (2006) and Huck (1977) note that much of reading research in the 1970s
focused on comprehension, text structure, a curriculum of accessible, authentic literature
(Huck 1977). Research had established the benefits of reading authentic children’s
literature aloud to early readers, particularly with regard to boosting vocabulary (Cohen
1968). It followed that whole language literacy instruction prompted a significant shift in
reading instruction beginning in the 1970s, primarily toward using authentic literature or
abridged versions of it in the reading curriculum (Pearson 2000). Most relevant to the
study at hand, this emphasis on authenticity particularly held true for the versions of
folklore in basal readers.
Although basal reading series in the 1970s accommodated the trend (Pearson
2000), a few years later, Huck (1977) made the case for children’s literature as the sole
content for literacy instruction, calling the basal reader “an anachronism reminiscent of
earlier times when we had few books, no school libraries, and thought all children had to
14

have the identical material to learn to read” (364). She argued strongly and specifically
for using folklore in literacy instruction, noting that every culture has its version of the
stock characters and universal themes found in folktales (366). Huck’s ideal reading
program would provide ten books per child in every teacher’s classroom library; an
American Library Association (ALA) standards-compliant school library; classroom sets
of books from a variety of genres; and a four-step literacy program that included: daily
read-alouds, wide reading by all children, in-depth discussion groups, literature-based
reading instruction in the content areas (specifically in social studies), and opportunities
for children to respond to books.
It came as no surprise, then, when Pearson (2000) called the later 20th century a
period when literature “exploded” into the literacy curriculum (19). Basals had always
contained abridged, simplified versions of classic children’s literature, but the whole
language movement meant that basal readers now contained mostly original, intact
novels, long poems, and authentic folktales and fairy tales, rather than stories created by
unknown writers according to a readability formula for a given grade level. Huck’s
(1977) and other scholars’ (Cullinan 1987; Fielding, Wilson, and Anderson 1989)
collective call for using authentic literature in classroom instruction and boosting school
library collections to support it meant that publishers reworked their programs to place
authentic literature at the forefront of basal readers and relegated skill-based lessons to
the basals’ appendices (Sears 2006). In fact, one national newspaper framed the 1988
California reading textbook adoption specifically in terms of the books’ “restored,”
traditional content: “myths, folktales, heroes, values” (Marquand 1988).
15

Whole language teachers had generally agreed from the outset that skills like
decoding would emerge if a child were exposed to enough good literature in the early
years (Pearson 2000; Cullinan 1987; Aaron 1987; Huck 1977). Indeed, Cullinan (1987)
argued early on that contextualized reading instruction produced good readers,
particularly in terms of skills for comprehension: “Good readers use many different word
analysis strategies, while poor readers ‘sound it out.’ If sounding it out fails, poor readers
have no alternatives” (42). Others agreed: “No basal series was ever intended to be a
complete, self-contained reading program” (Aaron 1987, 126). And by the mid-1990s,
basal readers in the United States showed a complete retooling to adapt to the dictates of
that model. Entire novels, plays, and information texts published previously under
separate cover – or some with negligible abridgment – were included in basal readers.
Meaningful, literature-based activities preceded what few phonics lessons were still in the
readers. Even remedial and developmental curricula like Reading Recovery (Clay 1985)
included lessons based on children’s trade books (see also Swartz and Klein 1994).
The movement was somewhat slower to take hold outside the United States.
Interestingly, in Canada, Phillips, Leithead, and Smith (2002) found that an average of
37% of the content of Canadian basal readers had been published previously elsewhere,
implying that most content was still written especially for reading series according to a
readability formula and prescriptive vocabulary list (231). In this study, the suggested
shift toward an authentic curriculum took on a normative tone; the authors opined that
children “deserve to experience the very best literature” (232) while noting that
abridgement often rendered the content of original children’s literature incomprehensible.
16

The use of authentic literature in the reading curriculum had a strong research
base (Dahl and Freppon 1995), so much so that school districts made the change to
literature-based literacy instruction and reading researchers studied the outcomes with the
support of the federal government (Applebee, Langer, and Purves 1990; Johnston et al.
1998). Researchers found for one large sample that 94% of teachers believed that
authentic children’s literature should be the core of the reading program, and their
instructional practices with literature in the classroom correlated with those findings
(Lehman, Freeman, and Allen 1994).
Yet whole language basically collapsed late in the 1990s, caused mostly by the
failure of the paradigm to produce measurable results in a new era of political
accountability (Pearson 2000). In 2001, the federal education legislation labeled No Child
Left Behind (2001) tied federal funding for education to state and local programs based
on “scientifically based research,” which “employs systematic, empirical methods that
draw on observation or experiment” and “involves rigorous data analyses that are
adequate to test the stated hypotheses and justify the general conclusions drawn” (No
Child Left Behind Act of 2001). Pearson (2000) noted that this language was the
equivalent of disavowing reading research based on qualitative methodology – which
included most reports of research into the whole language literacy instructional paradigm.
In fact, the pendulum of reading research had already begun to swing away from whole
language, with some quantitative studies designed solely to refute its claims (Carver and
Leibert 1995).

17

Most important for the research at hand, Pearson (2000) documented that whole
language literacy instruction – “the most significant movement in reading curriculum”
between 1970 and 2000 – co-opted literature-based curricula as a part of its paradigm.
Indeed, children’s literature experts today contend that modern literature-based
instruction is instead a remnant of the whole language movement (Stoodt, Amspaugh,
and Hunt 1996), primarily because literature-based instruction has persisted after the
decline of whole language literacy instruction. School libraries, of course, benefited from
the emphasis on authentic texts during this period of intensive, literature-based literacy
instruction. Using the school library as a source for reading curriculum remains a
corollary of literature-based instruction, and entire manuals were devoted to methods of
motivating students to use literature as a springboard for exploring and developing their
own reading (Aaron 1987). Those manuals are still revised and updated (Wooten and
Cullinan 2015).
Modern models of reading instruction. In the face of diminished support for
whole language literacy instruction and noting the emphasis on teaching skills that are
tested in modern standardized reading assessments, Pressley (1998) used the term
“balanced literacy” to refer to the combination of holistic and skills-based reading
instruction that has become the widely accepted norm (see also Calkins 2014). The term
was embraced by reading researchers and teachers seeking to maintain a focus on
literature-based instruction while also teaching phonics and strategies. Pressley, Roehrig,
and Bogner (2002) defined balanced literacy as skills instruction in the context of holistic
teaching, remarking on the wide-ranging disagreement between the skills and holistic
18

camps over terminology and the amount of time given to each method in successful
classrooms. Scholars who advocate the balanced literacy model insist that overt skills
instruction and whole language’s literature-based teaching are complementary rather than
contradictory (Calkins 2014; Short 1999; Pressley, Roehrig, and Bogner 2002), and that
no single approach has a monopoly on success in the classroom. But, most appropriate to
the research at hand, various scholars have noted with apprehension that classroom time
devoted to literature circles and independent reading of authentic texts has steadily
eroded in the presence of standardized tests that assess children’s skills – and the
necessity for reading programs to teach those tested skills (Short 1999; Pearson 2000,
2004; Calkins 2014).
Literature-based literacy instruction is clearly the historical legacy of a periodic
emphasis on teaching from authentic texts as the curriculum for teaching reading evolved
over two centuries. The philosophical legacy of literature-based instruction remains
strong in popular, current models like balanced literacy and reading workshop (Calkins
and Tolan 2010; Calkins 2014). Even in the face of a periodic rekindling of the
pedagogical clash between phonics and whole language instruction – including one
recent call to increase phonics instruction to half of the school day curriculum (Hirsch
2014) – Wooten and Cullinan (2015) argue that the best teachers will seek to maintain an
emphasis on teaching from authentic texts. Learning to read from compelling stories
written or retold specifically for children propels young readers into critical thinking,
regardless of the philosophical foundation of instruction (Wooten and Cullinan 2015).

19

School libraries support literature-based literacy instruction by providing
literature for curriculum and for children’s free reading. Specifically for this rationale for
research, school library folklore collections support instruction in social studies, language
arts, and character education with stories that teach social expectations and universal
truths. Historical analysis reveals that folklore collections also support literature-based
literacy instruction, a remainder of whole language instruction that persists in modern
reading curricula (Wooten and Cullinan 2015; Calkins and Tolan 2010). It follows that
standards by which teachers’ instruction and children’s progress in literacy are judged
have come to reflect the multi-faceted significance of the folklore collection in school
libraries.
Genre-Based Language Arts Standards
Analysis of specific classifications of the school library collection – including the
folklore collection – supports national and state standards in reading instruction,
including the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) in English language arts (CCSS
2015a) and the English language arts standards of the five states which do not follow the
CCSS (see table 1). More specifically, in the modern context, federal funding for
education is tied to student achievement on standardized assessments that measure
against the CCSS or the corresponding state language arts standards. It follows that
curricula in all states aligns with either the Common Core or separate state standards.
Because the knowledge of literary genres – specifically, the understanding of the genre of
folklore and traditional literature – constitutes one standard in the CCSS beginning in
grade 2 (2015d), and because the CCSS require instruction using folklore (2015c), it
20

follows that school library folklore collections support instruction that aligns with
national and state standards of instruction (Kimmel 2014).
The standard calling for students to recount the central storyline and to determine
the moral or message of a folktale first appears in the CCSS for second grade: “Recount
stories, including fables and folktales from diverse cultures, and determine their central
message, lesson, or moral” (2015d), and appears in increasingly complex iterations for
higher grades: “Recount stories, including fables, folktales, and myths from diverse
cultures; determine the central message, lesson, or moral and explain how it is conveyed
through key details in the text” (CCSS 2015e). In the CCSS ancillary statement of range
of literature to be covered for grades K-5 – termed “Standard 10: Range, Quality, and
Complexity” – the genre of folktales is mentioned as a required genre for reading
instruction (CCSS 2015c). For the states using standards other than the Common Core
State Standards, the genre of folklore is mentioned for instruction beginning in some
states as early as Kindergarten but in other states not at all (see Table 1).

22

Text complexity and genre. The concept of teaching students the characteristics
of folklore as a literary genre is tied closely in the CCSS to the theory of text complexity
(CCSS 2015b). The CCSS and their ancillary materials address the issue repeatedly,
connecting the scaffolding in the standards to an institutionalized effort to raise students
to the level of reading comprehension demanded for college and career readiness by the
time they reach high school graduation (2015f; Fountas and Pinnell 2014). For these
standards, knowledge of the characteristics of a given genre provides a window to
making complex text comprehensible (6). For beginning readers, familiarity with genre
is proprioceptive; in other words, recognizing specific features of a folktale allows
students to view the structure of a text through the lens of genre. Readers then formulate
predictions about plot, theme, and characterization – thereby making a complex text
accessible (Fountas and Pinnell 2014, 1996; McNamara, Graesser, and Louwerse in
press; CCSS 2015b, 2015f). Stoodt, Amspaugh, and Hunt (1996) add that knowledge of
genre expands children’s response to literature by broadening the capacity for
understanding of story grammar, syntax, and word selection (26).
Of course, the more complex a text, the more advanced the knowledge of genre
required for deep reading (Fountas and Pinnell 2014, 6). Other scholars have also noted
that including genre study in early literacy education allows beginning readers to
connect a given text more easily to an author’s purpose for writing it (Beckelhimer
2011, 50). Reynolds (2011) notes that learning the characteristics of a given literary
genre is an important part of learning to read. For a child to be able to anticipate features
of a text because of its genre – or because of its classification in the school library –
23

provides “confidence, stamina, and satisfaction” (79), and affords a literary scaffolding
that allows a child to be able to respond to parody and intertextuality (see also Vardell
2014, 92). Clearly, analyzing and improving folklore collections in school libraries
allows librarians and school districts to build collections that support students’ reading
in the genres mandated by state and local standards (CCSS 2015; see also Table 1).
Standards and Guidelines for School Library Programs
Developing and maintaining the school library folklore collection provides an
avenue to meeting several core standards for school library programs put forth by the
American Association of School Librarians (AASL) (2013). Research shows that
collection analysis results in enhanced access to materials, provided the analysis
concludes with improvements to the collection (Buda and He 2012; Henry, Longstaff,
and Van Kampen 2008). In particular, the AASL guidelines call for programs that
provide “access to materials in all formats, including up-to-date, high-quality, varied
literature” and “resources that reflect current ... needs and anticipate changes in ...
education” (12). In fact, removing barriers to access is embedded in the core beliefs of
the Standards for the 21st Century Learner, the AASL’s flagship publication: “Equitable
access is a key component for education. All children deserve equitable access to books
and reading” (AASL 2013, 19).
The concept of equitable access is, of course, fundamental to the American
Library Association Library Bill of Rights (AASL 2014). The results of a collection
analysis can not only educate administrators, teachers, and other stakeholders about the
holdings and needs of a school library, but a detailed analysis makes a strong case for
24

funding to address deficiencies in the collection in order to bring it into compliance with
standards and provide equitable access (Culbertson and Wilde 2009; Wilde and Level
2011). The data that emerge from a collection analysis like the one at hand, where the
folklore collections from a large sample are assessed using quantitative and qualitative
methods, can point out whether or not the school district’s investment in the collection is
being managed responsibly in terms of compliance with budget and responsively in
terms of alignment with evolving standards (Henry, Longstaff, and Van Kampen 2008;
Johnson 2009; Agee 2005). Improvements to a school library collection that result from
the data analyzed for a collection analysis can improve access to the collection for
children and teachers and help make the case for increased funding for one classification
of the collection that might otherwise languish in the face of misconceptions about its
timelessness.
The rationale for this research confirms that elementary school library folklore
collections are instrumental in communicating social expectations and universal truths to
children through literature. Historical analysis discloses that literacy instruction with
authentic children’s literature at the core of the curriculum remains a major instructional
paradigm. Children’s free reading in literature-based instruction, and in turn their
foundation for reading improvement, depends in part upon access to a school library
collection in which a given genre evolves according to prevailing standards for learners,
for library programs, and for the collection. The evaluation of a particular classification
in the school library can provide data that informs management of the collection in order
to align it to standards of instruction and standards for school library collections, as well
25

as to improve patron access – concepts fundamental to the American Library
Association’s Library Bill of Rights (2014). It follows that research evaluating a genre of
the school library collection using quantitative and qualitative metrics compels a
disposition toward inquiry within the communities served by the school library.
Theoretical Framework
To situate this collection analysis research in social theory is to explain the
underlying principles behind collection development in the school library and to prompt
the research questions that are the foundation for this study. Theory places data in a
context for interpretation (Rappaport 1987).
Fulfilling the Mission of the School Library
When the AASL revised the core mission statement for school library programs
in 2009, the association noticeably outlined the librarian’s charge for collection
development in terms of responsiveness to changes in access, formats, and standards:
The school librarian empowers students to be critical thinkers,
enthusiastic readers, skillful researchers, and ethical users of information
by:
-providing access to materials in all formats, including up-to-date, highquality, varied literature to develop and strengthen a love of reading
-providing students and staff with instruction and resources that reflect
current information needs and anticipate changes in technology and
education” (AASL 2013, 12).
Additionally, in its revised guidelines for school libraries that followed the
publication of Standards for the 21st Century Learner in 2007, the AASL reframed the
26

discourse regarding the role of the school library in relationship to the larger school
community by codifying it: “The school librarian links the school library with the greater
school, library, and education community through collaborative programs, cooperative
collection development, and interlibrary loans” (2013, 37). With specific regard to
developing the library collection, the AASL specifies that “school libraries provide
learners, staff, and families with open access to a varied, non-graded, high-quality
collection of reading materials in multiple formats to reflect academic needs and personal
interests of all members of the learning community” (40).
Clearly, a standards-compliant school library collection responds to changes in
educational standards and reflects current paradigms of instruction. Yet these guidelines
still leave assessment of the needs of the community and evaluation of the adequacy of
the collection to the professional judgment of the school librarian (Enochs 2010a;
Kimmel 2014). Establishing adequacy can be a simple matter of aligning collections to
standards (Texas State Library and Archives Commission 2004), but this research seeks
to develop a broader theoretical framework for collection assessment (Orford 2008;
Penland and Williams 1974; Orford 1992; Enochs 2009, 2010a; Lukenbill 2002;
Immroth and Lukenbill 2007a, 2007b).
Community Psychology Theory
Library and information science as a discipline is no stranger to community
involvement and community needs assessment. Public librarians historically and
routinely have polled communities, invited community input into programming, and
served as information experts on community problem-solving teams (Monroe 1976;
27

McCleer 2013). Likewise, school librarians serve on school wide leadership teams, in
community liaison positions, and as principal points of contact for community and
parent engagement. It follows that for purposes of this research, analyzing and
developing school library collections that respond to the needs of the school community
is hardly possible without a thorough understanding of the needs of a given school
community.
Origins in the discipline of psychology. The discipline of psychology has
addressed a similar situation with regard to understanding how clients receive mental
health care in communities where they live. Community psychology, a fairly new subdiscipline of psychology, has critical roots in the feminist and racial empowerment
movements of the 1960s and 1970s, the War on Poverty in the 1960s, and in the
deinstitutionalization of the mentally ill beginning in the late 1950s (Lukenbill 1995;
Orford 1992, 2008; Penland and Williams 1974; Lukenbill 2002). Community
psychology theory has as its core the ideas that mental health is a product of the
functioning of the individual in community (Orford 1992) and that the role of the
psychologist is to assess the community to see how to improve circumstances for its
members. The chief tenet of community psychology theory is this imperative for
examination of the “person in context” in order to facilitate improvement: “The central
idea of community psychology is that people’s functioning, including their health, can
only be understood by appreciating the social contexts within which they are placed. It is
‘community’ psychology because it emphasizes a level of analysis and intervention
beyond the individual and his or her immediate interpersonal settings” (Orford 2008, xii).
28

Community psychology theory holds that causation in mental health is a function
of institutions in the community – family, geography, work, ethnic and gender
interactions – interacting over time. Human behavior is a result of “how a person uses
and adapts to resources and circumstances available in life” (Lukenbill 2004, 57).
Problems originating within the community often can be prevented or ameliorated by
attending to and building upon the strengths inherent in community institutions
(Lukenbill 1995). The critical origins of the theory suggest that examining the person in
context often reveals disempowerment when it comes to institutions in the community
(Orford 2008).
It follows that, for purposes of research and praxis in community psychology, the
person in context is the irreducible unit of analysis (Bell and Cowie 2002, 122). In fact,
community psychology theory holds that analysis or examination of an individual
without respect to community and context can lead to assessment of blame upon the
victim for a given mental illness when the condition is more likely to be a consequence of
disempowerment by society (Orford 2008). Consideration of the individual out of context
is not only irrelevant and pointless – it actually can be damaging.
Application in library science. For library and information science – and for the
study at hand – the corollary to the examination of the person in context is the evaluation
of the collection in context (Enochs 2009, 2014; Lukenbill 2002). Penland and Williams
(1974) were among the first to apply community psychology theory to information
science, noting that collections and services in the library must be meaningful to the
community served by the library in order to develop germane programming and facilitate
29

relevant change (viii). Later, Lukenbill (1995, 2002) applied community psychology
theory to the work of the school librarian, noting that school librarians follow an
analogous model in developing the collection when they balance needs of young readers,
exigencies of the curriculum, instructional practice of teachers, patron requests, and
dictates of state and national standards (2002, 37). Specifically, school librarians facilitate
an exchange of information in the school community in order to develop the collection in
a relevant way (Penland and Williams 1974; Enochs 2009). As Kimmel (2014) contends,
“developing the collection in isolation would be meaningless” (12). The result is a
responsive, user-centered collection that empowers the community.
Altruistic implications. Penland and Williams (1974) noted that community
psychology theory applied to collection development requires six key factors: sustained
study of the community; ascertaining the needs and interests of patrons; identifying
community resources that might otherwise not be considered assets to the collection;
providing a centralized clearinghouse for community resources; developing relevant
programming; and evaluating goals and objectives (148; see also Lukenbill 2002).
Penland and Williams (1974) agree: “People learn better and faster when the knowledge
sought is closely related to everyday activities in the community” (74). Orford’s (1992,
2008) pioneering books on community psychology theory place it squarely in altruism:
“Power, empowerment and disempowerment are central concepts in community
psychology…. Community psychology aims not just to analyse power and the way it is
exercised, but then to find ways of helping people combat inequality and injustice [italics
in the original]” (2008, xii).
30

In another iteration of community psychology theory, Rappaport (1987)
confirmed that facilitating relevant change as a result of studying the community furthers
critical community development, noting that the empowerment that results from
including the community in decision making is universally considered a positive social
force. This is particularly true when the community is included in implementing changes
that result from data (Orford 1992, 2008; LaFlamme 2007). LaFlamme (2007) contends
that “community needs assessment can be a tool for political empowerment … but only
when the initiatives growing out of the needs assessment are developed in collaboration
with the community” (LaFlamme 2007, 61).
School library collection development research situated in community psychology
theory holds particular promise for teachers by providing them with a voice in selecting
materials that teachers will actually use in instruction (Enochs 2010a, 2014; Orford 2008;
Rappaport 1987). In application, the theory suggests that with adequate community
assessment, collection evaluation and management can result in an empowered school
community, particularly for disadvantaged students who may gain access to a larger,
stronger library collection (Rappaport 1987). Accordingly, improved access mitigates a
barrier to literacy for those students by ensuring the relevance and adequacy of the
collection, which may be their sole source for reading material (Pribesh, Gavigan, and
Dickenson 2011). In the case of the research at hand, this is particularly pertinent for
teachers who use folklore in literacy instruction. Penland and Williams (1974) contend
that, in the end, the theory in practice defines and extends the mission of a library per se:
“In the process the resource center remains no longer just an agency but becomes a
31

method for aiding people to learn continuously and emerges as a group of services
centered around a collection of materials” (85).
Immroth and Lukenbill (2007a, 2007b) note that recent instantiations of
community psychology theory in library and information science research lean toward
case studies which use the theory during professional interventions by community
psychologists seeking to improve communication in a given organization (see also Haas
and Weatherley 1981). Lukenbill (2002) concludes that in the end, community
psychology theory suggests that the way that a school librarian interprets the role of the
library in the school influences the behavior of the school community that it serves.
“Theoretically, to improve the life of the user is to change for the better the functioning
of the library — and vice versa” (Enochs 2009, 6).
Research Questions and Hypotheses
Folklore collections in school libraries provide materials in an appealing genre
proven to engage beginning readers with fetching, heroic characters who win battles,
chase dreams, and conquer evil. Folktales, myths, and legends communicate collective
truths, cultural mores, standards of behavior, and social expectations to young readers
who may actually care more about the outcome of an engrossing mythic heroes’ battle
than they do about its universal meaning. Native American Cinderellas, Chinese
Cinderellas, Korean Cinderellas, and twisted Cinderellas teach children about other
cultures as much as they do about fairy godparents who level the playing field for a
likeable hero. Fortunately, in a climate where standards often dictate curriculum, folklore
collections can provide part of a comprehensive foundation for literature-based reading
32

instruction. Newer, varied, and carefully managed folklore collections extend students’
independent reading in schools where balanced literacy and reading workshop encourage
the use of authentic literature during instruction based on genre-specific standards (CCSS
2015; Texas Administrative Code 2008).
It remains a misconception that some classifications in the school library are so
timeless as to never require deselection (Enochs 2010a, 2010b, 2014). Because folklore
collections contain traditional stories passed down from generation to generation,
librarians may tempted to pass the folklore collection itself from generation to generation.
A collection analysis study – which often entails an exclusively quantitative assessment
of a collection and its use in order to measure its sufficiency against a known standard
(Wiersma 2010; Agee 2005) – can provide a glimpse into user behavior by offering
insight into how users respond to the age and size of the collection (Enochs 2010a, 2014;
Lanning and Turner 2010). But research guided by community psychology theory
indicates that a comprehensive collection assessment should also consider the needs of
the school community – in this case, patrons of the school library. Specifically for the
study at hand, assessing the folklore collections in the elementary school libraries of one
large, urban school district suggests the utility of a quantitative assessment of the
collections, but it also means appraising how the folklore collection supports instruction
by including a qualitative case study of the opinions and needs of teachers who actually
use the collection in the classroom.

33

Research Questions
This study seeks to analyze the folklore collections in the elementary school
libraries of one large, urban school district in order to determine whether these collections
support current pedagogy. Accordingly, three questions guided this research:
1. What are features of elementary school library folklore collections?
2. How is folklore used in elementary school instruction?
3. Do elementary school library folklore collections support
instruction?
Hypotheses
This study addresses these research questions within a convergent, parallel, mixed
methods research design consisting of one quantitative strand and one qualitative strand
of data collection (Creswell and Clark 2011). The quantitative strand utilized a crosssectional, one-time collection of data without an experiment or treatment; the qualitative
phase was a small sample, single observation case study which included in-depth, semistructured interviews with selected faculty at the schools in the school district that served
as the sampling frame. Hypotheses for this research address only the data collected in the
quantitative strand (Creswell 2014); the design presupposed that themes would emerge
from data collected during the parallel, qualitative phase of the study. These hypotheses
indicated the condition of the folklore collections in the elementary libraries of one large,

34

urban school district at the time of data collection, along with possible associations
between variables:
H1: Folklore collections in the sample are smaller than the size recommended by
experts in the field of school library collection development. Morris (2010, 2004) and
Kerby (2006) suggest that school library collections should comprise 5 to 8.84% folklore.
Inadvertent neglect of school folklore collections results in smaller collections than
prescribed.
H2:The average age of folklore collections exceeds state standards for an
acceptable elementary school collection. State standards for elementary school libraries
in Texas call for all classifications of the school library to be less than fifteen years old
(Texas State Library and Archives Commission 2004).
H3. Older folklore collections circulate less than more recently published folklore
collections. This hypothesis suggests a correlation between the age and circulation of the
folklore collections in the sample.
H4. Larger folklore collections circulate more than smaller folklore collections.
This hypothesis suggests a correlation between the size and use of the folklore collections
in the sample.
H5. Age and size of the folklore collections predict their use. This hypothesis
suggests that data may provide insight into how much influence the age and size of a
collection have on its circulation. This hypothesis is grounded in research showing that
age and size can predict a percentage of use for one classification in the school library
(Enochs 2010a).
35

H6. The mean turnover rate for folklore collections in the sample will be less than
1.0. This hypothesis predicts fewer than one circulation per title over the course of a
single school year, which indicates underuse (Lancaster 1993).
H7. The mean relative use factor for folklore collections in the sample will be less
than 1.0. This hypothesis predicts underuse of the folklore collections in relationship to
their percentage of the larger school library collection (Gavigan 2014; Lancaster 1993).
Examining published research detailing the use of folklore in instruction, methods
of school library collection analysis, and the use of community psychology theory to
frame a research design provides the foundation for addressing these research questions
and hypotheses.

CHAPTER II
REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE
This research arose from an academic concern that folktale collections in school
libraries may deteriorate in size, condition, and age over time, which in turn may obviate
a school library’s support of current practice in literature-based reading instruction. Del
Negro (2007) found that the chief reason for including folktales in literacy instruction has
been to connect children to literature while at the same time connecting them to their own
and other cultures. Yet the potential of folktales, myths, legends, and fairy tales goes
beyond their role as a cultural time capsule. For young readers, folklore communicates
behavioral standards, universal truth, and the values that perpetuate and advance society.
Modern standards for language arts instruction include familiarity with folklore as a
genre, primarily for the ability of a folktale’s engaging characters and memorable
storylines to engage new readers and direct their comprehension. Likewise, current
instructional paradigms include folklore in literature-based reading curricula largely for
its appeal to children and for its natural mimesis of plots and motifs that recur in life and
in literature. Familiarity with these themes in recent research facilitates analysis of the
collection with regard to its support of each.
Folklore in Elementary Instruction
The first question addressed by this research asks: How is folklore used in
elementary school instruction? Interrogating standards and the history of literature-based
reading instruction provided an initial glimpse into the requirements for including
37

folklore in instruction, but a review of published research gives an overview of how
teachers integrate folklore into curriculum and praxis and how researchers use folklore in
assessment of instruction. Curriculum for elementary grades evolves according to
published research reports and the directives of state and national standards. Locating
articles detailing the role of folktales in literacy curriculum and instruction is an iterative
process. This selected review of the literature covers research published in English
between 1994 and 2015. Combinations of the terms folktales and folklore with
instruction, reading instruction, literacy instruction, reading, comprehension, pedagogy,
curriculum, and literature based reading instruction retrieved the majority of these
articles from the databases Education Research Complete, Education Source, ERIC,
Academic Search Complete, Library and Information Science Source, JSTOR, ProQuest,
and Library and Information Science Technology Abstracts with Full Text. Restricting
the search to full-text articles with references only and limiting the search terms to title
and subject headings provided additional parameters. This section of the review also
includes selected monographs in the field published between 2000 and 2015.
Underlying Assumptions
Definition. For purposes of this research, folktales and folklore are synonymous
and fall under the heading of traditional literature or folk literature, which also includes
stories labeled fairy tales, myths, legends, and tall tales (Young 2004; Vardell 2014).
Fountas and Pinnell (2012) note that traditional literature comprises stories passed down
in written or oral form throughout history. Traditional literature is an integral part of
world culture, often appearing in many countries with adjustments and variations that
38

reflect specific cultural norms (21). Folklore researchers and children’s literature
specialists agree that characters are usually flat, developing little over the course of the
relatively simple, fast-moving plot of a folktale or fairy tale (Jacobs and Tunnell 2004;
Kaminiski 2000).
Classification. School libraries using the Dewey Decimal System commonly
classify folktales, fairy tales, and anthologies of traditional literature in 398.2, labeled
folklore (Online Computer Library Center 2015), although some classify picture book
versions of folklore in easy fiction; folklore told in verse may be classified in 811, poetry.
For purposes of the research at hand, however, the term folklore refers to folktales,
myths, tall tales, and traditional literature anthologies classified in Dewey 398.2 in the
school library.
Literature-Based Literacy Instruction
Including folklore in the elementary curriculum is an effort to nurture literacy
development in children by providing texts that make sense to them (Stoodt-Hill and
Amspaugh-Corson 2009). Phillips, Leithead, and Smith (2002) contend that literacy
instruction should include authentic literature for five reasons: its “aesthetic, cultural,
educational, pleasurable, and cognitive purposes” (232). Basing reading instruction on
children’s literature means that children learn to read by interacting with text that has
meaning to them and is accessible – whether due to formulaic and repetitious language or
simplified, predictable plotlines (12; 185). Literature-based reading instruction has its
roots in the whole language literacy movement, which advocates teaching children to
read by presenting words, phonemes, and literary knowledge in the context of children’s
39

books and realia rather than basal readers and context-free excerpts written according to a
readability formula (Stoodt-Hill and Amspaugh-Corson 2009; Calkins 2014; Huck 1977;
see also Murray, Munger, and Hiebert 2014).
Accessible text. Accessibility of a text to a young reader is often assessed in terms
of the rapid onset of narrative action. In her landmark textbook, Children and Books
(1949) and its revisions, Arbuthnot and in later editions, Zena Sutherland (1972, 1997),
referred to brevity of introduction and rapid onset of plot as chief reasons that children
respond to folktales in the literacy curriculum (see also Del Negro 1999, 583; Vardell
2014, 82; Gamble and Yates 2011, 108; and Stoodt-Hill and Amspaugh-Corson 2009,
98).
Scaffolded reading. Interestingly, Akpinar and Öztürk (2009), Vardell (2014), and
Jacobs and Tunnell (2004) note that one reason to teach folktales to children is that
modern literature often refers to traditional stories, whether in theme, through retelling, or
overt attribution. Clearly, one reason to teach folktales is to scaffold children’s literacy
learning on a culturally metacognitive level. Arguing for using folklore with teenagers,
Altman (2000) says: “Folk tales are common currency in the today's adult world” (15), a
sentiment echoed by Schulz (2015). Young (2004) calls this the ability of folklore to
“bring a frame of reference” to the literature that children will read throughout their lives
(4).
Cultural relevance. Examining the authenticity of folktales in the elementary
school curriculum is a common theme of research. Stan (1999) concluded from analyzing
curriculum that folktales published for children often presented sanitized versions of the
40

culture of origin, adding that children gained no knowledge of the culture from these
titles. Other researchers note that the absence of cultural relevance in literacy instruction
can actually result in a drop in literacy achievement by children due to lack of
engagement, since texts were presented without familiar settings or resonant themes
(Yektiningtyas-Modouw and Kama 2013). In fact, two recent studies of folktales in the
elementary curriculum in Denmark concluded that folktales require meticulous
examination before being used in the social studies curriculum; Danish folktales often
presented themes that conflicted with children’s progressive notions of Danish culture
(Virtue 2007; Virtue and Vogler 2008). Both studies argued for the importance of
accuracy in literature that normally mirrors a culture’s traditions. Chen (2009) recounted
stereotyped illustrations used in older children’s versions of Chinese folktales like The
Five Chinese Brothers, adding that one of the worst problems with recent children’s
folktale titles is the mixing of Asian cultures in single stories. The issue echoes
considerations of authenticity in cultural representation (Del Negro 2007; Roy 2008).
Hamer (2000) observed that folklore in children’s education is almost universally
taught through the theoretical lens of multicultural education, which has as its goal the
equity of cultural understanding for students from diverse circumstances. She argues that
folklorists, on the other hand, tend to frame folklore instruction as a means of reducing
prejudice and increasing appreciation of other cultures (46). Hamer makes a strong case
that more teachers will teach through folktales if they see the genre as a means to
facilitating multicultural education instead of as fulfilling a curriculum mandate. Keys
(1997) had used this theory earlier in constructing a folktale-based curriculum to teach
41

multiculturalism to fifth graders. Bowman and Carpenter (2004) recount the chief effects
of including folklorists in professional development for teachers; teachers include
techniques of fieldwork in curriculum, thereby teaching higher level thinking when
children learn interview skills, which in turn translate to their interrogations of printed
text.
Authentic retelling. Evaluating authenticity is a particular concern for folktales
used in children’s curriculum because folklore transmits the cultural zeitgeist alongside
historical and sometimes factual information. In fact, in Mehta’s (2013) recent research
using folktales to teach multicultural values to Indian elementary school students, the
author contended that the education of children is bound up in the pedagogy of literature
– which is the prevailing way societies teach children to read and to live. Teaching
pluralism through folktales replaces ignorance with the values necessary for life in a
multicultural society, bringing the “the universal puzzlements of life back into order”
(104). Brooks and McNair (2009) reviewed research specifically covering the
development of African American children’s literature with regard to stereotypes; they
called for more quantitative studies exploring the use of folklore in ethnically diverse
classrooms, an appreciation of the interdisciplinary nature of scholarship about literary
authenticity, and a broader body of evidence concerning reader response and cultural
authenticity in all of children’s literature.
Del Negro (2007) published groundbreaking research into the formative influence
of reviews on the authenticity of cultural representation in children’s folktales. Her study
synthesized the criteria for evaluation used by authors and editors in a century of book
42

reviews published in Booklist, the Bulletin of the Center for Children’s Books, Horn
Book, and School Library Journal. Del Negro traced the evolution of the modern notion
of multiculturalism not only in these book reviews that influence collection development
in school libraries, but also in personal interviews with editors of the journals from which
she drew her sample for study. The idea that the evolution of the modern conception of
authenticity can be traced through reviews – which represent a source of “hegemonic
authority” for librarians charged with developing children’s collections – holds particular
relevance for the study at hand (Del Negro 2007, ii).
Themes in Folklore
Recent research considers the potential of folklore as a foundation for the study of
cultural, literary, and social themes in the lower grades. Zipes (2008) concluded that the
power of folktales in the curriculum results from the spread of the theme of the tale
memetically – where the clear message of the folktale becomes a meme that penetrates
social consciousness. Such memes are more powerful because the message of a folktale is
de facto presented clearly and without debate. Those messages are particularly important
for the early childhood curriculum, where connection with an easily understood message
can increase a child’s perception of self-worth at the same time that it supports reading
comprehension (Slaughter 1995; Ball 2013). In a study that used folktales alongside
persuasive advertisements to teach theme and message, Sakellariou (2007) concluded that
the clear themes in traditional literature made them particularly appropriate for genre
study.

43

Eliciting themes. Akpinar and Öztürk (2009) maintained that an instructional unit
requiring students who were learning English as a second language in Turkish classrooms
to compare the themes of various folktales in English resulted in increased
comprehension and literacy skills. In their qualitative analysis, the authors concluded that
the lack of ambiguity in thematic content made for stories that appealed to children’s
sense of justice while remaining “informative and comforting” (70). Folklorist Judy
Sierra (2006) comments that children’s folktales used in the curriculum can capitalize on
the repetition that is characteristic of the genre to allow the reteller to appeal to children’s
wacky sense of humor, thereby eliciting an understanding of compelling themes while
recounting cultural norms. Sierra adds that some themes in folktales are understood by
other cultures and some are not.
Smith (1994), summarizing the state of folktales in the curriculum, noted that
student familiarity with genres begins with immersing them in reading that genre. He
added that folktales have universal themes which student can deduce once they have read
enough of them to have a basis for comparison. Bader (2010), in her seminal article
tracing the publishing history of children’s folktales, notes that the clear nature of a
folktale’s message can often be intensely emotional for children, particularly in
traditional fables like The Lion and the Mouse.
Linking themes. Two researchers (Mitakidou and Manna 2002), recounting their
efforts to publish a folktale for children, note that the effort was motivated mostly by the
desire to link children’s experiences with literature and their literacy development when it
came to reading for the purpose of understanding a universal theme. Palmer, Sun, and
44

Leclere (2012) conclude from teaching Yeh-shen, the Chinese variant of Cinderella, that
folktales usually have two levels of meaning: an overt theme easily discerned by the
student, and the cultural meaning, which conveys information about the mores and
society of another culture. The authors found that discerning the two layers of meaning
was useful in scaffolding prior knowledge of Cinderella stories in order to find common
themes. In regard to visual literacy, Lantz (2005) offered explicit lessons for teachers
using picture book versions of folktale to teach theme and story structure.
Analyzing themes. The recent use of folktales in a counseling curriculum in a
landmark study by Ramirez et al. (2009) established that studying the universal themes of
folktales and identification of stories unique to students’ home cultures could alleviate
anxiety and increase reading comprehension for children experiencing cultural alienation
in urban schools. The authors used a quasi-experimental design to assess the anxiety
levels of Puerto Rican children in control and intervention groups, using a folktale-based
curriculum called cuento therapy. Interestingly, the researchers practice in the field of
school psychology.
Children’s folklorist and scholar Margaret Read MacDonald (1997, 2008) argues
for school librarians and teachers to use folklorists’ motif indices to locate children’s
folktales for use in the curriculum, noting that studying more than one folktale variant of
the same story may reach students who need reinforcement of the theme or plot for better
understanding (see also Goldberg 2010). Other researchers have refined the pedagogy of
folktales by linking them to cross-curricular understanding of cultures and societies while
at the same time using folktales to teach literacy skills.
45

Folktales as Teaching Tools
Pantaleo (2002) used survey research to discover which teachers in Canada used
children’s literature in instruction, finding that more than one-half of teachers reported
frequent or extensive use of folklore in instruction. In addition, primary grade teachers
used folk tales much more often than teachers in the upper grades.
Teaching social studies. Several curriculum initiatives recounted in the literature
focus on the use of variants of the Cinderella story to teach pluralism and literacy skills in
a multicultural student population (Alexander and Sanez 2006; Alexander and Grigsby
2003). The authors found that contrasting the differences between the variants of the
story facilitated comparison of cultures, which in turn allowed students to compare the
many cultures of the schools’ students. They concluded that focusing on diversity in
literature increased the transfer of that focus to a personal, social context. Geier (2009)
and Cassel (2009) used folktales to teach geography; Geier (2009) noted that students’
time on task and respect for diversity increased when the folktales originated from their
home countries (see also Ramirez et al. 2009; Carger 1998). Black, Wright, and Erickson
(2001) argued for the affective value of folktales to teach and preserve the beliefs, values,
and thoughts of other cultures. Akpinar and Öztürk (2009) concluded that the most
singular reason for teaching folktales is multiculturalism – exposure to a culture's unique
beliefs, lifestyles, and history. The lone voices of dissent, Brophy and Alleman (2002)
warn that using folklore in an interdisciplinary social studies curriculum may be likely to
reinforce misconceptions and stereotypes in the early grades.

46

Teaching reading. Smith-Johnson (1997) adds that finding the correct reading
level for folktales used in curriculum can be exceptionally difficult, necessitating
scaffolding of vocabulary for success. One particular challenge was teaching vocabulary
without giving away the ending of the story. Liang, Peterson, and Graves (2005) used
folktales in a qualitative study of approaches to fostering children’s reading
comprehension. In this mixed methods study, one teacher used a reader-response
approach to teaching a folktale and another used a scaffolded approach. The groups
performed equally well on writing assessments following the intervention but the
scaffolded group performed better on objective tests of comprehension and vocabulary.
Wasta, Scott, and Marchand-Martella (1999) noted that scaffolding improved
differentiation in their lessons that used folktales for integrated social studies and literacy
instruction.
Rickford (2001) used a mixed-methods research design to assess changes in
reading comprehension in a diverse class of fifth grade students who read African
American folklore. She found that students’ comprehension improved when they were
assessed with higher-order questions over longer texts. Jordan and Santori (2015)
analyzed third graders’ spoken response to folktales and the potential for retelling to
prompt alignment with national standards for oral language. Gandy (2007) found that
fourth graders’ comprehension of Japanese folktales was significantly altered when the
structure of the story lacked a central problem or conflict, likely because children had
been taught to spot the traditional, sequential plotlines of Eurocentric folktales.

47

Interestingly, Zhang (2014) noted that folktales rarely required children to think
critically, finding that quality to be a shortcoming in the genre.
Teaching writing. Kamberelis and Bovino (1999) contended that folktales are one
of the most important genres for literacy instruction because of the influence instruction
had on students’ writing. The clear beginning, middle, and end of folktales, coupled with
predictability and repetition has a measurable effect on students’ paragraph construction.
Weih (2003, 2005) added that the more familiar a student is with a genre, the more likely
features of that genre are to influence the student’s writing. Smith (1994) argued within
the context of schema theory that teaching folktales as a genre allowed for mimesis, or
students transferring the features of folktale text to their own work. Palmer, Sun, and
Leclere (2012) noticed that Yeh-Shen, the Chinese variant of Cinderella, was particularly
appropriate for teaching figurative language to children – especially metaphor and
symbolism. Schulz (2015) noted the obvious utility of folktale variants for teaching
children to compare and contrast elements of a story.
Teaching other curricula. Wilcox and Sterling (2006) used folktales and tall tales
to teach science units about weather. They concluded that the chief concern was avoiding
students’ misconceptions of fact when introducing tales that included exaggeration. Ellis
(2005) used the repetition and conventions of African folktales to introduce the origins of
African drumming in the elementary school music curriculum. Clarkson (2006) pointed
out that rhythm and rhyme in folktales for the very young could be used to teach metric
scansion and mathematical patterns in the early childhood curriculum. Yang (2015)
included folktales in an elementary curriculum for teaching environmental aesthetics and
48

appreciation. Lott et al. (2003) used The Gingerbread Man to teach students engineering
principles when the class constructed a trap to catch the main character. Iddings (2009)
used folktales in a parent engagement program for new immigrants.
Cartledge et al. (2001) recommended the use of folktales in a behavior
intervention for a class of gifted fourth and fifth graders in an urban school. The
curriculum included Cartledge and Kleefield’s (1994) text Working Together: Building
Children’s Social Skills Through Folk Literature. Children listened to recordings of folk
tales while following along with a printed copy. Guided practice included role-playing
and constructing relevant skills posters (Cartledge et al. 2001, 249).
Folktales and Reading Comprehension
Kaminiski’s (2000) experience teaching comprehension strategies using variants
of the Cinderella folktale indicated that the low text complexity of a folktale allows for
increased reading comprehension. Flat characterizations, progressive, predictable
plotlines, and explicit themes centering around the concept of absolute justice – all
resulting from the genre’s origin in the oral tradition – make the genre ideal for teaching
comprehension skills. Smith-Johnson (1997) adds that the flat characters, repetition, and
simple plotlines are particularly appropriate for very young students learning in their
second language. Konkina et al. (2015) used Russian folklore to aid in linguistic
assimilation of Tajik immigrant children in Russia. Payne (1998) and Goh (1996)
evaluated folktales for second language instruction. Wood (2005) simplified the plots of
easy children’s folktales to help struggling readers, creating progressively difficult
versions to teach vocabulary and prediction skills. Sakellariou (2007) remarks on the
49

value of repetition in folktales to student comprehension. Foster, Theiss, and BuchananButterfield (2008) note that this holds true in particular for the pourquoi tale, which
normally includes a call to action at the beginning that is repeated at the end, onedimensional characters with singularly identifying characteristics, straightforward action,
a problem and a solution, and a just ending.
Clearly, knowledge of the genre can aid in prediction and understanding of the
plot of the story. In two studies, Jenkins et al. (2003a, 2003b) used folktales in the
Comprehensive Reading Assessment Battery to assess children’s reading comprehension
with quantitative measures. One project focused on students reading at grade level and
one on a population with identified reading disabilities. The researchers used three
versions of the folktale – one in context, one with words presented as a list, and one
without punctuation – to assess comprehension and fluency (see also Simmons et al.
1995). In similar fashion, Lorch et al. (2004) used folktale recall to examine the
effectiveness of studying as an intervention for students with attention deficit disorder.
Folktales for Moral Education
Frieman and Kirmani (1997) used folktales in an early childhood curriculum with
the explicit purpose of teaching the moral virtue of kindness. Akpinar and Öztürk (2009)
noted that the tale must be developmentally appropriate or the message of the folktale
will be lost in any curriculum. The rather advanced developmental themes in translations
of Grimms’ Fairy Tales would seem to reinforce this conclusion (Tatar 2003).
Morality in trickster tales. Two studies assess the moral implications of teaching
trickster tales. Desai (2001) concluded that morality can be confusing in a folktale that
50

includes the appearance of a trickster. For example, soldiers in folktales often appear as
“fighting fools and braggarts” (93) in more than one retelling for children, including
Stone Soup. Soldiers are rarely involved in the act of war in folktales – they appear either
in acts of preparation or self-survival afterward. The moral ambiguity resulting from the
act of the trickster can also reflect a cultural subtext, a characteristic of folktales that
should be mentioned in curriculum (Darling 1996). Teaching the trickster tale in the
cultural context should include an exploration of the culture and the reasons that
folklorists keep telling the tale. Why would a given culture applaud moral ambiguity?
Morality and authenticity. Virtue (2007) and Virtue and Vogler (2008) plead for
teachers’ careful attention to a folktale used in the curriculum in order to assess its
accuracy of cultural and moral representation. Weih (2005) notes that the moral
education resulting from having students write their own folktales sometimes comes from
the clarity of thought about cultural issues that underlies the effort. Other research notes
that retelling or authoring folktales can serve as a measure of understanding.
Retelling as Assessment
Retelling and English language learners. Egenberger (1996) noted that asking
students to retell folktales in a bilingual format could reinforce pride in a home language
while engendering academic language and sequencing skills in students learning English.
Hoelker (2010) added that summary skills can be assessed through retelling by English
language learners, particularly with regard to oral language development.
Retelling in early childhood. Slaughter (1995) used folktales in the early literacy
curriculum as a means to promote multiculturalism, including retelling in plain and
51

predictable language as a means of reinforcing values and assessing literacy skills learned
from the tales presented in the unit. Ball (2013) used props to facilitate retelling
children’s folktales, noting that assessing and teaching skills in early literacy is
sometimes about finding other ways to tell stories. Ball adds that this concept manifests
most plainly when the teacher engages in more than one instructional modality for a
given story (2013).
Retelling as alternative assessment. Gifford (2002) contended that retelling was a
sufficient summative assessment of understanding of the essential elements of a folktale,
although she argues that the assessment is for comprehension only. Weih (2005) noted
that reading and then writing a folktale encouraged students to integrate elements of the
tale into their writing while they acquired the language and structure of narrative
discourse. Schulz (2015) implemented digital retelling as formative assessment, assigning
tales to small groups that used Google apps to collaborate on a new, written version of
the story. In the end, the act of writing or retelling a folktale links culture to writing and
oral language in a task-oriented approach to folktales that has been validated by recent
research (Mehta 2013).
Research indicates that folklore offers a cornerstone to the foundation provided by
literature-based reading instruction, where children learn to read by actually reading
authentic literature that make sense to them given the context in which they live.
Folktales provide cultural literacy, recounting the dominant stories, social norms,
traditions, thoughts, and beliefs of diverse cultures. Because modern literature often
refers directly or indirectly to traditional literature, folktales provide knowledge of those
52

stories to children who may not otherwise gain it. On a larger level, folktales are a
significant way of presenting values to children, no matter the culture (Mehta 2013; Del
Negro 2007).
This review of the literature addressed the question: How is folklore used in
elementary school instruction? in order to provide a foundation for the research at hand.
Published reports of research and selected monographs indicate that folktales' simple
plots, direct messages, singular characters, and repetitive elements support early literacy
instruction and reading comprehension curriculum for all students, including very young
children and English language learners. When it comes to teaching theme and imparting
moral messages, folktales are both indirectly and openly didactic. Most have an overt
theme as well as a message about the culture of the story’s origin. Through folktales’
stock characters like the trickster, children can discover other cultures' attitudes toward
morals, cleverness, and tradition. Folktales are particularly important in the curriculum
for their influence on students' writing, offering an accessible source of figurative
language, metaphor, symbolism, traditional plot structure which students can integrate
into their own compositions.
Collection Evaluation in School Libraries
This review of the literature concerning folklore pedagogy demonstrates that K-12
instructional standards and curricula calling for genre-based instruction compel the
development of a school library collection that holds recent folklore titles with wideranging reading levels, lengths, and cultures. Accordingly, the second question addressed
by this research asks: What are features of elementary school library folklore collections?
53

in an effort to determine whether collections fit those criteria and are adequate to support
curriculum and standards. Determining certain facts about library folklore collections can
allow school librarians to evaluate the potential of a collection to meet the needs of
teachers, students, and staff.
Approaches to Collection Evaluation
In general, quantitative assessment of library collections is categorized as
collection-centered assessment in the research literature and includes age and size of the
collection (Lancaster 1982; Agee 2005; Wiersma 2010; Lumande and Ojedokun 2005)
alongside interpretive and inferential metrics. On the other hand, qualitative methods of
assessing the school collection are regarded as user-centered and include surveys of user
satisfaction, interviews with patrons, and assessment of holdings against core reading
lists like Wilson’s Children’s Catalog (Wiersma 2010; Agee 2005; Johnson 2009).
Recent research places circulation analysis as a separate method of collection analysis.
Kohn (2013) puts the distinction succinctly: “These three methods measure respectively
whether a library has ‘enough’ books, the ‘right’ books, or books that are being used”
(87).
Quantitative School Library Assessment
Assessing the collection for age and size and judging the adequacy of the
collection by circulation are time-tested, cost-effective ways to evaluate it (Liu 2015;
Agee 2005; Enochs 2014). Yet circulation statistics are rarely used in school library
collection analysis beyond reciting their face value on collection maps (Enochs 2014;
Intner 2003; Gavigan 2014). Recent research argues strongly for expanding the
54

evaluation of school library collections using advanced, inferential metrics which can
substantiate the need for additional funding and demonstrate the library’s support for the
school curriculum (Enochs 2014, 2010a; Lanning and Turner 2010; Gavigan 2014).
However, in a comprehensive literature and methodology review of the school library
collection analysis literature published between 2000 and 2011, Enochs (2014) reported
that seventy-five percent of those articles comprised how-to essays – without the use of
advanced descriptive or inferential statistics.
In fact, the groundwork for this collection analysis study is Enochs’s (2014)
comprehensive review of school library collection analysis research published between
2000 and 2011. Enochs’s (2014) literature and methodology review revealed that the bulk
of the school library collection analysis literature recounts how librarians evaluated the
collection using Loertscher’s (1986) collection mapping method, which results in a visual
representation of the collection and its alignment to the curriculum (Loertscher 1986; Ho
and Loertscher 1985). The collection map highlights deficiencies and strengths in the
collection by showing them in a graphic format. Although collection mapping is
supported by thirty years of field testing in school libraries, and while the methodology
has evolved somewhat to account for the integration of electronic resources (Loertscher
and Wimberly 2009; Loertscher 1996), it does not make use of inferential statistics that
have the potential to inform acquisitions with precision and predict how a given
collection may be used (Enochs 2014; Greiner and Cooper 2007). On the other hand,
collection mapping may help librarians assess the multiculturalism of the collection, and

55

the map itself serves as a public relations tool to inform stakeholders of the present
condition of the collection.
Enochs’s (2014, 2010a) and other reports (McGriff, Harvey, and Preddy 2004;
Hart 2003; Gavigan 2014; Franklin and Stephens 2009; MacDonell 2005; Greiner and
Cooper 2007; Fussler and Simon 1969) reveal that advanced statistical analysis provides
critical evidence of weakness in the collection, offers information about underuse,
predicts which acquisitions may see the most use, and provides a way to compare a
library collection with that of another school or those of another school district. Hart
(2003) used basic statistical methods and charts to correlate age and use. However, only
five recent reports of school library research utilized quantitative methods to evaluate
school library collections (Farmer, Safer, and Leack 2015; Gavigan 2014; Lafferty 2014;
Enochs 2010a; Lanning and Turner 2010), with just three of those studies published in
the three years since Enochs’s (2014) literature and methods review.
Enochs (2010a) analyzed the poetry collection in the elementary school libraries
of one large, urban school district for age, size, and use, finding that inferential statistics
could predict up to one-third of circulation for a given Dewey classification. Lanning and
Turner (2010) analyzed circulation statistics to highlight the disparities in use of print and
electronic resources. As suggested by Enochs (2010a), Gavigan (2014) applied a timetested metric called the relative use factor (Bonn 1974) to analyze circulation of graphic
novels in relationship to the size of the collection in a group of middle school libraries.
Findings spotlighted the disparity between the high circulation of graphic novels relative
to the genre’s percentage of the collection. Interestingly, the qualitative section of
56

Gavigan’s (2014) mixed-methods case study included interviews with school librarians
regarding classroom use of the graphic novel collections and marketing of the genre in
libraries. Gavigan (2014) concluded that the extraordinary popularity of the genre has
potential for instructional application, provided school librarians make use of circulation
statistics to justify budgets and acquisitions (109). Lafferty (2014) analyzed circulation in
six high schools in order to determine patterns of use for multicultural fiction. Farmer,
Safer, and Leack (2015) used inferential statistics to produce a model of best fit that
would predict which California school libraries had the potential to meet the state’s new
standards for school libraries, but the authors were examining the collections in aggregate
from a self-selecting sample.
Specific metrics in the literature. In her research and review of the literature,
Enochs (2014, 2010a) suggests that school library collection analysis, which consists
mostly of mapping the collection to the curriculum, could benefit from applying specific
inferential and calculated metrics routinely used in the academic collection analysis
literature, particularly when it comes to analyzing a given classification to determine its
support for curriculum and instruction. Ochola (2002) calls these measures of the
“usefulness of a library’s collection” (2) because they usually assess circulation in
relationship to the size of the collection. Two recent school library collection analyses use
these metrics or their variations. Enochs (2010a) used multiple regression analysis to
determine that the age and size of school library poetry collections predict more than 30%
of the poetry collection’s use. The findings held particular interest given that school
librarians usually have control over those two aspects of the collection. Gavigan’s (2014)
57

work utilizes the relative use factor to measure circulation against collection size of one
genre in six school libraries.
Bonn (1974) was the first to explain the relative use factor in a review of
collection assessment methods. Calling it the “use factor,” Bonn defined the metric as the
ratio of use to holdings in a specific Library of Congress (LOC) subject class, with use
and holdings expressed as a percentages of their respective totals. He commented on the
versatility of the measurement, given that it can be calculated for as narrow a
classification of the collection as desired. Ochola (2002) used an extension of the use
factor in his 2003 collection analysis research; Mills’s (1982) “percent of expected use”
(PEU) multiplies the use factor by 100 to express it as a percent – with the underlying
assumption that the expected use of a given subject would always be one hundred
percent. In Mills’s (1982) evaluation of the film collection at Illinois University, he used
a PEU of 125 to indicate overuse, with a PEU of 75 or lower indicating underuse. Ochola
(2002) labeled overuse as a PEU of greater than 100, and underuse as a PEU of less than
100. Plainly, the metric has precise application for decisions regarding purchasing and
deselection.
Greiner (2005) used a variant of the relative use factor to determine the
relationship of circulation to shelving space in a public library and offer suggestions for
space reallocation. Kim, Lee, and Park (2009) attempted to use Hirsch’s h index to create
a new evaluation metric that combined citation with circulation to evaluate the collection,
citing the established importance of the relative use factor in collection assessment.

58

Other articles report the results of collection evaluation that benefited from
analyzing collection turnover rate, which is defined as circulation divided by the number
of items owned (Greiner and Cooper 2007). The figure represents average use per item if
use were spread evenly across the collection (Enochs 2009) and has been found to be a
better predictor of overall use than linear regression (Greiner and Cooper 2007, 83). In
the recent literature, Kohn (2013) established a small academic library’s support for the
curriculum by analyzing the turnover rate of a selection of monographs that
corresponded to the curriculum for upper-level classes taught at the university. Kohn
(2013) also developed an analog of the turnover rate metric which analyzed circulation of
unique items – meaning use was determined by a single circulation of a given title for
some analyses, rather than potentially multiple circulations of the same title. Enochs
(2014) added that turnover rate is used frequently in the research to analyze transactions
per item by subject. This calculates transactions per subject or classification divided by
the number of items circulated by subject (Knievel, Wicht, and Connaway 2004; Knievel,
Wicht, and Connaway 2006). Enochs (2014) noted that this metric can inform budget
allocations and assess circulation of emphasis collections. Hibner and Kelly’s (2013)
recent monograph on collection evaluation adds that turnover rate is most telling when
the evaluation includes a carefully culled and crafted figure in the denominator –
meaning a close portrayal of items that are actually allowed into circulation in the first
place.
Other studies utilize the metric for comparison of use between segments of the
collection. Koizumi (2010) studied the differences in circulation patterns of academic
59

collections selected by faculty and contrasted them with those of collections selected by
librarians by comparing turnover rates. Yoon, Oh, and Kim (2008) used turnover rate to
advance a proposal for hub-based, collaborative collection repositories for space-starved
public libraries in Korea. In one relevant study from the public library literature, Jones
(2007) used turnover rate as a starting point for analyzing public library collections in
New South Wales. Jones found that the lower the age of the collection, the higher the
turnover rate, concluding that a decline in funding should not deter weeding of older
materials.
Cumulative models of collection evaluation. The literature on school library
collection analysis consists primarily of accounts of mapping the collection to the
curriculum (Enochs 2014). While academic librarians tend to study their collections from
a varied, intentional quantitative stance, they consider quantitative evaluation of single
classifications of the library to be useful mainly when provided in the context of a larger,
more varied collection evaluation or to determine support for an isolated part of the
curriculum (Kelly 2014). Authors note that determining whether the collection supports a
given instructional initiative may depend on more than a simple analysis of a Library of
Congress call number. Kelly (2014), Duncan and O’Gara (2015), and Bodi and MaierO’Shea (2005) call for a more holistic approach to collection analysis that takes into
account collection statistics, use, student opinion, and the collection’s support for student
learning outcomes as elucidated through faculty interviews. Pan, Ferrer-Vinent, and
Bruehl (2014) echoed the approach in assessing collections in terms of their value to

60

bibliographic instruction embedded in college courses; Wexelbaum and Kille (2012)
examined the relationship of collections to student achievement.
Early in the shift from print to electronic resources, Oke and Tyrell (1998) called
this model the “cumulative approach” to collection management. The idea is to divide a
collection into manageable sections for analysis with a repertoire of tools in order to
determine its strength of support for instruction. Borin and Yi (2008, 2011) expand the
idea of cumulative collection analysis in academic libraries to include flexible
methodologies, including an adaptable, curriculum-appropriate ratio of print to electronic
resources. In general, research that uses a cumulative approach to collection analysis
proposes mixed-methods study that results in a thorough, wide-ranging profile of the
collection’s strengths and weaknesses (Kelly 2014; Borin and Yi 2008, 2011; Oke and
Tyrell 1998). Kelly (2014) and Knievel, Wicht, and Connaway (2006) found that the
cumulative method of collection assessment is predicated on the idea that multiple
perspectives and multiple sources of data provide the best collection evaluation. For a
collection analysis situated in community psychology theory, where the collection is
considered in the context of its use by a given community, Knievel, Wicht, and
Connaway’s (2006) findings have certain resonance.
This review of the literature reveals that school librarians and district library
directors most often assess their collections by mapping them to the curriculum according
to Loertcher’s collection mapping model (Enochs 2014). This review pinpoints
conspicuous gaps in research regarding other approaches to analyzing school library
collections. Few reports of research concerning school library collections make use of
61

quantitative metrics despite their informative potential, making it impossible to
implement a modern, holistic model of collection evaluation. However, recent research
indicates that cumulative collection assessment has at its core the notion of flexible
metrics designed to take into consideration user preference, alignment to standards, and
the use of materials in instruction.
Determining the Collection’s Support for Instruction
The first section of this review considers how researchers report the use of
folklore in instruction; the second section considers how features of elementary school
library folklore collections may be analyzed with quantitative measures. This review of
the literature also addresses a third question for research: Do elementary school library
folklore collections support instruction? Clearly, a quantitative analysis of collections can
determine whether a folklore collection meets a given set of standards or if it can provide
resources that are aligned to curriculum and instruction. But the third research question
suggests that the study at hand also should address teachers’ perceptions of the collection.
Operationalizing the variable support for instruction obliges a synthesis of information,
one most often attempted in research using a combination of qualitative and quantitative
approaches to study. In addition, the theoretical framework for this research, community
psychology theory, suggests that an analysis of the sufficiency of the collection would be
inadequate unless situated in the expressed instructional needs of the faculty (Lukenbill
2004).

62

Interviews in the School Library Collection Assessment Literature
Interviews with teachers can inform collection development and larger issues in
the practice of school librarianship while maintaining alignment between library services,
collections, and user needs (Gibbons 2013). Yet published research within the date
parameters of this review reveal few studies that apply interview methodology designed
specifically for the study of school library collections. In the most direct analogue to the
research at hand, Garry (2015) used mixed methods for assessment of the lesbian, gay,
bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) literature collections in twenty high schools.
The sequential research design included quantitative list checking, a participant
demographic study, and one-on-one interviews with participants in order to address gaps
in the resulting data. Librarians at the schools where the collections were a part of the
sample for the quantitative phase comprised the sample for the interview phase of the
project. Interviews operationalized a variable in a research question addressing librarian
self-censorship of LGBTQ literature in these collections (Garry 2015). Using similar
techniques, Colom (2010) assessed the juvenile science collections in three public
libraries and followed the quantitative phase of data collection with librarian interviews
to address other variables. In both studies, the researcher interviewed librarians but not
faculty. In academic collection analysis, DeVries, Kelly, and Storm (2010)
complemented a citation analysis and survey research with personal interviews to
discover if a university library satisfied the research needs of its faculty, but the study did
not address the faculty’s specific instructional needs, nor did it include a quantitative
analysis of the monograph collection in the library. Most relevant to the study at hand,
63

Williams (2011) wrote a scholarly essay on collection development for university
librarians in charge of liaison work with schools of education. Williams (2011) specified
the critical importance of interviewing university faculty on how they use children’s
literature in their education courses for pre-service teachers in order to build a relevant
university children’s collection. The essay offered a sample set of questions for a faculty
interview designed to elicit information about student expectations, curriculum
requirements, and preferred format of selections for a curriculum materials center.
Collins and Doll (2012) noted that K-12 instruction almost always consists of
more than is specified in a set of standards. In examining school library resource
provision, they used faculty interviews as a supplement to survey research, embedding
interview responses in the survey data in order to find themes that could inform collection
development. Perrault (2007) conducted faculty interviews to assess teachers’ level of
competence in online information searching for science instructional resources, noting
that interviews offered the opportunity to probe and clarify responses to survey data.
While she did not interview classroom teachers, Gavigan (2014) did interview middle
school librarians about developing and using graphic novel collections in classroom
instruction; the study also included a quantitative analysis of the graphic novel collections
in six schools. Hibbard and Franklin (2015) used faculty, parent, student, and
administrator interviews to study the implementation of a library program in an online
Ohio elementary school during its first year, but the research did not include quantitative
analysis of a collection.

64

Often, researchers use interview methods to examine issues tangential to
developing the collection but important to community relations in the school library.
Sandford (2013) conducted in-depth interviews for a case-study approach to determine
how four school librarians constructed their professional identities during their first year
on the job. Copeland (2012) examined how school librarians used parent volunteers in the
library by using semi-structured interviews of volunteers and librarians in her case study.
Shoham and Shemer-Shalman (2008) used in-depth interviews with librarians to examine
their school library websites.
Interestingly, Farmer (2001) calls interviewing student patrons about their needs a
best practice for collection development, and the literature suggests that in-depth, semistructured interviews have great potential to inform a user-centered collection analysis.
Yet this review exposes a gap in research that would include an analysis of a single
classification in the school library from the perspective of teachers as library patrons.
Community Psychology Theory in Library and Information Science Research
A theoretical framework for research guides inquiry by providing context for data
(Rappaport 1987). The research at hand addresses two related conditions and then
attempts to address a question of synthesis:
1. How is folklore used in elementary school instruction?
2. What are features of elementary school library folklore collections?
3. Do elementary school library folklore collections support
instruction?

65

Synthesizing data from a study designed to address the first two questions calls
for a conceptual framework that provides for inference based on data from more than one
source in the community. At its heart, this collection analysis study is designed to provide
results that allow librarians to develop collections with the best interests of the school
community in mind while maintaining fidelity to standards. This study uses community
psychology theory to provide context to those results. Merging psychological science, a
community-level perspective on social issues, and a social justice orientation, community
psychologists examine clients in the context of the community (Miller 2015).
Community psychology theory holds that individual well-being is a product of the
functioning of community forces over time (Orford 2008). The theoretical unit of
analysis in community psychology theory is the person in the context of the community.
Applied to library and information science, community psychology theory proposes that
the unit of analysis for a school library collection is the collection in context of the school
community. The school librarian analyzes and develops the collection with careful
attention to its use, serving as an agent for exchange of information about needs, use,
praxis, and standards in order to facilitate patron access to improved resources and
programming (Lukenbill 2002; Penland and Williams 1974). Constructive change leads
to empowerment when implementation fits the needs of the community (Rappaport
1987).
Application in Library and Information Science Research
The theory sees frequent use in psychology research, but more sporadic use in
library and information science literature. Most recently, information scientists Petrič and
66

Petrovčič (2014) used the empowerment construct of community psychology theory to
explore differing models of individual and collective empowerment that develop in
online communities. Siddiquee (2006) used community psychology theory to design a
study that investigated the impact of the Internet on human well-being.
In a particularly relevant essay, Crew (1997) situated community psychology
theory alongside feminist theory in determining a theoretical framework for research in
youth services. She noted alignment of the two theories with their shared, pluralistic
approach, similar methodologies, and sensitivity to the values of the community,
remarking that community psychology and feminist theory both hold in regard the ethics
of care, empowerment, and responsibility in fostering research. One other related report
of educational research used community psychology theory to facilitate development of a
parent education curriculum for low-income Mexican immigrant parents of elementary
school children (Hernandez 1997).
Application in School Library Research
The chief use of community psychology theory as a framework for school library
research has been to study and conceptualize the role of the library in the larger school
community. The principal proponents of the theory apply it broadly in research that
consistently situates the library as an agent for change. For example, Lukenbill (1995)
used community psychology theory to provide a rationale for distributing HIV/AIDS
information to youth, exploring the capacity of the school librarian to facilitate adolescent
and school community access to current, relevant health information. He remarked that
the school community must perceive the librarian as a change agent in order for
67

informed, effective progress to take place (1995). In a Delphi study, Lukenbill and
Immroth (2007, 2009) applied community psychology theory to discovering
characteristics of health information provision in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas.
Immroth and Lukenbill (2007a, 2007b) have used community psychology theory
in evaluating the potential of social marketing to guide librarian/teacher collaboration.
Their findings indicated that the theory particularly suited their qualitative research
design; participants took part because they saw collaboration as a positive intervention
designed to improve the school community. Lukenbill applied community psychology
theory in conceptualizing a community resource center in school libraries (2004) and in
suggesting a theoretical framework for school library collection development (2002).
Enochs (2009) used community psychology theory as a framework for studying
characteristics of poetry collections in the elementary school libraries of one large, urban
school district. In this study and others (2010a, 2014), she argued for school collection
evaluation research that includes additional intensive input from patrons in order to
develop a collection that responds comprehensively to the needs of a given school
community.
Collectively, these reports of research illustrate the utility of community
psychology theory for framing school library collection analysis, particularly for research
designs using mixed methods. The theory proposes that librarians guide decisions by
gathering information from a broad sample of stakeholders using a variety of methods
(Lukenbill 1995, 2002); in fact, the theory holds that decisions that do not regard the
collection in the context of the community may actually be detrimental, or at the
68

minimum, irrelevant (Orford 2008). The research at hand proposes to expand the use of
community psychology theory in the library and information science literature by using it
to guide a mixed methods collection analysis of a single classification in the school
library.
Conclusions
The responsiveness of school library collections to the curriculum and user need
is at the heart of the rationale for this review of the literature. This review indicates that
for teachers to use folktales in the curriculum with confidence, school library collections
must be evaluated for age – librarians’ most efficient way to account for bias and
authenticity in a given version or retelling of a folktale given that the evolution of cultural
standards is reflected in children’s books. Librarians must know the size of the folktale
collection and the size of the collection in relation to the entire school collection in order
to judge sufficiency for curriculum support. Evaluating the collection for turnover rate
and its use relative to general circulation gives a picture of utility that guides the librarian
toward identifying gaps in the collection. Inferential statistics about use and age can
highlight the potential of this rich classification of the school library not just for the
curriculum but also as the folktale collection figures into students' independent reading.
To discover how folktales are used in the classroom, qualitative content analysis
of data from in-depth interviews has potential to extend a cumulative collection analysis
by explaining how teachers use folktales in instruction, thereby establishing a guidepost
for determining the breadth and usefulness of the collection. This review of the literature
indicates that a research design dictated by these three questions for research will include
69

both quantitative and qualitative methods in a cumulative model of collection analysis
(Tashakkori and Teddlie 2010; Borin and Yi 2008, 2011).

70

CHAPTER III
METHODOLOGY
The worth of a library cannot be measured by the quantity of its resources alone. The
quality of those resources, proven by use, is the ultimate worth of a library.
(Ochola 2002, 12)
A review of literature in school library collection analysis establishes that school
library collections are rarely evaluated using inferential statistical methods that have the
potential to inform collection development, support requests for funding, and address the
instructional and free reading needs of patrons (Enochs 2014). While recent research
includes interviews with school librarians as a part of a collection assessment (Garry
2015; Gavigan 2014), published accounts of school library collection analyses have not
combined inferential, quantitative collection analysis with data from interviews with
teachers who use a given classification of the school library collection in instruction. The
study at hand responds to this gap by addressing three specific questions for research in
order to assess the library collection in the context of its use:
1. How is folklore used in elementary school instruction?
2. What are features of elementary school library folklore collections?
3. Do elementary school library folklore collections support
instruction?

71

Research Design
The research questions for this study guide the choice of research design
(Tashakkori and Teddlie 2010). For school library collection analysis research situated in
community psychology theory, analysis of data from a variety of sources facilitates
evaluation of the collection in the context of its use by the school community (Lukenbill
1995, 2002). To evaluate a library collection from the stance of its users is to evaluate
whether or not the collection meets their needs and expectations (Wiersma 2010; Agee
2005). Accordingly, user-centered collection assessment included qualitative measures of
user satisfaction, including interviews with patrons. This study determines how folklore
is used in elementary instruction by analyzing the content of interviews with faculty who
routinely use folklore in the classroom. On the other hand, collection-centered collection
assessment uses quantitative data to evaluate the age and size of a collection (Wiersma
2010; Agee 2005). This study uses statistical, quantitative analysis of the age, size, and
use of the folklore collections in the elementary school libraries of one large, urban
school district to determine distinguishing characteristics of those collections. Convergent
analysis of these two data sets addresses the third question for research, which considers
whether or not folklore collections are adequate to support current elementary classroom
instruction. In light of the conclusions from the review of the literature for this research,
the analysis of both qualitative and quantitative data about a given classification of the
elementary school library provides a cumulative approach to collection analysis (Oke and
Tyrell 1998; Borin and Yi 2008, 2011).

72

Convergent Parallel Mixed Methods Design
The research questions for this inquiry position an analysis of the folklore
collection as both user-centered and collection-centered and then address a question of
synthesis. Mixed methods research designs by definition contain at least two strands of
inquiry: one quantitative and one qualitative (Tashakkori and Teddlie 2009; Creswell and
Clark 2011). Data emerging from the two strands are mixed at some point during the
investigation, resulting in analysis, inference, and conclusions. Creswell and Clark’s
(2011) framework for choosing a typology of mixed methods inquiry guided selection of
the convergent, parallel mixed methods design for this study. First, the quantitative and
qualitative methods were carried out independently and answered separate research
questions. Second, the qualitative and quantitative investigations assumed equal
importance in this study. Third, timing of data collection for each strand was concurrent.
And fourth, the findings from each strand were to be mixed after analysis in order to
provide for inference and interpretation (Creswell and Clark 2011, 64).
Tashakkori and Teddlie (2009) note that within mixed methods research,
convergent parallel mixed methods designs are characterized by research questions
developed a priori, as were the questions for this study – a characteristic that may not
always hold for a qualitative strand of inquiry. Creswell and Clark (2011) suggest that the
convergent parallel mixed methods design suits this research for several reasons. First,
the methods for addressing each research question were fixed and determined at the time
of formulating the research questions; data collection would take place concurrently but
data would be analyzed independently. Next, the approach to selecting the research
73

design was typology-based rather than emergent during inquiry; the framework of the
convergent parallel mixed methods design, while predetermined and established as
paradigm of research design, was entirely logical and adapted to this study’s unique
purpose as a cumulative approach to collection analysis (see Borin and Yi 2008, 2011).
Other explicit reasons for using mixed methods for this collection analysis study
included the potential for triangulation of findings resulting from combining qualitative
and quantitative data about the folklore collections in school libraries (Bryman 2006).
Multiple methods of studying a research question generate findings that emerge from
different perspectives (Schutt, 2006, 18). Bryman (2006) confirms that mixed methods
increase the potential for data corroboration, thereby strengthening the validity of the
research. This results in part from methodological offset, where the weaknesses of one
method of data collection are countered by the strengths of the other (Creswell and Clark
2011). For a collection analysis situated in community psychology theory, using mixed
methods for their offset holds particular resonance, given the theoretical precept that a
collection cannot be evaluated to full effect in isolation from contextualized knowledge
of user need (see Orford 2008). Finally, the use of a convergent parallel mixed methods
design for this research improves the utility of the findings by applying a cumulative
model of collection analysis to school library collections where replication of the
approach could strengthen the case for expanded funding, increase alignment with
standards, and support the use of the collection in curriculum and instruction (Bryman
2006; see also Borin and Yi 2008). Creswell and Clark (2011) add that the convergent
parallel mixed methods research design offers embellished data from qualitative analysis
74

and contextualizes quantitative findings. Figure 1 adapts Creswell and Clark’s (2011)
graphic depiction of the convergent parallel mixed methods design to the research
questions for the study at hand.

integral to school library collections.

•

Collection analysis and assessment uncovers gaps, strengths, and
weaknesses in a library collection.

75

•

A cumulative model of library collection assessment that uses collectioncentered and user-centered analysis is appropriate for studying elementary
school library folklore collections.

•

Library automation software provides consistent reports of age, size, and
circulation of collections for a given date range.

•

Participants in the qualitative strand of research answered interview
questions dependably and fully.
Quantitative Analysis

The quantitative strand of this mixed methods research addressed the question:
What are features of elementary school library folklore collections? in order to determine
distinguishing characteristics of the folklore collections in the elementary school libraries
of one large, urban school district. While some experts consider circulation statistics to be
a separate category of collection analysis (see Kohn 2013), for the purposes of this
research, the quantitative strand of research includes analysis of use (Dinkins 2003). Data
was collected using a cross sectional design – also called a “one-shot case study” in the
research literature (Schutt 2006) – at a single point in time. Operationalizing the variable
features of elementary school library folklore collections included an analysis of the age,
size, and use of the folklore collections in the elementary libraries of one large, urban
school district without regard to causation and without regard for intervening or lurking
variables (Enochs 2009). The design was pre-experimental (Schutt 2006); it followed that
without an experiment or treatment, the relevance of the results lay in the description of
the condition and use of these folklore collections individually and collectively. The one76

time collection of data eliminated concern for determining nomothetic or idiographic
causation, given that data was collected for each library collection for condition and use
during one school year without regard to condition and use during previous or subsequent
school years.
Sampling
The target population for the quantitative phase of this study comprised
elementary school libraries. The sampling frame consisted of the elementary school
libraries in the Fort Worth Independent School District, which granted permission for
research into the library collections of the district’s elementary school libraries with the
provision that the report of research protect the privacy of individual students, teachers,
and libraries (see Appendix B). The non-probability, purposive sample for the
quantitative phase of the study included only those 77 elementary school libraries that
serve students in grade levels K-5 or PreK-5 and follow a traditional school calendar.
This research design used nonprobability, purposive sampling to minimize intervening
and spurious variables that would occur in analysis of circulation data and collection
statistics from school libraries where books were available over differing school years or
where instruction was concentrated over differing ranges of grade levels. This sampling
method allowed for the largest sample possible from the sampling frame and ensured the
most complete representation of the variables for study (Enochs 2010a).
Hypotheses
Hypotheses for this research addressed only the data collected in this quantitative
strand of the convergent parallel mixed methods study (Creswell 2014); the design
77

presupposed that themes would emerge from data collected during the qualitative phase
of data analysis. These hypotheses indicated the condition of the folklore collections in
the sample at the time of data collection, along with correlations, associations, and
predictive relationships between variables:
H1: Folklore collections in the sample are smaller than the size recommended by
experts in the field of school library collection development. Experts in school library
collection development suggest that school library collections should comprise 5 to
8.84% folklore (Morris 2010, 2004; Kerby 2006).
H2: The average age of folklore collections exceeds state standards for an
acceptable elementary school collection. State standards for elementary school libraries
in Texas call for a school library collection to be less than fifteen years old (Texas State
Library and Archives Commission 2004).
H3. Older folklore collections circulate less than more recently published folklore
collections. This hypothesis suggests a correlation between the age and circulation of the
folklore collections in the sample.
H4. Larger folklore collections circulate more than smaller folklore collections.
This hypothesis suggests a correlation between the size and use of the folklore collections
in the sample.
H5. Age and size of the folklore collections predict their use. Recent research
demonstrates that age and size can predict a percentage of use for a single classification
of the school library (Enochs 2010a).

78

H6. The turnover rate for folklore collections in the sample will be less than 1.0.
This hypothesis predicts fewer than one circulation per title over the course of a single
school year, which indicates underuse (Lancaster 1993).
H7. The mean relative use factor for folklore collections in the sample will be less
than 1.0. This hypothesis predicts underuse of the folklore collections in relationship to
their percentage of the larger school library collection (Gavigan 2014; Lancaster 1993).
Data Collection and Variables for Study
Reports generated from the Follett Destiny online public access catalogs of the 77
elementary school libraries in the sample provided data regarding the age, size, and use of
the folklore collections. Reports disclosed seven variables for analysis as those variables
existed for the 2013-2014 school year for each library – age of the collection, age of the
folklore collection, size of the collection, size of the folklore collection, circulation of the
collection, circulation of the folklore collection, and the percentage of the collection
comprising folklore.
In accord with the conclusions of the review of the literature for this study, the
Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) also calculated two additional
variables for study. First, the relative use factor measured the percent of the collection
comprising folklore against the percent of circulation generated by the folklore collection
for each library’s collection. Bertland (1991), Lancaster (1993), Everhart (1998), and
Greiner and Cooper (2007) suggest that the size of a given classification should be
essentially equal to its share of circulation. Previous research suggests the value of the
relative use factor for determining underuse or overuse of a given classification and for
79

making recommendations for collection management – particularly with respect to
assessing the relevance of the collection to patrons, the need for expansion, and the
timing of weeding (Enochs 2010a; Gavigan 2014; Greiner and Cooper 2007; Everhart
1998; Lancaster 1993; Bertland 1991). Of course, for school libraries, these decisions
take place in light of compliance with state and national standards for the collection and
for instruction. The relative use factor is expressed in terms of its distance from 1; a
relative use factor greater than 1 may indicate the need to expand a collection in order to
meet patron need, while a relative use factor less than one may indicate the need to weed
or promote the collection (Bertland 1991). Second, SPSS calculated the turnover rate for
the folklore collection in each library, which measures the average use per title in the
classification of 398 if use were spread equally across the classification. The turnover rate
– also called average circulation per item – provides the simplest and most dependable
predictor of future use (Greiner and Cooper 2007), but the method does not take into
account changes to a collection made in response to patron demand (83). Table 2
summarizes the variables for study in this research.

Three reports generated from the Follett Destiny online catalog for each of the 77
libraries in the sample provided data for analysis. The first report, Collection Statistics
Summary – Collection Age Report, provided the size of each library collection, the age of
the collection, and the total circulation for the collection for the previous school year.
Grouping the call numbers by Dewey classification rather than by prefix ensured
that the collection analysis included folklore titles in all languages. This measure guarded
against confounded results in case the district’s cataloger assigned a prefix to the call
number for books published in languages other than English (e.g., SP for titles in
Spanish).
Additionally, Follett explains that the Destiny software follows a protocol to
calculate the age of the collection for all copies that include a date of publication in their
81

records. If the title is cataloged with a copyright date instead of a date of publication (e.g.
c1998), Destiny does not use the date, and if the record offers a range of publication
dates, the software uses the first date in the range.
The Collection Statistics Summary – Collection Age Report provides total
circulation for the collection for the calendar year ending with the date upon which the
report was generated. Figure 2 shows the Collection Statistics Summary – Collection Age
Report for one library in the sample.

Adding filters to the same report provides age, size, and circulation of a segment
of a given collection sorted down to the Dewey 1’s for any classification for the calendar
year ending with the date upon which the report was generated. Data gathered for the
study at hand produced this detailed report for the folklore collections classified in
83

Dewey 398 for each of the 77 elementary school library collections in the sample. In the
final column, this report also provides the metric for the percent of the collection
comprising folklore for each collection. Figure 3 shows the Collection Statistics Summary

Issues for Quantitative Data Collection
Validity check for circulation data. Both reports were generated after the library
stopped circulation at the close of the school year and before circulation began for the
following school year, thereby providing data for collections during the 2013-14 school
year. To confirm the circulation statistics, data were checked against the Destiny report
84

labeled Collection Circulation Report – Historical, limited to the dates that each school
library was open during the school year (8/19/2013-6/10/2014) and listed by Dewey 1’s
for all classifications. This report corroborated the total circulation for each collection,
the circulation of the folklore collection, and the percent of total circulation accounted for
by the folklore collection.
Follett’s help files for the Destiny catalog note that circulation statistics include
all transactions related to a given title: checkouts, renewals, interlibrary loans, interlibrary
loan renewals, and in-library use. Statistics for a single year or for a report limited to
certain dates include all transactions for that time period, including those for copies
weeded or deleted after the date the report commences. Figure 4 shows the pertinent page
of the Collection Circulation Report – Historical for the Dewey 398 section of the
collection of one library in the sample, limited by dates to the 2013-14 school year
(8/19/2013-6/10/2014).

Spot check for bibliographic consistency. Collecting reports from the
administrator client for the school district’s online catalog eliminated non-response and
reporting error had data been requested in the form of printed reports from librarians at
individual schools in the sample. It followed that this method of data collection resulted
in the largest sample of qualifying libraries from the sampling frame. However, the
transition to a automated catalog can result in errors in publication dates of individual
titles in a library collection, particularly when records are entered by hand; for this
research, those mistakes could render invalid a calculation of the age of the collection or
of a given classification. A spot check of records of titles in the folklore collections of the
libraries in the sample served as a validity check for consistency of cataloging across the
sample.
Experts in the field commonly mention children’s author Eric A. Kimmel as a
pioneer in the field of children’s folklore for his extensive retellings of folktales and for
his original folk literature (Vardell 2014). In fact, at the time of data collection for this
study, the school library collections in the sample for this research held a total of 99
unique Kimmel titles among them. As a validity check before data collection and to
assure consistency of cataloging across collections, the publication dates from the
bibliographic records for the 15 most frequently held Kimmel titles in the sample were
checked for accuracy against the Online Computer Library Center’s WorldCat database.
In-person assessment of bibliographic records was not possible with so large a sample,
and recalling the books from students and faculty would have interfered with instruction
and the free reading requirements of students.
87

The results of the spot check were unequivocal. Of the fifteen titles, all but one
had publication dates in the catalog record that corresponded with those in WorldCat.
One title, Anansi Goes Fishing (Kimmel and Stevens 1992), shows two dates of
publication in WorldCat for a first edition, but all copies in the district’s catalog showed a
publication date corresponding with one of the records in WorldCat – 1992. The Fort
Worth Independent School District had reconciled catalog records in Follett Destiny
during the summer of 2011, using the Mitinet vendor tool to merge duplicate
bibliographic entries and find errors in MARC records for the union catalog; it followed
that this spot check was unlikely to uncover discrepancies in the clean database. With 100
percent of records for the fifteen Kimmel titles showing publication dates aligned with
WordCat bibliographic records, data collection proceeded as planned.
Analysis
Descriptive statistics. Tables illustrated the means, standard deviations, and
ranges of the nine variables for study named in Table 2 for each of the 77 elementary
library folklore collections. A grouping variable facilitated analysis of the size of
collection and size of the folklore collection for each library. Grouping variables also
facilitated analysis of the percent of the collections comprising folklore, which in turn
provided data for analysis of the relative use factor for these collections separately and
together. Frequencies and percentages tables and bar graphs illustrated the distribution of
collection size and age for these collections. A table provided visual evidence of the age
of each library’s folklore collection in relationship to the age of the general collection.
Finally, analysis using a grouping variable provided a glimpse into the circulation of the
88

collection and the circulation of the folklore collection. The relative use factor and
turnover rate for each library’s folklore collection illustrated patterns of use of the
folklore collection among schools and for the district’s libraries in general.
Primary analyses. Correlation coefficients determined relationships between and
among variables, including the age, size, and circulation of the collection and the age,
size, and circulation of the folklore collection. Multiple regression analysis used the
continuous variables of age and size of the collection and age and size of the folklore
collection to predict circulation of the collection and circulation of the folklore collection
(Enochs 2010a), and to determine positive and negative correlations between available
independent variables.
Qualitative Analysis
The expertise of the … faculty is vital to the health of the collection.
(Neville, Williams, and Hunt 1998, 527)
This collection analysis research was guided by three questions for study:
1. What are features of elementary school library folklore collections?
2. How is folklore used in elementary school instruction? and
3. Do elementary school library folklore collections support
instruction?
The convergent parallel mixed methods design for this study operationalizes the variable
features of elementary school library folklore collections in the first research question
with a quantitative analysis of the age, size, and circulation of the folklore collections in

89

the elementary school library collections of one large, urban school district in the United
States.
The second question for research, however, is exploratory, and as a qualitative
research question, does not test any preformulated hypotheses (Schutt 2006). In order to
situate this collection analysis study in community psychology theory, the unit of analysis
was the library collection in the context of its use (Enochs 2014; Orford 2008).
Community psychology theory suggests that a collection analysis is irrelevant – and
potentially even detrimental – if it does not take into account the context in which the
collection is used (Orford 2008). Accordingly, this study operationalizes the variable use
of folklore in elementary school instruction by exploring the instructional practices of
thirteen teachers recruited within the school district from which the sample for the
quantitative strand of research was taken. Using semi-structured interviews to determine
how the folklore collection is used by one group of patrons – the faculty – provided
context to the data from the quantitative strand of research. How do teachers use the
folklore collection in the classroom? Do aging collections affect instruction? What
features of folklore titles help or hinder a lesson? The review of literature for this
research disclosed selected discrete practices for teaching folklore in elementary language
arts and social studies instruction, but no single published research report has assessed the
de facto use of the school library collection in a small-sample case study of practicing
teachers.
Schutt (2006) notes that qualitative research questions focus on processes that
have not been studied, with the knowledge that data collection may uncover
90

unanticipated phenomena (288). In line with the model of cumulative collection analysis
suggested by a review of the literature (Oke and Tyrell 1998; Borin and Yi 2008, 2011),
this research contextualizes quantitative features of school folklore collections by
considering them in light of themes gathered from these interviews. These exploratory
interviews did not test preformulated hypotheses; instead, they were based on the
assumption that common themes would emerge during the coding stage of data analysis
(Creswell 2009; Charmaz 2006).
Case Study Design
The sampling frame for the qualitative phase of this research included the teachers
from the school district where data was gathered for the quantitative phase. The research
design used nonprobability, purposive sampling, given that the research question calls for
an intensive investigation of the phenomenon use of folklore in elementary school
instruction. Creswell (2009) notes that qualitative researchers deliberately select
participants and sites for study that will help the researcher understand the problem and
research question. In seeking to create a thick description of how teachers use folklore in
instruction (Schutt 2006), for this research, thirteen teachers were intentionally recruited
from the schools included in the sampling frame for the quantitative strand of this
research; the qualitative phenomenon of study included the teachers’ use of the particular
folklore collections under analysis, not only folklore in general.
Small sample case study. The research design for this phase of research took the
approach of Gerring’s (2007) small sample case study (19), using three assumptions to
guide the research design. First, the phenomenon under study required inference to
91

explain; here, the phenomenon for study was teachers’ instructional use of folklore,
particularly the folklore collections at the elementary schools in the sampling frame.
Second, the purpose of the case study was to shed light on a larger class of cases –
elementary teachers’ instructional use of school library collections (Gerring 2007, 20).
The study at hand comprised a single observation of each individual, which took the form
of a semi-structured interview with each of the thirteen participants. Gerring (2007) calls
these “within-case” observations. Gerring’s (2007) third assumption of a case study
design is that the case under study is not perfectly representative of that population due to
the intentional effort to garner a rich description of the case at hand from selected
participants. He notes that population, case, and observation are nested within one
another, and depending on the case under study, may have varying definitions. Figure 5
shows a graphic representation of the design of the small sample case study for this
research.

Semi-Structured Interviews
Advantages. Lancaster (1993) noted that in-depth interviews with faculty have
three advantages over surveys and questionnaires when it comes to assessing a library
collection. First, the interviewer can ascertain that the participant interprets the question
correctly. Second, the interviewer can ask follow-up questions in a semi-structured
interview in order to maintain accuracy. Also, the interview may lead to unsolicited
responses which add depth and breadth to the quantitative findings and allow for
reformulation of the qualitative research question (p. 228).
Recruitment. First, school librarians at schools in the sampling frame received a
recruiting letter and a copy of the consent form detailing risks and benefits of
participation (See Appendices C and D). School librarians at the schools in the sample
passed on the recruiting letter to potential teacher participants, who in turn contacted the
researcher. Interviews took place after school hours at the various schools where
participants taught, either in the classroom or the school library, in order to provide a
naturalistic setting for inquiry (Creswell 2009). As suggested by Schutt (2006) and Rubin
and Rubin (1995) for qualitative research samples, participants represented the range of
grade levels and languages of instruction and were selected according to their willingness
to talk (evidenced by their response to the recruiting letter), their knowledge of folklore
and curriculum, and their experience as teachers. Participants were purposefully selected
for their ability to help the researcher understand how they use folklore in instruction,
without attention to random sampling.

93

Protocol. For this research, each semi-structured interview followed the same
written research protocol in order to facilitate data comparison across subjects (Charmaz,
2006). A pilot test of the interview protocol with three former elementary language arts
teachers prompted additional questions for inquiry and data for preliminary analysis
before the study began. All participants signed informed consent detailing the minimal
risk involved in the interviews (see Appendix D). Interviews took place in person, faceto-face about participants’ use and perceptions of the school library folklore collection –
including folktales, myths, tall tales, and fairy tales. Other topics in the written protocol
included elements of folklore taught in genre study, student assignments requiring library
folklore resources, and strengths and deficiencies observed in the collection (see
Appendix E). The interview protocol and memos written during and after each interview
framed a dynamic data-gathering process which included the flexibility required to probe
unanticipated responses concerning teachers’ perceptions of the collection (Creswell
2009).
Coding and Analysis
The researcher recorded the interviews with audio only and transcribed them
using features of the statistical analysis software MAXQDAPlus. Transcripts of the
interviews were coded within one day of the interview. Using a grounded theory
approach (Charmaz 2006), analysis proceeded from initial to focused coding as the
interviews progressed, with some in vivo codes emerging early in the data gathering
process (e.g. “thematic instruction”). Other codes used descriptors. Codes were
established visually using the color-highlighting features in the software, which was
94

formatted to place subcodes into a hierarchy, thereby establishing the coding tree. As the
coding tree emerged, new codes were added, expanded, and narrowed to accommodate
patterns of data and to indicate the point of saturation of a given code. The analysis of
this data placed codes and categories into context for reflection and understanding
(Charmaz 2006; Creswell and Clark 2011).
Sample Size and Data Saturation
While quantitative researchers use statistical indicators that generate a sample size
necessary to provide findings with a given level of statistical power, qualitative
researchers often have no indicators of how much data is enough before data gathering
begins (Baker and Edwards 2012). It follows that determining the number of interviews
necessary to address a research question depends on the nature of the question and the
resulting methodology of the research design, with the understanding that the sample size
should maintain the researcher’s ability to collect and analyze data within a pragmatic but
flexible framework (Charmaz 2006; Baker and Edwards 2012).
Guided by community psychology theory, the intention of the qualitative phase of
this research was to determine how teachers – as library patrons – use elementary school
library folklore collections, in order to evaluate the collection and explain its use from the
point of view of the user. Gerring (2007) notes that a small sample case study
presupposes a relatively bounded phenomenon, constructed with clear definition. The
parameters of the phenomenon suggest that at some point, analysis of the interviews will
cease to generate new codes, called data saturation (Charmaz 2006). At that point in the
process, the researcher has reached the proper sample size. Anthropologist Harry
95

Wolcott, quoted in Baker and Edwards (2012), said of saturation: “You keep asking as
long as you are getting different answers, and that is a reminder that with our little
samples we can’t establish frequencies but we should be able to find the range of
responses” (4). For the research at hand, the point of data saturation began after ten
interviews and was reached with a large measure of thoroughness after thirteen
interviews, a sampling point mentioned in similar qualitative studies of faculty
perceptions of academic libraries (Nitecki and Abels 2013). As Ravitch and Carl (2016)
suggest, saturation was determined as the point at which no new data emerged with
respect to the emerging theory. For this study, new descriptors of teachers’ instructional
practice with folklore did not emerge after the tenth interview. To assure that there were
no “gaps or unexplained phenomena” in the theory that emerged from this study, three
additional interviews were conducted to assure the robustness of the coding structure
(Ravitch and Carl 2016, 266; see also Guest, Bunce, and Johnson 2006).
Issues for Qualitative Data Collection
Reliability and credibility. For quantitative researchers, evaluation of findings
includes assessing reliability - the ability of other researchers to replicate results using the
same instruments and techniques (Schutt 2006; Campbell et al. 2013). For qualitative
investigations, on the other hand, reliability of the research is a goal only with regard to
assessing the accuracy of coding for qualitative data analysis. The concept of verifying
the codes applied to a given data set by one coder against those applied by another coder
has roots in the quantitative idea of inter-rater reliability, where measurements obtained
by different observers rating the same phenomenon are considered in light of their
96

agreement (Schutt 2006). At least one recent study offers a method for achieving intercoder reliability in analysis of semi-structured interviews (Campbell et al. 2013).
For the study at hand, however, inter-coder reliability is not a necessary or
particularly desirable goal of research. Within the framework of community psychology
theory, a collection must be analyzed in the context of its use, and the use of a given
classification of a school library will differ according to school culture, curriculum, and
administrative expectations for instruction. Codes are specific and endogenous to the case
under study. Weiss (1994) notes that coding requires intense thought about data, and the
thinking should be that of the person responsible for writing the report. Furthermore, for
this research in particular, assessing inter-coder reliability would require an available
second coder with a concentrated, specific mix of skills and experience in education and
librarianship. In fact, for this mixed methods analysis to be transferable or adapted to
another setting (see Charmaz 2006), it would preferably be replicable by one researcher
working alone.
Qualitative researchers generally choose to focus on other methods to validate
their findings, particularly when there are few ways to check their one-time collection of
data against a known standard or against the perceptions and judgments of another
researcher. Norris (1997) notes: “Most of the conventional constructs of validity are
inappropriate for naturalistic forms of inquiry” (173). In the alternative, Charmaz (2006)
assesses qualitative research by establishing its credibility, resonance, and transferability.
Does the research achieve familiarity with its topic and are the data sufficient to merit the
claims? Are observations systematic between and across categories? Charmaz advocates
97

assessing qualitative data for its usefulness in order to establish whether it makes sense to
those who share the circumstances or conditions of the participants (183), an approach
considered in the discussion of the findings from this research.
Bias
Sampling and Selection Bias
Sampling bias. Schensul, Schensul, and LeCompte (1999) contend that sampling
bias can occur when characteristics of a sample do not match characteristics of the
population because some segment of the population was not sampled. The quantitative
strand of this research analyzes the age, size, and use of folklore collections in 77
selected school libraries in one large, urban school district. Nonprobability, purposive
sampling minimized spurious and intervening variables that might occur if collections
were included in the analysis from schools with differing ranges of grade levels or where
the school calendar meant a given library circulated books over a different period of time.
However, limited to one school district in one geographic region, the quantitative sample
is not representative of the population of school libraries. Because of this sampling bias,
the results of this collection analysis are not generalizable to other school districts or
libraries. It is unlikely, however, that the force of the results of this cross-sectional study
is minimized or even affected by sampling bias, particularly in the absence of an
experiment or treatment. The purpose of the quantitative strand of this research was not
to generalize the results of research, but to illustrate the results and potential of a
research-based, cumulative model of collection analysis applied to the elementary school
libraries in the sampling frame.
98

Selection bias. The qualitative strand of this research was a small sample case
study comprising semi-structured interviews with elementary school teachers in order to
characterize their use of folklore in instruction. Participants self-selected by responding to
a recruitment letter distributed through the school librarians at the schools in the sampling
frame. The researcher then scheduled interviews on a first-come, first-served basis. The
researcher intentionally considered the potential participants’ languages of instruction,
school location, and grade level in order to assure geographic representation and a wide
range of instructional experience. When the researcher noted a shortage of participants
who taught in a given grade level, she sent reminders to the librarians at the schools in the
sampling frame in an effort to recruit additional participants. Eventually, preliminary
coding indicated a satisfactory level of data saturation, and recruitment ceased.
Selection bias occurs when there are differences between those in a population
who take part in a study and those who do not (Last 2001, 166). For quantitative studies,
threats to the validity of the findings of an experiment or treatment may result from bias
inherent in the method by which participants or subjects become a part of the sample. On
the other hand, Charmaz (2006) contends that whether or not selection bias occurs in a
given qualitative study depends on the research purpose, the research question, and
methodology. For the qualitative research at hand, participants’ self-selection potentially
correlated with a strong interest in the subject, which undoubtedly introduced an element
of selection bias into the research design. In addition, the recruitment letter clearly
explained the interview methodology, so participants who did not have time for an
interview before or after the school day or for whom interviews were not comfortable
99

were less likely to participate. Also, teachers unknown to the school librarians in the
sampling frame may not have received the recruitment letter, and some teachers may
have been reluctant to participate due to lack of confidence in protection of their
anonymity.
However, for purposes of this small sample case study, selection bias actually
worked in favor of the researcher’s ability to gather rich data pertinent to the qualitative
research question: How is folklore used in elementary school instruction? Participants
volunteered for the study because they were willing to discuss their use of folklore in
instruction. In most cases, they had active, collaborative relationships with their school
librarians, which allowed them to voice legitimate concerns about the collection and to
feel comfortable discussing them with the researcher, a school librarian at one of the
schools in the sample. Most important, the research question sought participants’
expertise, not their representativeness of the population, as is often the case with
purposive samples (Schutt 2006, 303). For this research, selection bias clearly did not
preclude the usefulness of data; it facilitated it (Rubin and Babbie 2010; Collier,
Mahoney, and Seawright 2004).
Researcher Bias
The most credible threat to validity for this research was researcher bias, given
that the researcher was a school librarian at one of the schools in the sample. For the
quantitative strand of research, data was gathered using the administrator client of the
school district’s library automation system. Along with coding each report for anonymity,

100

this effectively eliminated bias from the cross-sectional collection and analysis of
quantitative data.
However, the consideration of researcher bias for the qualitative strand of this
research posed an interesting ancillary construct for consideration in the research design.
Seminal grounded theory researchers Strauss and Corbin (1990) posit that positioning
qualitative research in the personal or work experience of the researcher may seem
hazardous, but in fact may be a valuable endeavor given its potential to increase
motivation and to draw on the researcher’s expertise (35-36). Maxwell (2013) theorizes
that researcher bias takes two forms: selection bias and reactivity. Selection bias on the
part of the researcher extends primarily to threats to the validity of the sampling
methodology in the few cases where representativeness of the qualitative sample may be
important to the findings. More relevant to the case at hand is researcher bias due to
reactivity, or the interaction between the researcher and the subjects in qualitative
interviews (Maxwell 2013, 124). While quantitative studies would seek to control for
such researcher bias, qualitative researchers seek to use reactivity to the benefit of the
study.
For this research, the interview protocol had the potential to contain questions that
could lead participants toward a given answer – what Maxwell (2013) labels an
undesirable consequence of researcher reactivity (125). Feedback from the pilot
interviews allowed the researcher to avoid leading questions and structure the interview
protocol such that participants could construct a cogent narrative about their instructional
practices by addressing a loose framework of open-ended questions (Charmaz 2006, 27;
101

also see Appendix E). Maxwell (2013) adds that qualitative interviews are always
affected by interaction between the researcher and the participants, which essentially
obviates the need to avoid influencing participants at all. Instead, interpreting conclusions
and understanding findings in light of researcher reactivity confirms the validity of the
findings (Maxwell 2013, 125). For the study at hand, the researcher’s affiliation with the
school district which constituted the sampling frame confirmed the professional nature of
the interaction with participants and established the participatory nature of the qualitative
interviews. In addition, the researcher’s background as a teacher and librarian allowed for
a shared understanding of circumstances and details about curriculum and classrooms
that frequently put participants at ease during their explanations and allowed for extended
observations and shared vocabulary (see Del Negro 2007). Charmaz (2006) contends that
participants’ comfort level takes priority over obtaining data during a qualitative
interview. If anything, the reactivity of participants with the researcher in this study was
based on the interaction of colleagues and provided an atmosphere conducive to
tangential reflection. In the end, the goal of using a cumulative approach to evaluate a
library collection in the context of the community where it is used benefited from the
researcher bias in the research design.
Ethics
The Texas Woman’s University Institutional Review Board gave approval for this

Quantitative Analysis
This research did not use children as participants in either strand of study.
However, it did require the examination of circulation data that was generated by patrons
who are children, requiring diligence when it came to protecting privacy. Due protection
was provided by redacting identifying characteristics of the schools in published reports
of research and by destroying statistical reports once they were coded for anonymity.
Qualitative Analysis
Teacher participants received a disclaimer as part of informed consent in the
interview protocol specifying that no names or identifying characteristics of the teacher
or school would be included in data analysis or publication. Interview transcriptions and
the codebook for data analysis were coded for participants’ anonymity, with identifying
information available only to the researcher at the time of the interview. The researcher
protected teacher privacy and confidentiality to the extent allowed by law, including
destruction of interview transcripts and digital recordings once analysis was complete.
The participant recruitment letter and statement of informed consent signed by the
participants are included in Appendices C and D.

CHAPTER IV
RESULTS
This collection analysis study examined the folklore collections in the elementary
school libraries of one large, urban school district in order to address three questions for
research:
1. What are features of elementary school library folklore collections?
2. How is folklore used in elementary school instruction?
3. Do elementary school library folklore collections support
instruction?
The purpose of school library collection analysis is to inform the decision making
of the school librarian in developing and managing standards-compliant collections that
“enable student learning and support information literacy” (Hughes-Hassell and Mancall
2005, xii). The research at hand followed a convergent, parallel, mixed methods design in
which a quantitative collection analysis of folklore collections took place alongside
qualitative interviews with faculty who use those collections in instruction. The purpose
for the study was to determine the collections’ level of support for instruction while
substantiating the need for additional funding (Enochs 2014, 2009, 2010a; Gavigan 2014;
Lanning and Turner 2010). Situated in community psychology theory, this research
examined school library folklore collections in the context of their use by the school
community (Enochs 2010a; Lukenbill 2002).
104

Quantitative Analysis
The quantitative phase of this research characterized the folklore collections in 77
elementary school libraries of Fort Worth Independent School District. The researcher
gathered data from the online catalog regarding age, size, and circulation of these
collections in order to identify distinguishing features of the collections. In turn, findings
were merged with explanatory data from the qualitative phase of research in order to
determine the ability of these collections to support literacy and language arts instruction.
Assumptions testing was conducted on the data prior to analysis. Kolmogorov–
Smirnov and Shapiro–Wilk tests assessed the normality of distributions. The analysis
revealed that some of the variables in the data set had frequency distributions that
violated normality: age of library collection, age of folklore collection, circulation of
folklore, percentage of circulation of folklore, and relative use of folklore. Accordingly,
non-parametric tests were conducted in all analyses as a sensitivity. There were no
differences in the results from parametric tests to non-parametric tests for any of the
findings except for the pairwise correlation tests. Therefore, non-parametric Spearman’s
rho tests were used for the pairwise correlations in this study.
Description of Sample
There were 77 elementary school libraries sampled for this research. As shown in
Table 3, the library collections in the sample contained an average of 11,434 items (M =
11,434.66, SD = 2,783.49) and ranged from 7,103 to 18,154 items. The folklore
collections contained an average of 450 items (M = 450.79, SD = 125.25) and ranged
105

from 199 to 799 items. The average percentage of the collection comprising folklore was
3.96% (M = 3.96, SD = .74) and ranged from 2.29% to 7.05%. The average age of a
library collection was 15 years (M = 15.06, SD = 2.00) and ranged from 9 to 19 years.
The average age of the folklore collection was slightly less than 19 years (M = 18.77, SD
= 2.19) and ranged from 14 to 25 years.

The average circulation of the library collection was 32,441 items (M = 32,441,
SD = 15,520) and ranged from 8,233 to 90,960. The average circulation of folklore
collections was 708 (M = 708, SD = 395) and ranged from 138 to 1,810. The average
percentage of circulation of folklore collections was 2.28% (M = 2.28, SD = 1.04) and
ranged from .78% to 8.22%. The average turnover rate for folklore collections was 1.61%
(M = 1.61, SD = .84) and ranged from .28% to 4.47%. The average relative use factor for
folklore collections was .58% (M = .58, SD = .26) and ranged from .20% to 2.26%.
Grouping variables were created from these continuous measures to classify libraries by
selected intervals of each of these measures.
Size of the Library Collection
A grouping variable was created in order to classify libraries by intervals of
collection size. The majority of the library collections (84.5%) contained between 7,500
and 14,999 items. As shown in Table 4 and Figure 6, the largest proportion of library
collections contained 7,500 to 9,999 items (35.1%), followed by collections of 10,000 to
12,499 items (31.2%) and collections of 12,500 to 14,999 items (18.2%). Of the library
collections, 14.3% contained more than 15,000 items and 1.3% contained fewer than
7,500 items.
Size of the Folklore Collection
A grouping variable was created for folklore collection size in order to classify
libraries into groups by intervals of folklore collection size. As shown in Table 4 and
Figure 6, analyses revealed that almost three-fourths of the folklore collections (74.1%)
107

contained between 300 and 599 items. The largest proportion consisted of folklore
collections containing 400 to 499 items (39.0%), followed by folklore collections
containing 300 to 399 items (20.8%) and folklore collections containing 500 to 599 items
(14.3%). The remaining proportions of the sample were folklore collections between 200
and 299 items (11.7%), folklore collections between 600 and 699 items (10.4%), folklore
collections between 700 and 799 items (2.6%), and folklore collections holding fewer
than 199 items (1.3%).

Percentage of the Collection Comprising Folklore
A ratio variable was calculated to represent the proportion of the overall library
collection that comprised folklore. The percentage of the collection comprising folklore
was classified into seven groups. As shown in Table 5 and Figure 7, the analysis revealed
that 72.8% of these libraries held folklore collections that accounted for 3.0% to 4.49% of
the collection. Of these libraries, 16.9% had folklore collections comprising 4.5% to
4.99% of the collection, 5.2% had folklore collections comprising 5.0% to 7.99% of the
collection. Of the libraries in the sample, 5.2% had folklore holdings that accounted for
less than 3.0% of their collections.

Age of the Library Collection
A descriptive analysis of the ages of the library collections was conducted, and
the results showed that 84.5% of the library collections were between 13 and 17 years
old. As shown in Table 6 and Figure 8, the greatest proportion of library collections were
15 years old (28.6%), followed by library collections that were 16 years old (22.1%), 14
years old (13.0%), 17 years old (13.0%), and 13 years old (7.8%). Finally, 7.8% of the
library collections were between 9 and 12 years old, and 7.8% of the collections were
between 18 and 19 years old.

Age of the Folklore Collection
Analyses also revealed that 80.6% of the folklore collections in the sample were
between 17 and 21 years old. The largest proportion of the folklore collections was 18
years old (19.5%), followed by folklore collections that were 19 years old (18.2%), 17
years old (16.9%), 20 years old (14.3%), and 21 years old (11.7%). In addition, 11.7% of
the folklore collections were between 14 and 16 years old, and 5.2% of the folklore
collections were 22 to 23 years old (see Table 6 and Figure 8).
Circulation of the Library Collection
A grouping variable was created for circulation of the library collection to classify
libraries by intervals of circulation of the collection for the school year under study. The
results of this descriptor are shown in Table 7. Of the libraries in the sample, 2.6%
113

showed circulation of fewer than 10,000 items, and 85.8% of the participating libraries
had circulation between 10,000 and 49,999 items.
The largest proportion for circulation of collections was evenly split (23.4%)
between 20,000 to 29,999 items and 30,000 and 39,999 items. The next largest proportion
for circulation of collections was 10,000 to 19,999 items (22.1%), followed by
circulations of 40,000 to 49,999 items (16.9%) and 50,000 to 59,999 items (7.8%). Of the
libraries in the sample, 2.6% had collections with circulation of 60,000 to 69,000 items,
and 1.3% had collections with circulation greater than 70,000 items.
Circulation of the Folklore Collection
A grouping variable was created for circulation of the folklore collection in order
to classify libraries by intervals of circulation of the folklore collection. As shown in
Table 7 and Figure 9, 79.3% of libraries had folklore collection circulation ranging from
200 to 999 items.
The largest proportion of folklore circulation was evenly split (23.4%) between
200 and 399 items and between 400 and 599 items. The next largest proportion of
folklore circulation was 800 to 999 items (16.9%), followed by 600 to 799 items (15.6%),
1,000 to 1,199 items (5.2%), and 1,200 to 1,399 items (5.2%).
Of the libraries in the sample, 2.6% held folklore collections with a circulation of
fewer than 200 items. Finally, libraries with the largest circulation of folklore were 1,400
to 1,599 items (2.6%), 1,600 to 1,799 items (3.9%), and 1,800 items or more (1.3%).

114

Percentage of Circulation from the Folklore Collection
A grouping variable was also created for these libraries’ percentage of circulation
from folklore collections to provide a classification by interval. The results are shown in
Table 7 and Figure 9.
Of the libraries in the sample, 79.3% had a percentage of circulation from folklore
ranging from 1.00% to 2.99%. The largest proportion of percentage of circulation from
folklore was 1.50% to 1.99% (24.7%), followed by 2.50% to 2.99% (20.8%), then 2.00%
to 2.49% (19.5%), and 1.00% to 1.49% (14.3%). Of the libraries in the sample, 5.2% had
a percentage of circulation from folklore of less than .99%.
Finally, the libraries with the highest percentage of circulation from folklore were
4.00% to 4.99% (2.6%) and 5.0% or more (1.3%).

Turnover Rate for Folklore Collections
A grouping variable also provided a classification of libraries by intervals of
folklore turnover rate. The results are shown in Table 8 and Figure 10. Of the libraries in
the sample, 81.9% had folklore turnover rates ranging from .50% to 2.49%. Of that range,
the largest proportion of libraries had a folklore turnover rate of 1.50% to 1.99% (24.7%),
followed by 1.00% to 1.49% (23.4%), then .50% to .99% (19.5%), and finally, 2.00% to
2.49% (14.3%). Of the libraries in the sample, 6.5% had folklore turnover rates of less
than .49%. Finally, the highest folklore turnover rates for libraries in the sample were
2.50% to 2.99% (3.9%), 3.00% to 3.49% (2.6%), 3.50% to 3.99% (3.9%), and 4.00% to
4.49% (1.3%).
Relative Use Factor for Folklore Collections
A grouping variable was constructed for the relative use factor for folklore
collections to provide a classification of libraries by interval. The results are shown in
Table 8 and Figure 10. Of the libraries in the sample, 76.7% had relative use factors for
folklore ranging from .35% to .44%. Of that range, the largest proportion of libraries had
folklore relative use factors of .45% to .54% (22.1%), followed by .35% to .44% (20.8%),
then .55% to .64% (19.5%), and lastly .65% to .74% (14.3%). Of these libraries, 7.8%
had a relative use factor for folklore of .25% to .35%, and 1.3% had a relative use factor
less than .24%. Finally, libraries with the highest folklore relative use factor in the sample
were .75% to .84% (2.6%), .85% to .94% (9.1%), and .95% or more (2.6%).

Data Analyses
Preliminary Analyses
Spearman’s rho correlations were conducted to examine the pairwise relationships
between the individual variables measured in this study. Spearman’s rho correlations are
used to examine relationships between continuous variables measured on interval or ratio
scales. Correlation coefficients can range between -1.00 and +1.00. A positive correlation
indicates that increases in one variable are associated with increases in the other variable.
A negative correlation, on the other hand, indicates that decreases in one variable are
associated with increases in the other variable.
Correlation coefficients close to 0 indicate a weak relationship or a lack of a
relationship between variables. This non-parametric test was chosen due to some of the
variables in the data set exhibiting deviations from normality. Spearman’s rho makes no
assumptions about the distribution of the data.
Table 9 displays the correlation coefficients for the relationships among the
variables for the library collections and the folklore collections. The results revealed a
significant and positive correlation between the following: size of library collection and
circulation of collection (r = .449, p < .001); size of library collection and size of folklore
collection (r = .806, p < .001); and size of library collection and circulation of folklore
collection (r = .362, p < .01).

121

These results can be interpreted to mean that an increase in the size of library
collection is associated with an increase in circulation of the library collection, size of the
folklore collection, and circulation of the folklore collection.
For the variable size of folklore collection, the results showed significant and
positive correlations between size of folklore collection and age of the library collection
(r = .369, p < .01), size of folklore and age of folklore collection (r = .323, p < .01), size
of folklore and circulation of folklore collection (r = .334, p < .01), and of course, size of
the folklore collection and the percentage of the collection that comprises folklore (r =
.425, p < .001; see Table 9).
The results also showed significant and negative correlations between age of
library collection and circulation of library collection (r = -.267, p < .05) and age of
collection and turnover rate of folklore collection (r = -.329, p < .01), suggesting that an
increase in the age of a library collection is associated with a decrease in the circulation
of a library collection and the turnover rate of a folklore collection.
Conversely, the results showed a significant and positive correlation between age
of library collection and age of folklore collection, (r = .738, p < .001), age of library
collection and percentage of collection that is folklore (r = .320, p < .01), and age of
library collection and percentage of circulation comprising folklore (r = .229, p < .05).
For age of folklore, the results showed a significant positive correlation between
age of folklore and percentage of the collection comprising folklore (r = .449, p < .001;
see Table 9). On the other hand, the results showed a significant and negative correlation
122

between age of folklore and turnover rate of folklore collection (r = -.323, p < .01).
For circulation of collection, the results showed strong and significant positive
correlations for circulation of collection and circulation of folklore (r = .702, p < .001)
and circulation of collection and turnover rate of folklore collection (r = .620, p < .001).
On the other hand, the results showed a significant negative correlation between
circulation of collection and percentage of the collection comprising folklore (r = -.249, p
< .05). For circulation of folklore collection, the results showed a significant positive
correlation between circulation of folklore and percentage of circulation from folklore (r
= .540, p < .001). There was a positive correlation between circulation of folklore and
turnover rate of folklore (r = .825, p < .001) and circulation of folklore and its relative
use factor (r = .569, p < .001).
Percentage of the collection comprising folklore had a significant and positive
correlation with percentage of circulation of folklore (r = .478, p < .001). Percentage of
circulation from folklore had a significant and positive correlation with turnover rate of
folklore (r = .413, p < .001) and relative use factor of the folklore collection (r = .866, p <
.001). Finally, turnover rate of folklore had a significant and positive correlation with
relative use factor of folklore collection (r = .600, p < .001).

Primary Analyses
The hypotheses outlined in this study predicted the state of these library
collections at the time of data collection without regard to an experiment or treatment.
This quantitative phase of research was a cross-sectional, one-shot case study of 77
library collections in the elementary schools of one large, independent school district.
These hypotheses were tested in the primary analyses in order to establish the condition
and patterns of use of these collections over the course of one school year. For this set of
analyses, one-sample t tests were used to determine whether means of the following
variables deviated from a theoretical value derived from the literature: age of library
collection, age of folklore collection, percent of folklore collection, turnover rates of
folklore collection, and relative use rates of folklore collection. A Spearman’s rho
correlation was conducted to establish if relationships existed between the following: age
of folklore collection, size of folklore collection, circulation of folklore collection, and
relative use of folklore collection. Finally, multiple linear regression analyses were used
to predict circulation of folklore collection, turnover of folklore collection, and relative
use of folklore collection. The independent variables used to predict these dependent
variables are age of folklore collection and size of folklore collection.
H1: Folklore collections in the sample are smaller than the size recommended by
experts in the field of school library collection development. To examine H1, a onesample t test (test value = 5) determined if the percentage of the collection comprising
folklore was significantly different from 5%. As shown in Table 10, the mean percentage
125

of the library collection comprising folklore was significantly lower than 5% (M = 3.96,
SD =.74, p < .001). The folklore collections in this sample were significantly smaller than
the 5% minimum size indicated in the literature (Morris 2010, 2004; Kerby 2006). The
data supported the hypothesis that folklore collections in the sample were smaller than
recommended in the literature.

H2: The average age of folklore collections exceeds state standards for an
acceptable elementary school collection. This hypothesis predicted that the folklore
collections would be older than Texas’s state standard of 14 years. To test this
hypothesis, a one-sample t test (test value = 14) was conducted to determine if the age of
the folklore collections was significantly greater than 14 years. As shown in Table 11, the
mean age of folklore collections was significantly higher than the test value (M = 15.06,
SD =2.00, p < .001). The results of this test showed that the age of folklore collections in
the sample was significantly higher than 14 years. Clearly, the data supported the
hypothesis that these folklore collections are older than the Texas standard of 14 years.

H3. Older folklore collections circulate less than more recently published folklore
collections. H3 states that older folklore collections circulate less than newer folklore
collections, which posits a relationship between age and circulation of the folklore
collections.
H4. Larger folklore collections circulate more than smaller folklore collections.
H4 states that the larger folklore collections circulate more than smaller folklore
collections, which posits a relationship between size and circulation of the folklore
collections.
To test these hypotheses, nonparametric Spearman’s rho correlations determined
the strength of association between these continuous variables. As shown in Table 12, the
results revealed no relationship between age of folklore and circulation of folklore (r = .051, p = .657), although there was a negative correlation between the age of the total
library collection and the circulation of the total library collection (r=-.267, p<.05).
127

However, size of the folklore collection had a significant and positive correlation with
circulation of the folklore collection (r = .370, p < .001). As an aside, the results revealed
no relationship between size of folklore and relative use of folklore (r = .013, p = .909).
For H3, the data do not support the hypothesis that older folklore collections circulate less
than newer folklore collection. Conversely, for H4, the data support the contention that
larger folklore collections circulate more than smaller folklore collections.

H5. Age and size of the folklore collections predict their use. This hypothesis
predicts that the variables of age and size of folklore collections predict the circulation of
folklore. This analysis also considers whether age and size of folklore collections predict
the turnover rate and the relative use factor for folklore. Multiple regression analysis
tested this hypothesis. The results are shown in Table 13.
In the first model, the predictors included age of folklore collections and size of
128

folklore collections, and the dependent variable was circulation of folklore (see Table
13). The overall model was significant, F(2, 74) = 7.67, p <.001, and accounted for
14.9% of the variance. The results indicated that size of folklore collection was a
significant positive predictor of circulation of folklore collection (Beta = .437, p < .001).
Age of folklore collection was not a significant predictor of circulation of folklore
collection (Beta = -.199, p = .081).
In the second model, the predictors included age and size of folklore collections
and the dependent variable was turnover rate of folklore collections (see Table 13). The
overall model was not significant, F(2, 74) = 2.40, p = .098, and accounted for 3.6% of
the variance. The results indicated that size of folklore collection was not a significant
predictor of turnover rate of folklore (Beta = -.094, p = .448). In addition, age of folklore
was not a significant predictor of turnover rate (Beta = -.201, p = .098).
In the final model, the predictors included age of folklore collections and size of
folklore collections, and the dependent variable was relative use factor for folklore
collections (see Table 13). The overall model was not significant, F(2, 74) = .082, p =
.922, and accounted for less than .01% of the variance. The results indicated that size of
folklore collection was not a significant predictor of relative use factor for folklore (Beta
= .029, p = .812). In addition, age of folklore was not a significant predictor of its relative
use factor (Beta = -.048, p = .699).
As shown in Table 13, the results of these findings are mixed. Size of folklore
collection had a strong relationship with circulation of folklore when controlling for age
129

of folklore collection. However, none of the other relationships in the models were
significant predictors. The data do not support the hypothesis that age of folklore
collections predict their use, but the data support the hypothesis that size of folklore
collections predict their use.

H6. The turnover rate for folklore collections in the sample will be less than 1.0.
To test this hypothesis, a one-sample t test (test value = 1) determined if the turnover rate
of the folklore collections was significantly different from 1%. As shown in Table 14, the
mean percent of turnover rate of folklore collections was significantly higher than the test
value (M = 1.61, SD =.84, p < .001). The results of this test showed that the turnover rate
of folklore collections in the sample was significantly higher than 1%, which means the
data did not support the hypothesis that the turnover rate for these folklore collections
would be less than 1%.

Table 15, the mean relative use factor for these folklore collections was significantly
lower than the test value (M = .58, SD =.26, p < .001). Therefore, data support the
contention that the relative use factor for the folklore collections would be less than 1.0.

Summary of Quantitative Findings
This study called for analysis of the descriptors of age, size, and circulation of
library and folklore collections, along with the calculated turnover rate and relative use
rate of folklore collections, in order to characterize folklore collections for the sample.
The sample comprised 77 elementary school libraries in one large, urban school district.
Descriptive statistics for the sample found that the average elementary school library held
approximately 11,400 items in its collection, with a mean age of collection of 15 years.
The average library circulation totaled 32,400 items. On average, folklore collections in
these libraries totaled 3.96% of the total collection. The folklore collection in the average
library contained approximately 450 items with an average age of just under 19 years and
an average circulation of 708 items. The average library had a folklore circulation rate of
2.28%, a folklore turnover rate of 1.61%, and a folklore relative use factor of .58%.
The analysis showed that the mean percentage of collections comprising folklore
was significantly smaller than recommended by experts in the field of school library
collection development (5% to 8.84%; see Morris 2010, 2004; Kerby 2006). In addition,
132

the mean ages of library collections and folklore collections were significantly higher
than the test value of 14 years. There was not a correlation between age of folklore
collection and circulation of folklore collection. In addition, there was not a correlation
between size of folklore collection and relative use rate of folklore collection. Regression
models predicted the circulation of folklore collections, the turnover rate of folklore
collections, and relative use rate of folklore collections in the sample. The model that
employed size and age of folklore collection to predict circulation of folklore collection
was significant, with size of folklore a strong predictor. Overall, age and size of the
folklore collections accounted for approximately 15% of the circulation of the folklore
collections. There were no other models or predictors that were found to be significant in
the regression analyses. The turnover rate of folklore collection was significantly higher
than the test value of 1%. Finally, the relative use rate of folklore collections was
significantly lower than the test value of 1%. These findings have implications for
collection development and management of school library folklore collections, but in
order to situate this collection analysis in the context of its use, this research also
addressed a qualitative question for research: How is folklore used in elementary school
instruction?
Qualitative Analysis
Participants
For the qualitative phase of this research, thirteen teacher participants were
recruited from five elementary schools in the school district which constituted the
133

quantitative sampling frame. Most participants were women (76.92%). With regard to
age, 46.15% were 50 years or older, 23.08% were between 40-49 years old, 23.08% were
between 30-39 years old, and 7.69% were 29 years old or younger. Participants had a
mean of 18.23 years’ teaching experience. Most teachers had more than 15 years of
classroom teaching experience. The highest percentage (46.15%) had greater than 20
years’ teaching experience, followed by 30.77% of participants with 15-19 years’
experience. Teachers with 10-14 years’ experience composed 15.38% of the sample, and
7.69% of the sample had fewer than ten years’ experience.
Participants reported teaching a number of different grade levels over the course
of their careers. At the time of the interviews, eight teachers (61.54%) taught in grades
pre-Kindergarten through Grade 2, normally comprising students aged 4-8; these grades
fall under the school district and the World Health Organization’s classification of early
childhood (Fort Worth Independent School District 2016; Irwin, Siddiqui, and Hertzman
2007, 5). The remaining five teachers (38.46%) taught Grades 3-5, levels in which
students take an annual standardized state assessment aligned to state standards (Texas
Administrative Code 2008). Spanish was the language of instruction for language arts
and reading for five participants (38.46%). One teacher (7.69%) taught Spanish language
arts in a tested grade, and the remaining four (30.77%) taught Spanish language arts and
reading in grades pre-Kindergarten through Grade 2 (early childhood). Table 16 provides
demographics of the qualitative sample.

Pilot Interviews
The goal in developing the interview protocol for the qualitative phase of this
study was to establish a loose framework of open-ended questions that would allow
participants to construct a cogent narrative about their instructional practices (Charmaz
2006, 27). Three pilot interviews provided data to refine the interview protocol so that it
progressed logically through a description of a teacher’s use of folklore during planning
and instruction. The pilot sample (n=3) consisted of three female teachers with an
average of 16 years’ teaching experience and a mean age of 48 years. Two taught
language arts in Spanish and one in English.
Van Teijlingen and Hundley (2001) note that pilot studies bring to light practical
problems that may arise in qualitative interviews; for this study, the length of time
encompassed by the interview process was a chief concern given time constraints on the
participants. As suggested by Peat (2002) and Van Teijlingen and Hundley (2001), to the
extent possible, the pilot interviews for the study at hand were administered under
conditions mirroring those for the study. The pilot provided for the elimination of
questions that elicited duplicate answers and the addition of prompts for questions not
commonly or immediately understood by the pilot participants. Most prompts facilitated
the use of a common vocabulary; for example, the pilot interviews suggested that listing
“eBooks, big books, board books, print” would expedite participants’ understanding of
questions about the format of school libraries’ folklore collections.

136

Van Teijlingen and Hundley (2001) note that specifying in detail the changes or
adjustments resulting from pilot interviews can add validity to results in the final report
and explain the development of qualitative methodology for a given study (4). For this
study, two strands of close inquiry were emphasized in the interviews as a result of the
pilot study. First, pilot participants’ perceptions of their own lack of background
knowledge for genre-based instruction in language arts prompted a probe for the question
about college coursework as preparation for folklore instruction. Additionally, one pilot
participant remarked on the consequences of using folklore texts without illustrations,
which prompted probes about the need for illustrations in folktales used for instruction.
Community psychology theory suggests that school library collection analysis
should include an assessment of the collection in the context of its use by patrons.
Accordingly, the report of qualitative data from this small-sample case study (Gerring
2007) took the form of an issue-focused account at the level of the concrete (Weiss
1994), where findings were not generalized to a larger population. Using qualitative data
analysis software, transcripts were coded for recurring themes which flowed logically,
one from the other, into a rich description of teachers’ use of folklore in elementary
school instruction. Weiss’s (1994) method of local integration, or sorting codes into
sensible categories, led to inclusive integration, which weaves into “a single coherent
story the otherwise isolated areas of analysis that result from local integration” (160).

Definition of Folklore

Origins in oral tradition. All participants mentioned that folklore originates in the
oral tradition. One participant elaborated upon the difficulty of teaching children about
138

the difference between a reteller and an author when students are just beginning to learn
what an author does: “In Kindergarten, we are still helping them understand who the
author actually is. For folklore, they don’t know – we teach it like: ‘Oh, look. The writer
forgot to write down their name.’”
Origins in a given culture. All participants included in their definitions the origin
of folklore in a given culture, noting the importance of teaching the culture of origin
when teaching a folktale. Participants included cultural instruction in teaching the genre,
whether it was in the context of teaching the foundations of that culture or in the context
of comparing and contrasting the same folktales as told across cultures. Teachers agreed
that folktales served to bring students together in multicultural classrooms in particular:
“What I found out through the years of teaching different cultures is that different
students from different cultures have their own version similar to each story.”
Passed down through generations. Nearly all participants (92.31%) noted that
folklore is passed from generation to generation, noting that a story’s central idea stays
constant over time: “These are stories that stay essentially the same. Same story; same
thought.” A Kindergarten teacher adds, “It helps them understand the concept of time that stories may be from a long time ago.” One fifth grade teacher noted she includes
timelessness in her definition with respect to the cultural dimension of a folktale: “A
folktale could also be old, but it tells about a culture, a group of people - how they have
always lived, what they value, what they do.” Naturally, teachers’ definitions of folklore
tended to be more complex the higher the grade level they taught. Teachers in the tested
139

grades (Grades 3-5, or ages 8-12) included sub-genres in their definitions, like trickster
tales, tall tales, and fairy tales, in response to the definitions included in the state
standards (Texas Administrative Code 2008).
Conveys a moral or lesson. Nearly all participants (92.31%) identified the moral
or lesson of a folktale as integral to its definition. Pre-Kindergarten teachers were the
most vocal about the didactic potential of folktales, with one noting, “We study folktale
lessons in behavior, about truth-telling, about courage, about being generous, hardworking.” Another added, “A lot of our students don’t have stories in their lives to
explain things. These are often bloody, but they are made for children and not for adults
in order to teach important lessons. Like ‘Hansel and Gretel.’ I try to expose children to
all of those things.”
Fiction and humor. One smaller group of participants (38.46%) mentioned that
their definition of folklore included its place in the larger genre of fantasy or fiction.
Fewer participants (30.77%) included the element of humor in their definitions of
folklore. Yet one first grade teacher called humor in folktales the chief draw for her
students, particularly for stories read aloud: “Like, if something happens that’s funny.
And they ‘get’ it. I have some classes who don’t get it. It’s in how you read it and who
reads it. If I read it, they get it.”
Tall tales, tricksters, and animals characters. Three participants (23.08%)
mentioned exaggeration as a characteristic of folktales or included tall tales in their
definition. A smaller percentage of participants (15.39%) defined folklore as containing a
140

trickster character or including characters like the Raven or Anansi. “Folklore has the
strongest characters – kid-friendly,” said one first grade teacher, adding her own
categories to her definition: “We read the Cuckoo tales, the Coyote tales, and the Anansi
books.” Two participants mentioned animal characters and fairy tales in their definitions
of folklore (15.39%).
Participant Background and Content Knowledge
Community psychology theory suggests that providing support services for an
individual requires assessment of that individual in the context of the community (Orford
2008). Likewise, examining school library folklore collections in the context of their use
by patrons is to attempt to see the collection through the same lens as that of teachers
who use the collection in regular classroom instruction (Lukenbill 2002; Enochs 2010a).
Teachers’ editions of the school district’s basal reading series contained a definition of
the genre aligned to state and national standards for language arts instruction (CCSS
2015a). For this phase of research, understanding all sources of participants’ knowledge
about folklore had the potential to explain their assumptions about the school library
folklore collection, and in turn, illuminate its use. Table 18 shows frequencies and
percentages for all methods by which participants gained their knowledge of the genre.
The table lists all sources of knowledge of folklore credited by participants in order of
frequency mentioned; some participants mentioned more than one source of information,
but all described at least one.

On-the-job training. Most participants (76.92%) said they learned about folklore
while working as teachers. This usually meant garnering information from mentor
teachers, administrators, or instructional coaches. “What I know is self-taught and
through picking the brains of other people,” said one Kindergarten teacher participant.
“I basically did my own professional development by asking other teachers,” said
a first grade teacher. Another credits fellow teachers with her understanding of the genre:
“It’s been my colleagues who have taught me the features of text. We learn it from each
other, not in a meeting.” One teacher credited vertical alignment between grade levels in
the district curriculum framework for facilitating the exchange of knowledge among

142

teachers: “In some ways it's nice because you can get ideas from others who are teaching
the same thing at the same time.”
Teachers’ editions and the state standards. More than half of participants
(61.54%) used a teacher’s edition, the state standard, or the school district’s curriculum
framework as a source of information about folklore. Most participants used these as
guidelines for which features of folklore should be included in instruction at a given
grade level. “We don’t get too technical about genre in first grade,” said one participant.
“For me, it’s my own prior knowledge and including that the tale represents culture.” A
second grade Spanish language arts teacher adds: “We find what we need to know in the
framework first. Then we look in the TE (teacher’s edition), and then other sources.
That’s how we do it.” Others credit their definition to the district’s parallel reading
textbook adoption for students who speak English as a second language. “It gives a more
kid-friendly and simple definition of folklore, especially for my strugglers,” said one
third grade teacher. “We never get a definition we can use with children,” said one uppergrade teacher. “We have to make it more kid-friendly.”
Participants worried that their official sources of information about folklore
seemed to offer changing or unstable definitions of literary genres, especially for folklore.
One fifth grade teacher said, “What I’ve noticed in the past couple of years is that there
are definitions of genres in the curriculum that I have never seen before. When I have
changed grade levels recently, the definition of a genre is not what I remember it being. I
read the curriculum definition and thought, ‘This is not the way I’ve always understood
143

it.’” A third grade teacher confirmed the sentiment: “I never taught genres until the past
couple of years. At least, not like they are now.”
Personal knowledge and life experience. Teachers who had grown up hearing
folktales and internalizing the stories considered it a source of information that provided
them with a personal connection to the texts. “I have always been hooked on it. So now I
use them every day,” says one pre-Kindergarten teacher. Added one fourth grade teacher,
“I usually tend to start with my own personal connection to folklore. For example, I grew
up listening to the story of La llorona from my grandmother, so I always make that
connection with children. I give that as an example of folklore.”
College coursework or pre-service teacher preparation. The school district from
which this sample for qualitative study originated organized reading instruction and
language arts curriculum according to literary genre, a global categorization generally
suggested by state standards of instruction (Texas Administrative Code 2008). When
participants were questioned about their preparation teaching genres, fewer than half of
participants (46.15%) recalled learning about the genre of folklore during their
undergraduate teacher preparation courses. One third grade teacher recalled taking a
children’s literature class where reading and assignments were organized by genre; the
others recalled introductory children’s literature survey classes in which the professor
assigned at least one folktale and mentioned one or two features of folklore as a genre.
Just one participant, however, recalled extensive preparation in her undergraduate work:

144

“I had a library science professor for children’s literature. She was my favorite. She
loved literature. We read folktale after folktale.”
College coursework or teacher preparation courses as sources of knowledge of
folklore comprised a significant category for this research not only because answers
revealed that a minority of participants had college-level preparation to teach the subject,
but also because of the forcefulness with which those with no academic preparation
spoke of their lack of scholarly knowledge of genres of literature. “Listen. I have never
received any information about folklore in my course work or professional development.
I just know these stories work for teaching by making a judgment call. I stumbled upon
the way these stories connect the world for children,” said one Kindergarten teacher. “No
professor ever said the word ‘folklore’ to me,” added a third grade teacher.
Professional development. Just 23.08% of the sample, or three teachers,
mentioned learning about folklore during professional development - meetings or
workshops where teachers received training in curriculum and instruction. “I sometimes
use the leveled library they trained us with, where I can get twelve copies of The
Grasshopper and Ant,” said one participant. “The district give us a genre library and
taught us how to use it,” adds another. “We don’t get content in professional
development,” said one teacher who stated none of her knowledge of folklore came from
this source. “We learn to do grades. We learn to use technology. We get the scope and
sequence. But we never learn content.”

145

Teaching Folklore
Student understanding of elements of folktales are required by state standards for
elementary school language arts instruction in Texas beginning in Kindergarten and
increasing in complexity through grade five (Texas Administrative Code 2008; see also
Table X). Participants reported a pattern of instructional strategies for teaching the genre
that corresponds to the increasing rigor of the standard for higher grade levels. Table 19
summarizes participants’ methods of teaching the elements of folklore.
Reading aloud. All 13 participants (100%) taught folklore in part by reading it
aloud to students. “Folktales are always my choice for read-alouds,” stated one
Kindergarten teacher. Other participants confirmed the practice, noting that they read
aloud freely from their classroom libraries of folklore while teaching the genre. “With a
read-aloud, children hear repeated phrases instead of seeing them on the page, like ‘once
upon a time,’ or ‘chinny chin chin.’ We reach auditory learners,” said a first grade
teacher.

Most participants noted that the simple plots and familiar characters in folktales
meant children grasped the storyline easily when read aloud. Five participants (38.46%)
stressed that illustrated titles tended to make the read-aloud a richer, more intense
instructional experience.
Teaching plot or problem and solution. All participants taught plot as an element
of a folktale or fairy tale. Lower grade teachers used kinesthetic instruction: “We hold up
our hands. The thumb is ‘once upon a time,’ the middle three fingers are the three bears,
147

and the pinky is ‘happily ever after.’” One first grade teacher included sequencing in plot
instruction: “We write ten important sentences on the Promethean Board and then move
them to the order they happen.” A pre-Kindergarten Spanish language arts teacher added
specifics, “Cumulative tales are best for teaching plot. There’s a mosquito. He is
swallowed by the frog, which the fish eats and then we put it in order while we hop and
swim. Our Hispanic storyteller Alma Flor Ada is the best for telling Spanish folktales that
teach plot” (see Flor Ada and Escrivá 1999a). Pre-Kindergarten teachers noted that
folktales with repetition and predictable plotlines were used in their classrooms as
vehicles for Total Physical Response (TPR), an instructional strategy for second language
acquisition that involves acting out a story in order to understand its vocabulary (Marsh
1998). Upper grade teachers fused instruction about plot with other literary elements in
folktales: “We cover the characters and settings, problems and solutions, the main idea
and message, the lesson or moral.”
Identifying the moral or lesson. Nearly 85% of participants reported teaching
students to identify the moral or lesson in a folktale, a requirement in the standards
beginning in second grade (Texas Administrative Code 2008). Most participants said they
taught this element by having students find and restate the moral or message of the story.
Verbal retelling. Ten participants (76.92%) mentioned teaching elements of
folklore through teacher and student retelling. Retelling as an instructional practice was
generally modeled by the teacher and then facilitated in literacy centers. One preKindergarten teacher said, “I teach it as a whole group and then they go to the centers and
148

they can pull out a book to look at. It's for them to practice looking at it and recognizing
the story. That's my goal. When they see the pictures they can retell the story.” Other
participants used songs for retelling: “I try to find folktale songs. Once we get the story,
we sing it.” A Spanish language pre-Kindergarten teacher said, “We have TPR lessons
that have a song for every folktale. When children sing it, they are retelling.” A first
grade teacher adds, “Folklore uses so much repetition. I teach that with retelling, like in
The Little Old Lady Who Was Not Afraid of Anything. It’s repetitious. Cumulative. So
much fun.”
Folklore vocabulary and features of text. More than half of participants (69.23%)
reported using explicit instruction to teach vocabulary used in folktales and vocabulary
used in describing the features of a folktale. Teaching folklore means teaching words that
describe its elements. For example, first, second, and third grade teachers described
adding genre-specific words to their interactive word walls, including repetition, folktale,
beginning, and moral. One third grade teacher described teaching genre-specific
vocabulary as a challenge for her struggling readers and students for whom English is
their second language (ESL): “I teach the word and its meaning. We put it in a notebook.
We put it on the word wall. Then I teach it again. And we scaffold; and we scaffold; and
we scaffold. We can make no assumptions about what words children know and what
they don’t.” Other teachers use context clues for vocabulary instruction: “I ask them to
draw what they hear.” One first grade Spanish language arts teacher teaches vocabulary
before a read-aloud: “We look at the picture and try to use the vocabulary word when we
149

are doing the picture walk. Then we go back and read the book.” Spanish language arts
teachers and ESL teachers were adamant that the best folktales for teaching the genre had
detailed, explanatory illustrations. “I show the words in context with the illustrations,”
said one teacher, describing the integration of vocabulary with genre instruction.
Acting out the story, Total Physical Response (TPR), and props. Five teachers
(38.46%) used props, dramatizations, and acting to demonstrate features of folktales in
lessons. “I download props from Pinterest,” said one Kindergarten teacher. Another used
finger puppets to dramatize folktales like Goldilocks and the Three Bears. Early
childhood teachers relied on TPR lessons to supplement vocabulary instruction. One preKindergarten teacher plays every character and dramatizes folktales by himself: “It also
ignites the imagination in children. They always love the stories and role playing.”
Another pre-Kindergarten teacher relies on her dramatizations to explain rudimentary
versions of literary concepts intrinsic to folktales, like exaggeration. She offered an
engaging mental image: “I act it out, and then I ask, ‘Is this real or fantasy? Can someone
drink a whole lake? Can you do that?’”
Constructing a genre anchor chart. Three participants (23.08%) recalled
constructing class anchor charts when teaching folklore as a genre. One Kindergarten
teacher noted her initial surprise when the chart varied from year to year: “I think we
have included everything we should include. And then I see another version on Pinterest
and I think, ‘that anchor chart doesn’t look like mine.” Genre anchor charts, constructed
collaboratively by students during actual classroom instruction and designed to remain on
150

a classroom wall during instruction, remind learners of elements of a folklore text and
provides a means for scaffolding when learning other genres and building on concepts
from previous years’ instruction. One first grade teacher participant confirms: “And we
will have a visual anchor chart that we produce as we go. They vary across years,
depending on the group and on the teachers they've had before. If the other teacher got
into folklore, you can really tell.”
Connecting to other literary genres. Three participants (23.08%) who taught in
grades 3-5 routinely taught elements of folklore by connecting the genre to others they
study. “We talk about plot, character, and theme in everything we read, since they are
tested. I teach setting in a fairy tale, setting in a folk tale, and setting in historical fiction.”
An early childhood teacher adds, “We teach characters in every story. Folktales, nursery
rhymes, poetry.” One third grade teachers connects characters across genres: “We also
find common characters to see how the character changes the message or moral of the
folktale.”
Instructional Activities for Folklore
Teachers in the qualitative sample use several structured academic activities and
assignments to reinforce their instruction in the elements of folklore. Table 20
summarizes activities mentioned by participants for use during folklore instruction.

Plot, problem and solution, and sequencing. All 13 participants (100%) reported
using folktales as a springboard for teaching elements of plot. Teachers used partner
reading to delve into story elements like problem and solution, pairing a strong reader
with a struggling one. The process is a standard instructional strategy for reading
teachers, said one participant, “…And it works exceptionally well with folktales in
Spanish, which tend to be on a higher level.” One third grade teacher noted, “We make a
foldable (flipbook). It pulls out the beginning, middle, and end and the language of a
folktale like ‘once upon a time.’” All participants used folktales in small group guided
reading. One teacher noted: “During the reading they usually turn to the partner and they
152

have to express their reflections on the plot or ask questions. Sometimes it's directly to
me. Some we do it in small groups as a part of our guided reading.”
Writing a folktale, myth, or fairy tale. All participants (100%) used writing and
activities that integrated elements of folklore with writing instruction. Participants
mentioned that they often assigned subjective cloze activities to assess knowledge of the
elements of folklore. But more commonly, participants integrated writing instruction with
genre instruction by asking students to write their own folktales. One Kindergarten
teacher used folktales to convey to students that they, themselves, are writers: “We use
the tales to help them learn that they can come up with alternative endings. The folktales
are especially appropriate for coming up with their versions of the ending. I get a lot
more excitement and willingness to take risks in writing when I am using folktales in that
way. They are more willing to take risks when they are engaged. They get the most
engaged when we are using folktales.”
Some participants assigned students to find the moral or lesson in a tale and then
rewrite the story with a new moral or lesson. Others assigned students to write entirely
new stories that included a sequential mix of folklore or fairy tale elements: ‘once upon a
time,’ a journey, a rescue, the death of a villain, and ‘happily ever after.’ One upper grade
teacher’s writing assignment required students to include a problem, a trickster, an
intelligent character foil, and a solution in a new folktale. A Kindergarten class wrote a
whole-class folktale, using student-identified elements of a folktale: “Last year, I gave
them different fables and it really helped them to come up with their own morals of what
153

the tale was all about. Especially for the theme. I was impressed. It might not have been
the true theme I was looking for, but they come up with it. They could connect.”
Independent reading. All participants required students to read folklore
independently in order to familiarize themselves with the genre. Teachers made
provisions for independent reading in one of two ways: they established a folklore
literacy center using their own books or a classroom library of folklore checked out from
the school library, or they required students to check out a folktale from the school
library.
Retelling a folktale. More than half of participants (61.54%) implemented
instructional assignments requiring students to retell folktales, fairy tales, and myths.
Teachers who made dramatizations and retelling a part of their students’ introduction to
folklore usually turned over the tools of retelling to their students for guided practice and
formative assessment. Early childhood teachers most often used this strategy. “I put the
props in the library center so they can retell the story during center time. We use finger
puppets and costumes,” mentioned one pre-Kindergarten teacher. Participants noted the
importance of retelling in order to scaffold instruction as students progressed through
school, particularly ESL students and those from disadvantaged backgrounds: “Our
regular program kids (who speak only English) in public schools are often their own
version of ESL students. School is their second language. No one has ever read to them,”
said one third grade teacher, speaking of the critical importance of retelling folktales.
“Well, I think these kids don't see (traditional folktales) before they get to our school.
154

Even nursery rhymes, fairy tales. They don't do that like when we were kids. We knew it
before we went to school. I told the nursery rhyme and then I read And the Dish Ran
Away with the Spoon (Stevens and Crummel 2001). They don’t have the background to
understand why this was funny! I had to go back and scaffold with retelling, and then I
had them retell both ways.” An upper grade teacher added, “When we were kids, we read
folktales at a very early stage for reading. But you can't take for granted that every child
has had that experience. So we retell the stories and we repeat the rhymes.”
Relating folktales to the country or culture of origin. Eight participants (61.54%)
used activities that related folktales to their culture of origin. These teachers immersed
students in the culture of a given country. Participants recounted assignments like
coloring maps and singing the songs of a given culture. “We make tamales when we read
Hispanic folktales,” said one participant. Others required students to complete art projects
that situated folklore within a given culture; one teacher’s class made totem poles when
learning about Native American myths. “There's a time in February when we are
celebrating Black History Month. We use Anansi stories then,” said one Kindergarten
teacher, whose students hung construction paper spiders from the ceiling to represent the
trickster.
Comparing and contrasting versions of folklore. In fact, investigating the country
of origin for a given folktale was also chief mechanism for teaching the skill of
comparison and contrast. Six participants (46.15%) compared versions of folktales from
one country with versions from another, including multiple versions of Cinderella or a
155

myth as told in several cultures. “So we usually take and compare and contrast them,”
said one participant. “Is the base of the story the same? Which elements are different?
How are they different? Then we rewrite a totally new version.” Others compared fairy
tales to their fractured fairy tale counterparts. Participants assigned students to write their
own fractured fairy tales after reading aloud a paired selection, like Sleeping Beauty and
Sleeping Ugly (Yolen and Stanley 1981). Other participants made Venn diagrams or Tcharts to facilitate comparison and contrast between versions.
Author study. Two participants (15.38%) assigned activities based on
investigations of multiple folklore titles from a given reteller or author. “I take a little
longer for Tomie and Jan,” said one first grade teacher who maintains an author study
center where students read multiple titles from folklorists like Tomie dePaola or Jan
Brett. “Students use the puppets in the center for retelling. We make our own bordered
illustrations when we study Jan Brett, but for her, we have to learn a lot of vocabulary.
Then for Tomie we learn about the Italian witch and legends.” Participants reported that
structuring the author study as a literacy center supported independent student reading in
the genre by pairing titles with relevant, rigorous activities.
Using Folklore in the Content Areas
Using folklore in elementary school instruction includes teaching elements of the
genre during literacy instruction, even as children are learning to decode text. Participants
in the sample for these qualitative interviews noted that the repetition embedded in the
genre, along with its simple plots, basic characterizations, and didacticism facilitate
156

literacy acquisition while promoting students’ engagement with written text. Yet all
teachers in the sample use folktales, tall tales, fairy tales and myths as unifying elements
in instruction across the content areas. Table 21 summarizes participants’ use of folklore
across the content areas.
Thematic instruction. The participants (100%) reported that they routinely used a
given folktale to unify instruction in more than one subject, lamenting the fact that their
curriculum did not expressly acknowledge this potential of the genre. “The curriculum
makes it hard to teach thematically. We are just not connecting across subjects. We don’t
have the flexibility to move those titles across the curriculum because of what’s supposed
to be covered at a certain time.” The plea was common among early childhood teachers:
“I would like to see folklore included in the curriculum cyclically. We could teach it all
from the same story or the same set of stories. Then we could go back and do it again. I
could do math, science, and literacy all with the same story in a couple of days. And
cover it all at the same time.” The concept suggests that instruction for a given unit
begins with a folktale, chosen for its level of complexity and potential for illustrating
math, science, social studies, and literacy concepts. Throughout the unit, teachers and
students refer back to the mentor text to relate concepts to each other and to the folktale.
Participants said that some administrators permitted thematic instruction in early
childhood grades, even when it meant deviating from the prescribed pace of the
curriculum. For example, teachers spoke of using a single folktale to teach a crosscurricular unit in math, science, social studies, and literacy. One Kindergarten teacher
157

said, “What better way to relate one concept to another than with a folktale? Right now,
they are just supplemental or supportive curriculum, another way to meet the standard,
when they really should be the center of instruction and the unifier. I mean, what better
way to teach plant cycles, money and math, characters, and a moral than Jack and
Beanstalk? It’s just common sense to structure early childhood instruction this way.
Otherwise, we are so disjointed.”

Social studies. All participants mentioned using folktales to teach social studies
concepts. Most introduced a folktale by discussing its country of origin in terms of
geography and culture. “Cultures. Absolutely this is the most important part of teaching a
folktale. I always say that these students are learning language but they are also learning
culture at the same time,” said one upper grade teacher. One third grade teacher
commented on the role of the folktale in teaching her students a social studies lesson:
“Well, I think it’s important to try to represent different cultures when you are teaching
students from different cultures. If everything is Anglo-Caucasian, the students don’t feel
as important if they are from different cultures. If you can bring in Hispanic literature,
and African American literature, and show versions of the same story, they can see that
their cultures have the same story but with characteristics that make it unique.”
Teachers included assignments to research folktales’ countries of origins. A first
grade teacher added, “I use maps. I use globes. We teach the behaviors and beliefs of the
country, like what they eat and how they live. We use a lot of folktales from Russia,
China, Hispanic countries, and Africa.” A Spanish language pre-Kindergarten teacher
sums up his social studies lesson using thematic instruction around The Little Red Hen:
“She encounters community workers, one of our social studies lessons. She can’t get
anyone to help her. When she gets to the baker, the man gives her the piece of firewood
without expectations of anything in return. I have the big book and I make a map of all
the places she went.”

159

An upper grade teacher took a reflective view of her use of folklore to guide her
students through social studies lessons: “You cannot separate social studies from folklore
because it has to do with a society’s traditions and religions and beliefs. For example, a
pourquoi tale goes into beliefs about a greater spirit and being. As a social studies
teacher, I got to teach nature and beliefs of Native Americans using folktales. Even
gender roles are part of social studies and cannot be separated from traditional literature.”
A fourth grade teacher agreed. “Native Americans would use folklore with their totem
poles, a way of passing down traditions. I think it’s the greatest part of folklore. I explain
to my students – you can never lose your traditions, no matter where you go. You can
never lose that tradition that you carry on in your family. Always keep it alive by telling
your stories.”
Socialization and character education. Inquiry into the beliefs and traditions of
other cultures often prompts reflection on a culture’s behavior and moral standards. The
review of literature for this research disclosed that modern retellings of folktales for
children routinely reflect those morals and lessons, the identification of which is included
in national and state standards of curriculum and instruction (CCSS 2015a; Texas
Administrative Code 2008). All interview participants (100%) reported using folktales to
teach character education, mostly in terms of finding the moral or lesson of a story and
applying it to modern, real-life situations. “For character education, I would say it’s
taught as making a connection, bringing over previous knowledge. Usually it’s based on
everyday situations which students can relate to. We are always trying to find the lesson
160

and ask how we apply that in our everyday situation,” offered one fourth grade teacher.
She adds, “I think it’s important for students to understand that no matter what country
they come from they can do what’s right or wrong morally. They gain those lessons from
reading folklore.”
Teachers also use folktales to guide students’ socialization to school culture,
particularly at the beginning of the school year. Five teachers mentioned reading The
Little Red Hen or its fractured folktale analog, Armadilly Chili (Ketteman and Terry
2004), to teach community helpers, classroom jobs, or the rewards of responsible
behavior. Others use folktales to forestall negative classroom conduct and create a sense
of community. Said one first grade teacher, “I start the beginning of the year with the
folktale that talks about why the armadillo has such small ears (Armadillo Tattletale).
That is the first folktale I use and I use it at the beginning of the year no matter which
grade level I am teaching.” The folktale explains the gory consequences of eavesdropping
and tattling (Ketteman and Graves 2000).
Writing with folktales across the content areas. While all participants mentioned
using folktales to teach writing in the language arts, slightly fewer respondents (84.62%)
said they used these stories to teach writing in other content areas. Participants mentioned
the role of folklore in teaching writing, particularly in math and science. “We teach them
that they are the authors, not just other people,” said one Kindergarten teacher. “In third
grade, their imaginations are ready for all kinds of writing,” said one third grade Spanish
language arts teacher. Teachers mentioned that assignments that used a folktale to guide a
161

math or science unit usually included a writing assignment for an explanatory paragraph
relating the science or math work product to the folktale.
Science and math. Eight teachers (61.54%) reported introducing a science concept
with a relevant folktale. For example, “We talk about rainbows, so the Alma Flor Ada
(Ada and Escrivá 1999b) stories work for teaching that as a science concept of it (How
the Rainbow Came to Be/Cómo nació el arco iris). And of course, we use Jack and the
Beanstalk to teach plant cycles,” said one Spanish language Kindergarten teacher. One
Spanish language pre-Kindergarten teacher makes gingerbread and tortillas with students
while teaching The Gingerbread Man and its Hispanic retelling, The Runaway Tortilla
(Kimmel and Cecil 2000), carefully measuring ingredients while teaching the vocabulary
of food science and math. A third grade Spanish language arts teacher reinforced her
students’ math vocabularies in English using Goldilocks and the Three Bears’ words –
big, small, and smallest – as she guided them in creating a bar graph for the story. One
Kindergarten teacher recounted a lesson in mathematical sorting using concepts from
Goldilocks: “We put the cut-outs in piles: papa bear’s chair, mama’s chair, and baby’s
chair.”
General vocabulary. A smaller group of teachers (38.46%) used folklore to teach
vocabulary in the content areas. Some use some conventional methods, including
worksheets, cloze activities, and matching exercises. Others required students to use ten
previously unknown words when implementing a folktale-based writing assignment. “We

162

teach vocabulary and spelling together for the geography, math and social studies words
in the stories,” said one first grade teacher.
Grammar. Three teachers (23.08%) reported using a particular folktale to teach an
element of grammar or syntax. A fourth grade teacher described her method: “We read
one story, The Little Red Ant and the Great Big Crumb (Climo and Mora 1995). There
are a lot of prepositions so I use it to teach grammar along with it.”
Inference and prediction. Three teachers (23.08%) mentioned the value of
folktales for teaching inferential thinking and prediction. One teacher asked students to
predict the next step in a plot of every folktale, given the simplified nature of plot in the
genre. A fifth grade language arts teacher used the folktale to merge inference with
context clues for spotting the culture of a given folktale. “I usually find out where the
story comes from. I ask the students to make predictions based on the colors of the
illustrations, any visuals that we have from the story. Even sometimes from the names or
from the letters. I show them the name and the cover of the books. Then I ask them to
guess where the story comes from. That’s where they begin to understand ‘Oh, that's
from Asia.’”
The Role of the Library
The research question for this phase of study asked: How is folklore used in
elementary school instruction? Community psychology theory suggests that for the
library to provide the most relevant collection, the collection must be examined in the
context of its use by patrons. A chief aim of the interviews was to discover the role of the
163

library folklore collection in providing for the instructional needs of one group of school
library patrons – elementary school teachers.
The teachers in this qualitative phase of research were forthcoming in their
assessment of their library collections. Table 22 summarizes frequencies and percentages
of aspects of use for school library folklore collections mentioned by participants during
the interviews.

Locating folklore for lessons. Teachers located folktales for instructional needs
using a variety of sources. All participants (100%) mentioned their use of curriculum
materials provided by the school district, namely the basal reader from the state-adopted
reading series. Interestingly, one fifth grade English language arts teacher used the state’s
ESL reading series adoption to teach folklore to her non-ESL students instead: “It is a
theoretically advanced genre for struggling readers. They don’t get the higher order
thinking that is involved in finding a moral or a lesson. The ESL materials are more
friendly to my strugglers.”
Teachers supplemented the folktales in the basal reader with other districtprovided materials, including genre libraries and leveled libraries. Genre libraries
provided eight copies for several titles of each genre of literature specified in the district’s
curriculum, organized by Fountas and Pinnell reading level (2016). The district’s
extensive leveled libraries in each elementary school often included multiple copies of a
title that fell into a given genre, but not by design, which meant that finding a folklore
title in the leveled library required an intensive search by the teacher. Still, five
participants (38.46%) mentioned using leveled libraries to teach folklore. They cited
space requirements for the books that meant that the leveled libraries were sometimes
moved without their knowledge or even inaccessible: “We have a list of materials from
the reading department that we are supposed to have. They might be from the textbook.
They might be materials that are on the campus. We sometimes find them when we ask
around.”
165

Nine participants (69.23%) located folktales for lessons on the Internet. “I use
YouTube because I need the audio component for my English language learners,” said
one fourth grade teacher. “I download stories and include them in a packet of reading
material for my students. We keep it under a folklore tab in reading notebooks,” offered a
fifth grade teacher. A pre-Kindergarten teacher added, “I go to the Internet to get pictures
to use for retelling in centers.” A first grade teacher mentioned her own reliance on the
Internet for content knowledge: “I also Google stuff. I get on the Internet and Google it. I
find myself doing that a lot more. The Internet and I are good buddies.” One fifth grade
teachers supplemented her searches of the school library catalog by using Renaissance
Learning/Accelerated Reader’s public search tool, AR BookFinder (2014), noting the
utility of the program for genre and keyword searches in particular.
Seven participants (53.85%) relied on the librarian for assistance in locating and
teaching folklore. One fifth grade ESL teacher said, “During my first years teaching, I
had a hard time finding folktales in the library. But I had a great librarian helping me. I
would tell her and she would prepare a set of books for me and bring them to the class. If
we did not have them, we would borrow them from other libraries.” A Kindergarten
teacher noted, “I ask the librarians. They help me find them in the library.” More than
half of participants (69.23%) used the librarian as a source of instructional expertise for
folklore: “I get some of it from the curriculum frameworks. They'll give us some. But
then if I still have questions I go to my librarian. And then I pull books from her or sit
down and talk to her to get information.” A Kindergarten teacher added, “When we get
166

programs from different parts of the curriculum department, they often don't match, and
that's when we need a centralized suggestion for how to put the thematic units together
for curriculum. I rely on the librarian to tell me how to unify instruction and it can be
done easily with common sense and the use of folklore.”
Six participants (46.15%) searched the online library catalog to find folktales for
their lessons. Another four teachers (30.77%) relied on browsing the shelves for
resources: “I figured out where to look,” said one Kindergarten teacher, while another
said, “I have the information skills to find what I need.” A first grade teacher added, “I go
to the school library and I search during library time. I look on the shelf and I use the
online catalog.”
Library folklore in the classroom setting. Participants mentioned a variety of
instructional strategies for motivating students to engage with folklore as a literary genre
outside the confines of the classroom. Some had the goal of incorporating folklore into
independent reading. All participants mentioned their personal preference for whether or
not they required their students to check out a folktale from the school library. Two
participants (15.38%) required their students to check out a folklore title from the school
library during instructional units covering the genre. Eleven participants (84.62%) did not
require students to check out folklore titles from the library, but their reasons differed.
One Kindergarten teacher said the librarian did not allow her students to check out from
the folklore section of the library because “they have to get books on their reading level.”
Three participants said they didn’t require students to check out folklore because the
167

teachers had already created a folklore library center for students’ free reading during
literacy instruction. A fifth grade teacher elaborated, “Usually they don’t have a chance
because I’ve already gotten (the books) when I begin to teach the genre. So a lot of times
I’ll assemble them for the students in my room and say ‘You need to select from this.’ So
I don't tell them ‘You need to check this genre out,’ because I’ve already done it and
made a center.” One first grade teacher continues: “When they come to the library, it’s
too confusing to require a genre book. If they have free time, I want them to read on their
levels and I want them to have that passion.” A third grade Spanish language arts teacher
adds, “I never assign them to get the personal book as folklore. I think that they enjoy
choosing their own books and what they are going to read. I try to give them the
freedom.”
Four teachers said they didn’t require their students to check out a folktale, but
that students usually came back to the classroom with one: “Normally, library books are
their choice. But they tend to check out the genre that we are studying. If they study them
then they are checking them out.” Another teacher encouraged students to check out
folktales during library time without actually requiring it: “When I know a student is
interested in a concept or a kind of literature, I will bring them to a particular section of
the library, particularly with folktales. I pull them, put them on a table, and they may take
them. That way they can be exposed further.”
In all, eight teachers (61.54%) checked out a group of folklore titles from the
librarian, establishing a classroom library of folklore. One fifth grade teacher explained
168

the strategy: “I also go to the library and do a lot of browsing. I know where that section
is and for me, that's one-stop shopping. Especially when we are doing those genres – I
will go and pull a lot of those books off the shelf, because in addition to whatever we're
reading and discussing in my class I want them using some of their extra time reading
that genre and getting more immersed in it.”
Descriptors of the folklore collection. For this research, examining school library
folklore collections in the context of their use included asking teachers in the qualitative
sample to describe features of folklore titles that made them readily available to teachers,
compatible with instructional objectives, and appealing to students.
Participants in the pilot study for this research made it clear that of all
characteristics that make a folklore title usable in classroom instruction, the most
important is that the book have large, relevant illustrations. “You talk about an ancient
hero or a god or a goddess, and without illustrations, the students just see Jesus,” said one
pilot participant. Teachers in the sample confirmed the finding. Eleven participants in the
study proper (84.62%) mentioned that they looked for titles that had large, relevant,
colorful illustrations, preferably one for each stage of plot, or in the case of early
childhood teachers, one full-page illustration per double-page spread: “They need to be
simple pictures, with one picture per page or per idea, so the child can focus on one
picture and what is happening in that one picture. We need simple, large drawings. We
need them not to be busy.” Of particular importance to the research at hand, each teacher
in that group stated affirmatively that books without large, relevant illustrations held no
169

value for instruction and that they did not check them out. A third grade teacher
acknowledged the role of illustrations in helping students use their imaginations: “Some
of our students are not so good at using their imaginations. For them to hear a story and
see an illustration they love is helpful to give them a starting point.” One first grade
English language arts teacher added perspective: “Beautiful pictures don’t matter if they
can’t understand the story and what I am reading to them.”
All teachers (100%) initiated folklore instruction with a read-aloud, and for most
(84.62%), the read-aloud began with a picture walk – a preview of the title using
illustrations without text in order to scaffold vocabulary, facilitate inference, and identify
elements of plot. One fourth grade teacher described the strategy: “The picture walk is
the most important thing. So we would not even attempt to read a folktale without
illustrations or without looking at the pictures first. It helps to cement those ideas or make
them have a connection to what they are about to read or listen to.” Participants cited
additional reasons for the importance of illustrations to a folklore book. One preKindergarten teacher framed her response in terms of educational theory: “Illustrations
are critical. That’s how they get a new schema about life and work. They can’t go home
and watch a television show about that.” A fifth grade teacher framed her use of visual
images in terms of the future: “The skill in this is visualizing. And I tell my students it is
really important to get little movies playing in your brain. As you go up in age, there will
be fewer and fewer illustrations and the only illustration you might have to give you any
sense of the book is the cover. That’s it. And I say you’ve got to visualize.”
170

A standard instructional strategy for students learning English as a second
language is to pair an image with a new word or a new concept. A fifth grade teacher
whose students were new immigrants explained the implications for using folklore in
instruction: “These students are still learning the language, so visual effects are very
important to them. We cannot teach anything without visuals.” A regular program teacher
added, “Illustrations are their cultural starting point.” In fact, participants used
illustrations in folklore books to support instruction about other cultures. The results were
sometimes surprising: “I ask them to guess and predict where these people come from.
And some never look at the color of the characters’ skin. That's really something that
they do not recognize that. Our students learn to respect culture. We try to make it this
way as a body, as a community. We just do not look at that.”
Format. Ten participants (76.92%) mentioned that format of a library folklore
title was a chief concern for instructional use. Further inquiry indicated that all ten
participants preferred picture-book, print copies of a single folktale. All teachers who
mentioned format preferred picture books as kits - with a CD or mp3 of the audiobook:
“Especially when they are such low readers. I also think that Playaways would be really
good for the kids and centers. It would be a lot easier to set up a listening center.”
The eBook platform in use at the school libraries in the sample for research
required authentication and passwords which had the potential to limit instructional use
of digitally formatted folklore. Three participants in the study proper (23.08%) mentioned
that the process of entering login information kept them from using folklore in eBook
171

formats. “I have these students for 90 minutes a day. I can’t spend ten minutes logging
in.” One teacher noted, “We don’t have devices for proper use of eBooks in centers.” On
the other hand, an equal number of participants mentioned that they used folklore eBooks
regularly to teach listening and comprehension, and to take advantage of interactivity: “If
I use TumbleBooks folktales, it gets the students used to listening for comprehension. I
use eBooks to support the theme, but there is good listening practice. I use the Ziggi
(document camera) with eBooks to zoom in on features of the illustrations.” Other
participants were not familiar with eBook versions of folklore in their school libraries or
said their school library eBooks comprised science or nonfiction titles.
Two pre-Kindergarten teacher participants noted the value of big book formatted
folktales for their preschool students: “We need big books that we can handle and touch.
We use them in whole group settings.” A Spanish language pre-Kindergarten teacher
confirmed: “Big books are best for early childhood. The children turn the pages and I
point at every word I read. They follow the print.” One third grade teacher offered a final
insight about the use of folktales in anthology format with her struggling readers.
“Anthologies show them the common features. Maybe they all have exaggeration. Or
maybe the characters all do the same action. It might be helpful to flip and see ‘Here’s
story number one. I liked it. I think I’ll try story number two.’”
Condition and age. Eight participants (61.54%) mentioned that the condition and
age of library folklore books were a factor when using the collection in instruction. “I use
library folktales almost every day,” offered one pre-Kindergarten teacher. “But the pages
172

are torn and the spine is coming off because the children love the story.” A second grade
Spanish language teacher added, “The books the kids have are often in rough shape. The
books are worn and need to be replaced.” One participant had a similar comment: “I just
gave a book back that was falling apart. It wasn’t in the withdrawn section at all. It was
all about giants but the cover was nearly off.” In general, participants deplored the
condition of the folklore print collection: “Well, a lot of the ones we see have been
through the wringer. Their spines are coming apart. The pages are falling out.”
Age of the participants’ libraries’ folklore collections, on the other hand, was less
of a concern to participants. “To me, I know that when you walk into the school library
you have a feeling that you are walking into an old place. Especially for students who
have never had libraries in their own schools, it's an amazing place. It is a treasure trove.”
One participant added, “If I remember, the age didn’t affect anything. I read The
Runaway Tortilla (Kimmel and Cecil 2000) and compared it with The Gingerbread Man.
The age didn’t really matter.” Only when age of a title affected its condition did
participants notice it: “Our librarian has had to weed a lot of them just because they were
worn.”
Size of the folklore collection. “We have no guarantee that a folktale will be
available in our library even if the curriculum says to use it,” said one participant. Eight
participants (61.54%) mentioned the size of the library folklore collection, all of them
noting that the collection was smaller than they would prefer. Six participants (46.15%)
blamed vertical alignment of the curriculum across grade levels for the shortage of
173

folklore books in the library: “In some ways (vertical alignment is) nice because you can
get ideas from others who are teaching the same thing at the same time. But when you are
going to find a certain genre – well, there are 900 kids in my building and there are not
900 of each folktale we teach in the library.” One third grade Spanish language arts
teacher added that a larger collection would allow them to cover the genre more broadly
in instruction: “We are only going to touch it two times this year in the curriculum. Just
trying to get more materials would be helpful.” Three participants (23.08%) added that a
lack of access to library folktales were the reason they purchased folklore titles with their
own money: “Sometimes when I asked the librarians they said they were all checked out.
I usually buy them in that case.” A Kindergarten teacher added, “I want to use it every
year. It is an investment.”
Reading level. For teachers in the sample, locating folktales in the school library
for use during instruction meant finding an appropriate version of the tale for a given
grade level. Six participants (46.15%) mentioned the reading level of the folklore titles in
their school libraries. Most were reluctant to sacrifice a requirement that students check
out library books at their individual reading levels for the sake of reading a given genre,
like folklore: “I expect my kids to read at their reading level. Every time. Currently, they
must check out a fiction book at their level and then one of their choice. So reading level
comes first.” Spanish language teachers noted that Spanish folklore titles in their school
libraries were at higher reading levels than English folktales, offering strategies to
compensate: “They look for their color in the genre books from the library. Sometimes
174

we don’t have their color and they will have to read with a partner.” Other teachers found
that reading the story aloud during instruction was enough scaffolding to compensate for
the difference: “I just read them aloud for every story. The language is always too
idiomatic for my first graders.” A pre-Kindergarten teacher confirmed: “We have the
story of Rapunzel with medieval artwork (Zelinsky 1997), but little ones can’t get
through it. You strip it down.” A first grade teacher summed up the difficulty of using
higher-level folktales for genre instruction: “If the books are high level, students are not
able to read them. That's probably a reason why we do not do as much with them.”
Community psychology theory suggests that analyzing school library collections
in the context of their use facilitates a collection analysis because it provides a glimpse
into how a collection is read, understood, and integrated into instruction by patrons,
including faculty. For teachers in the qualitative sample for the research at hand, school
library folklore collections support a variety of definitions, instructional strategies, and
pedagogical theories, suggesting that they use folklore extensively to support students’
literacy acquisition, genre awareness, and content area knowledge in the elementary
grades.
Summary of Results
This research combined quantitative and qualitative research in a convergent,
parallel, mixed methods research design in order to address three questions for research:
1. What are features of elementary school library folklore collections?
2. How is folklore used in elementary school instruction?
175

3. Do elementary school library folklore collections support
instruction?
Quantitative analysis. The research design for called for an examination of age,
size, circulation, relative use factor, and turnover rate of the folklore collection in 77
elementary school libraries in one large, urban school district in order to characterize the
folklore collections as they stood at the time of data collection. Descriptive statistics for
the collections disclosed that the average school library held 11,400 items in its
collection, with a mean age of 15 years. The average circulation for one year for the
libraries in the sample was 32,000. The sample had a folklore collection that totaled, on
average, 3.96% of the larger library collection, with an average size of 450 items. Most
folklore collections had an average age of just under 19 years. These libraries circulated
an average of 708 folklore titles each year, which accounted for 2.27% of the average
library’s circulation. In turn, the average relative use factor for folklore collections in
these libraries was 0.58%, while the turnover rate for the folklore collections was 1.61%.
The analysis showed a strong postitive relationship between the size of the library
collection and the size of its folklore collection. There was a similar positive relationship
between the age of the library collection and the age of folklore collections. Analysis also
revealed positive correlations between the circulation of a library collection and
circulation of folklore collections and between the circulation of the library collection and
the turnover rate of the folklore collection. In addition, the percentage of the circulation
of the folklore collection showed a positive relationship with the relative use rate of the
176

folklore collection, which in turn had a positive correlation with the turnover rate of the
folklore collection. Age of the folklore collection showed no relationship to the
circulation of the folklore collection or to its relative use. On the other hand, size of the
folklore collection showed a positive correlation to its circulation, but did not correlate to
an increase in its relative use.
Regression models predicted the circulation of the folklore collections in the
sample. The model was significant, with size of the folklore collection showing a strong
positive relationship with the circulation of the folklore collection. Age of the folklore
collection, on the other hand, showed no relationship to its circulation. Age and size of
the folklore collection did not predict its turnover rate nor its relative use.
Qualitative analysis. A sample of thirteen highly experienced elementary school
language arts teachers participated in the qualitative phase of research. After a pilot study
to refine the interview protocol, participants answered a series of open-ended questions
designed to construct a narrative about their instructional practice. More than 90% of the
teachers in the sample for this research shared a four-pronged definition of folklore:
•

Folktales originate in the oral tradition.

•

Folklore originates from a given culture.

•

Folklore is passed down over time from generation to generation.

•

Folklore offers a moral or lesson.
Participants mentioned five sources of their own content knowledge of the genre,

including on-the-job training; teachers’ editions, state standards, and curriculum
177

frameworks; life experience; college coursework and teacher preparation programs; and
professional development. Teachers used an assortment of instructional strategies and
activities to familiarize students with traditional literature, increasing the descriptors of
the genre and the complexity of activities with the reading level and grade of the student.
Participants used folklore to teach literacy, math, science, social studies, and social skills.
More specifically, participants saw a place in the curriculum for the use of folktales as
mentor texts in thematic instructional units that spanned the course of the school year,
particularly for early childhood grades.
Participants generally located instructional materials and folktales through their
curriculum and the internet. They supplemented instruction by locating folklore in the
library, most often by asking the librarian for help and instructional expertise. More than
half checked out a classroom library of folklore while teaching it, which they said
resulted in frequent shortages of library materials. Most participants commented on the
importance of illustrations to a folklore title used in instruction, their preference for print
materials, and their desire for newer folklore titles in better condition.
Borin and Yi (2008, 2011) stipulate that a cumulative collection analysis includes
flexible methodology, resulting in a more dependable profile of a collection's strengths
and weaknesses. Kelly (2014) and Knievel, Wicht, and Connaway (2006) noted that a
cumulative model of analyzing a collection includes multiple perspectives and many
sources of data. Considering these results collectively facilitates an answer to the third
question for research – Do elementary school library collections support instruction?
178

CHAPTER V
DISCUSSION
This research arose from a long-standing, scholarly concern that school library
collections may not align with the needs of their school communities. More specifically,
a given classification of the collection may be aged, insufficient, neglected, and irrelevant
to the students and teachers who use it for free reading or in modern pedagogy (Enochs
2009). In fact, one review of the literature revealed that school library collections are
rarely evaluated using inferential statistical methods that can provide descriptive and
inferential conclusions about use and condition (Enochs 2014). Furthermore, framing a
collection analysis through the theoretical lens of community psychology theory suggests
that a library collection assessment is not complete without consideration of the
collection in the context of its use by patrons (Lukenbill 2002). This study used a
cumulative, mixed methods model of collection analysis to examine the folklore
collections in 77 elementary school libraries of one large, urban school district.
The rationale for this research outlined the history of literature-based literacy
instruction in light of the unique ability of folktales, myths, fairy tales, and fables to
communicate the values of a civilized society. Current standards for language arts
instruction in nearly all states specify the use of folklore, fairy tales, and myths in
curricula, alongside requirements for student knowledge of the genre as early as age five
(Texas Administrative Code 2008; CCSS 2015a). The review of the literature for this
179

research outlined the modern role of folktales, myths, legends, and fairy tales in literacy
instruction, character education, social studies instruction, math and science curricula,
instructional assessment, and character education.
For this analysis, community psychology theory suggested that determining the
support of these school libraries’ collections for instruction must take place in the context
of their use by patrons. The most constructive collection evaluations are those where
findings lead to change that empowers a school community, particularly students for
whom the school library is their chief source of reading material. It follows that a
statistical examination of the age, size, and use of elementary school folklore collections
without specific attention to their use actually could be more detrimental than beneficial
due to misapplication of noncontextualized findings (Orford 2008).
This research used descriptive and inferential statistical methods to examine the
folklore collections in the elementary school libraries of one large, urban school district
in order to address the research question: What are features of elementary school library
folklore collections? The second phase of this mixed methods study included qualitative
interviews with a small sample case study of practicing elementary school language arts
teachers at the schools in the quantitative sample in order to address the question: How is
folklore used in elementary school instruction? The convergent, parallel, mixed methods
research design for this study includes one last question for synthesis of the findings: Do
elementary school library folklore collections support instruction?

180

Findings
The results of the quantitative phase of this research included analysis of a crosssectional, one-time snapshot of 77 elementary school library collections in the school
libraries of one large, urban school district as those collections existed for one school
year. Seven hypotheses predicted the condition of these poetry collections as they were at
the time of data collection, without regard to experiment or treatment:
H1. Folklore collections in the sample are smaller than the size recommended by
experts in the field of school library collection development.
H2. The average age of folklore collections exceeds state standards for an
acceptable elementary school collection.
H3. Older folklore collections circulate less than more recently published
folklore collections.
H4. Larger folklore collections circulate more than smaller folklore
collections.
H5. Age and size of the folklore collections predict their use.
H6. The mean turnover rate for folklore collections in the sample will be
less than 1.0.
H7. The mean relative use factor for folklore collections in the sample will
be less than 1.0.
Values for nine variables describing the collections furnished the data set for
analysis: age of the collection, age of the folklore collection, size of the collection, size of
181

the folklore collection, circulation of the collection, circulation of the folklore collection,
percentage of the collection comprising folklore, relative use factor for the folklore
collection, and turnover rate for the folklore collection. Analysis of the quantitative data
revealed a group of aged school library collections with folklore sections smaller than
recommended and circulation generally less than their sizes might indicate. As suggested
by community psychology theory, the quantitative findings are merged here with
explanatory data from faculty interviews in the qualitative phase of research in order to
address the question: Do elementary school library collections support instruction?
Size of the Folklore Collection
H1: Folklore collections in the sample are smaller than the size recommended by
experts in the field of school library collection development. Recommendations for the
size of the folklore collection in an elementary school library – the Dewey 398s – are tied
closely to recommendations for the size of the entire Dewey 300s section (social
sciences. Morris (2010, 2004) has suggested that 5-8.84% percent of the collection
should comprise titles in the 300s, while Kerby (2006) suggests that 5% of the collection
comprise folklore. Morris and Kerby’s figures for the classification are widely accepted
in the profession to be general guidelines for the size of the elementary school folklore
collection rather than standards. One reason is that cataloging for school libraries can be
variable when it comes to Dewey classification for folklore titles. Librarians may classify
those titles with a lower reading level or with larger illustrations in easy fiction rather
than the Dewey 398s, resulting in a slightly skewed take on the measurement of size of
182

the folklore collection from the online catalog. Furthermore, the Texas school library
standards do not give specific guidelines for the size of segments of the library collection,
specifying instead the number of items per student or a given size of the entire collection
required for designation as a below standard, acceptable, recognized, or exemplary
library program (Texas State Library and Archives Commission 2005).
Clearly, the data support the contention that the folklore collections in this study
are smaller than recommended. Primary analyses indicated that the average percent of the
collection comprising folklore was well below the lower test value of 5%. In fact, the
average folklore collection in the sample contained 450 items, and the average percentage
of the collection comprising folklore was 3.96%. The majority of libraries had a
collection comprising 3.5 to 4.49% folklore, still well below the lower end of the size
range recommended by experts. To put the finding in perspective, in a library with a
collection of 11,434 items – the mean collection size for the sample – the folklore
collection should total 572 to 1011 items, but the average folklore collection in the
sample contained just 450 items. Half of the folklore collections in the sample contained
441 titles or fewer.
While this is a troubling statistic, it is in line with the qualitative finding that
teachers noted a shortage of library folklore titles during intervals in the curriculum
framework when many grade levels covered the genre at the same time. This is likely due
in part to the instructional practice of checking out a large number of folklore titles and
keeping them in the classroom for independent reading in literacy centers. Vertical
183

alignment in the curriculum meant that teachers across grade levels tried to follow this
practice concurrently, thereby removing much of the collection to classrooms. In
addition, 31% of the participants in the qualitative sample noted that students often
checked out folklore titles as they learned more about them, even in the absence of a
requirement to do so. In the end, teachers’ instructional practice strongly influenced
collection use for folklore in these school libraries, which in turn highlighted a general
quantitative shortfall in the collections. Merging findings from the two phases of research
makes a strong case for expanding folklore collections in these school libraries to meet
minimum recommendations.
Additional observations. Analyzing the relationship between the size of the
collection and the percentage of the collection comprising folklore offers an additional
statistic that sheds light on the collection development practices in the school libraries in
the sample. Librarians at the schools in the sample would appear to understand the need
for a large folklore collection; the larger the size of the total collection in the libraries in
the sample, the larger the percentage of the collection comprising folklore (see Table 12).
In previous studies (Enochs 2009, 2010a), an association between these two variables
was considered a measure of the health or neglect of the collection under study. In the
case of the study at hand, as librarians expand the larger collection, they are likely
purchasing folklore titles. Considered in light of the mean size of these folklore
collections, however, acquisitions of folklore titles are not sufficient to build the folklore
sections to the goal of 5-8.84% of the collection.
184

Age of the Folklore Collection
H2: The average age of folklore collections exceeds state standards for an
acceptable elementary school collection. Standards for school libraries in Texas, the
location of the school district which served as the sampling frame for this research,
specify that the school collection should be less than 15 years old in order to be ranked as
an “acceptable” collection (Texas State Library and Archives Commission 2005). The
consideration of individual classifications or genres is not included in the state’s
standards, but the standards note that librarians should pay “special attention … to
specific disciplines” when it comes to managing the age of the collection (2005; see also
Enochs 2009).
Primary analyses for this research indicated that the average age of the library
collection and the average age of the folklore collection in this sample were both greater
than the test statistic of 14 years. In fact, most library collections were 15 years old, and
the majority of folklore collections were 18 years old. The data support the hypothesis
that folklore collections were older than the state standard suggests. Furthermore, older
folklore collections were associated with older library collections, an association that
could mean that older folklore collections were not maintained intentionally, but were
instead the result of not weeding an entire collection.
In the case of the folklore collection, keeping a book without regard to its age
could constitute sound practice – at least from the point of view of the teacher. The
information that the average folklore title in the school libraries in the sample was 18
185

years old at the time of data collection is startling. Yet Morris (2010) makes specific
recommendations for avoiding any weeding of the school library folklore collection for
age, advising school librarians to: “Remove materials on customs and folklore only
because of poor condition” (452). Likewise, the American Association of School
Librarians’ (AASL) flagship publication on school library collection development,
developed in alignment with the AASL Standards for the 21st Century Learner (2007),
specifically sidestepped age of the library collection as a valuable metric, saying such
metrics were “… useful measures that carried weight with funding and accreditation
bodies in the past, but those measures said very little about the quality, the kinds of
materials in those collections, who had access to them, or how they were used. These
standards were one-size-fits-all measures that failed to address local contexts, such as
demographics, teacher styles, or the varying characteristics of students, families, and
communities” (Kimmel 2014, 72). In fact, teacher participants in the qualitative phase of
this research would seem to confirm the AASL position. While 62% of participants
mentioned that folklore titles in their school libraries seemed old, they added that the age
of the book did not affect its instructional potential unless it meant the title were in poor
or unusable condition. Even then, teachers in the sample used the books anyway,
requested replacements, or bought their own copies. From the professional perspective of
the librarian, these arguments fail to account for the ability of newer titles to mitigate
troubling folklore titles which include outdated stereotypes, language, and illustrations –
all of which can taint students’ nascent perceptions of literature and society.
186

Merging findings from both phases of this study makes a strong case for
meticulous maintenance of the school library folklore collection, resisting weeding solely
on the basis of the age of a title, and replacing titles that become unusable. Furthermore,
as standards for school library collections evolve, these findings support the argument
that establishing a single age for all classifications in the school library may be
counterproductive when it comes to developing a school library folklore collection that
supports instruction. Age of the folklore collection may be irrelevant to teachers who
have established practices for use of a given title in the classroom, but it must be
balanced with cultural sensitivity present in newer titles. It follows that keeping folklore
titles longer than recommended in a school library has particular implications for use.
Circulation of the Folklore Collection
The average library collection in this sample circulated 32,441 times over the
course of the school year under study. The folklore collections in the sample circulated an
average of 708 times per school during the same year, which means that folklore
circulation accounted for just 2.27% of the average library’s circulation in the sample.
The average library collection comprised 3.96% folklore in the Dewey 398s.
Older research has confirmed the generally negative correlation between the age
of a library collection and its circulation (Bertland 1991; Ettelt 1986); on the whole,
newer collections tend to circulate more than older. For this research, older collections
circulated less than newer collections (see Table 12). Furthermore, previous research in
school library collections substantiated specifically that newer poetry collections in
187

school libraries circulated more than older poetry collections (Enochs 2009, 2010a). In an
effort to clarify that finding for other single classifications in the school library, this
research included three inferential hypotheses predicting an association between variables
regarding the circulation of the folklore collection.
H3. Older folklore collections circulate less than more recently published folklore
collections. This hypothesis predicted an association between the age of the folklore
collection and the circulation of the folklore collection. The hypothesis was based on
previous findings in library collection analysis research that found a negative association
between age of a classification in the collection and its use (Bertland 1991; Ettelt 1986;
Enochs 2009, 2010a). Put simply, older collections circulate less often. However,
analyses of this sample indicated no such association between variables; the data did not
support this hypothesis. Analyses demonstrated that folklore circulation in these libraries
was not associated with the age of the collection, a finding confirmed by data from the
qualitative phase of this research. Teachers in the qualitative sample reported that they
used a folklore title no matter its age, provided it fit their requirements for instruction or
their needs for a classroom library to support students’ independent reading.
H4. Larger folklore collections circulate more than smaller folklore collections.
Analyses showed a positive association between the size of the folklore collection and its
circulation; data supported this hypothesis. Put simply, for this sample, the larger the
folklore collection, the higher its circulation. A majority of teachers in the qualitative
sample observed a corollary to this quantitative finding, mentioning an empirical
188

observation that students checked out many folklore titles in the library once they learned
about them. For the teachers in the sample, this obviated any instructional requirement
that students themselves check out a book in the genre.
Interestingly, previous research in this line of inquiry (Enochs 2009, 2010a) had
shown no relationship between the size of the school library poetry collection and its use,
suggesting that simply enlarging the poetry collection would have no impact upon its
circulation. In the case of the folklore collections in this sample, the opposite would
appear to be true. Furthermore, findings from the qualitative phase of this research
indicated that the majority of teachers (62%) mentioned a shortage of materials in the
collection and noted that the shortage had affected their instructional practice. Enlarging
the folklore collection is a sound strategy for collection development in these libraries.
H5. Age and size of the folklore collections predict their use. This analysis used
multiple linear regression to find out how much of the circulation of the folklore
collections in the sample was due to their age or size. These are both variables over
which the librarian in charge of developing and managing the school library folklore
collection has exclusive control. As suggested by previous quantitative studies of school
library collections (Enochs 2009, 2010a), the intent of regression analysis also was to
discover whether or not any portion of circulation of the folklore collection might be due
to other factors other than the age and size of the collection.
The overall model was significant, but results of multiple regression analysis
showed that size of the folklore collection was the only predictor of its circulation; age of
189

the folklore collection was not. In fact, analyses showed that 14.9% of circulation of
these folklore collections was accounted for by their size. Of course, this finding also
indicates that about 85% of circulation of folklore in these school libraries was accounted
for by factors other than the size of the folklore collection. However, merging qualitative
findings from teacher interviews with this quantitative metric discloses an unmistakable
message for collection management: simple expansion of the folklore collection in the
school library will support instruction and provide for independent reading needs of
students. Furthermore, given the positive relationship between the size of the folklore
collection and its circulation, expansion has the potential to increase circulation of the
genre.
H6. The mean turnover rate for folklore collections in the sample will be less than
1.0. Collection turnover rate is defined as circulation divided by the number of items
owned (Greiner and Cooper 2007). The figure represents average circulation per item if
use were spread evenly across the collection (Everhart 1998; Enochs 2009). This
hypothesis predicted that the average use for a given folklore title in these collections
over the school year would be less than one, which indicates underuse (Lancaster 1993).
The measure is based on the idea that a chief assumption when adding a title to a
collection is the expectation that it will be used.
However, analyses did not support the hypothesis predicting underuse. The
average turnover rate for the folklore collections in this sample was 1.61%. In fact, the
majority of folklore collections in this sample had a turnover rate between 1.5% and
190

1.99%. Were use spread evenly across these collections, most folklore titles would have
circulated more than 1.5 times each.
The collection turnover rate can be a capricious measure of use, given that a
library emphasizing highly popular materials but maintaining little subject depth in a
collection will usually exhibit a high turnover rate for materials (Montana State Library
2015; Everhart 1998). However, for school libraries – whose collections generally follow
guidelines for size of a given classification and which support state standards of
instruction instead of the preferences of patrons – the measure can give important insight
into circulation, particularly within a given subject classification (Enochs 2014). Other
studies have found a correlation between the age of collection and the collection turnover
rate (Jones 2007), meaning that the lower the age of the collection, the higher the
turnover rate – leading to a recommendation that a decline in funding should not deter
weeding of older materials. However, the analyses of the folklore collections in this
sample found no correlation between turnover rate and age or size of the collection. In
fact, the high turnover of folklore in the libraries under study indicates higher than
expected use for these folklore collections without regard to age or size of a given title.
Everhart (1998) noted that a high turnover rate occurs when a library has high
circulation compared to collection size, a fact confirmed by Van House and Zweizig
(1987). It follows that the higher-than-expected turnover for these folklore collections
could suggest that the collections are in need of expansion, which unquestionably was
confirmed by the qualitative findings for this study. Teachers routinely mentioned a lack
191

of folklore titles, mainly at times during the year when all grade levels were teaching
similar curricula.
Interestingly, other research indicates that turnover rate is a better predictor of
future use than multiple linear regression (Greiner and Cooper 2007; see also Brooks
1984). Brooks (1984) compared the two methods for prediction of use and found that
turnover rate edged out linear regression for predicting use in the collections under study.
However, as Greiner and Cooper (2007) note, one assumption of the predictive value of
the turnover rate is that there be no change in the collection over time. That assumption
notwithstanding, for the sample at hand, the metric as a predictor would imply that
folklore collections maintained at their current sizes would see at least a mean turnover
rate of 1.64% during any given school year. The suggestion follows that adding to the
average collection would result in that level of use at the very minimum. While the lack
of correlation between age of these folklore collections and their circulation would seem
to support this assumption, other research generally indicates an increase in use follows
weeding, promotion of a given collection, and expansion of holdings (Bertland 1991;
Enochs 2010a; Lancaster 1993). If anything, the results of the multiple linear regression,
viewed in light of the turnover rate, would suggest that expanding the collection has the
potential to increase use above its level at the time of this study.
H7. The mean relative use factor for folklore collections in the sample will be less
than 1.0. The relative use factor is a calculated metric which shows the results of dividing
the percent of circulation for which folklore was responsible by the percent of collection
192

comprising folklore. A relative use factor of 1.0 would indicate that the folklore
collections were circulating in direct proportion to their availability in the average school
library – or the collection was the right size for the school’s needs.
For this research this hypothesis predicted underuse of the folklore collections in
relationship to their percentage of the larger school library collection (Gavigan 2014;
Lancaster 1993). The data supported the hypothesis that the mean relative use factor
would be less than 1.0. The mean relative use factor for the folklore collections in the
sample was 0.58%. The review of the literature for this research disclosed that Ochola
(2002) and Mills (1982) multiplied the relative use factor by 100 in order to facilitate
understanding of the metric as percent of expected use. In keeping with this suggestion
for interpretation of findings, for the average folklore collection in this sample, the
percent of expected use was 58%.
Bertland (1991) and Greiner and Cooper (2007) suggest that a reasonable
benchmark for determining a relevant size for a given classification in the library
collection is congruence between collection size and collection use. In a public library, if
a section of the collection is disproportionately larger than its use, it is an indicator that
the classification is in need of deselection or that the library has purchased unpopular
materials. However, for this analysis, evaluation of this metric must take place in light of
the purpose of collection development in the school library, and in this case, in absence
of a relationship between circulation and age of the folklore collection.

193

School library collections support curriculum and instruction and the free reading
needs of students, rather than simply the reading preferences of patrons. Previous
research in this line of inquiry (Enochs 2010a) suggested that a disparity between use and
collection size does not necessarily indicate the need for weeding, particularly in the case
of a school library collection where size of the collection is dictated by standards and
experts in the field of school collections (Morris 2010, 2004; Kerby 2006). Instead, it
indicates the need to explore the metric from other perspectives (Enochs 2009, 2010). In
this case, the qualitative findings offer a unique insight into the relative use factor.
Teachers in the qualitative sample for this study tended to offer a common definition of
folklore and common practices for instruction, the most telling of which was the use of a
classroom set of folktales, myths, tall tales, and fairy tales checked out from the school
library and used to stock their literacy centers while they taught the genre. Frequently,
this meant that folklore titles from the library were unavailable for circulation to students
because they had been removed to classrooms for extended use by teachers. If their
preferred materials were unavailable, teachers bought the books themselves, used districtprovided resources, or downloaded materials from the Internet. Possible explanations for
the low mean relative use of these school library folklore collections include the practice
of teachers checking out the same large groups of folklore titles for a classroom library
for extended periods at different times of the year. Given their instructional practices,
teachers’ preferences for particular titles could be common across grade levels, which
could explain a high turnover rate but a low relative use factor for these collections.
194

Furthermore, folklore titles may circulate mainly at a few times during the instructional
year when folklore as a genre falls under close study in the classroom.
Other Findings
Condition of the folklore collection. Teachers in the qualitative sample viewed
folklore collections in their school libraries as old and in need of careful maintenance.
Yet quantitative findings demonstrated a positive correlation between the size of the
folklore collection and its circulation, which would indicate that keeping folklore titles
without regard to their age is likely a best practice for these libraries. Retaining a title
does not mean keeping it beyond its usable life, however. The forcefulness with which
interview participants mentioned the shabby condition of the folklore titles they used
from their school libraries indicates that condition of a title could preclude its use for
instruction, and in turn, its potential to satisfy the independent reading needs of students.
Furthermore, one issue of terminology likely confounded these findings. Age of the
collection for these analyses refers to the date of publication, not the date of acquisition
of a title. Teachers’ perception of the meaning of the descriptor age were likely in
reference to the date of acquisition, and the resulting length of use by patrons of the
library, rather than to the publication date of a given book. This difference was not
explained during the interviews in an effort not to influence the participants or findings.
The qualitative findings from this research suggest that collecting folklore titles
for elementary school libraries may governed as much by the art of librarianship as by its
science. These findings suggest that the best folklore collections for use in genre
195

instruction are available in print and have large, colorful illustrations – perhaps one per
double-page spread. Folklore collections facilitate the read-aloud and its correlate, the
picture walk, allowing readers to anticipate elements of plot, character, setting, and
theme. Folklore collections are plentiful, wide-ranging, and may even contain multiple
copies of those titles used regularly by the school community. Where possible, folktale
retellings should span time periods and cultures in order to offer bases for comparison
and contrast of themes and lessons in the tales. Collections cover common folklore
typologies, including pourquoi tales, cautionary tales, and cumulative tales. Structural
elements in a given folktale title, including those in myths, legends, and tall tales, are
straightforward to facilitate children’s acquisition of story structure through the lens of
the genre of folklore. Folktales in the school collection span the reading levels and the
interest levels of the students in the school community, and include titles in kit format or
that contain CD/DVDs to complement instruction. Cultural representations are modern,
without judgment or stereotype, with illustrations and vocabulary that portray the social
norms of the country of a folktale’s origin.
In her influential work on cultural sensitivity in school libraries, Agosto (2001)
notes that school librarians are well within their roles in promoting folklore and other
literature from the dominant cultures represented in a given student body. She argues that
children construct textual meaning and acquire literacy through the lens of culture. The
qualitative findings from this research and its literature review suggest that teachers
understand this as an integral reason for using folklore in literacy instruction.
196

Furthermore, community psychology theory, which guided this research, suggests that
collections must be analyzed in the context of their use. It follows that school collections
developed with sensitivity and recognition of the cultures of the school community are
those which will see use most beneficial to the acquisition of literacy.
An additional consideration from the qualitative findings of this research was
teachers’ felt need for professional development in genre studies. The CCSS and the state
standards require instruction using folklore. Adding reference sources to the school
library professional collection has the potential to address teachers’ need for support in
genre-based literacy instruction.
Limitations
Generalizability, Validity, and Transferability
Quantitative findings. The results of this non-experimental, cross-sectional study
are not generalizable to elementary libraries outside the school district which provided
the sampling frame. While the sample was large for a study of this type, all schools were
in the same school district and subject to similar rules and limitations on collection
development. As noted in previous research in this line of inquiry (Enochs 2009, 2010a),
expanding the analysis to more than one school district’s school libraries in a wider
geographic area would add to the validity and generalizability of findings while
diminishing sampling bias and error variability occurring in the research design for this
study. Yet Van Orden, Bishop, and Pawelak-Kort (2001) advised against statistical
comparisons between collections because different schools house different collections
197

(see also Lafferty 2014 and Bradford 2014). This is particularly true for collections in a
large sample such as the one at hand, although this study controlled for calendar and
grade levels of instruction. However, to generalize these findings to other libraries and
other collections was not the purpose of this research, which sought instead to establish a
cumulative, mixed methods model of collection analysis for one district’s elementary
libraries.
In addition, other studies have noted that the online catalog accounts for
circulation of the collection only to the extent that the librarian is vigilant in recording it
(Enochs 2009). For example, in elementary schools in particular, the system may not
account for renewals of a given circulation – especially in the absence of fines and their
enforcement for very young patrons. Lancaster has noted that actual library circulation
may be as much as six times what is actually recorded (1993). However, the intent of this
cross-sectional design was not to produce generalizable findings, but to illustrate the
results and potential of a research based, cumulative model of collection analysis for
school libraries seeking to evaluate their collection in the context of its use by patrons.
One confounding variable not accounted for by this research was idiosyncratic
shelving of the folklore collection in these libraries. Librarians in the school district under
study may have reclassified folklore in easy fiction or fiction sections of the library. Nor
does this research account for genre shelving, which can alter accessibility of the
collection for patrons. Librarians may have shelved graphic novels, picture books, very
low level titles, or story collections and folklore anthologies separate from the bulk of the
198

folklore collection. Librarians may have stored titles classified in Dewey 398 but in kit
format with a CD or DVD alongside a separate audio/visual collection. Likewise, class
sets of folktales, tall tales, myths, or fairy tales accounted for in the online catalog under
one barcode may show lower circulation than what actually takes place. Such variability
in professional practice is common in studies of use but should not counteract the force of
the results, which lie chiefly in the creation of this model of cumulative collection
analysis.
Qualitative analysis. The question of generalizability commonly is a question for
quantitative research, which often seeks to follow a methodology intended to produce
findings generalizable from sample to population. For qualitative findings, on the other
hand, generalizability and validity shift to the consideration of credibility of findings.
Charmaz (2006) lists criteria for evaluating the credibility of qualitative research, chief
among them a consideration of whether the research has achieved intimate familiarity
with the setting or topic (182). To that end, the credibility of this study can be established
by the in-depth nature of the semi-structured interviews for the qualitative phase of
research. Thirteen teachers carefully addressed a loosely structured interview protocol
designed to construct a narrative about their professional practice in teaching the genre of
folklore in elementary reading instruction. The result was a shared definition of folklore,
a list of common practices for teaching reading using literary genre as a lens for
comprehension, and a glimpse into patron perceptions of the library as a source of
instructional support. Charmaz (2006) also evaluates credibility in terms of the
199

sufficiency of the data – whether they reflect a range and quantity to frame the issue
accordingly. Clearly, the careful and considered responses of the participants fulfill this
criterion.
The transferability of this study lies in its originality, its mixed methodology, and
its use of community psychology as a theoretical framework. Other studies have not
explored the use of the folklore collections in the school library by faculty in order to
explain patterns of collection use. The result of this research is a cumulative model of
collection analysis for elementary libraries which can be refined and extended in future
studies. Charmaz (2006) uses the term resonance to evaluate transferability and
dependability in qualitative studies. Evaluating a study’s resonance means asking if a
theory resulting from research makes sense to the participants or people who share their
circumstances (183). This construct holds particularly relevance for research framed in
community psychology theory. The model of collection analysis put forward by this
research resonates with school librarians, district library directors, and teachers for whom
it provides a workable model for analyzing a collection in the context of its use.
Other Limitations
Circulation is the measure of the use of a book in this research. Greiner and
Cooper (2007) note that circulation is objective, measurable, and recorded, but in the end,
it offers only an indication of interest to a patron. A recorded circulation measures only a
patron’s interest at a given moment - not whether or not a teacher actually used the book
in a lesson or a student actually read it. Lafferty (2014) notes that circulation studies in
200

school libraries generally measure exposure to a subject, title, genre, or concept, and must
be cast in that light.
Future Research
Bertland (1991) used the relative use factor to compare the use of different
sections of a middle school library without regard to their size. The metric levels the
playing field, so to speak, for evaluation of different classifications within one library and
among many school libraries, and can provide a window into performance of a collection
that has been developed primarily according to standards rather than by user preference.
Future iterations of this model of cumulative collection analysis should consider the
relative use factor of the collection under study against the relative use of other
classifications in libraries in the sample.
In the same vein, Hibner and Kelly (2013) note that circulation statistics have
more meaning for collection development when they are observed for a specified time
frame – usually a period of years rather than over a single school year. As a measure of
collection popularity, a longer time frame for measuring use could have particular
resonance as an assessment of popularity of a given collection, and in the case of
folklore, of the popularity of a given set of titles.
At least two recent studies in the academic library literature have assessed library
collections in terms of their support for student learning outcomes (Bodi and MaierO’Shea 2005; Pan, Ignacio, and Bruehl 2014). Conducting a detailed analysis of folklore
collections to assess their support of specific standards in the CCSS or other state
201

standards could lead to closer alignment between the collection and patron needs. Ho and
Loertscher’s (1985) method of collection evaluation – collection mapping – uses a similar
strategy to map a collection to curriculum.
One recent and seminal school library collection analysis looked at high school
collections for evidence of student use of multicultural titles (Lafferty 2014). Findings
indicated that students were not checking out multicultural literature from their school
libraries. The author’s recommendations included improving the cultural competencies in
education for school librarianship (208). The suggestion has resonance for future research
in this line of inquiry, given that fewer than half of the teachers (46.15%) in the
qualitative sample for this research mentioned that they had knowledge of literary genres
from their undergraduate coursework or teacher preparation programs. In particular,
exploring faculty perceptions of the cultural standards reflected in the folklore collections
could expose gaps in teacher education programs and, as Lafferty (2014) suggests, in
library science preparation programs. Del Negro (1999, 2007) examined reviews of
folklore titles in major review sources used by school librarians when developing their
collections, noting that modern social standards had evolved and were reflected in the
cultural authenticity of folklore collections. Examining teachers’ and librarians’
awareness of the cultural implications of using older materials in instruction could reveal
gaps in collections and clarify patterns of use. Likewise, future research could assess
collections for breadth of reading level in folklore collections – a characteristic of a title

202

mentioned frequently in the qualitative interviews as a necessity for appropriate
instructional support.
Do Elementary School Library Folklore Collections Support Instruction?
Hibner and Kelly (2013) contend that the real value in the metrics resulting from a
collection analysis is in their collective use - when these findings are assembled into a
narrative that facilitates decision making about the collection and the library as a whole.
The data from both phases of research for this study separately and together indicate that
these aging, worn collections actually support instructional practice to a far greater a
degree than would seem feasible, especially considering that these collections averaged
122 volumes short of the minimum recommended size and they held titles that were
published 18 years ago. Teachers use these aging folklore collections to teach math, to
teach science, to teach cultural awareness, to teach social skills, and to teach children
how to make decisions – even as they teach them how to read the words on the page. The
instructional practice of removing significant chunks of the collection to the classroom
during folklore lessons may have resulted in a collection analysis that documents only
part of the actual use of the collection – a risk assumed when using circulation statistics
as a measure of use.
Teachers’ enthusiasm for teaching with and about folklore was unmistakable in
this research, as was their passion for the library folklore collection. The use of the
collection in the classroom indicated a desire to expose children to the treasured stories
and wealth of lessons contained in the genre, not a desire to remove these titles from
203

circulation! Intentional, informed expansion of these collections and meticulous
maintenance and replacement of treasured titles used year after year in instruction has the
potential to support teachers’ use of the genre in thematic instruction and provide for the
free reading needs of students.
Stoodt, Amspaugh, and Hunt (1996) described folktales as the product of
thousands of polishings by seasoned storytellers, saying “A folktale is a living thing that
frequently lives longer than the issue leading to its birth” (180). Perhaps the greatest
lesson of this collection analysis lies in its affirmation of the adage: Tales are timeless.

INTERVIEW PROTOCOL
Project Title: A Cautionary Tale: Mixed Methods Analysis of Elementary School Library
Folklore Collections
Research Question: How is folklore used in elementary school curriculum and instruction?
Background: The theoretical framework for this research, community psychology theory, would
suggest that evaluating the ability of the folklore collections in school libraries to support the use
of folklore in instruction involves assessing the state of available resources and how they are used
by the community. The library assessment literature confirms that the needs of faculty patrons are
best assessed by asking teachers directly how they perceive and use a given section of the school
library.
Data Collection Method: I will conduct individual interviews.
Participants: Teachers recruited from faculties of elementary schools in the sampling frame for
the quantitative phase of this study will be interviewed individually. I will interview teachers who
teach language arts in grades pre-K-5.
Sample Size: In keeping with current literature on sample size for qualitative interview research,
I will interview teachers until the point of data saturation for a given code occurs.
Ethical Issues: I will obtain informed consent to interview each participant, obtain approval
from the External Research Review Committee of the sponsoring agency (Fort Worth ISD), and
obtain approval from the Texas Woman’s University IRB. I will not interview anyone who does
not consent.
Data Collection Protocol: I will schedule face-to-face interviews with each of the individuals
who respond to a recruitment letter distributed through elementary school librarians in the school
district where the quantitative study will be conducted. Each interview will last approximately
forty-five minutes. I will use an open-ended interview guide to allow participants the greatest
latitude in giving their responses. The guiding questions are listed below.
Documentation: I will make digital recordings of each interview. I will transcribe each recording
for coding in statistical analysis software.
Guiding Interview Questions:
