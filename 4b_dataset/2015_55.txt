ABSTRACT
In libraries around the world there are people asking librarians for research assistance. As
technology has advanced and communication strategies have moved outside the physical library
buildings, librarians now respond to reference queries online. This study analyzed two forms of
virtual reference; instant messaging (IM) and log-in chat. The purpose of this study was to find
out if there is any inherent difference between the way the patrons or the librarians used these
two virtual services.
An exploratory research design focused on numerous aspects of virtual reference
communication. During the spring terms of academic years 2011 and 2012 at a community
college, 1,341 transcripts of IM and log-in chat sessions were recorded. Using a systematic
sampling process, 320 transcripts were sampled and their content analyzed.
Findings indicate that a length of the transaction significantly affected the outcome of all
transactions. Log-in chats were generally longer than IM chats and it was found that; they were
more complicated, the librarians were more responsive and friendly, patrons were more satisfied
and the librarian was generally able to conduct a reference interview more often. Additionally
the findings indicated that both IM and log-in chat were very similar in three aspect; patron
formality, completeness/accuracy of the librarians’ answer and the reference interview
adding/changing or clarifying the patrons question.
There were four major conclusions of this study: The log-in chat portal had longer online
reference transactions and better overall outcomes; instant messaging portal queries, although
similar in many aspects to log-in chat, were ultimately treated in a less formal manner by
patrons; librarians gave reference interviews and complete/accurate answers equally in both
platforms and there were similar overall success rates in both platforms.

xiv

Based on the findings in this study it is recommended that academic libraries serving a
general population of students use both the IM and log-in chat portals on their library websites.
Patrons appear to appears to be using each portal for different and equally important reasons.
Further study of virtual communications practices is needed to enhance the findings of this study
as more institutions expand their patron base beyond those who can physically meet with a
reference librarian.

Chapter 1. Introduction
The generation that was born between the years 1977 and 1994 has been called
Generation Y, the Net Generation, the Digital Generation, the Echo Boom and the Millennials
(Gardner & Eng, 2005, p.405). The Milennial Generation has also been said to be born in or after
1982 and before 2000 (Howe & Strauss, 2000). Regardless of the ambiguity in exact birth dates
the majority of this generation appear to be college aged. They have not known a world without
cellular phones and cable television. In 2005 they made up 25 percent of the total population
which was close to the 26 percent already taken up by the baby boom generation (“Millenials”,
2006 , p. 1). Tapscott refers to them in his book "Growing up Digital" as having been able to use
computers throughout their life experience. These students only know a life of computers as
commonplace (1997, p. 3). This is the first generation in history with this background and their
influence has changed the way people of all generations act, react and learn.
While the Millennials have been growing up, libraries have undertaken some of their
most radical changes. From the 19th to mid-20th century finding library materials was
accomplished by using a paper card catalog. They consisted of all of a librarys’ material records
printed on small cards in alphabetical order. They used such information as: title, subject or
author as the descriptor to locate the card that had the information that would tell a patron where
that item was housed in the library. Beginning in the 1970s these paper card catalogs were
automated into online public access catalogs (also commonly known as OPAC’s). These online
catalogs allowed the user to retrieve data on any material housed in the library electronically,
through a computer database (Rubin, 2000, p. 65). Physical libraries themselves have changed
since the 19th century as well. During the 20th century they became more than simply the
repositories of paper books. They also housed: audio books, music CD’s, DVD movies,
computers with access to the Internet, as well as wireless internet access for those who brought
1

their own wireless devices such as tablet and laptop computers. With internet connected devices
e-books and digital audio books could be accessed online as well as recent and back issues of
newspapers and magazines which were retrieved through library databases.
It is not surprising that as the offerings of the library have changed so too has the library
patron. The Millennial patron is less likely to come to the brick and mortar library due to the
access they have with their own electronic devices. In 2002 a survey was conducted of collegeaged students that concluded 73 percent were more likely to do their research on the Internet than
go in to a physical library (Oblinger, 2003, p. 39.). In 2011 (p. 28-29) this decline was
discovered to have continued, in the OCLC Perceptions of Libraries study it was found that there
was an eighteen point decline in the use of the physical library space from their own 2005 study
(p. 59). The study also showed 83% of college students began their information searches using
search engines not library websites (p. 55). The problem with students doing their own
independent Internet research is that although they have experience on the Internet they do not
have knowledge that makes them “information literate”. According to the Association of College
& Research Libraries (ACRL, 2000) information literacy is the ability to:

• Determine the extent of information needed
• Access the needed information effectively and efficiently
• Evaluate information and its sources critically
• Incorporate selected information into one’s knowledge base
• Use information effectively to accomplish a specific purpose
• Understand the economic, legal, and social issues surrounding the use of information,
and access and use information ethically and legally (pp. 2-3)
Although the document that contains this list is fourteen years old it is still used as the

2

standard for information literacy competency by the American Library Association. The need for
an information literate society has grown to the point that in October of 2009 President Barack
Obama declared by Presidential Proclamation that October be the countries’ annual National
Information Literacy Awareness Month (White House, 2009).
As important as they may be, information literacy skills do not tend to come naturally to
those who simply surf the net and look for information through natural language search engine
queries. The difficulty with “Google” searching and true, in depth research is, as Michael
Gorman past president of the American Library Association, noted “the distinction between
accessing knowledge and merely retrieving… how a search engine selects, organizes and
presents information can destroy or invisibly distort the context.” (Jeanney, 2007, p. vii).
As information literacy is not a standard on the national testing of K-12 students in the
United States these students frequently find themselves entering college without the skills to
successfully accomplish academic research tasks. Knowing that students do not tend to seek out
the librarians at brick and mortar library reference desks for information literacy assistance
(OCLC, 2011, p. 57; Kyrillidou, 2000, p. 432) makes it imperative to seek out the students on
their own electronic grounds. For this purpose librarians created online forms of reference
services to assist their patrons. In doing so every means of online communication has been
attempted as it has become available and some have become commonly used throughout the
college library community. It is from this place that college libraries now find themselves having
to choose which services will best serve their college communities.
One form of online service that has become popular with libraries is online log-in chat. In
order to participate the patron must contact the librarian through by filling out a form in the
online portal on the library website. The librarian then responds to the patrons’ query through

3

their end of the portal and they have an online chat. Another prevalent form of online
communication with a librarian is instant messaging (IM). This is usually conducted through a
widget that is placed on a page (or multiple pages) on the library website. From that widget the
patron can contact a librarian immediately with no log-in information. This study will take these
two forms of virtual reference (VR) and shed light on their similarities and differences so that
future decisions and research can be informed with data that is not currently available. It is
important for academic institutions to make these informed decisions so they do not provide
services that are unneeded, unwanted and/or negatively impact their budgets.
Focus of the Study
The focus of this research was on academic libraries and their patrons in the virtual
reference environment. The academic library is a place where students can turn information
retrieval into their own repositories of knowledge. In order for academic libraries to be effective
they must be able to address what students are now expecting from their academic institutions
which is:
•

Quality academic facilities and high academic achievement

•

Customization of technology and research

•

Integration of technology into learning

•

The usage of new communication modes (Gardner & Eng, 2005, p. 416)

The front line of assistance to students by the academic library is their reference services.
Traditionally, the role of the reference librarian, particularly in the public library setting, has
been to supply answers to a patrons’ research questions. In the case of academic libraries the
librarian helps the student understand how to find the answer to their research questions (Toy,
1978; Kennedy, 2011). In the past a library patron had to physically come into the library or

4

make a phone call to the reference desk in order to speak with a librarian. With the advent of
computer assisted information retrieval the role of the reference librarian has had to adapt. The
librarian has to bridge the digital divide that separates the information housed in the library and
its digital coffers from the novice researcher. Moreover it is not just the ability to retrieve
information electronically that has changed the research process, the college students
themselves have changed, they have a different perspective on the way communication should
occur. "Computing is not about computers any more, it is about living" (Negroponte, 1995, p.
8).
For example, it has been found that putting smart phones in the hands of a Millennial has
far more social uses than with other generations. Research conducted by The Pew Internet and
American Life Project called “Generations and their Gadgets” found that “most cell phone
owners use their cell phones for two main non-voice functions on their phones: taking pictures
and text messaging. Among Millennials, meanwhile, a majority use their phones also for going
online, sending email, playing games, listening to music, and recording videos.” (Zickuhr, 2011,
p. 2). The challenge for academic librarians continues to be bringing the library into the
computerized lives of their student patrons (Stanley, 2010).
Although libraries have been in existence for thousands of years arguably some of their
most profound changes have taken place during the last forty. The first major development was
the movement from paper “card catalogs” that housed information regarding each book in the
library collection to computers. This migration began in the early 1970s but didn’t take off
universally until the late 1980s (Borgman, 1997). Then came library websites which allowed
library patrons to access OPAC’s from computers outside of the library, these websites did not
become commonplace until the mid to late 1990s (King, 2009). The library websites allowed

5

patrons to access more than just the information regarding the physical collection housed in the
library it also allowed patrons to access materials housed digitally within the libraries’ online
environment. Eventually the face-to-face reference service followed suit into the digital age;
since 1999 web-based library reference services have become essential additions to traditional
face-to-face and telephone reference assistance. “By the end of the 1990's, 99 percent of 70
academic libraries offered email reference and 29 percent offered real-time virtual reference
services” (Tenopir, 2001, p. 38).
Although email was the first foray into electronic reference assistance it was not enough
to keep up with the way in which Millenials communicated. Email was slow; it could take days
for a reference question to be answered electronically. The Millenial student did not have that
kind of electronic attention span they were immediate with their electronic communication and
research access needs (Sweeney, 2005; Sykes, 2007). As early as 2004 The Pew Internet and
American Life Project noted in “How Americans Use Instant Messaging” that of the Millenials
age group surveyed, 46% reported using instant messaging more frequently than email, nearly
two-thirds (62%) of the Millenial Internet users had sent instant messages, and 20% did it daily.
In order for academic libraries to reach these students it became quickly obvious that instant
forms of reference communication needed to be made available.
In 2002 Ruppel & Fagan noted that library patrons were increasingly turning to their
electronic alternatives such as email and a synchronous form of online reference service called
virtual reference due to their added conveniences of longer hours and the ability to get assistance
remotely. By 2004 virtual reference (e.g. log-in chat, instant messaging and e-mail) had grown so
much that they had become common features of both public and academic library websites
(Johnson, 2004).

6

The library was not the only aspect of campus life that was effected by the electronic age.
The Millenial students did not just expect instant access for their communicative needs they also
expected education to come to them. In the 2000-2001 school year 56% of two and four year
degree granting institutions reported having distance education programs (U.S. Department of
Education, 2003). This number grew even larger in the following years. By the 2006-2007
academic year 66% reported having distance education programs (U.S. Department of
Education, 2009). Today it is difficult to find an institution of higher education without some sort
of distance education program. There are even colleges that operate entirely in virtual spaces
with students who never visit a physical campus. The academic library exists to serve all students
enrolled in the campus whether they are online, face-to-face, full-time, part-time or disabled. The
shift to both a greater number of distance learners and the tech savvy traditional student that
expects convenient and immediate online access to all of their services has added pressure to
extend and strengthen online services through the librarys’ digital environment.
As new technologies arise the academic library staffs’ must assess what is needed and
what is not. Two forms of on-line reference service have emerged as strong contenders for longterm library use and they are: log-in chat reference and IM chat reference. Each service has its
own pros and cons.
The log-in chat reference service allows students and librarians to “co-browse” web
pages, meaning they can both see and manipulate web pages at the same time in order to work
together to resolve the reference question. When unable to co-browse the librarian can “push” a
website page to the patron so they can see and manipulate it on their own during the chat.
Additionally the log-in patron is prompted to provide their email address upon initial inquiry
which allows the system to send them a transcript of the full chat conversation once it has been

7

completed. Lastly, the addition of the email address allows the chat to be forwarded to another
librarian who can respond to the patron after the chat is complete in case the first librarian felt
the patron needed additional assistance.
In contrast instant messaging is a much simpler system. Instead of being provided a login page where the patron needs to fill in information for the chat to begin. The IM chat has an
added state of anonymity that is not given in the log-in chat because there is no email address
requested however this also means that there is no transcript of the chat sent to the student or an
opportunity for follow-up unless that patron supplies an email address voluntarily sometime
within the IM chat transaction.
Both log-in and IM reference chat sessions are similar in that they both have a seemingly
instant connection to a reference librarian. In both cases there is a degree of anonymity and the
patron does not have to go to the library or even physically speak to an individual in order to get
assistance. With both being so similar one might wonder if it is necessary to have both log-in and
chat reference available at one institution or if a library can safely choose one with the
knowledge that they will be meeting their students’ needs with that choice.
Problem Statement
As online reference services become more commonplace it is imperative that we
understand how these services differ from one another. Previous studies have addressed the
differences between face-to-face and online reference services or have looked at facets of one
online reference services. However, very few have directly compared the online services of IM
chat reference and log-in chat reference to each other. This study will examine those two services
both from a user and the librarians’ perspective.

8

Purpose of the Study
As academic libraries get their virtual reference services up and running there comes a
time when the services that are being offered must be evaluated. Does one library need face-toface, phone, email, log-in chat and IM reference services available for their patrons? From both a
fiscal and a service point of view it is not prudent to haphazardly become involved in every new
technology, some may be more useful to the academic audience than others. This study proposed
to acquire data from the transcripts created by the involved parties: the individual students and
the online librarians. These log-in and IM chat reference services are two of the most popular online reference assistance services available. With there being so many options available, budgets
being continually scrutinized and librarians having to juggle their many responsibilities it is
necessary to get more clarity regarding these options.
Studies in this area have mainly been focused on log-in chat reference and have been
concerned with the quality of answers given by the online librarian (Foley, 2002; Katz, 2002;
Kwon, 2007; Lankes, Gross, & McClure 2003; Radford, Connaway, & DeAngelis, 2011; Sears,
2001; Shaw & Spink, 2009; Warner, 2001). This research has been anecdotal in nature and while
useful they do not take the perspective of the user into consideration other than the occasional
satisfaction survey once the reference transaction is complete. While this study looked at the
quality or type of question that was being asked in both log-in and IM reference portals it also
studied the patrons reaction to the portals via variables such as;

• Type of question asked
• Showing satisfaction with the transaction
• general behavior or attitude
• length of chat sessions

9

Research Question
The principal question underlying this research is:
•

Is there an inherent difference between IM and log-in chat reference transactions?

The following research questions were addressed:
1. What are the time parameters involved when using a particular service?
2. What is the level of formality of library patrons using each service?
3. Are there more heavily used “type of calls” in one service than in another?
4. What is the quality/depth of the questions being asked by patrons in each service?
5. Is there a different level of completeness/accuracy in the response of the librarian in
either service?
6. Does the librarian respond differently (friendliness) to the patron depending on which
service they are using?
7. Does the librarian give a reference interview more in one service than another? And If
a reference interview is given does it add, change or clarify the question more in one
service than another?
8. Does the librarian check with the patron for satisfaction in their query resolution more
in one service than another?
9. Does the patron appear to have a higher level of satisfaction with the resolution of a
query in one service than another?
Significance of the Study
As library services become increasingly decentralized they must continue to provide
assistance in the area of reference research. In order to accomplish this task multiple methods of
online assistance are being tested in libraries throughout the world. Although there have been

10

methods that have been researched individually there are very few studies that look at the
methods of online log-in chat reference and IM chat reference in direct comparison to one
another.
By researching the similarities and differences of log-in and IM reference services the
field will be provided with a picture of each service and how they might fit in to a library
program. An institution may have the information they need to choose one of the services, both
or neither depending on the outcome of the study and the needs of the institution.
This study will allow future research in the area of log-in and IM reference to have a
baseline of understanding from which to gather new data. Additionally, it will open the door for
institutions to make more informed choices regarding their on-line reference needs.
Conceptual Foundation of the Study
There are two theoretical foundations that provide support for this study. First is the
nature and role of the reference librarian. While this study is not focusing on the librarian in
particular it is focusing on the virtual tools and processes that are being used to provide
information literacy instruction and assistance to the students. The librarian must manipulate the
tool appropriately in order for the reference transaction to be successful therefore he/she is part
of the study’s issue. Thus, the second conceptual area is about the virtual tools. Chapter two
focuses on the literature surrounding these modes of communication. Theoretical and operational
definitions are presented below.

Chapter Summary
During the 20th Century technology tools were created that changed the way libraries run
and students learn. As these advances continue to affect academia the tools that are being put
into place must be studied for effectiveness and efficiency. This study will take two popular
online reference tools and research them from both the user and librarian perspectives in order to
gain a greater understanding of their preferences and behaviors.
Chapter one of this study addresses the focus and purpose of this study as well as the
research questions. Chapter two will review the relevant literature and studies that have been
written in the field of virtual reference. It will provide a background and understanding for the
purpose of this study in the field of library science.

Chapter 2. Literature Review
The importance of this chapter is to present the history and relevant issues surrounding
virtual reference in academic libraries. This chapter will provide an examination of the
fundamental aspects of library reference service as well as the history of academic reference
services as they pertain to the changes that have occurred due to the advancements in technology.
There will be specific attention given to the literature surrounding log-in chat and instant
messaging reference services for the purpose of better understanding the underlying technologies
that this study is based on.
The Changing Face of Library Reference Service
From the first library in Alexandria Egypt in the 3rd century B.C. until today there have
been librarians to help make sense of the seemingly endless information that is housed within
(Canfora, 1989). The act of librarians assisting patrons in finding the information they need is
called reference service. For centuries reference services were conducted face to face, with the
advent of the telephone, reference questions could be answered from a distance. However it was
not until the 20th century with its technological advances that reference services truly turned the
corner to a new horizon. Instead of waiting for a local librarian to be available to assist the patron
there were options to ask ones question anytime and be answered within 24 hours if not instantly.
In the 21st century more options have become available regarding reference services and
the libraries need to begin choosing which modes of communication they will use. The more
technology has been involved in reference services the easier it has been to get statistical
information to drive the decisions regarding which services to provide. This is true for all types
of libraries but for the purposes of this study we will be focusing on libraries in higher education
known as academic libraries. The Association of Research Libraries (ARL), a not for profit
14

organization within the ALA comprising of the leading research libraries in North America,
began taking statistics of academic libraries: collection sizes, library expenditures, staffing and
services in 1961 (Coyle, 2007, p. 602). Starting in the late 1990s declining statistics for face-toface reference transactions was cited as evidence that the landscape of reference services was
changing (Broughton, 2001; Coffman, 1999; Coffman & McGlamery, 2000; Helfer, 2001;
Lipow, 1999; Oder, 2001; Saunders, 2001; Tenopir & Ennis, 1998; Wilson, 2000).
By 2002, 60.5% of Americans who use the Internet considered online technology to be a
very important or extremely important form of information retrieval (Lebo, 2003, p. 35). As
early as 2001 a Pew Internet and American Life study confirmed that students thought the
Internet satisfied all of their information needs (Simon, Graziano & Lenhart, 2001). As time has
passed students have kept this view, in 2010 a study called How College Students Evaluate
Information in the Digital Age found that students “considered themselves adept at finding and
evaluating information, especially when it was retrieved from the Web. However, students
reported difficulties getting started with research assignments and determining the nature and
scope of what was required of them” (Head & Eisenberg, 2010, p. 1). This indicates that
although the Internet provides a wealth of information students often do not know what to do
with it in an academic context.
The fact that students are turning to the Internet for research assistance may mean that
they have literate computer skills but this has been proven not to be the same as being
information literate (McDonald, 2004; Messineo & DeOllos, 2005; Goodfellow, 2007;
Rowlands, Nicholas, & Huntington, 2007). Additionally, when Millenials are unable to find
information on their own it has been found that they tend to “find peers more credible than
teachers” (Manuel, 2002, p. 208). However, with their peers sharing the same knowledge base

15

regarding academic research skills they don’t necessarily get the assistance they are looking for.
Therefore instructors are charged with teaching students to recognize that they need assistance
and knowing where to find it.
The ever-presence of “just in time” research assistance in the form of search engines,
which are at the students fingertips wherever they are via their electronic mobile devices, has
created the “concept of disintermediation, where library users seek and retrieve information
without the assistance of the librarian” (Agee & Antrim, 2003, p. 477). Lack of patrons using
reference library services can partially be blamed on the lack of students in the physical library
space. “The absence of library users in the building means fewer library users receive expert
human-mediated interaction; lost opportunities for instruction in an educational environment” (p.
474). One might consider disintermediation to be more of an issue with off-campus students
because their physical proximity to the library is more likely to be further than the on-campus
student. However, those who reside on campus have also shown a preference for using online
resources instead of coming in to the library building (Kelley & Orr, 2003). In an attempt to
combat the problem of student disintermediation libraries are bringing their reference services to
the students via their chosen online technological devices. The goal being to give the students the
assistance they need on their technological terms.
Knowing that students are going online to answer their questions and knowing that they
are using the physical space less and less for research means that the library needs to be in their
digital space. The question ultimately became: Where to put the access points for the students to
find the library online. Lewis and DeGroote (2008) discovered that the more access points were
added to the library and institution website the more likely students were to use the online library
services.

16

The Reference Interview
The technological advancements of the late 20th and early 21st centuries have not
diminished the popularity of the academic library. What was once a building known for its
silence and well categorized paper tomes is now a bustling virtual and physical space.
Throughout these changes there is still a need for reference librarians to assist students with their
research assignments. Be it face-to-face or online many students find that expert assistance is
necessary to be successful. When a student seeks assistance from a librarian they must have what
is called a reference interview with the student. This is when a patron seeks assistance from a
librarian and the librarian “interviews” the patron to find out what it is the patron is truly seeking
to find out. It is “a problem-solving process that is collaborative. Few library users, even
experienced ones, have ever heard of the reference interview or know that they are being
interviewed” (Ross, 2003, p. 38) however it is a critical component for effective in depth
research assistance.
In order for the reference interview to be successful the librarian must have an air of
approachability. The Reference & User Services Association (RUSA) of the American Library
Association (ALA) explains in their Guidelines for Behavioral Performance of Reference and
Information Service Providers the importance of approachability both in person and online in
the reference interview:
In order to have a successful reference transaction, patrons must be able to
identify that a reference librarian is available to provide assistance and also
must feel comfortable in going to that person for help. In remote environments,
this also means placing contact information for chat, email, telephone, and
other services in prominent locations, to make them obvious and welcoming to

17

patrons. Approachability behaviors, such as the initial verbal and non-verbal
responses of the librarian, will set the tone for the entire communication
process, and will influence the depth and level of interaction between the staff
and the patrons. At this stage in the process, the behaviors exhibited by the
staff member should serve to welcome the patrons and to place them at ease.
The librarian’s role in the communications process is to make the patrons feel
comfortable in a situation that may be perceived as intimidating, risky,
confusing, and overwhelming. (RUSA, 1996, section 1.0)
Before technology was a ubiquitous part of everyday life librarians only needed to know
how to be approachable in a face-to-face or phone conversation. The new technological
environment requires the ability to be approachable without being physically seen or heard
(Fagan & Desai, 2002).
In the face-to-face environment approachability is visual and once the patron breaches the
barrier of introduction the interview begins. Tone of voice, facial expressions, and body language
have proven to be cues that ensure approachability (Katz, 1997). These cues are so important in
fact that it has been proven that patrons are more satisfied with a friendly reference librarian that
gave an incorrect answer than a librarian who made them feel ill at ease, unwelcome or appeared
to be judge their question even when they gave the correct answer. In fact, the patrons were more
likely to return to the librarian that gave the incorrect answer than the one that did not (Durrance,
1989, p. 35).
In the online environment the barrier of introduction is different. Patrons can feel
anonymous and therefore they are less likely to feel judged regarding the content of their
question. Additionally, opinions are less likely be formed by the librarian regarding race, age,

18

gender or appearance. This puts a great emphasis on the writing technique of both the patron and
the librarian as well as the inviting nature of the website.
It is counterproductive for an online library patron to find the look and/or feel of the
website intimidating, this may cause them to decide not to ask their questions before they’ve
even begun. Additionally, once they have asked their question they can be misunderstood due to
lack of visual or audio cues. Differences in the behavior patterns of face-to-face and online
reference interviews are well documented (Bobrowsky, Beck, & Grant, 2005; Fagan & Dasai,
2002; Jensen, 2004; Kwon & Gregory, 2007; Straw, 2000). Marstellar and Mizzy (2003) also
found that online reference librarians felt that patrons would have a negative response to
clarifying questions because chat patrons were using the service for the sake of a quick
transaction. In actuality they found that in only 5 of 270 transcripts did users display a negative
response to clarifying questions, it was the convenience, not the speed that caused patrons to
choose online reference transactions.
In the physical world of reference students enter the library and go to the reference desk
when asking their research question. In the electronic world the patron must find the access point
that will allow them to find the available reference librarian. It has been found that unlike the
physical environment where there may only be one reference desk it is better to have many
access points in the digital world wherever service may be needed both in and outside of the
library web page (Lewis & DeGroote, 2008). Along with available points of access the look and
feel of the user interface that will connect them to the librarian needs to be appealing (George,
2008). “The Web interface should be clear and uncluttered, easy to maneuver and provide built
in redundancy to accommodate different learning styles” (McMullen, 2001, p. 7). The student

19

must feel welcome and unintimidated by the user interface it is not until the student crosses the
digital divide and asks their question that the reference interview can begin.
Integrating Library Reference into the Digital Age
Digital products are becoming more ubiquitous with each passing month, as the world
gets used to living in a digital space service providers are creating new products to satisfy an
ever expanding and technically savvy market. “As librarians adapt new technologies that are
useful to students, students are more willing to see the importance of the library in the process of
information retrieval” (Lukasiewicz, 2007, p. 825). The question is how to get the online
services of the library to the end user so they can experience it. Fortunately, “it must also be
stressed that even if end-users are placed in a position to search for their own information, not all
will take the opportunity… it can therefore be predicted with some certainty that not all endusers will want to do their own information searching. It can also be assumed that the greater
awareness of the availability of information will increase end-users’ expectations of quality
services and their demands for training and support” (Fourie, 1999, p. 14). This brings two items
to the forefront of importance for libraries: making the online library services available and
visible to the patron as well as providing quality services to the patron once they decide to use
the library’s online environment. In this study quality service is referring to the reference service
provided to the patron by the librarian who must assist them virtually.
RUSA Guidelines
In 1996 RUSA developed the Guidelines for Behavioral Performance of Reference and
Information Services Providers (RUSA, 1996). These guidelines were created “to be used in the
training, development, and evaluation of library professionals and staff” during the face-to-face
reference process (RUSA, 1996, p.1). In the years that followed the RUSA Guidelines were

20

studied and found to correlate with high success of reference transactions. They have therefore
become the only guidelines widely recognized and used in library reference transactions (Gatten
& Radcliff, 2001; Saxton, 2000; Schachaf & Horowitz, 2008b). The 1996 guidelines were based
around five components:
•

Approachability: The ability to recognize that a reference librarian is available to assist a
patron and lowering the barriers that may make the patron feel uncomfortable going for
the help.

•

Interest: This is when the librarian must show a high level of interest in the patrons
inquiry in order to get the result of a more satisfying transaction from the users point of
view.

•

Listening/Inquiry: This is when a librarian exhibits good listening and questioning skills
during the reference interview. Librarians need to keep the patron at ease while
discovering the true nature of the inquiry.

•

Searching: When the librarian exhibits superior search skills and can effectively come up
with valid results from the patron inquiry.

•

Follow-up: This is when the librarian brings proper closure to the reference transaction
by verifying the patrons’ satisfaction and assisting them with additional locations of
information that may not exist at their library. (RUSA, 1996, p. 3)
By creating these guidelines RUSA allowed librarians throughout the country to have a

common set of rules to follow for a more successful face-to-face reference transaction. In 2004
RUSA published Guidelines for Implementing and Maintaining Virtual Reference Services
(2004a) where they reiterated the need to adhere to the RUSA Guidelines for Behavioral
Performance of Reference and Information Services Providers (See Appendix A) while assisting

21

online reference patrons. Additionally, in 2004 RUSA updated their Guidelines for Behavioral
Performance of Reference and Information Services Providers to include email and chat
reference services (2004b). They have since been revised further “to anticipate developments in
reference services using a broad approach, and yet maintain enough specificity to be useful”
(2013). Included first in the 2004 Guidelines and retained through the 2013 revision were both
an in person section and a remote section with advise on how to handle each of the five
components mentioned above.
For example in the updated 2004 guidelines in the section regarding approachability the in
person section stresses: eye contact, proximity, visibility and tone of voice. Whereas the remote
section on approachability states: “Should provide prominent, jargon-free links to all forms of
reference services from the home page of the library's Web site, and throughout the site wherever
research assistance may be sought out. The Web should be used to make reference services easy
to find and convenient.” (2004b, section 1.8)
As the RUSA Guidelines have become a standard for reference service training. The
question becomes: Does following the RUSA Guidelines actually make a better learning
outcome for library patrons? It has been generally found that adherence to the RUSA Guidelines
by reference librarians creates a more effective reference transaction and a patron that is
generally more satisfied with the service provided (Hughes, 2010; Oakleaf & VanScoy 2010;
Zho, Love, Norwood, & Massia, 2006)
Digital Reference Services
Digital reference service (DRS) has been defined as “a mechanism by which
people can submit their questions and have them answered by the library staff member through
some electronic means (email, chat, Web forms etc.), not in person or over the phone” (Janes,
Carter & Memmott, 1999, p. 146). RUSA defines digital reference as a “reference service
22

initiated electronically, often in real-time, where patrons employ computers or other Internet
technology to communicate with reference staff, without being physically present” (RUSA,
2004a, section 1).
The first form of digital reference made available to library patrons was email. The patron
would type their query as a free form email and send it off to the library reference department. It
would usually get answered in the order received which depended on the staffing of the
electronic mail queue and answered to the best of the librarians ability depending on how the
initial query was worded. In 1993 Abels conducted some of the first published research
regarding email reference in academic libraries (1996). The study was mainly concerned with
controlling the lack of a reference interview when the patron emailed their reference question.
They found that instead of providing an email address and letting the student create their own
free form query it was more productive to create an electronic form for the student to fill out that
guided them to be more specific with their research needs.
Email was the only electronic option a patron had when DRS was in its infancy. They were
able to have their question answered via email instead of having to wait for library operating
hours that would allow them to call or walk-in to a library in order to communicate with a
librarian and it was found that users valued this additional service (Bushallow-Wilbur,
DeVinney, & Whitcomb, 1996 ). Although email reference was a popular subject for the library
literature of the time it was not a popular form of reference service to patrons; looking at the
number of emails received per day, most studies were reporting an average of one (BushallowWilbur et al., 1996; Schilling-Eccles & Harzbecher, 1998; Still & Campbell, 1993) additionally
the email service was not found to become more popular as time went by (Bristow, 1992;
Bushallow-Wilbur et al., 1996).

23

As colleges increased their number of online students, some of which would never step
foot on their brick and mortar campuses, DRS became more important. Between 1997 and 2000
the number of distance education course enrollments doubled (Johnson & Magusin, 2005).
Additionally in the 2000-2001 school year the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES)
reported that distance education courses had risen to between 20-50 per cent of the total
enrollments at Universities in the United States (US Department of Education, 2001, p. 3).
Librarians knew that if email services were not working online something else was going to have
to come in and provide reference services to online patrons.
Online Chat Reference History
In 1985 a service emerged in retail that would later become useful to libraries. It was a
live online chat service where consumer questions were answered and assistance was provided
for searching their databases (a service that is common for library reference today). This service
was provided by a company called Telebase that was paired with the company Compuserve
(Ware, Howe, & Scalese, 2000).
Libraries took longer to begin using this chat based service for answering reference
questions. As mentioned previously the first form of digital reference was email and it did not
begin being used in libraries until the early 90s. This did not evolve into the use of live
synchronous chat until the mid-90s. In 1995 the Internet Public Library used a text based virtual
reality system called a MOO to create a live on-line reference service to their patrons during
specified hours (Sloan, 2006). The first academic library to use live chat reference was in 1998 at
SUNY Morrison, New York. Using Internet Relay Chat (a chat room version of instant
messaging) and software created on campus they were able to create a service called “Talk Now”
(Kresh, 2003).

24

In June of 2001 the first online, 24/7, library reference services, began offering online
assistance. On June 11th 2001 Clevnet was launched in Ohio with a public library service they
called Know it Now. It served 10 counties in northern Ohio online, twenty-four hours a day,
seven days a week. Eight days later on June 19th of 2001 the Metropolitan Cooperative Library
System’s launched their 24/7 reference service for public libraries in the Los Angeles area. Both
turned to a consortia model in order to have the services manned at all times. In the Metropolitan
Library System this meant that 31 member libraries staffed the service “with the larger libraries
handling more of the hours and local librarians freelancing out of their homes for the late night
shifts” (Flagg, 2001). By the Spring of 2002 it was reported that 28% of thirty academic libraries
surveyed were offering some form of real-time online reference (Tenopir & Ennis, 2002).
The Growth of Instant Messaging
A form of communication that was growing in popularity at the turn of the century was
Instant Messaging (IM, also widely known as text messaging or Short Message Service [SMS]).
IM is defined by Foley (2002) as:
real-time online communication between two or more people. The medium
enables people to ‘chat’ via the Internet by rapidly exchanging text messages. One
user chats with another user by typing a message into a specialized window, or
‘chat room,’ generated by IM software. The message appears almost immediately
on the other user's screen. The recipient reads it and replies by typing a response.
Only an Internet connection is required to access basic chat systems.
In 2004 the Pew Internet and American Life Project reported that Millenials (people
between the ages of 18-27) were using Instant Messaging (IM) 46% more frequently than email.
Additionally, of those that were using IM 31% were reported to be sending links of articles and

25

websites to friends and colleagues. This study made it clear that college aged students were
moving away from email and towards more instant forms of communication. Additionally they
were becoming more at ease with the transfer of information through IM. In 2003 Marshall
Breeding wrote in the journal Computers in Libraries “The pervasive presence of instant
messaging will be ignored only by organizations willing to risk irrelevancy. Many individuals mostly, but not exclusively from the younger generation- prefer instant messaging to email” (p.
38). By 2006 Fox and Madden were estimating from their Pew Internet and American Life study
that 75% of teenagers who had access to the internet were using instant messaging and 47% of
adults with access to the internet were doing the same. In 2009 a Nielsen Report noted “the
average U.S. mobile teen now sends or receives an average of 2,899 text-messages per month
compared to 191 calls” (Nielsen, 2009, p. 8). Finally, by 2011 it was found that “95% of 18-29
year olds use the text messaging feature on their phones, and these users send or receive an
average of 87.7 text messaged on a normal day” (Smith, p. 3).
As early as the year 2000 case studies were emerging from libraries who were piloting
the use of IM as an additional reference service to face-to-face in their libraries (Fagan &
Connoway, 2001; Foley, 2002; Ruppel & Fagan, 2002). For an IM service to be successful the
library and the patron needed to be signed up, and have installed, a proprietary piece of software
such as America OnLine (AOL) or MSN Instant Messenger. This, in itself, required a level of
technological knowledge and hardware that was not available to everyone and therefore excluded
a certain population. Additionally, in order to use the service both parties needed to be logged
into the same texting software and accepted each other into their chat spaces for one-to-one
conversing. On the positive side texting was better than a phone call because a user could attach
a file and send websites to the other participant. With texting already being a popular medium of

26

communication it is no wonder that those who adopted IM reference found that their overall use
of reference went up when texting was added to the tools a patron could use to communicate
with a librarian (Bedwell, Rodrigues, Duggan, & Orlov, 2008; Brietbach, Mallard, & Sage, 2008;
Doan & Ferry, 2007; Foley, 2002; Stahr, 2010).
The convenience of digital reference is that the patron does not need to be on campus in
order to make their reference query to a librarian. However, like the face-to-face service in its
early stages online reference librarians had to be at work in order to answer the incoming
question therefore the service was usually only available during library business hours (Davis,
2007; Desai, 2003). Additionally, like the face-to-face and telephone environment there was
usually no transcript of the transaction allowing for the patron or the librarian to review exactly
what was discussed during the reference question session. Statistics were also not compiled by
the service and therefore had to be kept by hand. Ruppel & Fagan (2002) found that the “top
advantage of IM reference service was convenience and not having to get up from their
workstation or give up their computer and 15 percent of the users liked the anonymity… 29
percent thought staff did not look helpful at the physical reference desk and 17 percent did not
want to go to the library building to do their research” (p. 190). In 1995 Durrance noted that
reference staff were much more likely to have a successful face-to-face reference transaction
when they looked approachable and they showed personal interest in the patron, any form of
anonymity on the part of the librarian proved to be more of a hindrance. However, Desai (2003)
found that the IM librarian always appeared available and therefore approachable she also found
that anonymity is an advantage for the instant messaging patrons as long as they were greeted in
a personal manner, making the patron feel at ease.
In 2005 a company called Meebo was founded (“About Meebo,” 2011). This company

27

allowed the user to put a widget on their desktop or a webpage that would integrate most of their
instant messaging tools. In this way a person could be signed up with multiple texting accounts
and get them all in one window. Therefore if friends were signed up with one text messaging
account and the library was set up with a different text messaging account service they could
both be seen at the same time by the patron. Later technology emerged that allowed “users to
insert chat widgets on to any web page by inserting code into the (web) page in HTML. The code
calls forth an application… known as a widget” (Breitbach et al., 2008). This widget allows any
user to simply begin typing in the text box provided and send it instantly to the librarian. No set
up is needed.
Online Library Chat Reference Technology
As technology became more sophisticated another form of virtual reference emerged
commonly known as chat reference. Unlike IM reference, the patron had to go to an intake page
and fill out the necessary fields which would get forwarded to the librarian immediately before
the chat began. Essentially this was call center software that began as a service that was available
for real time reference “chat” during the hours of operation with an email back-up when the
library was closed. However, the goal for many libraries was to turn the chat reference service
into a 24/7 resource that would work in consortial service with other libraries around the country
(Blank, 2002). In 2001 Francour conducted a survey that noted “272 libraries were being served
by a chat reference service, 210 of which (77 percent) were served by one of eight chat reference
consortia” (p. 190). In his survey chat reference was referring to both forms of virtual reference
but it does speak to the growing popularity of the medium. Chat reference was being discussed in
the literature along with its sister technology IM as early as 2002 (Blank, 2002; Maxwell, 2002)
they were most genrally studied separately (Blank, 2002; Francouer, 2001; Radford, Connoway,

28

Confer, Sabolcsi-Boros & Kwon, 2011; Ward, 2004). In 2005 Houghton and Schmidt published
an article that evaluated chat reference software and IM software from the libraries’ point of
view with IM turning out to be the unanimous favorite under most criteria such as; speed of
interaction, cost, training, computer requirements and connection to the community of users. A
study by Ward & Kern (2006) had both IM and chat reference available simultaneously at The
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champagne in order to determine if users had a preference. It
was found that both choices were very popular and attracted different audiences and therefore
warranted continued use. Doan and Ferry (2007) were using log-in chat reference software first
with little buy-in from staff and little use from students at the Kresge Library in the University of
Michigan’s Ross School of Business. After trying two separate kinds of chat software they chose
a complete switch to IM for their virtual reference program and that was the catalyst that turned
their virtual reference program around for both the students and librarians. Similarly Bedwell et
al. (2008) were part of a consortium using log-in chat software with little success. They were
disappointed with both the unreliability of the software and the lack of popularity. Once they
switched to an IM client with a multiple protocol platform that could accept IM’s from several
major IM services their consortium decided to switch to an IM service completely until
something more stable could be produced by the virtual chat reference providers. Brietbach et al.
(2008) did the same with their virtual service after trying Meebo as an alternative. One
interesting note in their study was that Meebo transactions took significantly less time than their
QuestionPoint log-in chats and they did not know why.
IM vs. Chat Reference in Libraries
IM chat had a lot of pros and studies showed that there was some preference by patrons
to using IM, one might wonder why log-in chat was still a service that librarians felt was worth

29

offering. The differences between log-in chat reference and IM reference were minimal in some
respects but noteworthy in others. As mentioned previously IM software had to be loaded on
both the library and patron computers whereas with log-in chat reference only the library had to
install software and a portal was made available on the website for logging into and chatting. The
IM software was usually free whereas the log-in chat reference software required that the library
pay the company that was providing the service. IM produced a portal that the patron simply
typed into, there was no need for logging in. It was an instant, two-way chat. Once logged into
the log-in chat reference service a patron had to begin with an initial question, which was sent
out to reference librarians who were manning the service. The librarians could have previously
created responses that were held in the software system that they might pull from to save time in
answering regularly asked questions. These responses “can include instructions that are
frequently sent (for example, how to connect to databases from off-site) or even standard
questions used in reference interviews” (Francoeur, 2001, p. 193). This made log-in chats
slightly easier on the librarian as they typed their responses.
Current log-in chat reference software often allows librarians to push Web pages on to a
user’s screen and some also allow the patron to push pages to the librarians screen creating a cobrowsing experience. Transcripts of a chat reference transaction can also be generated for review
and for forwarding to the patron if an email address is provided. Transcripts cannot be provided
with IM.
Cooperative On-Line Library Reference Assistance
Today, the largest provider of 24/7/365 online reference service is QuestionPoint (QP),
they are owned and administered by the Online Computer Library Center (OCLC). QP became

30

available as a log-in chat service in June of 2002 as a collaborative network of subscribing
libraries to a consortia (Dee & Allen, 2006). A subscription to QP in 2003 would get a library:
•

Access to a professional community of librarians working together to
develop standards, best practices, and the QuestionPoint service based on
their experiences and needs.

•

An interface that enables libraries to offer online reference services locally
and to refer questions to libraries locally, regionally or globally.

•

Tools to support synchronous and asynchronous digital reference including
walk-up questions, email, web-based forms, and live chat including the
ability for librarians to see and talk with patrons over the Internet.

•

The ability to route and track the status of questions, including system views
for the patron, the librarian and the administrator.

•

Local and global knowledge bases that store previously asked and answered
questions for later retrieval and use as a reference resource.

•

Usage statistics and reports to help librarians implement and maintain
Question Point successfully in their libraries.

•

Integration with other virtual reference systems that participating libraries
already use.

•

A customizable administration module. (Penka, 2003, para 9)

Additionally, each library that took a session was responsible for the accuracy of the response
given. To ensure quality QP staff monitor chats and libraries themselves have the ability to
review their own transcripts of both their libraries chats and the chats of their library patrons
taken by other member librarians (Penka, 2003). All the library and the patron needed to

31

successfully launch the service was a Web browser. QP has had over 1,000 member libraries
spanning the globe for some years now (Radford et al., 2011) and the system generally runs in
the same manner it did upon opening with changes made to the libraries administrative end for
more sophisticated management.
An additional service was added to QP in 2008 called the Qwidget. This was a web based
widget you could put on any library webpage that would work as a kind of text messaging
system for instant chats that did not require a log-in page or ask for an email address
(Introducing Qwidget, 2008). On the patron side it looked very similar to a Meebo or any similar
instant messaging widget. From the librarian side it looked like any other log-in chat with the
exception of an incoming tag with the initial query that noted it as a “qwidget” question (See
Figure 1 and 2). As with other IM technologies the Qwidget does not allow for web pages to be
pushed to the patron or vice versa.

Figure 1. Librarian page showing a chat coming in from the log-in chat in-take page.

Figure 2. Librarian page showing a chat coming in from the IM Qwidget.
Few studies have been done using the OCLC QuestionPoint service and the Qwidget. An
exhaustive search by this researcher yielded one study conducted by Virginia Cole of Cornell
32

University (2010). She studied the added service of the Qwidget to a college that had originally
only had log-in. Her study focused on increased traffic to the overall online reference service and
found that unlike other studies where IM was added, they had no increase in traffic but they did
have students switching to the Qwidget instead of using the log-in service. She also found that
the Qwidget was being used for short answer questions as opposed to the log-in chat which was
being used for more in depth questions. Additionally it was found that Qwidget questions tended
to be shorter in duration, approximately 8 minutes or less and the log-in chat averaged 12-24
minutes. The down side of this study is that it only took place over a two and a half week period.
The first day of the study was the first day that they put the Qwidget in a prominent spot on the
home page of the library therefore it was not an established service. Additionally this time period
was during the last few weeks of classes and finals therefore potentially changing the nature of
the questions.
An additional study was found that looked at an MSN instant messaging portal and a login portal with a service called Docutek at a single institution over a one year period of time. This
study looked at question classification, formality and patron satisfaction. Their analysis
suggested that patrons used each service for a different purpose. They found that the log-in chat
or virtual reference (VR) questions were the more in depth or research intensive queries. They
also found that both their librarians and their patrons used different behaviours in each portal.
Lastly, they surveyed their patrons for overall satisfaction and found that generally they were
satisfied with both services. In this study the librarians did not have a single portal to answer
both questions they were either answering the IM questions or the VR questions. This might
account for the difference in mindset by the librarian when answering in each portal. The
satisfaction survey by the patron is also questionable in that the patron may have been answering

33

what they felt the college wanted to hear and therefore self reported satisfaction (Rourke &
Lupien, 2010). Being the only study that used a large amount of transcripts and the full one year
period of time this study is important when comparing the two services.
Assessing The Quality of Reference Service with The 55 Percent Rule
As mentioned previously the reference interview plays a major part in the success or
failure of a reference transaction. Hundreds of studies have been conducted to discern if
librarians are successful at conducting these transaction. In 1986 Hernon and McClure published
a landmark article regarding the accuracy of reference transactions. They studied a total of 26
academic and public libraries throughout the United States. Unobtrusive test questions were used
which are “reference questions (for which answers have been predetermined) of library staff
members who are unaware that they are being evaluated” (p. 37). They determined that accurate
answers were provided by reference librarians only 50-60% of the time. This became known as
the 55% rule and sent a ripple of concern throughout the library reference services community.
This was not the first time that low accuracy numbers had been mentioned in literature (Crowley
& Childers, 1971; Gers & Seward, 1985; King & Berry, 1973; Myers & Jirjees, 1983; Ramsden,
1978; Schmidt, 1980; Weech, 1984) but it was the first time it had been labeled and published in
one of the most highly read publications in the library community: Library Journal. They went so
far as to state:
If the 55 percent reference law is a fact of life, critical issues about the
quality of reference services in a particular library, and the role of
information services, in general, in the larger professional context must be
re-examined…perhaps in the rush to embrace new technologies, resource
sharing, faculty status, and assorted other issues and concerns, a number of

34

staff members have lost sight of a primary mission of the academic and
public library-meeting patrons’ information needs. (Hernon & McClure,
1986, p. 41).
Hernon & McClures (1986) article made an impact on an international scale among
reference librarians. It was difficult to believe that professional librarians with advanced degrees
in library science were unable to answer reference questions correctly 45% of the time. In 1987
Bailey wrote the first of many articles that were to span the course of twenty years (Hubbertz,
2007) denouncing the unobtrusive testing methods used by Hernon & McClure. Bailey (1987)
noted specifically:
•

Observer Bias: Which is the personal bias held by the trained proxy asking the question
of the reference librarian. He argued that no matter how well trained, the observer would
bring in their own personal bias and shade the perceived results. He suggested that a
second observer or many observers would more accurately view the transaction.

•

Random Errors: Such as time of day, staff experience, staff member bias/beliefs. He
argued that in Hernon and McClures study there was no way of knowing “the magnitude
of random error- any better than we know the magnitude and source of any constant error
” (Bailey, 1987, p. 280).

•

Questionable Ethics: Which he explained by stating “surreptitious observation eventually
will uncover flaws in even a paragon of professionalism” (p. 281).

•

A Better Approach: Bailey noted that psychologists were not using unobtrusive testing
because they “have trouble believing in its validity and shy away from using it, then why
should library researchers do differently?” (p. 281).

35

•

Realities of Reference not Black and White: Hernon and McClure marked each question
either 100 percent correct or 100 percent incorrect. If the question was not answered 100
percent correct no credit was given at all to the librarian.

•

Proxy Attitude: Bailey states that the attitude of a student approaching the reference desk
will influence the way in which the librarian answers the question. Therefore if different
proxies were to approach the desk with different attitudes they would not get the same
answer to the same question.

•

Librarian Attitude: “the reference librarian in a better mood, a less harried atmosphere at
the desk, or the proxy desperate for an answer are all factors that could have upgraded the
55 percent rule” (p. 281).

•

An Honest Answer: Bailey surmised that librarians may have made a first utterance of “I
don’t know” and been marked as not wanting to help when that statement may have
meant that they wanted to help but honestly did not have the answer. Therefore an “I
don’t know” answer would not necessarily have been a negative answer as had been
perceived by the study.

•

Length of Interview: The study marked any reference transaction that was under five
minutes as too brief when in actuality Bailey believed “the best reference librarians will
comprehend a question immediately and may take no more than a minute to satisfy the
patron” (p. 281).
In 1988 Douglas denounced the 55 percent rule stating mainly that unobtrusive testing

chose specific questions, particularly brief and factual ones and ignored other requests for service
such as the need for general information on a topic. He conceded that there were “failures in the
provision of reference services (however), we do not know what the incidence of these failures

36

is” (p. 96). Durrance joined Douglas in 1989 writing in a Library Journal article titled: Reference
Success: Does the 55 Percent Rule Tell the Whole Story. She argued that success in a reference
interview was relying too heavily on accuracy and that the environment that reference services
take place in plays a heavy role in the way a reference transaction will develop. The environment
causes the librarian to rely on interpersonal skills which, as has been mentioned previously, can
be a heavily weighted factor in a patrons feeling of satisfaction with the transaction. In this study
patron’s requests will be received by librarians from the same environment, there will be one
community college with one online reference service intake page for online chat and one IM
widget for the Qwidget questions. By removing the environmental concern more emphasis can
be put on accuracy in terms of the quality of a question being studied.
Ways of Assessing Quality Reference Transactions
For decades librarians have been trying to accurately measure the quality of reference
transactions. This is important because reference services are one of the main public duties for a
librarian. After the uproar created by Hernon & McClure’s article regarding the ‘55 percent rule’
more attention began to be paid to how quality is measured in a reference transaction.
For many years one of the main measures for assessment of quality reference service was
tabulation of the number of reference questions received at the reference desk. It was believed
that if the number of reference questions increased then the level of good service must have been
increasing as well (Robbins-Carter & Zweizig, 1985). However, as Hansel (1990) has pointed
out, reference librarians not only admit that their self reporting of reference transactions is
inaccurate, a rise in the number of questions asked could mean that the patrons are finding the
library to be disorganized and need additional assistance where none would be needed otherwise.

37

Satisfaction surveys given to patrons upon the conclusion of reference transactions have
also been used as a gauge of quality (Brudenall, 1976; Bunge, 1985; Howell, Reeves & Van
Willigen, 1976; Johnson, 2004; Ruppel & Fagan, 2002; Strong, 1980; Weech & Goldhor, 1984).
There is confusion, however, regarding the accuracy of these surveys: "If a simple satisfaction
survey comes back positive it could mean that the user's original expectations of the service
quality had been very low" (Bicknell, 1994, p. 78). Additionally, patrons satisfaction can be hard
to determine via a survey due to the fact that their needs are often ill-defined and changing
therefore, in quality control terms, customer satisfaction can be an ill-defined moving target
(Haywood-Farmer, Duffus, & Downing, 1985/1986). For these reasons this study will not be
using the number of chats received as an indication of quality nor will it be seeking out the user
satisfaction surveys taken at the institutions of their chats received.
Behavioral and attitudinal aspects of the librarian during the reference process can have
significant impact on the accuracy of the reference transaction. These aspects are: the librarian
probing for the actual information needed, showing interest and being attentive, making the
patron feel comfortable, and asking follow-up questions to verify that the patron found what they
were requesting (Gers & Seward, 1985; Crews, 1988). The RUSA Guidelines for Implementing
and Maintaining Virtual Reference Services discusses service behaviors in section 3.3. More
specifically in section 3.3.4 which states “staff should follow interpersonal communication
practices that promote effective provision of reference service as articulated in the RUSA
Guidelines for Behavioral Performance of Reference and Information Service Professionals”
(RUSA, 2004b). These practices are:

38

1.0 Approachability: “… patrons must be able to identify that a reference librarian is
available to provide assistance and also must feel comfortable in going to that person
for help…”
2.0 Interest: “…the librarian should be interested in each patron’s informational need and
should be committed to providing the most effective assistance…”
3.0 Listening/Inquiring: “…The librarian must be effective in identifying the patron’s
information needs and must do so in a manner that keeps patrons at ease…”
4.0 Searching: “…the portion of the transaction where behavior and accuracy intersect.
Without an effective search, not only is the desired information unlikely to be found,
but the patron may become discouraged…”
5.0 Follow-up: “…The librarian is responsible for determining if the patrons are satisfied
with the results of the search, and is also responsible for referring the patrons to other
sources…”
The RUSA Behavioral Guidelines are the standard that has been set for librarians by the
American Library Association and have been used in studies to effectively determine the level of
reference service that has been provided to the patron (Duinkerken, Stephens & MacDonald,
2009; Harmeyer, 2007; Ronan, Reakes, & Ochoa, 2006; Scachaf & Horowitz, 2008b; Zho, Love,
Norwood, & Massia, 2006; Walter & Mediavilla, 2005; Ward, 2004). Many more studies have
not mentioned the RUSA guidelines specifically in their methodology but have measured
effective reference transactions using similar evaluative behaviors (Arnold & Kaske, 2005;
Bolander, Connoway, & Radford, 2006; Houlson, McCready & Pfahl, 2006; Lee, 2004;
Marstellar & Mizzy, 2003; Platt & Benson, 2010; Pomerantz & Luo, 2006; Ryan, Dougherty, &
Mauldin, 2006). Due to the wide acceptance of and successful studies using the RUSA

39

Behavioral Guidelines this study will also be using those guidelines to measure the quality of
service provided to both IM and chat reference patrons.
Summary
As the technological landscape changes libraries need to be mindful of their mission and
their patron needs. Digital reference services have now become a part of the library landscape.
The key to discovering which DRS is best for any individual library has to do with the culture of
the library patronage and the information that has been discovered from the studies of DRS that
have been conducted. This study seeks to find any inherent differences from the user and
librarian perspectives in the day-to-day sessions of both log-in chat and IM reference
transactions. The goal is to give a clear picture of both the IM and log-in chat landscapes so that
librarians can make knowledgeable choices when looking at both services.

40

Chapter 3. Methods
The purpose of this study was to gather data in order to examine whether there were any
inherent difference between IM and log-in chat reference transactions. This chapter describes the
procedures for conducting the research and the specific methods used to answer the following
research questions. The central research question was:
•

Is there an inherent difference between IM and log-in chat reference transactions made by
community college students?

The specific sub-questions were:
1. What are the time parameters involved when using a particular service?
2. What is the level of formality of library patrons using each service?
3. Are there more heavily used “type of calls” in one service than in another?
4. What is the quality/depth of the questions being asked by patrons in each service?
5. Is there a different level of completeness/accuracy in the response of the librarian in
either service?
6. Does the librarian respond differently (friendliness) to the patron depending on which
service they are using?
7. Does the librarian give a reference interview more in one service than another? And if
so, does it change, add or clarify the question more in one service than another?
8. Does the librarian check with the patron for satisfaction in their query resolution more
in one service than another?
9. Does the patron appear to have a higher level of satisfaction with the resolution of a
query in one service than another?

41

Research Design
An exploratory design was used to examine the transcripts of community college students’
use of two different library reference web portals. The study was exploratory as opposed to
being only descriptive because it focused on careful analysis among factors as they influenced
and interacted with each other. Greater understanding of the two forms of virtual reference
services was the major goal in this research as opposed to coming up with definitive
conclusions about the individual users. Additionally, this study was retrospective as the data
involved online reference transcripts from 2011 and 2012.
Many studies have analyzed virtual reference (VR) transcripts using anywhere from one
(Radford, Radford, Connaway, & DeAngelis, 2011) to eight hundred and fifty transcripts
(Radford, Connaway, Confer, Sabolcsi-Boros, & Kwon, 2011). Previous research of online
reference transcripts includes a study by Arnold and Kaske (2005) that studied the overall
service provided to library patrons. Research has also focused on studying the quality of
answers given by the librarian (Logan & Lewis, 2011; Maximiek, Rushton, & Brown, 2010;
Shachaf & Horowitz, 2008a). Only one study used 1400 transcripts and studied both IM (from
an MSN portal) and VR (from Library Services and Systems Inc) it studied the difference in
question classification, formality and patron satisfaction. This study had the librarians
answering patron queries either in IM or in log-in chat, not both at the same time, and patron
satisfaction was discovered through a survey (Rourke & Lupien, 2010). In this study the
librarians were answering both IM and log-in chat questions at the same time in the same
response portal. This helped lower the possibility of the librarian being in a different mindset
depending on which service they were assisting. Additionally, patron satisfaction was not self
reported by the user in this study it was discovered by the researcher through transcript analysis.

42

This researcher could find no study that analyzed chat transcripts with a main focus on
the users perspective. This study did so in order to gain a better understanding of what the user
wanted or expected of each service portal. As there are a number of online options available
librarians need a better understanding of how their users are handling the services. This study’s
main focus was to discover if there is an inherent difference between IM and log-in chat
reference transactions made by community college students.
Target Population and Sample
The targeted population for this study consisted of transcripts of online chats between
reference librarians working within the OCLC Question Point service system and the patrons
who utilized this service through the San Diego Mesa College web portal. The chat transcripts
were from the calendar years of 2011 and 2012. There were 1,341 transcripts available that were
created when an IM or log-in chat request was accepted by a librarian and an attempt at a
conversation was made. Any abandoned chats that did not have an attempt at a two-way
conversation were excluded from the sample that was studied. The final sample consisted of 320
transcripts. They were comprised of 160 transcripts from each calendar year 80 from each of
those were from log-in chat and 80 were from the Qwidget portal.
The Southern California Community College involved was San Diego Mesa College
which had a full time equivalent (FTE) Enrollment as of Fall 2011 was 24,667, 58% of the
population was between the ages of 18-24 with the second most prevalent age group of 25-29
years old coming in at 19%. Approximately 50% of students attending the college planned on
transferring to a university for a four-year degree (San Diego Community College District
Institutional Research and Planning, 2012). FTE for Fall of 2012 was 25,468, much like the
previous year 57% of the population was between the ages of 18-24 with the second most

43

prevalent age group of 25-29 years old making up 18% of the population. Again, approximately
51% of students attending this college planned on transferring to a university for a four year
degree (San Diego Community College District Institutional Research and Planning, 2013).
Data Collection and Instrumentation
The Reference and User Services Association (RUSA) of the American Library Association
(ALA) defines a reference transaction as “information consultations in which library staff
recommend, interpret, evaluate, and/or use information resources to help others to meet
particular information needs.” (RUSA, 2008). In this study transcripts were used from virtual
reference transactions where the patron made at least one response to the librarians’ initial
greeting. There were 1,341 transcripts that were housed in a password protected OCLC Question
Point databases. Each transcript was stripped of all identifying features and given a new
identifying code prior to any analysis. The actual sample of transcripts to be analyzed had chats
where the patron responded to the librarians greeting indicating that the call was not abandoned.
There were two forms of transcripts involved in this study. One was from the instant
messaging (IM) portal. The library patrons accessed the instant messaging portal on the home
page of the library website (see Figure 3)

44

Figure 3. IM chat window that was located on the home page of the San Diego Mesa College
library website (2012).
The second type of transcript was taken from the transactions originating from the log-in Chat
portal: Ask A Librarian on the library website (see Figure 4).

Mesa College library website (2012).

Analysis Process
The over arching goal for this study was to determine if there was an inherent difference
between IM and log-in Chat reference transactions. The content of each transcript was analyzed
for evidence of nine specific characteristics: session length, formality of the librarian, type of
call, quality/depth of question, completeness/accuracy of the librarians answer, friendliness of
the librarian, did the librarian give a reference interview and if so did it change, clarify or add a
question? Did the librarian check for patron satisfaction? And, did the patron appear to be
satisfied with the transaction? Once questions were coded in the HyperResearch™ software
reports were run to determine if either portal displayed a stronger use pattern.
The length of chat session, was defined in this study as the amount of time a session took
from the time the librarian answered the patrons initial query until the last contact in the chat
session whether it was from the patron or the librarian. The system itself noted when the patron
first logged on and posted their question and when the librarian closed the chat and posted a
resolution code. This system generated time code however could not be used as is due to the fact
that librarians don’t always respond to queries as soon as they are posted nor do they post their
resolution codes immediately upon ending the chat. The transcripts were manually reviewed to
determine their actual length of time and were calculated by hand for accuracy.
Formality classifications were selected based on the work of a previous study by Westbrook
(2007) who defined four levels ranging from very formal to informal. Westbrook described
informality as being represented with abbreviations, acronyms, emoticons, slang, excessive
punctuation, contractions, dropped punctuation, dropped words, or emphatic punctuation.
Formality was defined by the opposite of the above, “express use of capitals, full sentences and
complete words” (p. 643). Each transaction was carefully read for the nuances of formality or

46

lack thereof and coded accordingly in the HyperResearch™ software. Later, analysis reports
were run to determine the formality of users in each portal.
Type of calls were defined using the Katz, Marsteller et al. question classification (as cited in
Arnold and Kaske, 2005, p. 179). The question types were:
a) Directional/General: this is a general informational question. One that takes a
negligible amount of time to answer, “the answer rarely requires more than
geographical knowledge of key locations” (2005, p. 179). This also includes such
general information questions as hours and wifi access.
b) Ready Reference: These are questions “that require only a single, usually
uncomplicated, straightforward answer. The requested information is normally found
without difficulty in standard reference works, ranging from encyclopedias to
almanacs and indexes” (2005, p. 179).
c) Specific Search: Unlike ready reference questions that can be answered with a short
piece of information from a reference book. A specific search needs more detailed
materials such as a book or document to satisfy the query.
d) Research: “research questions differ from other inquiries in that most involve trial
and error searching or browsing” (2005, p. 180) this is usually because the patron has
not fully formed their query or narrowed their search so a larger amount of back and
forth is involved to resolve the question.
e) Holdings/Do You Own?: This is when a patron is asking for a specific title of a book,
journal, article, video or the like.
Each transaction was read by the researcher and categorized into at least one of these
categories. On occasion the reference interview caused the patron to ask another question in that

47

case it would be coded as a second question instance. This data was input into the
HyperResearch™ software for analysis in order to determine if either portal had a larger number
of questions in any one category.
Quality/Depth of the question classifications were created to determine which questions
required the librarian to use more resources. There were five possible categories ranging from
query was simple/no need for probing to query was complex. Also included was a category for
no query of note because some transactions did not have a question that related to the library or
research. These classifications were created by the researcher using 17 years of professional
experience asking reference questions to library patrons. Each transaction was read and coded by
the researcher to reflect the quality/depth of the question(s) that were asked by the patron. The
coding was input into the HyperResearch™ software where a report was later ran to determine if
either portal had more in depth questions than the other.
Eight categories were created in the area of completeness/accuracy to determine if the
librarians were responding differently in either portal in terms of their answers to the patrons’
query. The range of categories went from librarian blew off question/sent to home library to
librarian was thorough in their answer. The researcher using the experience gained from five
years of reviewing online reference transcripts also created these categories. Every transaction
was read and analyzed by the researcher to determine the level of completeness/accuracy of the
answer given by the librarian. They were coded and reports were run in HyperResearch™ in
order to determine if the librarians answers were affected by which portal they were choosing to
answer questions in.
Friendliness of the librarians during the reference transaction was described by RUSA in
their behavioral guidelines as “effectively identify(ing) the patron’s information needs in a

48

manner that puts the patron at ease” (2013, section 3.0) and to “communicate[s] in a receptive,
cordial and supportive manner” (2013, section 3.1.1). Question Point trains their online reference
librarians to “create a welcoming atmosphere” (2013, section 5). Librarian friendliness is a very
important part of the reference transaction in terms of having a satisfied patron that will return to
the service. In this study there were three classifications of librarian friendliness: all business/no
personality, moderately friendly and very friendly. The researcher analyzed each transaction for
the level of friendliness the librarian demonstrated to the patron and coded them into
HyperResearch™ reflecting the level of friendliness that was displayed. Reports were run with
this data to determine if the librarians acted differently toward the patrons in one portal than the
other.
The reference interview is described by RUSA as “the heart of the reference transaction
and is crucial to the success of the process” (2013, section 3.0). Virtually every reference
question should have a reference interview of some kind but it is known that this does not occur
in every transaction. In this study the reference interview was analyzed and coded into
HyperResearch™ for each transaction in order to record if the librarians engaged the patrons
more in one service than in the other. There were two initial categories in this area of coding,
which were: there was a reference interview; there was not a reference interview. The researcher
then took this query one step further by coding: If a reference interview was given did it change,
add or clarify the question. This additional question was asked in order to discover if either
portal created an environment that fostered additional information to be brought forth by the
patron. When the reference interview did change, add or clarify the question it too was coded
into HyperResearch™ as a separate category. Reports were run for both categories to determine
how often the reference interview was given and if it effected the initial question.

49

Checking for patron satisfaction has also been called the follow-up question (Ross,
Nilsen, & Radford, 2004). The follow-up question is usually administered to either find out if the
user needs additional assistance or to discover if their needs have been met. Although the user
does not always get an answer that they find satisfactory it has been found that simply asking the
follow-up question can make the user feel better about the transaction (Nilsen, 2006). In this
study every transaction was read to determine if the satisfaction question was asked and then
recorded into the HyperResearch™ software by coding whether it was or was not asked. Reports
were later run to determine if the librarian asked the follow-up question more in one portal than
the other.
Lastly, there was a category to determine if the patron appeared to be satisfied with the
outcome of the transaction. This category was created to discover if one of the portals seemed to
have a more satisfied patron in general. Each transcript was coded as: Patron seemed satisfied
with the resolution, Patron seemed dissatisfied with the resolution, Patron had no satisfaction
indication or Patron disappeared before the resolution. The coding determination was then input
into the HyperResearch™ software and later reports were run to determine if either portal
appeared to have more satisfied patrons.
Reliability of the Coding Process
There were two phases of transcript analysis. First, the researcher gathered all transcripts,
reviewed them for appropriate inclusion in the sample, removed any identifying information and
transferred them into a Word document. The length of each transcript transaction was then
determined and put into a spreadsheet in order to calculate the length of each transaction.
The second phase of coding began with the involvement of two other college librarians. Each
had experience as a reference librarian and also had familiarity with qualitative analysis

50

procedures. Each of the nine research questions and their classifications were reviewed in-depth
by each librarian to check for usefulness and validity. The process was conducted collaboratively
so as to arrive at an agreement regarding how the transcripts would be coded. Once the research
questions and classifications were decided upon the researcher coded each transcript using the
HyperResearch™ software.
Assumptions of the Researcher
In order to analyze the transaction data and make general and definitive determinations
certain assumptions were made by the researcher:
•

The San Diego Community College online reference portal patrons were students, staff or
faculty of said college.

•

Patrons came to the online service portals knowing that they would be chatting with a
librarian for information or research purposes

•

That the librarians were properly trained in online reference protocols and proper
reference interview techniques.

•

That the San Diego Community College online reference patrons were characteristic of
other community college communities.

Human Subjects’ Considerations
This research was conducted using archival transcripts of chat conversations between
patrons and online reference librarians from a single community college. It was conducted in
compliance with federal and state guidelines for the protection of the welfare and dignity of
human subjects (Department of Health and Human Services: National Institutes of Health: Office
for Protection from Research Risks, 2005). All personal identifying information was redacted
and removed from every transcript before any review or coding of content. Each transcript was

51

assigned a new transaction number so that the order could be maintained within the transcripts
but not traced back to their origin within the database they came from.
The study met the criteria for exempt research due to the fact that there was no risk to
individual students. Specifically, the research qualified based on Title 45 Code of Federal
Regulations Part 46.101 subpart B section 4 [45 CFR 46.101(b)(4)]. There was always a chance
that there could be a breach in procedure regarding the de-identification of the transcripts.
Fortunately, the nature of these transcripts was neither sensitive nor related to personal or
professional reputation or performance. Approval was received from the University’s Graduate
and Professional Schools’ Institutional Review Board in May, 2013 (see Appendix B).

CHAPTER 4. RESEARCH FINDINGS
Studies regarding various aspects of academic library chat reference have been published
since 2001 (Flagg, 2001) however the need to understand the patrons’ response to different
forms of online chat service has been generally overlooked by the academic research community.
The purpose of this study was to examine if there is any inherent difference between IM and login chat reference transactions. The intended outcome of this research was to understand if there is
a need to have both services at one institution or if one is more advantageous than the other.
Understanding this outcome will assist both fiscally and operationally when administering online
library research programs.
Sample Population
The study used transcripts created by the Question Point online chat service from the San
Diego Mesa College IM and log-in chat portals. The reference transaction transcripts were
chosen from the Spring terms of the years 2011 and 2012. The Spring term was selected due to
the potential learning curve for both user and librarian in the Fall. It was more likely that both the
librarians and the patrons would have experience with the reference chat system by the Spring
thus giving the researcher a wider base of user knowledge. There would certainly be first time
users in the Spring term but there was a greater likelihood that there would be a larger number of
skilled users than in the Fall.
There were 1,341 total log-in and IM chat transcripts available in the Spring terms of
2011 and 2012. The transcripts for the study were chosen using a multistage stratifying process.
Initially all transcripts from each Spring term were read to determine if they fit the criteria to be
used in the study. Transcripts were excluded if the chat was abandoned before a two-way
conversation could be started. Once the set of usable transcripts was created they were stripped
of identifying information and numbered in order to distinguish each in a unique but anonymous
53

fashion. The final transcripts were chosen randomly by way of a number generator that can be
found at http://random.org/lists. Three hundred and twenty total transcripts were chosen, 160
transcripts from each calendar year, 80 from each of those were from log-in chat and 80 were
from the Qwidget portal.
The 320 transcripts used in this study were broken down into four groups of eighty
(Table 1). One Qwidget group from 2011 and one from 2012 as well as one log-in chat group
from 2011 and one from 2012. The years 2011 and 2012 were chosen because they were the
most recent years available with a completed Spring term.

The qualitative data from the 320 transcripts was analyzed using a qualitative analysis
tool called HyperResearch™ (2012). This tool allowed the researcher to code and conduct
analysis of data in a systematic and organized format. Using this software the researcher was
able to create a “code book” that allowed for grouping of the classifications in each research
question (see Figure 5). Each transcript was then individually read and coded for classifications
from each research question which could later be organized and analyzed for frequency and
themes. Two other librarians reviewed the code book and participated in a review of coded
transcripts. Any discrepancies were discussed with modifications as needed to ensure a reliable
process. A sample of a coded transcript can be seen in Appendix C.

Research Questions
The central research question underlying this research is:
•

Is there an inherent difference between IM and log-in chat reference transactions?

The specific sub-questions were:
1. What are the time parameters involved when using a particular service?
2. What is the level of formality of library patrons using each service?
3. Are there more heavily used “type of calls” in one service than in another?
4. What is the quality/depth of the questions being asked by patrons in each service?
5. Is there a different level of completeness/accuracy in the response of the librarian in
either service?
6. Does the librarian respond differently (friendliness) to the patron depending on which
service they are using?
7. Does the librarian give a reference interview more in one service than another? And if
so does it add, change or clarify the question more in one service than another?
8. Does the librarian check with the patron for satisfaction in their query resolution more
in one service than another?
9. Does the patron appear to have a higher level of satisfaction with the resolution of a
query in one service than another?
Findings
Time spent in log-in chat and qwidget sessions. The time that was spent in either the
log-in chat or Qwidget portals had an effect on all of the research questions. Actual time spent
on-line varied on average between log-in chats and Qwidget sessions with log-in chats lasting
more than five minutes longer than the Qwidget sessions (Table 2). The range for each log-in
chat session (Table 3) was between 1 minute and 2 seconds to 59 minutes and 9 seconds (range =

56

58 minutes and 9 seconds). The range for Qwidget sessions (Table 4) being 1 minute and 52
seconds to 51 minutes and 49 seconds (range = 49 minutes and 9 seconds). There was more
variation in the log-in chat sessions with a standard deviation of 10.44 as opposed to the Qwidget
which had a standard deviation of 7.44.

User and librarian response to the portal environment. The way in which the
librarians and patrons responded to the portal environment was represented by the level of
formality of the patron and the degree of friendliness of the librarian.
User formality. The formality of an online reference session was rated using the scale by
Westbrook (2007) which defines four different levels ranging from Very Formal to Informal as
well as acknowledging that some exchanges would not provide sufficient information in order to
rate the actual level of formality (Table 5).
Table 5
Definitions of Patron Formality
Very Formal
Formal
Seems Comfortable and Polite
Informal

Typed Too Little to Know Formality

Using full sentences, proper grammar and
punctuation and showing respect to the
librarian as an instructor not a peer.
Very polite, mostly correct grammar and
punctuation.
Treated the librarian with respect however
as more of a helpful peer. Might have used
some emoticons or slang.
Treats the librarian as a peer or tutor.
Writes in a casual manner. Might use:
slang, emoticons, abbreviations for
multiple words, emphatic language.
Patron did not write anything that would
put them in a formality category.

There were only two sessions in the Qwidget portal that were rated as Very Formal and
none in the log-in chat portal. There were an equal percentage of sessions rated Formal in both
log-in chat and Qwidget and an equal rating for Informal exchanges. The only variations
involved a higher percentage (21% higher) of log-in chat sessions being rates as Comfortable
and Polite than the Qwidget sessions though it should be noted that there were 20% more of the
Qwidget sessions deemed to have too little information in order to rate the level of formality
(Table 6).
To illustrate these levels of formality numerous examples are provided. All study
transcripts are copied as written in the chat, spelling and grammar were not corrected
Very Formal: (from Qwidget case 10, 2012)
Patron: I would like to submit a request for a book I find interesting. May I do it
using this media?
Patron: The book is relevant as introduction to contemporary philosophy or art:
Librarian 1: Hi! I am a librarian in xxx and I will be assisting you today. Your
librarians have asked our librarians to staff this 24-hour service when they are
unavailable. I am reading your question right now to see how I can help you.

Patron: Explaining Postmodernism: Skepticism and Socialism from Rousseau to
Foucault (Expanded Edition) (Hardcover) by Stephen R. C. Hicks
Patron: Hello Ma'm!
Librarian 1: Since I could not find this in your catalog, you can request the book
via interlibrary loan.
Patron: Wonderful! What do I have to do?
Librarian 1: I am looking though your policies page - still searching
Librarian 1: I did find a suggestion for purchase but that is not ususally the fastest
option http://www.sdmesa.edu/library/suggest-purchase.cfm
Librarian 1: Here is the ILL page
http://libcat.sdccd.edu/hipres/sdccd/illservicepolicy.html
Patron: I'm sorry that I am taking so much of your time.
Librarian 1: Not a problem - does this help?
Librarian 1: I can refer this to your college reference librarians who can help you
further.
Patron: Yes! thank you very much. Have a wonderful weekend.
Librarian 1: Can I help you with anything else?
Patron: You already did. Thank you!
Librarian 1: Thank you for using our service. If you need further assistance,
please contact us again. Goodbye for now...
In this transcript the patron addressed the librarian as “Ma’am” and generally used
correct spelling, grammar and punctuation. The tone is respectful, not casual. It is interesting to
note that this is one of only two examples of a very formal chat in all of the 320 transcripts and it
was in a log-in chat transaction.

Formal: (Qwidget Case 14, 2011)
Patron: i lost my student ID would i get charged to get a new one?
Librarian 1: Well, let me see if I can find that out.

Librarian 1: Yes, it looks like there is a $5 charge:
http://www.sdmesa.edu/admissions/csid.cfm

Librarian 1: Is there anything else I may help you with?

Patron: no that is it thank you very much

In this Qwidget transcript the patron is asking a straight forward Directional/General type
of question. There is no indication that they want to be on familiar terms with the librarian nor is
there any indication that they feel particularly comfortable in the IM environment. Full sentences
are used and the patron closes the transaction with formal politeness
Seems Comfortable and Polite: (Qwidget case 42 from 2011)
Patron: hi i wanted to know if i can check out a book 'aims of arguement'
Librarian 1: Hello, I'm xxx, a librarian at xxx University, and I'm happy to
help!
Librarian 1: I'm reading your question now....
Patron: oh thank goodness
Librarian 1: :)

Librarian 1: Are you a student at San Diego Mesa?

Patron: i am a student at mesa college and dont have this text book (ordered
online)

Librarian 1: Oh, and so you want to see if anyone has it so you can borrow it?

Patron: yes

Librarian 1: okay, let me see what I can find first at your library

Patron: if i can check it out at the library... sadly it seems like they have an old
61

edition...but its ok

Patron: i wanted aims of argument 7th ed... they have the 6th ed

Librarian 1: looks like there is a copy on reserve for ENGLISH 205
Patron: yes that is my course...

Patron: does that mean i can check it out?

Librarian 1: yes. you will only be able to have it for a limited time - a couple
of hours, or overnight, i can't tell from the info
Librarian 1: let me send you the record from the library catalog
Patron: oh... ok... will go to the college and see...thanks
Librarian 1: what's your email address?
Patron: xxx@xxx.com

Patron: can i put it on hold?

Librarian 1: usually they don't allow holds, it's first come first served
Patron: ok... thanks... going rt away
Patron: bye

Librarian 1: does say "checked in" which is good.

Librarian 1: If you need further assistance, please feel free to contact us
again. Thank you for using our service. Goodbye!

In this Qwidget transcript the librarian and patron chat back and forth in a friendly

and comfortable manner. The patron uses phrases that make him/her seem at ease such as:
“if i can check it out at the library... sadly it seems like they have an old edition...but its ok”

and later when he/she states “ok… thanks… going rt away” capitalization is not used by the
patron however punctuation is used regularly. The patron clearly seems comfortable with
the format and is polite to the librarian.

62

Too Little To Know Formality: (Log-In Chat Case 79, 2011)
Patron: how many books can i check out
Librarian 1: Greetings! I am assisting your library by answering this service,
let me find out the answer for you. One moment please.
Librarian 1: The policies are on this webpage:
http://www.sdmesa.edu/library/circulation.cfm

Librarian 1: Looks like you can check out a maximum of 10 books for a two
week period.
Librarian 1: Is there anything else I can help you with today?
Patron: thank you thats all

Librarian 1: Thanks for using our service! Have a good night.

This Patron had one simple question which was answered fully and to the apparent

satisfaction of the patron. There is simply not enough text written by the patron to know if
they are formal, informal or comfortable with the service.

Librarian friendliness. In the Guidelines for Behavioral Performance of Reference and

information Service Providers created by the Reference and User Services Association of the
American Library Association; “friendliness” can be seen described in section 3.0
Listening/Inquiring. In it the Guidelines state:
The reference interview is the heart of the reference transaction and is crucial to the
success of the process. The librarian should effectively identify the patron’s information
needs in a manner that puts the patron at ease. Effective listening and questioning skills
are necessary for a positive interaction (RUSA 2013).
The Guidelines continue in section 3.1.1 stating “Communicates in a receptive, cordial and
supportive manner.”
The Question Point Best Practices For 24/7 Reference Cooperative Sessions web page

63

states under the first bullet in section 5 Interpersonal skills “Create a welcoming atmosphere”
(2013).
Table 7 defines friendliness as it was used in this study.
Table 7
Definitions of Librarian Friendliness
Librarian is all Business/No Personality
Librarian is Moderately Friendly
Librarian is Very Friendly

This is when the librarian is the equivalent
of monotone in their response to the patron.
This is when the librarian shows some
empathy or interest in the patron and their
needs.
This is when the librarian shows interest
and/or empathy with the patron. The
librarian might be reassuring or
sympathetic in their responses.

is Moderately Friendly is only slightly higher at a 7% difference. In the classification of
Librarian is Very Friendly however there is a difference of 12% between log-in chat and
Qwidget with log-in chat librarians getting the higher percentage.

Examples of the friendliness classifications are provided. Not all transcripts are
represented in full. All study transcript examples are quoted directly with no corrections.
Librarian is all Business/No Personality: (from Qwidget Case 21, 2011)
Librarian 1: …Do you have the book in front of you?
Patron: no, i'm using online library catalog: Books and More
Librarian 1: What are you being asked to do with the book bibliography and the
index?
Librarian 1: Are you asking about how to find a book with references and an
index?
Librarian 1: Or are you asking about how to find the references and index in a
book that you're using?
Patron: yes I'm asking about how to find the references and index in a book that
you're using and learn to research books in the library web site
Librarian 1: The references and index will be at the back of the book.
Librarian 1: You'll use the library's online catalog to decide which books you
want to use. Then, if it's a print book, you'll go to the library to get it. If it's an
eBook, you'll access it through the library's catalog.
Patron: thank you for your help
In this case the librarian is thorough enough but shows no empathy for the students
confusion. The librarian does not reassure the patron that this question can be confusing as not
all books have indexes. The patron received facts from the librarian, perhaps not enough facts,
and they both moved on in a very matter of fact, efficient manner.
Librarian is Moderately Friendly (from Log-In Chat Case 4, 2012)
Librarian 1: …Hi xxx! You can check library course reserves here:
Librarian 1:
http://libcat.sdccd.edu.libraryaccess.sdmesa.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&profile=msrbr#
focus
Librarian 1: either search by course, or you can change the "course" selector and
65

search by professor's name instead
Patron: ok thank you. Doesnt look like any of my professors have books on
reserve
Librarian 1: That's too bad. Can I help you with anything else?
Patron: thats it, Thank you
Librarian 1: You're welcome!
Librarian 1: Thank you for using our 24/7 Ask Us Now service. Come back again
if you need help, we're always available. Goodbye.
In this transcript the librarian shows friendliness in the form of empathy by stating “that’s
too bad” and responding to the patron with “You’re welcome!” and encouraging them to return if
they need assistance.
Librarian is Very Friendly (from Log-in Chat Case 3, 2011)
Patron: Im trying to find a communication journal about personal relationships
Librarian 1: Let me see if I can help you. What do you mean by a
"communication journal?
Patron: If thats not clear enough, the directions for the assiment reads as follows:
find a copy of a journal article at the liberary that fits your interest in
communication theory.
Librarian 1: And what kind of personal relationships.
Patron: any.... I guess.... the it says examples of communication journals : com
education, com monograhps, personal relationships, journal of com, journal of
language and social psychology, jornal of non verbal behavior
Patron: acutally I like the journal of non verbal behavior a
Patron: so either one will do
Librarian 1: Ok. Let's do this together. Let's go into the database EbscoHost.
Patron: ok
Patron: wait. how do i get there

66

Librarian 1: Are you at the Library's website?
Patron: ok
Patron: yes
Librarian 1: Click on the left hand side where it says ARTICLE DATABASES.
Librarian 1: Then select EBSCOHOST.
Patron: ok
Patron: got it
Patron: ok
Librarian 1: I am going to type in communication personal relationships and click
on full text and click on scholarly articles or journals.
Patron: k
Librarian 1: Now I only retrieved one article and I don't think it is what you are
wanting. So we need to select more specific terms. What do you want your article
to be about?
Patron: non verbal behavior
Librarian 1: OK. let's type in non-verbal behavior.
Patron: ok
Librarian 1: Click on BASic Search and be sure to click on full text and scholarly
journals.
Patron: k got some
Patron: the 1st one
Patron: deceptive responses
Librarian 1: How do they look to you?
Patron: so how do I find them?
Patron: great :)

67

Librarian 1: Please notice that the journal title is in italics.
Patron: yes
Librarian 1: You have them in full text if you clicked on the full text.
Patron: ok
Librarian 1: At each hit it will say PFD or Full tect. Just click on that and you will
get the full text. Try it.
Librarian 1: Are you able to retrieve it?
Patron: yes
Patron: I want to print it but I dont have cash, is there anywhere I can get money
back or atm?
Patron: or is there a hard copy I can look at?
Librarian 1: Let me check. By the way you can always e-mail the article to
yourself.
Patron: yes ! I forgot about that hahaha
Librarian 1: To e-mail it to yourself, double click on the blue title. The option to
e-mail it will be on the right hand side.
Patron: ok
Librarian 1: AS for the ATM, I don't see anything about it but you could call the
Reference Desk at 619-388-2660
Librarian 1: Can I help you with anything else?
Patron: Nothing else, thank you youve been a great help!
Patron: Have a great day!
Patron: bye :)
Librarian 1: Good! Good luck with your paper.
This librarian was not only very helpful but patient. The statement “Ok. Let's do this

68

together” is reassuring to the student that they will not be left trying to figure it out for
themselves. The librarian gave additional information to make the students future research easier
by letting them know “By the way you can always e-mail the article to yourself”. Lastly, the
librarian showed personal interest in closing by stating “Good! Good luck with your paper.”
Transaction content classification and quality/depth of question. The questions that
were posed to the librarians were classified into six categories. Patron queries had varying
degrees of depth meaning the query required the librarian to spend more or less time searching
and retrieving information with the patron.
Classification of patron question. The patron transactions were classified into six
different categories depending on what type of information was being asked.
The questions are defined and described in Table 9 using the Katz, Marsteller et al.
question classifications (as cited in Arnold and Kaske, 2005, p. 179).

69

Table 9
Definitions of Question Classification
Directional/General

These questions were generally about the library
building and services that were offered.
This is when a patron asks for a specific journal or
book title. It was also applied to more general
holdings questions where the patron knew what
they wanted but did not know the exact title.
These are general reference questions that
normally require a single source to answer such as
an encyclopedia or almanac. There is not much
searching necessary on the part of the librarian
Unlike ready reference this question requires a
more detailed search and the answer comes from a
more unique source such as a book or journal
This question involves the most trial and error.
Usually the patron has not fully formed their
research question and needs the most assistance
narrowing their topic and/or searching multiple
sources for their needs.
This is a question made by the patron that is
unrelated to the library or research.

Directional/General and Holdings/Do You Own Questions are generally the easier and more
straight forward questions to answer. They were asked 26% more in Qwidget than in log-in chat.
Subsequently the higher level question that require more searching and working with the patron:
Ready Reference, Research and Specific Search were asked 28% more in log-in chat than in
Qwidget. Unrelated Questions were only asked 2% more in Qwidget than in log-in chat. The
questions that were unrelated to library reference service were only asked in 4% of the total
transcripts (Table 10).
Excerpts of transcripts exemplifying the question classifications are provided. All study
transcripts are copied as written in the original transaction, spelling, grammar and punctuation
were not corrected.
Directional/General: (from Log-In Chat Case 26, 2012)
Patron: “is there a way to renew my checked out books without coming into the
LRC?”
Holdings/Do You Own: (from Qwidget Case 34, 2012)
Patron: “Hi, can you tell me the link to find out if you have "Tibetan Book of the
Dead for Reading Aloud" available for check out, not the reserve copy?”
Ready Reference: (from Qwidget Case 79, 2011)
Patron: “how do u say butler in Spanish”
Specific Search: (from Log-In Chat Case 34, 2011)
Patron: “where can i find an article from a medical journal on duchenne muscular
dystrophy”
Research: (from Log-In Chat Case 41, 2011)
Patron: “i need help researching about bottled water trends and overview”
Unrelated Question: (from Qwidget Case 24, 2012)
Patron: If I took a class this semester, is it possible to take it again later?”
Quality/Depth of patron query. During the process of coding the type of questions for
their classification it was also important to find out if the librarian had to use more resources (i.e.

71

quality/depth) in one online portal than another when answering these queries. The
Quality/Depth classifications were created by the researcher using 17 years of professional
experience asking reference questions and are defined in Table 11.
Table 11
Definitions of Quality/Depth Question Classification
No Query of Note
Query Was Simple/No Need for Probing
Query Required Minimal/a Bit of

Query Required Some Detailed Searching
Query Was Complex

Table 12

The patron usually does not ask a question
or asks a question that does not require an
answer.
These Questions are straight forward such
as Holdings/Do You Own.
These are Questions that require a few
extra mouse clicks to answer such as Ready
Reference.
These questions require some reference
interview skills on the part of the librarian
in order to get at the actual research need.
The complex query takes research and
reference interview skills on the part of the
librarian. These questions are often multilayered and scholarly.

The classifications of: Query was Simple/No Need for Probing and Query Required
Minimal/A Bit of Searching were asked in 14% more in Qwidget transcripts than log-in chat.
Whereas the classifications of: Query Required Some Detailed Searching and Query was
Complex were asked 16% more in the log-in chat portal (Table 12).
Excerpts of depth classification questions from log-in chat and Qwidget Transcripts are
provided. No change was made to grammar, spelling or punctuation.
No Query of Note: (from Qwidget Case 25, 2012)
Patron: there's a old man in the library that was watching porn! regulate!

Query Required Some Detailed Searching: (from Log-In Chat Case 72, 2011)
Patron: I have to write an essay about how social class affects children's success, but I
can't find suitable articles...Can you please help me!!!! I use these words in my search:
social class, children, success, kids, education, but they did not work.
Query Was Complex: (from Log-In Chat Case 72, 2012)
Patron: I am looking up the following: Origins of Sikhism (religion).
Librarian 1: I'd be happy to help you find some good articles
Patron: Also, Sikhisms relationship with Hinduism and Islam
In this last Query it is the last sentence that turns this reference question from relatively simple to
complex. Although the question seems relatively straight forward there is quite a bit of
researching necessary.
Completeness/Accuracy of a question and the reference interview. Once the type and
quality/depth of the query was recorded it was important to look at how the librarian answered
the question in each portal. Librarians are taught to give complete and correct information in

73

their reference question responses and the researcher wanted to study if the type of portal being
used changed the completeness/accuracy of their response. Librarians are also taught to give a
reference interview (discussed in chapter two of this study) in order to understand fully what the
patron is truly asking for. The researcher studied whether the type of portal being used affected
the librarians’ ability to give a reference interview. Additionally, the researcher wanted to study
if giving the reference interview changed, clarified or added a question to the transaction and if
that happened more in one portal than another.
Completeness/Accuracy of the librarians’ responses. A complete/accurate answer from
a librarian fully answers the patrons query with information that can be verified. The
completeness/accuracy classifications and their definitions (Table 13) were created by the
researcher using the experience gained from five years of reviewing online reference transcripts
for these characteristics.

Excerpts from Qwidget and log-in chat transcripts are provided and give an example of the
completeness/accuracy classifications in context as well as explanations regarding why that
transaction was classified as it was. The transcript examples have not been changed in any way
from the original.
Librarian Blew off Question/Sent to Home Library: (from Log-In Chat Case 21, 2011)
Patron: …i also need to find the largest non clonal (mass) thing to have ever lived
, and what is the longest living non clonal thing on earth ? and what they have in
common where can i find that ?
Librarian 1: I had a student with the same question last night is this a class
assisgnment there is not much online about that?
Patron: yes its a class assignment . well its more like one of many , our teacher
gave us a list of things to find and those two are the ones ive [sic] been having
most trouble with because i dont want to use google or any of those search
engines
Librarian 1: I would suggest you consult with your instructor about those
questions, if you cannot find any information in the databases
Librarian 1: I'd be happy to pass your question along to the local staff and have
them email you back with an answer. Would you like me to do that? What's the
latest date that you can use this information?…
In this case the librarian does not ask any reference interview questions that might assist
in answering the question. The fact that the librarian had this question already and made little
apparent headway is not an excuse to forgo the reference interview entirely. This student may
have had more information about their topic that could steer the transaction to a successful
conclusion but instead the librarian chose to end the chat and leave it to the home librarian to
contend with.
Librarian Gave Incomplete Answer: (from Qwidget Case 14, 2012)
Patron: i need some advice on this world and i need to research cultural
knowledge
Patron: here are the four words
76

Patron: Voracious ,Amorphous,Formidable,Immense,Genesis
Librarian 1: Have you tried the dictionary?
Patron: here is my explaination it was first week of classs and our english pro
gave us this assignment to read on the most agnoying assiemt n then it told us
some steps find four word u dont understand look up the definition n then guess n
give me some cultural knowlege of it bla bla bla so i need help on that part i did
the rest n i need to do one part!
Librarian 1: Which english class is this eg. eng100, 200, etc?
Librarian 1: It looks like an essignment one might receive in an philosophy or
class on religion.
Librarian 1: If you have any experience in either of these areas, you might want
to apply these words to that.
Librarian 1: What I can suggest to you is to look these words up in the Oxford
English Dictionary, the 27 volume set which gives
Librarian 1: the etymology of words.
Librarian 1: This is where I would begin. By doing this you might find the
various
Librarian 1: ways in which the word was used since it was created.
Patron: this is english 49
Patron: thnks so much
Librarian 1: Would you like me to locate a library in the area that has this
reference book?
Librarian 1: We do have it at xxx in the reference area, first floor.
Librarian 1: Please feel free to come in and use it here in the library.
Librarian 1: Good luck with your paper and thank you for using our service.
In this case Mesa College library also had both the Oxford English Dictionary and an
etymological dictionary available but the librarian did not check the library catalog to find them.

77

Librarian Gave Incorrect Answer: (from Log-In Chat Case 56, 2011)
Patron: Hello there! I am xxx with CSID xxx. I am trying to renew my books
since they are due last week and because I was so busy with three tests. I really
still need the books for my research paper due next week. Is it possible that
someone can renew them again and delete the fine of due to late returning….
Librarian 1: Here is the information Renewals Current books may be
renewed once unless a hold is already been placed on the book. Renewals may be
made in person, by telephone (619 388-2696), or online
Patron: ok , cool. I'll make a call
Patron: thank you for helping me
Librarian 1: You should be able to renew online by going to My Library Account
in the library catalog
http://libcat.sdccd.edu.libraryaccess.sdmesa.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?profile=ms#focus
In this case the college library policy also clearly states that overdue books can not be
renewed. Therefore the student now has a full expectation that they can renew overdue books
due to the information given to them by the librarian.
Librarian Gave Just Enough Answer and No More: (from Log-In Chat Case 29, 2012)
Patron: …I no there is a link on my schools website for where i can have a couple
of link like proquest, or access worlds news. theses are links that will help me
type in a topic and it will bring up articles and news papers ect. to help me do
research for my english paper…
Librarian 1: you're a student at San Diego Mesa College?
Librarian 1: http://www.sdmesa.edu/library/database.cfm
Librarian 1: this is the page with the databases
Librarian 1: you need to login with your CSID number and last name
Librarian 1: is that what you were looking for?
Patron: yes thank you very much…

78

In this case the librarian could have assisted the patron in narrowing down which
databases would be best for the English paper topic they were researching but they neglected to
ask if there was anything else they could do to assist the student.
Librarian Gave Partially Incorrect Answer: (from Qwidget Case 28, 2011)
Patron: …Hi, could you please tell me if the Biology, Concepts and Connections,
6th edition by Campbell [QH308.2.B56448 2008] is available for checkout?...
Librarian 1:
http://libcat.sdccd.edu.libraryaccess.sdmesa.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=12E65H
288C845.10312&profile=ms&uri=link=3100006~!287119~!3100001~!3100002
&aspect=basic&menu=search&ri=1&source=~!horizon&term=Biology+%3A+co
ncepts+%26+connections+%2F&index=PALLTI
Librarian 1: Yes the book is checked in
Patron: How long can I checkout this book for?
Librarian 1: Let me check
Librarian 1: Their website does not say but here is a phone number to call 619388-2696…
In this case the librarian did not check the website fully. The check-out policies are
clearly stated.
Librarian Had No Chance to Answer Question: (from Qwidget Case 3, 2011)
14:01:11 Patron: …I am looking for some self help books i suffer from chronic
depression
14:01:33 Librarian 1: Please give me a few moments while I search.
14:02:17 Patron: Patron ended chat session.
The time stamp clearly notes that the patron disappeared from the chat before the
librarian had the opportunity to answer the query.
Librarian Had no Question to Answer: (from Qwidget Case 76, 2011)
Patron: Qwidget: hello
Patron: is anybody there?

79

Librarian 1: Welcome to the 24/7 Reference Service! Please give me a moment to
read your question...
Librarian 1: Hi. My name is xxx and I am a librarian from the University xxx.
Librarian 1: How may I help you?
Patron: oh nothing. i just wanted to see if somebody was there,
Patron: well HAPPY VALENTINES day xxx :)…
Librarian was Thorough in Their Answer: (from Log-In Chat Case 1, 2011)
Patron: …do i need my student id to check the items out, or just my CSID?
Librarian 1: They ask for your student ID card
Patron: if i havent gotten one yet will i be able to check it out?
Patron: if i have my state id?
Librarian 1: Are you a current student at San Diego Mesa College?
Patron: yes
Librarian 1: Your library says: Staff and currently enrolled students use their
CSID Card. If a student does not have their ID they can check out books by
producing a copy of their class registration and a photo ID.
This was a simple question and the librarian answered it thoroughly with all available
information for the patron.
The reference interview. Ross, Nilsen and Radford, in their book Conducting the
Reference Interview (2009), define the reference interview as “purposive conversation between
librarians and users in which questions are asked to get a clearer and more complete picture of
what users want to know and to link users to the system” (p. 4). Later they state:
While the reference interview is a crucial tool for these novice users, it enhances the
likelihood of receiving a helpful answer for all users. In short, you should give every user
the chance to elaborate on the query; if it turns out to have been unnecessary, then no

80

harm is done. (p. 5)
Table 15 describes how a reference interview was coded when there was, or was not, a
reference interview.
Table 15
Definitions of Reference Interview Transcript Classification
There Was a Reference Interview
There Was Not a Reference Interview

The Librarian asked at least one probing
question to the patron.
The librarian answered the question they
assumed was being asked with no
additional inquiry.

Table 16 displays that a reference interview was conducted 7% more in the log-in chat
portal than in the Qwidget portal. Subsequently a reference interview was not conducted 3%
more frequently in the Qwidget portal.
Examples of the reference interview classification are taken directly from the transcripts
with no corrections for spelling, grammar or punctuation.
There was a reference interview (from Qwidget Case 61, 2011)
Patron: im looking for a historical atlas from the time periods of the beginning of
civilization until the year 1700
Librarian 1: Wow! Let's see what what we can find. Have you looked in the
catalog?
81

Patron: do you know where I can find a good one online?
Patron: no I havent. I dont even know where to start looking
Librarian 1: Are you at the Library's homepage?
Patron: yes i am…
The librarian responds to the patron’s query with “wow!” acknowledging that their
question is unusual and then the librarian asks a question in order to understand where to begin
assisting the student. Later the librarian clarifies in order to get the patron to begin at the most
advantageous place on the website. This example shows how a simple reference interview at the
beginning of a reference transaction can put the patron at ease, clarify where they are in the
process and get them started in a non-threatening manner.
There was Not a Reference Interview (from Log-In Chat Case 55, 2012)
Patron: im am trying to do a research paper for english 101 and we need to get
five sources. i no there is web page that gives me a few databases to choose from
such as access world new, but i am having trouble finding this website.
Librarian 1: Hi, I'm xxx, a librarian at xxx in xxx. I'm helping your librarians by
answering questions for them. I am reading your question right now and will be
with you in a minute. Thank you!
Librarian 1: Let me see what I can find for you.
Patron: ok
Librarian 1: This is your college's list of databases:
Librarian 1: http://www.sdmesa.edu/library/database.cfm
Patron: yes
Patron: this is the page thank you
Librarian 1: No problem. If you need more help, please let us know.
Librarian 1: Have a good evening.

82

This librarian did not get any background information about the assignment to assist the
student in finding the databases that would work best. Nor did the librarian find out if the patron
had ever used a database in which case they may have needed assistance in finding the articles
needed. The closing of the chat was also abrupt. Instead of asking if there was anything else that
could be done right now the librarian let the student know that they could come back later if they
had any questions.
Reference interview adding, changing or clarifying the question. Once it was
determined whether there was a reference interview the researcher investigated one step further
to find out if the reference interview added, changed or clarified the original question being
asked by the patron. Table 17 defines the three reference interview classifications.
Table 17
Definitions of Follow-up Reference Interview Classification
Reference Interview Added a Question
Reference Interview Changed the Question
Reference Interview Clarified the Question

During the reference interview process the
patron added another question to their
query.
During the reference interview process the
patron changed their original question
usually due to narrowing of topic.
During the reference interview process the
patron clarified the original question to be
more specific.

Out of 320 total transactions only 153 (86 in Log-In Chat and 67 in Qwidget) were noted
as having added, changed or clarified the question that was asked. Table 18 and Table 19 break
down those chats into the three categories of added, changed or clarified the reference interview
question.

Table 18 and 19 display that only 53% (n = 86) of total log-in chat sessions and 41%
(n = 67) of total Qwidget questions are represented in these tables. There is a variety of reasons
that a reference interview may not be asked and therefore not added, changed or clarified e.g.
directional or holdings questions are often too straight forward to need a reference question. In
both the log-in chat and Qwidget portals the reference interview tended to clarify the question
with changing or adding a question happening less than 5% of the time.
Transcript excerpts of added, changed or clarified questions are provided with an
explanation for the reason for coding that question in that manner. There were no changes made
to spelling, grammar or punctuation.
Reference Interview Added a Question (Log-In Chat Case 31, 2012)
Patron: Chat Transcript: I am looking to possibly check out a book from Mesa
College Library. I am looking for a book written by Nigel Davies, titled The
Ancient Kingdoms of Mexico. I am not able to find anything online for this

84

author/title. Please help
Librarian 1: Hello, I'm a reference librarian at xxx College. Your library and my
library are part of an international cooperative that staffs this chat service. I'm
looking at your question right now.
Librarian 1: OK, let me do a quick search for this book at your college library
catalog. I will be right back!
Patron: Great thank you!
Librarian 1: It appears that only San Diego Miramar College has this title and not
at Mesa.
Librarian 1: At SD Miramar, they have 2 copies. One copy is missing and the
other is checked out.
Librarian 1: Would you like me to check to see if any other libraries in your area
carry this title?
Patron: Oh yikes!
Patron: No wonder why I am unable to locate a copy.
Patron: Are you able to see if local libraries have the book available?
Patron: That would be very helpful….
In this transaction the patron began wanting to know if their college library had a
particular book. The librarian used the reference interview process to guide the patron to a
possible copy at a local public library.
Reference Interview Changed the Question (Chat Case 52, 2011)
Patron: Is the LA times a great source
Librarian 1: Hi, I'm xxx in xxx. I will be helping you tonight. I'm reading your
question now.
Librarian 1: Can you tell me more about your research topic?
Patron: tomorrow's America: Are college Students prepare to be stewards of our
democracy, and with our budget deficit I was thinking about using the article in
the times about the governor.

85

Librarian 1: I see that you have an assignment to work on. Can you tell me what
grade this is for?
Patron: Bachelor of Science in Organizational Leadership at APU (Research
Project)
Librarian 1: L.A. Times will be a good source, but there are other databases that
may be useful to your research.
Librarian 1: So, are you a current student at both the San Diego Mesa College and
APU? I am asking because you will need to be a current student to access an
institution's subscription databases.
Patron: yes I'm
Librarian 1: Would you like me to start with San Diego Mesa College resources?
Patron: yes
Librarian 1: Please have your ID# handy to log in.
Patron: ok
Librarian 1: http://www.sdmesa.edu/library/database.cfm?type=5
Librarian 1: On the right side of the web page, there is a list of databases that
covers multiple subjects. Since you are interested in newspaper sources, I would
suggest you start with Proquest Newspapers.
Librarian 1: You may wish to use keywords such as:
Librarian 1: california budget deficit
Patron: I did that and that how I came up with the first question
Librarian 1: Did you mean how college students can prepare to be stewards of our
democracy with California budget deficit?
Librarian 1: Are you there still?
Patron: No I did not but I like your ideal better can I use it.
Librarian 1: Yes, please feel free to use it. Just in case, would you like to share
what you have in mind originally? I am asking so that you have a second, fall
back research topic.

86

Patron: Students, are they prepared to be stewards of our democracy in the 21th
Century
Librarian 1: I see.
Librarian 1: This is a really general topic. How do you plan to approah this topic?
Patron: to sharpen the focus I may use a combination of both:
Patron: I was planning on going back in history to the 1960's and talking about
the student movements and asking the question are todays' students ready to run
the country tomorrow
Librarian 1: That's sounds like a good plan.
Librarian 1: So, you are writing a persuasive/argumentative essay.
Librarian 1: http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/685/05/
Librarian 1: You may find this site useful in helping you organize your
arguments/facts.
Librarian 1: Do you think you have enough information to continue with your
research?
Patron: I was plannings on talking about the former president and his involument
with Eron and who Eron robbed CALPERS making employee of the state,
children who maybe could pay now parents can pay
Patron: can not pay for college
Patron: Thank for the advice
The patron began the chat simply asking if a source was worth using. The reference
interview changed the conversation to the content of the paper being written and narrowing of
the topic.
Reference Interview Clarified the Question (Qwidget Case 11, 2011)
Librarian 1: Hello, I am a reference librarian working in cooperation with your
library. What is your question?
Patron: i am majoring in architecutr

87

Patron: architecture
Patron: i need some good resourses to research
Patron: are u still there??
Librarian 1: Let's go to your library's webpage at
http://www.sdmesa.edu/library/index.cfm
Librarian 1: If you want books, we can go to the library catalog, and if you would
like articles, we can go to databases.
Patron: i prefer online sourses
Librarian 1: Ok, click on Article and Reference Databases. Then on the left-hand
side, there is a link to all the databases that cover architecture. Click on that.
Patron: and then which website is for architecture??
Librarian 1: All the databases listed on the right-hand side could be used to find
architecture articles, images, etc.
Librarian 1: What are you looking for specifically?
Patron: i'm looking about light in architecture
Librarian 1: EBSCOhost, ProQuest, or JSTOR would be good.
Patron: great, thank you
Librarian 1: Then for different search terms, try: architecture AND light
Patron: ok
Librarian 1: public buildings AND light (if you are thinking of public buildings,
if not.... buildings AND light
Librarian 1: structures AND light
Librarian 1: Terms like that. Is that enough to get you started?
Patron: yes that's awsome
Librarian 1: Great. Thank you for using our 24/7 Ask Us Now service. Come
back again if you need help, we're always available. Goodbye.

88

The librarian could have simply pointed the patron to the databases listed under
“architecture” however the reference interview process brought the librarian to ask “What are
you looking for specifically” which allowed the chat to become more specific to clarify the
students needs.
Patron satisfaction and librarian query for satisfaction. When a reference transaction
appears to be complete the librarian should check for satisfaction in order to assure that the
patron feels comfortable enough to use the information on their own. Additionally the patron
may or may not appear to be satisfied with the transaction even if they positively responded to a
satisfaction question. The researcher used this study to discover if there was any difference in
either the asking of a satisfaction question by the librarian or the appearance of satisfaction by
the patron in either portal.
Librarian query for satisfaction. Satisfaction questions are also known as follow-up
questions. They are designed to be two fold, both to “invite the user to ask for additional help” or
“to discover if the need has been met” (Ross, Nilsen, & Radford, 2009, p. 120). Table 20 defines
the three classifications used in this study to determine if a satisfaction question was asked.

Difference

The librarians could not ask a satisfaction question 9% more often in the Qwidget than in
the log-in chat portal. However, the log-in chat librarians did not ask a satisfaction question 16%
more often then in the Qwidget. A question to assure satisfaction was asked close to 50% of the
time in both portals however the log-in chat portal asked the question 7% more often (Table 21).
The transcript examples provided have the time stamp for each question or response
given in order to clarify the librarians’ ability to ask a satisfaction question. The transcripts are in
their original state with no corrections to spelling, grammar or punctuation.
Librarian Could not Ask Satisfaction Question (from Log-In Chat Case 50, 2012)
16:27:31 Patron: Chat Transcript: Unable to access Psyarticles database (under
Psycology). Are we having problems with the system?
16:28:38 Librarian 1: Hi! I'm a librarian at a different college.
16:28:48 Librarian 1: Just a moment, please, while I check.

90

16:28:51 Patron: Hi, I'm trying to access Psyarticles database, but system won
16:30:14 Patron: still there?
16:32:35 Librarian 1: The database itself seems to be working - I just accessed it.
16:32:42 Librarian 1: What message did you get?
16:33:28 Patron: "Authentication failed due to a system error. Please close the
browser and try again. "
16:34:41 Patron: I close browser and try again, but I get the same message.
16:34:53 Librarian 1: I was having that problem myself earlier. I was able to get
in by using a different browser. Can you try using a different one?
16:35:12 Patron: which one?
16:37:19 Librarian 1: If you were using Firefox, try Internet Explorer or Safari. If
you were using Internet Explorer, you can download Firefox for free and try that.
16:38:08 Librarian 1: Does that make sense?
16:38:18 Patron: I used internet explorer. Can't download firefox because I am at
the library.
16:39:52 Patron: That's ok, I will just send a message to my teacher. Thanks for
your help, though. I appreciate it. tks. bye.
16:40:05 Patron: Patron ended chat session.
Note the time coding on the transcript at the end of the transaction. The librarian asks the
patron “does that make sense?” at 16:38:08 the patron responds at 16:39:52 and ends the chat
within ten seconds of that response. The librarian did not have time to ask the patron if they
could provide anymore assistance.
Librarian Did not Ask Satisfaction Question (Qwidget Case 46, 2011)
16:54:02 Patron: im new. how do i check out books and what do i need to do ?
16:55:31 Librarian 1: This should help you.

91

16:55:48 Patron: could i just come in and check out books today?
16:56:35 Librarian 1: So if you are a current student with a student ID, it looks
like that's all you need. You would check the books out at the Circulation Desk.
16:57:29 Patron: were is that located? i do have a student id
16:57:48 Librarian 1: Are you in the Library?
16:58:41 Librarian 1: Check out services are located on the first floor of the
library.
17:01:17 Librarian 1: I would think you would see the Circulation Desk but if not
the Reference Desk is on this floor and you could ask them where it is.
17:03:36 Librarian 1: Librarian ended chat session.
The librarian gave their last statement at 17:01:17 at that point they could have assisted
the student in finding the book they needed to check out however the librarian chose to hold on
the line for over two minutes and then end the chat with no additional assistance.
There was a Question By Librarian to Assure Satisfaction (from Log-In Chat Case 15,
2012)
14:15:57 Patron: I'm looking for a workbook of Chinese 101. I wonder where it's
at
14:17:17 Librarian 1: Hi!
14:17:29 Librarian 1: I'm a librarian at a different college. Let me check.
14:18:34 Librarian 1: The workbook is on Floor 1 at the checkout desk, but
seems to be in use.
14:18:53 Patron: sure
14:19:21 Patron: thanks anyway
14:19:30 Librarian 1: There's a link to Course Reserves on the main library home
page, http://www.sdmesa.edu/library/. You can search for textbooks there.
14:20:14 Librarian 1: Did you have any other questoins? You can ask at the desk
when it will be back.

92

14:20:51 Patron: thanks so much. that should be all I want to ask today
14:21:04 Librarian 1: OK. Thanks for using chat reference!
14:21:08 Librarian 1: Librarian ended chat session.
The librarian asked the patron “Did you have any other questoins [sic]?” this gave the
patron an opportunity to continue the transaction with the knowledge that the librarian was
willing to continue. The patron responded with “thanks so much. That should be all I want to ask
today” affirming that they understood the librarian and was ready to end the chat.
Patron satisfaction. The purpose of the reference transaction is to answer the patrons
query fully, satisfying the patrons need for assistance. This study endeavored to discover if the
patrons appeared to be more satisfied with their outcomes in one portal than in the other. Table
22 defines the four patron satisfaction indicators used in the study.

Table 23 displays that patrons disappeared from the transaction before the librarian had a
chance to ask a satisfaction question 13% more in Qwidget than in log-in chat. However when a
satisfaction question could be asked the patron either had no satisfaction indication, was
dissatisfied with the resolution or showed satisfaction with the resolution more in log-in chat
than in Qwidget. Most notably the patrons seemed satisfied 12% more in log-in chat than in the
Qwidget portal.
Examples of the study transcripts that exemplify the classifications of patron satisfaction
are provided. Time stamps have been included in order to clarify the coding e.g. patron
disappeared before resolution is more clear when one can see the time difference between the
librarians’ query and the patrons’ lack of response or the call disconnecting.
Patron Disappeared Before Resolution (Qwidget Case 20, 2012)
13:54:46 Patron: Hi! I'm researching the play "The Doll House". Do we have a
copy of the script in the Mesa Library?
13:55:34 Librarian 1: Hello, I am a reference librarian working in cooperation
with your library. I am reading your question now, one moment.
13:55:52 Librarian 1: I'll take a look, one moment...
94

13:56:39 Patron: thank you
13:57:19 Librarian 1: I only have "a doll house" by Ibsen,
13:59:24 Patron: yes that is the one
14:00:12 Patron: where can i find it/
14:00:17 Patron: ?*
14:00:41 Librarian 1: Yikes, it is at City college...
14:02:37 Librarian 1: You can go to City and check it out or go to Mesa and have
the librarian at the reference desk order it for you to be sent to Mesa
14:05:09 Librarian 1: Are you still there?
14:06:35 Librarian 1: If you would like to get the book from City College Library
the play is in a book that has a few plays in it. The title is "The Complete Major
Prose Plays" by Ibsen, Henrik
14:07:46 Librarian 1: Since I haven't heard from you in a while, I'm going to end
this session. Thank you for using the library's chat service. It has been a pleasure
to help you. If you need more help, please don't hesitate to try us again.
14:07:49 Librarian 1: Librarian ended chat session.
In this transaction the patron was last heard from at the time code stamp 14:00:41. The
librarian assumed that they were still there but simply not responding and answered the question
fully. At the point when they may have asked if there was any additional assistance needed the
patron had not been heard from for approximately seven minutes. The librarian then informed
the patron that they were going to end the session. In this transaction the patron clearly
disappeared before the librarian had time to be assured that they had fully assisted the patron or
that they were satisfied with the outcome of the transaction that had transpired.

09:49:05 Patron: Patron is no longer connected.
09:49:23 Librarian 1: Librarian ended chat session.
In this transcript the patron was present at 9:43:33 with the response of “THANKS”. The
librarian proceeded to answer the question for the next five minutes with no response from the
patron however the system did not note that the patron was no longer connected until 9:49:05.
By that time the librarian had asked if there was anything else they could assist with however
since the patron was no longer connected there is no way to know if the patron was satisfied with
the transaction.

Summary
This study examines two forms of online library reference software portals in an effort to
understand if there is any inherent difference between the two making one more advantageous in
the academic library setting than the other. Generally the log-in chat portal was found to have;
more lengthy chats, more a reference interviews conducted, librarians were more “friendly” to
the patrons and the patrons appeared to be more satisfied with their overall transaction. The
questions asked in the log-in chat portal were more complicated and required more in depth
answers than in the Qwidget portal as well. The portals were generally the same in the areas of:
patron formality, completeness/accuracy of the librarians answer, and the reference interview
adding, changing or clarifying the patrons’ question. This chapter included the findings and
Chapter 5 presents a discussion of implications conclusions and recommendations.

99

Chapter 5. Study Implications, Conclusions and Recommendations
Libraries around the world have had to drastically change the way they do business in the
technological age. One important aspect of library services is the reference transaction. In these
transactions library patrons query librarians regarding library services and research assistance.
As librarians have changed the way they handle reference transactions by using new
technologies they have had to adapt and make decisions regarding which software is worth
continued use. These decisions are made for both fiscal responsibility and service improvements.
Online reference services have grown with the online communities that are now a part of our
everyday culture. Two forms of online reference service portals have become the most widely
used and they are; instant messaging (IM) and log-in chat. Librarians are faced with the decision
of offering one, both or neither service at their institutions. The decision making process for
choosing which service is most advantageous has been generally haphazard at best. There is
research available regarding the services individually and librarians responses to the two services
but there is very little in the available literature that speaks to which service might best serve a
particular group of library patrons or which service the patrons respond best to other than in
popularity. This study was created to fill that gap.
Conceptual Support
The Reference and User Services Association (RUSA) states that a reference transaction
is an: “information consultations in which library staff recommend, interpret, evaluate, and/or
use information resources to help others to meet particular information needs” (RUSA, 2008). As
the internet has become a popular place for people to find the answers to their everyday
questions the library reference desk has seen a decline in the face-to-face reference transactions
(Broughton, 2001; Coffman, 1999; Coffman & McGlamery, 2000; Helfer, 2001; Lipow, 1999;
Oder, 2001; Saunders, 2001; Tenopir & Ennis, 1998; Wilson, 2000). Although Head &
100

Eisenberg (2010) found that even in 2010 college students felt confident in their web searching
skills they continued to have difficulty researching their assignments and narrowing their topics
in a way that allowed them to feel confident in their outcomes. Web resource availability causing
“disintermediation, where library users seek and retrieve information without the assistance of
the librarian” was nothing new in the field of academic library research having been discussed as
early as 2003 by Agee and Antrim (p.477). Part of the issue was knowing why the patrons were
not utilizing the library resources. Lewis and DeGroote (2008) determined that students were
more likely to use the online library resources if there were more access points on the library and
institution web pages. Once the student found the online library resources it was important that
they felt welcome and that assistance was available to them if needed. In an effort to help
librarians with their online reference transactions RUSA updated their widely accepted
Guidelines for Behavioral Performance of Reference and Information Service Providers in 2004
to include online reference services (2004b) as a guide to improve and maintain successful
interactions.
As online use became more ubiquitous in peoples daily lives librarians needed to figure
out what online reference services would best serve the needs and preferences of their patrons.
Instant Messaging (IM) was an ever growing area of online communication that was worth
considering. The Pew Internet and American Life Project determined in 2004 that Millennials
(people between the ages of 18-27) were using IM 46% more frequently than email for their
online communication needs. By 2011 “95% of 18-29 year olds use the text messaging feature
on their phones, and these users send or receive an average of 87.7 text messaged on a normal
day” (Smith, p. 3). Some libraries had already started studying the use of IM for reference
transactions as early as 2000 (Fagan & Calloway 2001; Foley 2002; Ruppel & Fagan 2002).

101

Therefore it may not be surprising that studies reported that the libraries that incorporated IM in
their library reference offerings found their statistics for use went up (Bedwell, Rodrigues,
Duggan, & Orlov, 2008; Breitbach, Mallard, & Sage, 2008; Doan & Ferry, 2007; Foley, 2002;
Stahr, 2010).
One hurdle the online reference librarian needed to tackle was to appear approachable or
friendly. In the RUSA Guidelines for Behavioral Performance of Reference and Information
Service Providers it was explained that:
the behaviors exhibited by the staff member should serve to welcome the
patrons and to place them at ease. The librarian’s role in the communications
process is to make the patrons feel comfortable in a situation that may be
perceived as intimidating, risky, confusing, and overwhelming. (RUSA, 1996,
section 1.0)
Whereas one might consider the anonymity of the online reference transaction a hindrance
Desai’s research discovered that it was actually an advantage in the IM transaction as long as the
patron was made to feel at ease by the librarian due to their availability and approachability
(2003).
IM was not the only form of online reference that was being tested in the late 20th and
early 21st century. Log-in chat reference was also being used as a means to communicate with
patrons. In this form of online reference the patron needed to fill out an intake form with all of
their basic information including their question; which was then forwarded to the librarian
allowing them to know what the question was before choosing to answer it. Additionally in the
log-in chat service the patron had the ability to get a transcript of the transaction emailed to them
upon completion, which was not available in the IM platform.

102

Although the bulk of online reference research was conducted on either IM or log-in chat
software separately (Blank, 2002; Francouer, 2001; Radford, Connoway et al., 2011; Ward,
2004). Some articles did emerge that looked at both mediums. These studies found that the IM
platform was more popular than log-in chat (Bedwell et al., 2008; Doan & Ferry, 2007;
Houghton & Schmidt, 2005). However those studies were based solely on the popularity of the
service. None looked at factors such as: the type of transactions that were being answered, the
accuracy of the transactions, the friendliness of the librarian or the satisfaction level of the
patron. A study by Breitbach et al. (2008) resulted in their academic institution choosing an IM
client over log-in chat however they had the added result of looking at time spent in each service
and discovered that the IM transactions were significantly shorter unfortunately they had not
investigated the potential reasons or effects of this outcome. One additional study was found
(Cole, 2010) using the same online reference tools being used in this study: Qwidget (IM) and
log-in Chat from OCLC Question Point. Cole found that the IM transactions were shorter
however the researcher was able to add that those questions did tend to be less in depth.
Unfortunately that study took place during a short two and a half week period beginning with the
first day they added the Qwidget to a prominent place on their website so it was still a novel
concept to their student body. It also took place at the very end of the semester, potentially
changing the nature of the questions being asked by the patrons (Cole, 2010).
For this study great care was taken to look at all aspects of the reference transaction in
order to determine which form of online reference service, if any, was best serving the patron.
RUSA’s (2013) guidelines were used to create many of the research questions in this study as
they have been proven to help create the welcoming environment that often fosters a successful
reference transaction. Primarily they state that a librarian should follow certain interpersonal

103

communication skills such as: Approachability, Interest, Listening/Inquiry, Searching and
Follow-Up (2013) in order to have a more satisfied patron and successful transaction. It has also
been found in previous research studies that a librarian: probing for the actual information
needed, showing interest and being attentive, making the patron feel comfortable and asking
follow-up questions to verify that the patron found what they were requesting had a significant
impact on the accuracy of a face- to-face transaction (Gers & Seward, 1985; Crews, 1988).
Methods
The research design used in this study was exploratory. Transcripts of reference
transactions from community college students in two different web portals were examined. The
study focused on finding possible relationships among factors as they influenced and interacted
with each other. Additionally, this study was retrospective as the data involved electronic library
reference transcripts from 2011 and 2012.
The target population for this study consisted of transcripts of online chats between
reference librarians working within the OCLC Question Point service system and the patrons
who utilized this service through the San Diego Mesa College web portal. There were 1,994
transcripts available for use in the analysis for this study. From that pool 320 transcripts were
chosen which were comprised of 160 transcripts from each calendar year 80 from each of those
were from log-in chat and 80 were from the Qwidget portal.

104

Research Questions
The central research question underlying this research was:
•

Is there an inherent difference between IM and log-in chat reference transactions?

The specific sub-questions were:
1. What are the time parameters involved when using a particular service?
2. What is the level of formality of library patrons using each service?
3. Are there more heavily used “type of calls” in one service than in another?
4. What is the quality/depth of the questions being asked by patrons in each service?
5. Is there a different level of completeness/accuracy in the response of the librarian in
either service?
6. Does the librarian respond differently (friendliness) to the patron depending on which
service they are using?
7. Does the librarian give a reference interview more in one service than another? And if
so, does it change, add or clarify the question more in one service than another?
8. Does the librarian check with the patron for satisfaction in their query resolution more
in one service than another?
9. Does the patron appear to have a higher level of satisfaction with the resolution of a
query in one service than another?
The qualitative data from a total of 320 transcripts was analyzed using software called
HyperResearch™ (2012). This tool allowed the researcher to code and conduct analysis of data
in a systematic and organized format. Using this software the researcher was able to create a
“code book” that allowed for grouping of the classifications in each research question (see Figure
5). Each transcript was then individually read and coded for classifications from each research

105

question which could later be organized and analyzed for frequency and themes. The
characteristics for analysis were reviewed by two college librarians with experience as reference
librarians and with qualitative analysis procedures.
All research was conducted in compliance with federal and state guidelines for the
protection of the welfare and dignity of human subjects (Department of Health and Human
Services: National Institutes of Health: Office for Protection from Research Risks, 2005). All
personal identifying information was redacted and removed from every transcript before any
review or coding of content. Each transcript was assigned a new transaction number so that the
order could be maintained within the transcripts but not traced back to their origin within the
database they came from. The study met the exempt criteria for research due to the fact that there
was no risk to individual students.
Key Findings & Study Conclusions
Many findings in this study hinged on the fact that log-in chat transactions were
significantly longer on average than Qwidget transactions. The length of the transactions allowed
certain other key qualities to become more evident in the log-in chat portal. These include:
•

Questions were 12% more complicated

•

The librarians responses were 5% more complete/accurate

•

Librarians were 18% more friendly

•

Patrons showed overall satisfaction 12% more than in Qwidget

•

Ability to conduct a reference interview 7% more often

The two portals were very similar in three aspects:
•

Patron Formality

•

Completeness/Accuracy of the librarians answer
106

•

The reference interview adding, changing or clarifying the patrons question

Conclusions of the study are grouped based on the length of transaction, formality of chat,
similarities of the portals and similarities between online and face-to-face transactions
Conclusion 1: Longer online reference transactions have better overall outcomes. It has
been stated that Chat transactions were an average of 5 minutes and 24 seconds longer than
Qwidget transactions in this study. This additional length affected five categories positively in
the log-in chat portal (see Key Findings above). Each of the five categories are representative of
the implied fact that a longer chat creates additional rapport and allows the librarian and patron
the luxury of slowing down and being thorough with both the content provided during the
transaction and the way the two interact with each other on a more personal level.
There has been only one other study that looks at both IM and log-in chat regarding the
length of transaction. It focused mainly on the area of subject content or type of question in each
portal. The major difference with their study and this one is that it used both undergraduate and
graduate students at a four year university whereas this study used transcripts from a community
college. Additionally their IM and log-in services came from two different vendors and therefore
were not a complete apples to apples statistical comparison. Although Ward & Kern (2006) did
find that their log-in chat transactions were an average of 55% longer than their IM chats they
also found that the IM portal was used 90.5% by the undergraduates (as opposed to graduate
students and staff/faculty). This may account for the fact that their IM transactions were more in
depth than their log-in chat portal questions as “undergraduates tend to ask more subject-based
questions, whereas graduate students (who typically have a more sophisticated starting point for
research and also research techniques such as searching bibliographies, which provide them with
citations in hand) have more known-item searches ” (2006, p.424). Their log-in chat portal was

107

used almost equally by the graduates and undergraduates (39% undergraduate to 37% graduate)
and there was no breakdown of question classification by graduate and undergraduate level. In
order to compare Ward & Kern’s study more completely with this one the researcher would need
to see a breakdown of the undergraduate IM and log-in chats separated from the graduate
students. That information was unavailable.
Using this study and what can be taken from Ward & Kern it is recommended that both
IM and Chat portals be made accessible to community college students as they appear to use
both portals for different purposes. This study showed that community college students use the
IM portal for less complicated and quick questions. Whereas Ward & Kern show that
undergraduates prefer the IM portal in general for most of their transactions, many of which were
more complicated than those generally asked by the community college students in this study.
Log-in chat transactions in this study were generally longer and were overall more successful.
By choosing one portal over another an academic institution would potentially cut off part of a
population they are trying to serve. It would only be advisable to choose a single platform if one
had patrons that had only one type of need (i.e. holdings/do you own questions = IM, research
questions = log-in chat)
There are few studies that have been done using both IM and log-in chat portals and only
one other dealing with length of transactions. Clearly more research needs to be done in this area
for both community colleges and four year institutions. The studies would imply that there are
some differences between the way community college students use the two portals and the way
four year university undergraduates use the portals. In order to have a more reliable pool of
results additional studies must be undertaken.

108

Conclusion 2: Instant messaging portal queries are less formal than log-in chat
queries. Qwidget transactions were found to be shorter and therefore less detailed. Additionally
the Qwidget patrons disappeared from the transaction more often before a resolution could be
made regarding the question. This would imply that the Qwidget patron did not feel they needed
a formal ending to the chat before they discontinued it. The log-in chat patrons were found to be
more comfortable and polite in their sessions which may have to do with the fact that they
tended to have longer transactions which therefore gave both parties the time to create a rapport.
Although the Qwidget and log-in chats were technically equal regarding the coding of
informality when the researcher combined that information with the fact that Qwidget patrons
regularly did not finish their transactions it was concluded that IM patrons were less formal
overall than the log-in chat patrons.
Rourke & Lupien’s 2010 study of both IM and log-in (Virtual Reference, VR) chat
reference found that “VR questions tend to be more research intensive and formal, while IM
questions are less focused on academic research and informal.” This is similar to the research
that found that instant messaging in general is treated as an informal means of communication
(Rosen, Chang, Erwin, Carrier, & Cheever, 2010; Tagliamonte & Denis, 2008; Ward & Kern,
2006). In this study it appears that patrons were not actually using a great deal of informal
language it is more accurate to state that they were using informal behavior. Further implying
that if the students are not treating this particular medium in a linguistically informal manner,
they also do not want unsolicited informal treatment by the librarians. It is common practice to
train online reference librarians to use informal language with patrons such as acronyms (e.g. brb
for be right back) or emoticons (e.g.  for a positive signal). This training is based on the fact
that online texting is found to be informal in other settings however there has been no previous

109

study that looks at online reference text by patrons. The results of this study warrant a
recommendation that future training of online librarians encourages a comfortable formality and
only mimic informal language when prompted by the patron.
Conclusion 3: Librarians give reference interviews and complete/accurate answers
equally in both platforms. There were some categories in this study that returned a result of
similarity between both portals. Meaning the patron treated each portal in a similar matter.
Informality has already been discussed. Additionally the areas of completeness/accuracy and the
reference interview being giving were found to have similar results in both portals.
Historically these are two categories that have never been studied in the areas of IM and
log-in chat reference so there is little to compare them too. Radford & Connoway (2007)
conducted a study using only log-in chat transcripts and found that when a librarian chose to give
a reference interview with a millennial patron it boosted the accuracy of the librarians answer by
75%. This study did not replicate that finding as there were no comparisons between the
accuracy of an answer when a reference interview was or was not asked however reference
interviews were asked in both portals approximately 70% of the time and librarians were
thorough in their answers an average of 67% of the time in both portals so this study did
represent a relatively high number of accurate answers as well as a high number of reference
interviews given by librarians.
It is recommended that more studies look directly at online transactions that have
reference interviews and if those particular transactions have more accurate answers. The
implications from this study is that the librarians treat both portals equally in the areas of the
reference interview and completeness/accuracy of librarians’ answer which is what is to be
expected as that is a major part of librarian training for manning the face-to-face reference desk.

110

Conclusion 4: Online and face-to-face reference transactions have a similar success
rate. The reference interview remains the most important part of the reference transaction
whether it be online or face-to-face. In this study online reference interviews were given 68.5%
of the time. Face-to-face reference interviews are, on average, given 75% of the time (Ross,
Nilsen, & Radford, 2009). It is well documented that the addition of a reference interview in a
reference transaction creates a more successful and accurate outcome for the patron (Gatten &
Radcliff, 2001; Saxton, 2000; Schaachaf & Horowitz, 2008a). Therefore these percentages of
reference interviews in the online arena again disprove Hernon & McClures (1986) landmark
claims that librarians are only accurate 55% of the time. Additionally, In this study over 85% of
the time in both Chat and Qwidget when a reference interview was asked it clarified the patrons’
original question. This is what the reference interview is designed to do and is what happens in
the face-to-face environment (Ross, Nilsen, & Radford, 2009).
This implies that librarians are treating the online reference environment the same as they
treat the face-to-face environment in terms of conducting the reference interview process.
Furthermore this would imply that the success rate of the online reference transaction should be
similar to the success rate of the face-to-face transaction. As there are no studies that look at the
IM and log-in chat reference environments and the use of the reference interview it is
recommended that this study’s findings attempt to be replicated for validity.
Limitations of the Study
There are three limiting limitations that need to be considered. First, the transcripts came from
only one college. There are two colleges in the San Diego Community College District that use
both the Qwidget and the log-in chat portal. The second college has a slightly different
demographic and their patron queries might be different from those studied. The second

111

limitation is that there were only two calendar years of transcripts used and additional years may
have reflected different patron experiences. Finally, due to the interpretive nature of qualitative
analysis, findings and conclusions are based on this researchers interpretation.
Internal validity. A number of mechanisms were put into place in order to ensure the
internal validity of this study. In order to remove potential bias the personal information on all
transcripts was redacted to ensure anonymity of all persons involved with a transaction. The
transcripts were also taken from two consecutive school years in the same term so that any
anomaly that may have arisen from a single school year would be washed out by the second.
Reliability of the coding process was ensured by using classifications that were both proven
reliable in previous studies or created by the researcher from professional experience.
Analysis characteristics were reviewed by two librarians who had experience as reference
librarians and with qualitative analysis procedure. Additionally, the HyperResearch™ software
was used to analyze the data in a systematic and organized fashion. The design used in this study
was exploratory as there were few studies that had direct comparative qualities. The main focus
was to gain insight for recommendations and further research.

Closing comments. Students need to be able to accomplish critical
thinking tasks in order to become successful academic researchers and life-long
learners. Librarians can play a vital role in this process. The key for student use of
the library is to have research assistance readily available and easy to use. The
key for the librarians is proper training in the areas of handling the reference
transaction.

112

The means by which patrons will communicate with librarians will remain in a state of
flux as long as new communicative technologies are being created. It is important for librarians
to stay on top of these changes in order to remain a viable option for patrons. For the academic
library student success is a main goal and therefore understanding the needs and communication
styles of those patrons is of the utmost importance. In doing so staffing and costs will always
play a part in the decision making process. Going forward studies should be undertaken on an
ongoing basis in order to understand not just which forms of online reference communication are
most popular but which are most effective.
As academic institutions look over their current options for online reference tools the
question becomes which to choose and why? The results of this study warrant a recommendation
of having both the IM widget and the log-in chat portal available at academic institutions,
particularly at community colleges. Each portal represents a different need from the patron base.
It has been proven in past research that shorter, less complex questions are more popularly asked
in the IM portal whereas the more complex or research based questions are being asked in the
log-in portal. Furthermore, there is research proving that the IM platform is more popular with
the younger, lower level, students and therefore they are more likely to use it when given the
option to choose. However, they do not make-up the entire student population and therefore both
platforms should currently be made available to fit the needs and inclinations of every student.

Appendix A
RUSA Guidelines for Behavioral performance of Reference and Information Service Providers

134

Guidelines for Behavioral Performance of Reference and Information
Service Providers
Revised by MOUSS Management of Reference Committee and approved by the RUSA Board of Directors, June
2004. (Listing of members and authors.)

Introduction
The face of Reference Services has changed significantly since the original RUSA Guidelines for Behavioral
Performance were first published in 19961. Intended to be used in the training, development, and/or evaluation of
library professionals and staff, the Guidelines have subsequently been favorably evaluated by the profession, and
currently enjoy widespread acceptance as standards for the measurement of effective reference transactions.2
The original Guidelines dealt primarily with face-to-face interactions between Reference staff and library users. Even
at the time, however, the world of Reference was moving beyond the traditional Reference Desk. Email and online
chat services have since become popular with both patrons and library staff, and are expanding in all types of
libraries, from public to academic to school libraries and beyond. Although some of the statements in the original
Guidelines can be applied to remote forms of reference, the lack of traditional visual and non-verbal cues produces a
different type of library-patron interaction.
One constant that the shift away from in-person encounters has not lessened is the need for good communication
skills. The Virtual Reference Desk recognized this and incorporated an “Interactive” component into their “Facets of
Quality for Digital Reference Services,” stating that “[d]igital reference services should provide opportunities for an
effective reference interview, so that users can communicate necessary information to experts and to clarify vague
user questions.”3
In all forms of reference services, the success of the transaction is measured not only by the information conveyed,
but also by the positive or negative impact of the patron/staff interaction. The positive or negative behavior of the
reference staff member (as observed by the patron) becomes a significant factor in perceived success or failure. This
connection has been born out in the work of researchers like Gers and Seward (1985), who found that "behaviors
have a strong influence on performance"4, and Whitlatch (1990), who stated "Librarian courtesy, interest, and
helpfulness are crucial in providing successful reference service. Libraries must select and retain staff who have
these service orientations toward users."5 Matthew Saxton (2002) put the Guidelines to a statistical test, and found
that they did indeed correlate highly to a successful reference transaction.6
The original RUSA Ad Hoc Committee that designed the Guidelines recognized the need for future adaptation to deal
with issues related to remote users, and in late 2001 the RUSA Standards and Guidelines Committee requested that
the RSS Management of Reference Committee undertake this revision. The revised Guidelines reflect the
understanding that while in-person and remote reference interviews share some points in common, each also has its
own peculiar characteristics that need to be addressed separately in the formation of standard guidelines.

135

With this in mind, the original format has been rearranged to reflect the changes in our profession. The five main
areas (Approachability, Interest, Listening/Inquiring, Searching, and Follow Up) remain the same, but three distinct
categories have been added (where appropriate) under each. They are:
General--Guidelines that can be applied in any type of reference interaction, including both in person and remote
transactions.
In Person--Additional guidelines that are specific to face-to-face encounters, and make the most sense in this
context.
Remote--Additional guidelines that are specific to reference encounters by telephone, email, chat, etc., where
traditional visual and non-verbal cues do not exist.
Some of the original Guidelines have also been rewritten to make the service ideal they convey apply more generally.
The goal of this document's revision has been to create a conceptual framework and service ethic with which
reference professionals can consider all patron reference interactions, and help establish a service standard for their
institution.
Note: The term librarian in this document applies to all who provide reference and informational services directly to
library users.

1.0 Approachability
In order to have a successful reference transaction, patrons must be able to identify that a reference librarian is
available to provide assistance and also must feel comfortable in going to that person for help. In remote
environments, this also means placing contact information for chat, email, telephone, and other services in prominent
locations, to make them obvious and welcoming to patrons. Approachability behaviors, such as the initial verbal and
non-verbal responses of the librarian, will set the tone for the entire communication process, and will influence the
depth and level of interaction between the staff and the patrons. At this stage in the process, the behaviors exhibited
by the staff member should serve to welcome the patrons and to place them at ease. The librarian's role in the
communications process is to make the patrons feel comfortable in a situation that may be perceived as intimidating,
risky, confusing, and overwhelming.
To be approachable, the librarian:
General
1.1

Establishes a "reference presence" wherever patrons look for it. This includes having Reference Services in a

highly visible location and using proper signage (both in the library and on the library's Web site) to indicate the
location, hours, and availability of in-person and remote help or assistance.
1.2

Is poised and ready to engage approaching patrons. The librarian is aware of the need to stop all other activities

when patrons approach and focus attention on the patrons' needs.

136

1.3
1.3.1

Acknowledges others waiting for service.
Employs a system of question triage to identify what types of questions the patrons have when more than two

patrons are waiting. Frequently asked questions, brief informational questions, directional questions, and referrals
can be answered quickly, allowing more time to devote to in-depth reference questions.
In Person
1.4

Establishes initial eye contact with patrons, and acknowledges the presence of patrons through smiling and

attentive and welcoming body language.
1.5

Acknowledges patrons through the use of a friendly greeting to initiate conversation, and by standing up,

moving forward, or moving closer to them.
1.6

Remains visible to patrons as much as possible.

1.7

Roves through the reference area offering assistance whenever possible. Librarians should make themselves

available to patrons by offering assistance at their point-of-need rather than waiting for patrons to come to the
reference desk. To rove successfully, the librarian should:
1.7.1

Be mobile. Get the patrons started on the initial steps of their search, then move on to other patrons.

1.7.2

Address the patrons before addressing their computer screen. Patrons are more likely to confide in librarians

and discuss their needs if they do not perceive the librarians as "policing" the area.
1.7.3

Approach patrons and offer assistance with lines such as, "Are you finding what you need?" "Can I help you

with anything?" or "How is your search going?"
1.7.4

Check back on the patron’s progress after helping them start a search.

1.7.5

If the reference desk has been left unattended, check back periodically to see if there are patrons waiting for

assistance there.
Remote
1.8

Should provide prominent, jargon-free links to all forms of reference services from the home page of the library's

Web site, and throughout the site wherever research assistance may be sought out. The Web should be used to
make reference services easy to find and convenient.

2.0 Interest
A successful librarian must demonstrate a high degree of interest in the reference transaction. While not every query
will contain stimulating intellectual challenges, the librarian should be interested in each patron's informational need
and should be committed to providing the most effective assistance. Librarians who demonstrate a high level of

137

interest in the inquiries of their patrons will generate a higher level of satisfaction among users. To demonstrate
interest, the librarian:
General
2.1

Faces the patron when speaking and listening.

2.2

2.2 Focuses attention on the patrons.

In Person
2.3

Faces patrons when speaking and listening.

2.4

Maintains or re-establishes eye contact with patrons throughout the transaction.

2.5

Signals an understanding of patrons’ needs through verbal or non-verbal confirmation, such as nodding of the

head or brief comments or questions.
Remote
2.6

Maintains or re-establishes "word contact" with the patron in text-based environments by sending written or

prepared prompts, etc., to convey interest in the patron's question.
2.7

Acknowledges user email questions in a timely manner.

2.8

States question-answering procedures and policies clearly in an accessible place on the Web. This should

indicate question scope, types of answers provided, and expected turnaround time.

3.0 Listening/Inquiring.
The reference interview is the heart of the reference transaction and is crucial to the success of the process. The
librarian must be effective in identifying the patron's information needs and must do so in a manner that keeps
patrons at ease. Strong listening and questioning skills are necessary for a positive interaction. As a good
communicator, the librarian:
General
3.1

Communicates in a receptive, cordial, and encouraging manner.

3.2

Uses a tone of voice and/or written language appropriate to the nature of the transaction.

3.3

Allows the patrons to state fully their information need in their own words before responding.

138

3.4

Identifies the goals or objectives of the user’s research, when appropriate.

3.5

Rephrases the question or request and asks for confirmation to ensure that it is understood.

3.6

Seeks to clarify confusing terminology and avoids excessive jargon.

3.7

Uses open-ended questioning techniques to encourage patrons to expand on the request or present additional

information. Some examples of such questions include:

• Please tell me more about your topic.
• What additional information can you give me?
• How much information do you need?
3.8

Uses closed and/or clarifying questions to refine the search query. Some examples of clarifying questions are:

• What have you already found?
• What type of information do you need (books, articles, etc.)?
• Do you need current or historical information?
3.9

Maintains objectivity and does not interject value judgments about subject matter or the nature of the question

into the transaction.
Remote
3.10

Uses reference interviews or Web forms to gather as much information as possible without compromising user

privacy.

4.0 Searching
The search process is the portion of the transaction in which behavior and accuracy intersect. Without an effective
search, not only is the desired information unlikely to be found, but patrons may become discouraged as well. Yet
many of the aspects of searching that lead to accurate results are still dependent on the behavior of the librarian. As
an effective searcher, the librarian:
General
4.1

Finds out what patrons have already tried, and encourages patrons to contribute ideas.

4.2

Constructs a competent and complete search strategy. This involves:

• Selecting search terms that are most related to the information desired.
• Verifying spelling and other possible factual errors in the original query.

139

• Identifying sources appropriate to the patron's need that have the highest probability of containing
information relevant to the patron's query.
4.3

Explains the search strategy and sequence to the patrons, as well as the sources to be used.

4.4

Attempts to conduct the search within the patrons’ allotted time frame.

4.5

Explains how to use sources when appropriate.

4.6

Works with the patrons to narrow or broaden the topic when too little or too much information is identified.

4.7

Asks the patrons if additional information is needed after an initial result is found.

4.8

Recognizes when to refer patrons to a more appropriate guide, database, library, librarian, or other resource.

4.9

Offers pointers, detailed search paths (including complete URLs), and names of resources used to find the

answer, so that patrons can learn to answer similar questions on their own.
In Person
4.10

Accompanies the patrons in the search (at least in the initial stages of the search process).

Remote
4.11

Uses appropriate technology (such as co-browsing, scanning, faxing, etc.) to help guide patrons through

library resources, when possible.

5.0 Follow-up
The reference transaction does not end when the librarian leaves the patrons. The librarian is responsible for
determining if the patrons are satisfied with the results of the search, and is also responsible for referring the patrons
to other sources, even when those sources are not available in the local library. For successful follow-up, the
librarian:
General
5.1

Asks patrons if their questions have been completely answered.

5.2

Encourages the patrons to return if they have further questions by making a statement such as “If you don’t find

what you are looking for, please come back and we’ll try something else.”
5.3

Roving (see 1.7) is an excellent technique for follow-up.

140

5.4

Consults other librarians or experts in the field when additional subject expertise is needed.

5.5

Makes patrons aware of other appropriate reference services (email, etc.).

5.6

Makes arrangements, when appropriate, with the patrons to research a question even after the reference

transaction has been completed.
5.7

Refers the patrons to other sources or institutions when the query cannot be answered to the satisfaction of the

patron.
5.8

Facilitates the process of referring patrons to another library or information agency through activities such as

calling ahead, providing direction and instructions, and providing the library and the patrons with as much information
as possible about the amount of information required, and sources already consulted.
5.9

Takes care not to end the reference interview prematurely.7

Remote
5.9

Suggests that the patrons visit or call the library when appropriate.
