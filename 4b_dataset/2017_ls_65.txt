Abstract
An Evidentiality Library for the LinGO Grammar Matrix
Michael Haeger

Chair of the Supervisory Committee:
Professor Emily M. Bender
Department of Linguistics
This thesis describes a library extending the LinGO Grammar Matrix to support evidentiality. Evidentiality refers to the linguistic phenomenon where elements of a language’s
grammar express the source of information for a speaker’s statement. This thesis reviews
linguistic literature dealing with evidentiality, proposes an analysis within the Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS) framework for modeling the semantics of evidentials, and describes
the implementation and evaluation of a software library meant to extend the LinGO Grammar Matrix, a software system for the rapid prototyping of grammars, to cover evidentials.

Chapter 1
INTRODUCTION
In this thesis I describe the research, implementation, and evaluation involved in developing a library for the LinGO Grammar Matrix to support evidentiality. The LinGO
Grammar Matrix is a software system that produces grammar fragments based on input
from user-linguists through a graphical web interface. The functionality of the Grammar
Matrix is generally extended through the development of libraries that focus on supporting
some linguistic phenomenon. Libraries for negation, argument optionality, adjectives, and
several other phenomena have been developed in the past.
The grammars produced by the Grammar Matrix can be used for both parsing and generation tasks. One of the benefits of Grammar Matrix-style grammars is that they provide a
semantic representation of a sentence’s meaning in addition to capturing syntactic structure.
Besides NLP applications, these grammars can also be useful in linguistic research by facilitating the formal description of grammatical rules and the testing of linguistic hypotheses.
The linguistic phenomenon this library seeks to support is evidentiality, the grammatical
encoding of the speaker’s information source. According to a typological study by Aikhenvald (2006), evidentiality is a phenomenon found in approximately a quarter of the world’s
languages. In Aikhenvald’s terminology, the term evidentiality refers to a semantic category
whose primary meaning is information source. Evidential systems vary significantly across
languages that possess the category. Aikhenvald notes that languages that possess this feature are not well represented in Indo-European, and since it is these languages that have
had the longest history of study in modern linguistics, scholarship on evidentiality has been
relatively sparse until recently.
As an example of an evidential system, a language may have two categories: reported and

2

everything else, where information gained from hearsay must be marked, similarly to how an
English speaker may say it is said that . . . Alternatively, a more developed evidential system
may have separate categories for information perceived visually by the speaker, information
perceived through the other senses, information received through hearsay, and information
inferred from evidence. Evidential meanings can be expressed by bound morphemes, clitics,
and independent words and phrases. Evidential meanings in a single language need not be
limited to a single morphological or syntactic slot within the language’s grammar. Further,
evidential meanings may be split across two layers that interact to create specific evidential
semantics from different combinations of forms.
An overview of the Grammar Matrix project, as well as its theoretical foundations, Headdriven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) and Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS), is
provided in Chapter 2. Chapter 3 is a review of the typological literature dealing with
evidentiality. The first step in developing a library is defining the phenomenon based on
this literature review. The second step is to determine the theoretical analysis in HPSG
and MRS that the library is aiming for. An account of my analysis of evidentiality in these
frameworks is found in Chapter 4. Chapter 5 describes the changes this library makes to the
Grammar Matrix’s code to implement the analysis described in Chapter 4, while Chapter 6
explains how I evaluated the coverage and performance of this library. Chapter 7 concludes
the thesis, including thoughts on directions for future work.

Chapter 2
THE LINGO GRAMMAR MATRIX
The LinGO Grammar Matrix (Bender et al., 2002, 2010) is an ongoing project aiming
to provide tools for the rapid development of grammars for computational applications. A
number of applications in computational linguistics require the ability to parse sentences in
a given language. This requires a grammatical model of the language, a “grammar”, which
defines the possible combinations of words and phrases in the language. The Grammar
Matrix’s theoretical groundings are in the Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG)
(Pollard and Sag, 1994) approach to syntax, a phrase-structure grammar approach that uses
complex feature structures to encode properties of words and phrases, such as tense of verbs,
or unfulfilled argument requirements. The HPSG grammars produced by the Grammar Matrix further encode semantic information in a scheme called Minimal Recursiong Semantics
(MRS), as described by Copestake et al. (2005). In this chapter, I will provide an overview
of HPSG, MRS, and the Grammar Matrix project itself.
2.1

Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar

Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG), originally developed by Pollard and Sag
(1994), is an approach to syntax that relies on constraints and unification to model linguistic
phenomena.

2.1.1

Feature Structures

Linguistic entities, such as words and phrases, are represented in HPSG as typed feature
structures (Carpenter, 2005), data structures composed of feature-value pairs, where the
value itself may be another feature structure. The type of a feature structure defines which

features are appropriate for the feature structure and defines constraints on the feature
structure’s values. Further, types are organized in a hierarchy that limits which feature
structures can unify with each other. As an example, an HPSG grammar of English could
represent transitive verbs with a tr-verb type that constrains feature structures instantiating
the type to have a comps (complements) list with a length of one, indicating that it must
be provided with one complement. It is possible in this formalism to require two or more
features to refer to the same feature structure; this is called reentrancy or structure sharing.
These feature structures are often represented as attribute-value matrices. As an example, Figure 2.1 shows an attribute-value matrix that could be produced by a grammar
developed in HPSG. Each feature structure is represented between square brackets; the feature structure’s type is in italics at the top, its features are in capital letters to the left, and
the values are located to the right of their features. Reentrancy/structure sharing is shown
by a small box with a number inside, a tag that represents feature structure identity.
The feature structure types are organized in a hierarchy, allowing for multiple inheritance.
So, for example, the type basic-head-subj-phrase inherits from head-valence-phrase and headcompositional in the Grammar Matrix. Inheritance means that the child type must impose
all constraints of all its parents. If there are any conflicting constraints between the parent
types and/or the child type, the child is an invalid type.

5

2.1.2

Applying Rules with Unification

The way that a lexical or phrase structure rule is applied is that the feature structure of the
components of the phrase or the stem of the lexical rule are identified with the appropriate
features in the rule’s feature structure. This is done through an operation called unification
(Shieber, 2003), which harmonizes the constraints of all feature structures that are being
identified. If any of these constraints are inconsistent with those contributed by the other
feature structures, unification fails, and the combination is invalid. This is how the sentence
Three dogs barks would be labeled ungrammatical: barks constrains its subject to be singular,
and the rule constrains Three dogs to be the subject of barks. Since Three dogs is plural,
violating the constraint contributed by dogs, unification fails.

2.1.3

Definition of a Grammar

There are three main categories of types in an HPSG grammar, 1) lexical types, 2) construction types, and 3) miscellaneous types. Lexical types, like the tr-verb type proposed above,
are types instantiated by entries in the lexicon. Construction types describe phrase structure
rules, such as the head-complement rule, and lexical rules. Finally, the miscellaneous types
define other useful properties, like the different values for case or tense.
In this section I’ll explain how various lexical and phrase structure rules apply to the
sentence The dog barks. The syntactic analysis given here is taken from a simplified grammar of English produced by the Grammar Matrix and used in the course LING 5671 at the
University of Washington. An abridged feature structure representing the syntactic properties of the lexical item bark can be written as in Figure 2.2. Here, the lexical type of the
word is expressed in the feature structure’s type, itr-verb-lex, the supertype of all intransitive
verbs. The intransitive constraint is shown by the empty comps list (which refers to the
complements of the word). The subj (subject) list contains one element, with constraints
that that element be a noun in the nominative case. Further, the element of the subj list

Figure 2.2: Feature structure of lexical item bark (syntax)

is identified with the single element on the arg-st list (arg-st is the concatenation of the
subj, spr, and comps lists). The synsem feature refers to the combination of syntactic
and semantic information (more on semantic information in the next section), local refers
to the local properties of the word (non-local deals with long-distance dependencies), and
cat contains the syntactic properties of the word.
By contrast, the lexical entry of dog would have an empty subj list, since nouns don’t
need subjects, but an spr list of one element, since English nouns (usually) require a specifier
of some sort (additional rules exist to account for plural and mass nouns).
In order to account for the form barks, a lexical rule is applied to bark, the 3sg-lex-rule.
In Figure 2.3 I show an abridged feature structure demonstrating how this rule applies to the
word bark. Here, the args list to the rule consists of a single argument, the daughter (dtr),
that is, the lexical item bark. The application of a lexical rule consists of identifying a lexical
item (or the feature structure of a different lexical rule) with the dtr feature. Here, the
cat feature of this feature structure is identified with that of the daughter, maintaining the
basic syntactic information from the daughter. The major change is that the pernumtense-

flag in inflected is satisfied. (Also, the subject of the verb is constrained to be 3rd person
singular, but this is handled in the semantics, not shown in this figure.) The flag features
inside inflected represent the requirements for a word to be considered fully inflected;
specifically, all flags in inflected must be na-or-+, that is, non-applicable or true, for the
word to be used in a sentence.
In Figure 2.4 there is an example of an abridged feature structure representing the application of the Subj-Head Phrase Rule to this sentence, which combines the subject phrase
(the dog) with the head, barks. Its head daughter must have a subj list with one element,
which must unify with the synsem of the non-head daughter. The rule’s feature structure
in turn has an empty subj list, meaning it requires no further subject. Since the head type
is verb, and the val lists are all empty, the feature structure unifies with the initial symbol
and thus represents a complete sentence.

Minimal Recursion Semantics

The foregoing section discussed how the syntax of a sentence is represented in the Grammar
Matrix’s HPSG-based framework, but it did not discuss one of the Grammar Matrix’s main
benefits: the ability to produce a formal representation of a parsed sentence’s semantics
(or, in reverse, to generate a sentence from that semantic representation). The Grammar

Figure 2.4: Feature structure of Subj-Head Phrase Rule (syntax)

Matrix makes use of Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS) (Copestake et al., 2005). An MRS
structure formally represents the meaning of a word, phrase, or sentence. An MRS structure
consists of a bag of elementary predications (EPs), each EP consisting of a predicate and the
predicate’s arguments.
One of the primary benefits of MRS is that it is able to represent both fully disambiguated
scopal semantics as well underspecified scopal semantics. This is useful for representing such
scopally ambiguous sentences as Every hungry child eats some sandwich, which has two
interpretations: 1) for every hungry child, there is some sandwich that that hungry child
eats, and 2) there is some sandwich, and every hungry child eats that one sandwich. The
way this is accomplished is through handles: every EP has a label, whose value is one of the
handles in the MRS structure; EPs that are scopally conjoined (like hungry and child in the
preceding example) share the same handle. Each EP, in addition to variable arguments that
refer to individuals, can also contain scopal arguments that refer to handles. A label is equal
modulo quantifiers (qeq) to a another label if the two labels point to the same handle, or if
there is a chain of quantifier EPs in between the first and second label.

h5 :eat(ARG1 x, ARG2 y )
{}i
Figure 2.6: Second interpretation of Every hungry child eats some sandwich

In addition to this bag of EPs, an MRS structure further contains a top handle, identified
with the handle of the root EP or conjunction of EPs in the structure, as well as a list of
handle constraints, or hcons. These handle constraints usually take the form of qeq relation
requirements. The MRS structure shown in Figure 2.5 represents the first meaning of the
sentence Every hungry child eats some sandwich. Conversely, the second interpretation of
this sentence would be represented with the MRS structure in Figure 2.6.
The differences between these two MRS structures are the values of the body arguments
of the two quantifiers. In the first case, the body of the some quantifier is the situation x
fights y, and the body of the every quantifier is the some quantifier. In the second situation,
this is reversed. The MRS structure shown in Figure 2.7 represents the semantics of the

h3 :hungry(ARG0 x ), h3 :child(ARG0 x),
h4 :some(ARG0 y , RSTR h5 , BODY h8 ),
h6 :sandwich(ARG0 y),
h9 :eat(ARG1 x, ARG2 y )
{ h2 =q h3 , h5 =q h6 } i
Figure 2.7: Underspecified representation of Every hungry child eats some sandwich

sentence in a way that allows either interpretation. Here, the body arguments of the two
quantifiers are left unspecified, but the handle constraints require that the restrictions of
both quantifiers are qeq to the nominal associated with that quantifier. So, the restriction
of every is qeq to hungry child and the restriction of some is qeq to sandwich.
An important feature of MRS is that it is strictly compositional, meaning that the semantics of the daughters of the rules are all present in the semantics of the result of the rule.
That is to say, semantics are never deleted in MRS; they are only combined and potentially
added to.
To illustrate how MRS applies to the Grammar Matrix, I return to the sentence The
dog barks, this time looking at the semantic features that were omitted earlier. Note that
I separate syntactic and semantic feature structures only for presentational reasons; in a
Grammar Matrix-style grammar, the semantic and syntactic information are contained in
a single feature structure. Again, the feature structures are abridged, to focus on the most
important features.
Figure 2.8 illustrates the abridged feature structure of bark, this time focusing on the
most important semantic features. The cont feature stands for content, and is the main
place semantic information appears. The hook feature represents the information that is
“visible” to other feature structures and subject to their constraints. hook contains the ltop
feature, pointing to the local top handle of the MRS structure. The index feature points

to the individual represented by this word itself; that is, the event of barking. This event
contains the feature e, which in turn contains the semantic information of tense, aspect,
and mood. The fact that these features currently only constrain their values to their types
indicates that they are underspecified; that is, they can be unified with another feature
structure irrespective of that other feature structure’s tense-aspect-mood values.
The rels feature of cont represents the bag of EPs in an MRS structure, each element
corresponding to a single EP. The semantic relation of the EP is represented by the pred
feature. The ARG0 feature is the argument which represents the event of barking itself;
this is identified with hook | index value. On the other hand, arg1, which in this case
represents the agent, that is, the barker, is identified with the index value of the verb’s
subject’s index. This constraint is what will tie together the semantics of the dog and barks
when the Subj-Head Phrase Rule is applied to the two phrases.
In Figure 2.9, there is an abridged feature structure for the application of the 3sg-lex-rule
to the verb bark. The primary difference between this view of the feature structure, on the
one hand, and the syntactic view and lexical item feature structure given in Figure 2.2. on
the other, is twofold. First, the tense of the barking event is constrained to be nonpast. The
semantics would not be right if it was underspecified for tense, since The dog barks could
then be considered semantically equivalent to The dog barked. There is a semantic difference
between the two sentences, which is captured in a feature of the event’s feature structure.
This is an important observation that merits an explicit statement: not all semantic content
is represented by EPs; some semantic content may be represented by features instead. This
is an important point in the analysis of evidentiality in this thesis.
The second important semantic difference is that the person of the subject is specified to
be 3rd, and the number of the subject is specified to be sg (singular). This is how agreement
works in HPSG: the feature structure of one element of the sentence places constraints
on an element on one of its valence lists. This way, unification with a non-third-singular
noun phrase, like the first person singular pronoun, will fail, preventing the grammar from
accepting the ungrammatical sentence *I barks.

Figure 2.10: Feature structure of Subj-Head Phrase Rule (semantics)

15

Finally, I present the Subj-Head phrase structure rule applied to the sentence The dog
barks. Figure 2.10 displays some of its more important features in a feature structure. This
feature structure shows the result of semantic composition in MRS: the two EPs from the
phrase the dog are both included in the rels list. As required by constraints we’ve seen
previously, the arg1 of the barking predication (that is, the barker), is identified with the
arg0 of the dog predication (and also with the arg0 of the the predication).
This example also demonstrates how quantifiers are represented in MRS. The restr
field, or restriction, of the the quantifier is qeq to the label of the dog EP. This equality
modulo quantifiers is represented by the qeq feature structure in the hcons list.
Finally, this shows that the ltop (local top label) of the whole sentence is identified with
the label of the barking predication. This is standard for basic sentences in MRS: the top
label of the sentence is the label of the main event being communicated. That said, if a
scopal modifier is introduced, then the top label would be the label of the modifier.
The examples in this section cover the main semantic features of MRS as they relate to
grammars developed with the Grammar Matrix. The formal representation of semantics in
the MRS framework will be a fundamental part of the library I develop for this thesis.
2.3

The Grammar Matrix

The LinGO Grammar Matrix itself is a piece of software that allows users to quickly prototype
grammatical models of the kind described above. It consists of a core of grammatical type
declarations (Bender et al., 2002) and two major modules for customizing grammars (Bender
et al., 2010). The first module is the questionnaire, a web application that allows a userlinguist to answer typological questions about a language, as well as enter specifics of its
lexicon and morpheme inventory. The web application produces as output a choices file,
which stores the content of the answers to the questionnaire in a standard, human-readable
format. The second module, which can be invoked from the web application but can also be
run separately, takes a choices file as input and produces as output a collection of files that
store the grammatical model as a collection of TDL files representing the type hierarchy and

CONT.HOOK.INDEX.E.TENSE nonpast ] ].
Figure 2.11: Definition of the 3rd Singular Lexical Rule in TDL

feature structures of the grammar in the DELPH-IN Joint Reference Formalism.
As an example, the code for the 3sg-lex-rule in the grammar of English used for the
previous examples is shown in Figure 2.11. The first line indicates the name of this type
and the types from which it inherits. The remaining lines declare any further constraints the
type being defined imposes.
In the format of the Grammar Matrix, feature structures are expressed using the DELPHIN Joint Reference Formalism (Copestake, 2002a) in TDL-type files. A grammar is composed
primarily of definitions of types and the definitions of grammar entities, such as entries in
the lexicon, lexical rules, and phrase structure rules.
The files that are produced by the Grammar Matrix can be used with other tools, including a number of DELPH-IN tools, including the Lexical Knowledge Builder (LKB)2 (Copestake, 2002c) and the Pet3 (Callmeier, 2000), ACE4 , and Agree5 (Slayden, 2012) parsers. The
heart of a grammar is composed of a series of TDL files, such as <name of language>.tdl,
irules.tdl, lexicon.tdl, and rules.tdl, that are produced according to the user-linguist’s input
to the questionnaire. There is also a file called matrix.tdl, which contains general definitions
of basic types and is the same for all grammars output by the Grammar Matrix. The customized TDL files expand on matrix.tdl types and define new types that often inherit from
those in matrix.tdl.

A common workflow is for a user-linguist to produce a prototype grammar using the
Grammar Matrix, then subsequently directly edit to TDL to add features and constraints
not yet supported by the Grammar Matrix. This process allows linguists to skip the large
amount of boilerplate code involved in setting up a basic grammar, and to focus on the more
difficult or obscure syntactic/semantic issues in representing the language.

Summary

This chapter has outlined the theoretical framework under which the LinGO Grammar Matrix operates, as well as its technical details. This has been a necessarily quick overview,
and there are many particulars that have been omitted. However, this chapter has hopefully provided readers with enough of an understanding of these frameworks to assist an
understanding of the issues developed in this thesis.

Chapter 3
EVIDENTIALITY IN THE WORLD’S LANGUAGES
This chapter consists of a review of the typological literature on evidentiality. The goal
of this review is to ground the library in cross-linguistically valid analysis of evidentiality.
Since the goal of the Grammar Matrix is to provide a useful tool to linguists working on
any language, it is important for libraries to account for the diversity within a linguistic
phenomenon across the world’s languages.
I’ll begin with an overview of the most common types of evidential inventories, followed
by a discussion of how evidentials are most commonly expressed. Then I will discuss some
of the ways evidentials interact with other grammatical categories and with each other.

3.1

Term Systems

Aikhenvald (2006) develops a typology of evidentials in languages based on 1) the number of
terms, or evidential values, that the language contains, and 2) language’s specific inventory
of terms. To provide the reader with a sense of the range of evidential systems in the world’s
languages, a short summary of this typology is given here. I will begin with four-term
systems, to give readers a sense of the most common evidential terms, then I will discuss
three- and two-term systems. Finally, I’ll briefly mention systems with five or more terms,
which tend to be more idiosyncratic than the simpler systems.
Aikhenvald includes a recurring label everything else. In two-term systems this term
is an evidentially neutral form. Aikhenvald notes that “Strictly speaking, systems of this
kind have only one evidential ‘term’. They have been included on a par with two-term
systems because of the semantic similarities and tendencies towards historical development”

19

(Aikhenvald, 2006, 23). This label also shows up in three-term B51 systems, which are
analogous to two-term A3 systems. These are the only systems Aikhenvald applies the term
to; she does not apply the term to systems with four or more terms; in these, the lack of
evidential marking is not considered part of the evidential system. To be consistent with
Aikhenvald’s typology, I also use the term everything else, but it should be clearly understood
that these everything else terms do not provide evidential semantics.

3.1.1

Four-term systems

C1. Visual, Non-visual sensory, Inferred, Reported. Here, the visual evidential indicates that
the speaker saw the event that is being stated. The non-visual sensory term indicates that
the speaker perceived it through another sense, such as hearing or touch. The inferential term
means that the speaker’s statement is an inference based on evidence, while the reported
evidential indicates that the speaker was told about the event by someone else. These terms
are common in simpler systems, where two or more terms may be combined into a single
term, as discussed below.
C2. Direct (or Visual), Inferred, Assumed, Reported. Here, the direct (or visual) term can
refer either to any sensory information source or strictly vision. The distinction between
inferred and assumed is that “the inferred evidential typically refers to inference based on
visible or tangible results, or direct physical evidence. The assumed evidential is to do with
assumption, or general knowledge” (Aikhenvald, 2006, 54).
C3. Direct, Inferred, Reported, Quotative (or a second Reported). Here, the visual and
non-visual sensory terms of C1 are combined into the direct term. Aikhenvald says that the
reported and quotative can mean slightly different things in different languages. In Cora
(crn),2 the reported evidential means the same thing as in the previous two types, while the
1

In Aikhenvald’s typology, A refers to a two-term system, B refers to a three-term system, and C refers
to a four-term system.
2

This is an ISO-639-3 language code. These codes are always three letters long, and they exist to provide
a standard way of identifying languages, considering that here may be more than one name for a single
language. A list of these codes can be found at http://http://www-01.sil.org/iso639-3/codes.asp.

20

quotative term indicates that the speaker’s speech is a verbatim quote from another person,
either real or a character in a story. On the other hand, in Southeastern Tepehuan (stp),
which Aikhenvald includes in this category, there are two reported evidentials: the first is
when the reported information was not previously known to the speaker, the second when
the speaker did previously know the information (Aikhenvald, 2006, 58).
3.1.2

Three-term systems

B1. Direct (or Visual), Inferred, Reported. The first term, depending on the language,
can refer only to visually-acquired information, or it can refer to any information acquired
through the senses. When the direct evidential is explicitly visual, as in Qiang (cng), there
may be the option to not mark evidentiality, which would be required for non-visual sensory
information sources (Aikhenvald, 2006, 45).
B2. Visual, Non-visual sensory, Inferred. In this type of system, information acquired
through hearsay appears to be combined with the inferential term, as is the case with Siona
(snn) (Aikhenvald, 2006, 46).
B3. Visual, Non-visual sensory, Reported. The example that Aikhenvald cites for this
category is a language isolate in Papua New Guinea, Oksapmin (opm). She cites Lawrence
(1987) for her description of the language’s evidential system. Lawrence notes that the
firsthand terms (under which he includes both the visual and non-visual sensory terms) deal
with “information about things which [the speaker] has experienced, observed, or thought
out” (Lawrence, 1987, 54). This inclusion of information that the speaker has “thought out”
seems to indicate that inferential meanings would be included under the category for the
source of evidence on which the inference is formed.
B4. Non-visual sensory, Inferred, Reported. In these systems, there is also the option to not
mark the sentence for evidentiality. In this evidentially ambiguous case, there are multiple
possible readings. If the information is obtained visually, the sentence would be unmarked
for evidentiality; however the unmarked form could also be used in other cases, when the
speaker feels it is unnecessary to mark information source (Aikhenvald, 2006, 49-50).

21

B5. Reported, Quotative, ‘everything else’. Aikhenvald draws a comparison to A3 systems, discussed below, which distinguish between a hearsay evidential an everything else
(Aikhenvald, 2006, 50). The difference in B5 is that a reported evidential indicating that the
information source is hearsay is contrasted to a quotative evidential that indicates that the
statement is a direct quote.
3.1.3

Two-term systems

A1: Firsthand and Non-firsthand. In this system firsthand refers to information acquired
through the senses of the speaker (a combination of visual and non-visual sensory meanings),
and non-firsthand refers to information from all other sources (mostly, this is a combination
of inferential and hearsay meanings).
A2: Non-firsthand and everything else. At first glance, this category appears to be the same
as A1, except with the orders reversed. However, in these languages, the everything else
form is evidentially ambiguous; it can be used for both situations where the information is
firsthand and situations where it is not. The non-firsthand term explicitly means that the
information was not gained firsthand through the speaker’s senses. Aikhenvald includes in
this category languages like the Turkic languages that traditionally have been said to have
“directive” (everything else) and “indirective” (non-firsthand) evidentials.
A3: Reported and everything else. In this system, the reported term indicates that the
information was told to the speaker by someone else; all other cases are covered under
everything else. The reported term often takes on an additional meaning that the speaker
is unsure of or questions the information, as in Estonian (est), Latvian (lav), and Warlpiri
(wbp), but this is not necessary, and in languages like the Kham languages (kif, kgj, kip,
kjl) and Lezgian (lez), the reported evidential does not imply anything about whether the
speaker is uncertain (Aikhenvald, 2006, 33).
A4: Sensory and Reported. This category is similar to A1, with the main difference being
that the inferential meaning is categorized under sensory evidence instead of being grouped
together with reported.

22

A5: Auditory and everything else. Here, the distinction is between information directly
perceived through hearing and information acquire through any other means. This is a rare
category–Aikhenvald found only one such language, Euchee (yuc). Aikhenvald conjectures
that “Euchee is a dying language. So, could it be the case that such an unusual system is
simply the result of the drastic reduction so frequently observed in the situations of language
obsolescence?” (Aikhenvald, 2006, 37).
3.1.4

Systems with five terms or more

There are fewer thorough analyses of evidential systems with more than four terms than of
systems with four and fewer terms, so Aikhenvald doesn’t bother creating a sub-typology as
she did with the other systems. I’ll give here two examples to show how evidential systems
may extend past the types we’ve seen so far.
One example of a language with five terms is Traditional Wintu (wnw), which has 1)
Visual, 2) Non-visual sensory, 3) Inferred, 4) Assumed, and 5) Reported evidentials. The
meanings of most of these are similar to those found in the simpler systems. As an example
of the difference between inferred and assumed, take the situation where the speaker is
communicating the main event He is chopping wood. The inferred evidential would be used
when “I have gone to his cabin, find him absent and his axe is gone” (Aikhenvald, 2006, 60).
On the other hand, the assumed evidential would be used when “I know that he has a job
chopping wood every day at this hour, that he is a dependable employee, and, perhaps that
he is not in his cabin” (Aikhenvald, 2006, 60).
Aikhenvald cites a language in Papua New Guinea, Foe (foi), as an example of a language
with a six-term evidential system. Its terms are: 1) Participatory, 2) Visual, 3) Non-visual
sensory, 4) Mental deduction, 5) Visible evidence, 6) Previous evidence. Aikhenvald states
that “ ‘Participatory’ or factual evidential implies that the speaker is participating in the
action, or is making a statement of a generally known fact . . . Visual implies that the action
was seen . . . Non-visual (‘sense perception’) indicates that the action was perceived by hearing, smelling, feeling, or understanding . . . Mental deduction implies an inference based on

23

something for which the speaker has evidence perceived with his senses . . . Visible evidence
implies inference base on the visible results . . . Previous evidence describes, for instance, an
event the evidence for which the speaker had seen, but cannot see at the moment of speech”
(Aikhenvald, 2006, 63).
These two examples demonstrate how more complex systems can differ, as well as how
the semantic distinctions between evidentials tend to become more nuanced in systems with
more terms. Considering this, a system for modeling evidentiality should allow flexibility in
defining new evidentials, as it would be unnecessary, difficult, and most likely impossible to
produce a universal inventory of evidential terms that could apply to every language. That
said, having a default inventory of the most common terms could be useful, since there is
regularity in the simpler evidential systems.

3.1.5

Variation within a type

One important thing to note is that even within a type, the meanings of the terms may
not perfectly match. For example, Qiang (cng) and Shasta (sht) are classed as B1 (Direct,
Inferred, and Reported terms) systems. However, the direct term means different things in
the two languages. In Shasta, the direct term can refer to any information acquired through
the senses, whereas in Qiang, the term refers strictly to information acquired visually. If the
speaker can sense something through another sense without seeing it, they would use the
inferential term. This difference could motivate splitting this type into two distinct types,
though Aikhenvald does not do so, and it would lead to a less compact typology.
This observation is not very important when working on an implementation of the grammar of a single language, but it is worth keeping in mind when it comes to multilingual
applications, such as machine translation. Also, when specifying an inventory of commonly
used evidentials, this disctinction will be important to keep in mind.

24

3.2

Expression of Evidentiality

There is significant variation to the morphological, syntactic, and lexical means by which
evidentiality is expressed across the world’s languages. Evidentials can be inflectional affixes,
as in Yukaghir (ykg), or Qiang (cng), as demonstrated in this example with the visual
evidential (vis), an affix on the verb:
(1) the: ýdýyta:

Ha-q@-(w)u.

3SG Chengdu+loc or-go-vis
‘He went to Chengdu.’ (used in a situation where the speaker saw the person leave and
that person has not yet returned) [cng] (LaPolla, 2003, 65)
They can be clitics, such as the second-position clitics found in Shipibo-Konibo (shp) and
Quechua (que), the latter shown by this example:
(2) huk=si

ka-sqa huk machucha-piwan payacha.

once=rep be-sd one old.man-with

woman

‘Once there were an old man and an old woman.’ [que] (Aikhenvald, 2006, 68)
In Quechua, the clitics can also occur on a focused element of the sentence:
(3) Pidru kunan=mi

wasi-ta

tuwa-sha-n.

Pedro now=dir.ev house-acc build-prog-3sg
‘It is now that Pedro is building the house.’ [que] (Aikhenvald, 2006, 69)
Evidentials can be expressed as indpendent words, as in Western Apache, where the nonvisual experiential evidential is an indpendent particle:
(4) Train hilwoł

hiłts’ad.

train 3sg.prog.run nvexp
‘I hear the train (running).’ (noise heard) [apw] (de Reuse, 2003, 80)

25

Or, as in the hearsay evidential of Japanese (jpn), they may be expressed with a combination
of a nominalizing evidential particle plus the copula:
(5) Kaza ga

cuyo-katta

-soo

da.

wind s.m. strong-past hearsay cop
‘They say the wind was strong.’ [jpn] (Aoki, 1986, 230)
It’s fairly common to see the evidential system of a language combined with the tense system
of a language, especially with past tenses. This is common in the Turkic languages, like
Kazakh (kaz), where two past tenses exist, -DI, which is evidentially ambiguous, and -IptI,
which indicates that the information source is non-firsthand, as shown in these examples:
(6) tüs-ipti.
fall-past.indir
‘[He/she/it] has evidentily fallen, evidently fell.’ [kaz] (Johanson, 2003, 279)

(7) qara-dï.
see-past.dir
‘S/he saw.’ [kaz] (Muhamedowa, 2015, 175)

3.3
3.3.1

Complexities of Marking Evidentiality
Scattered Systems

In some evidential systems, the evidentials form a single grammatical category, all occupying
a single position in the phrase, or a single slot in a verb’s morphology, for example. However,
it’s not uncommon for the evidential system to span multiple separate slots or parts of speech.
For example, in Japanese (jpn), the evidential system contains terms expressing 1) hearsay,
2) inference based on “visible, tangible, or audible evidence collected through [one’s] own

26

senses,” 3) inference “when the evidence is circumstantial or gathered through sources other
than one’s own senses’, and 4) inference when “the speaker believes in what he is making an
inference about” (Aoki, 1986, 231-233). Due to the three inferential terms, this system does
not fit neatly in Aikhenvald’s typology described in the previous section. The way Evidential
1 is marked is by the phrase soo da, where soo is a noun and da is a copula, preceded by a
verb, predicate adjective, or predicate noun phrase:
(8) Kaza ga

cuyo-katta

-soo

da.

wind subj strong-past hearsay cop
‘They say the wind was strong.’ [jpn] (Aoki, 1986, 230)

(9) Kare wa
he

daigakusei

da-tta

-soo

da.

top university.student be-past hearsay cop

‘They say he is a university student.’ [jpn] (Aoki, 1986, 231)
Evidential 2 is marked with yoo da, where yoo is a noun, and da is again the copula. Evidential 3 is expressed with rasii, where rasi is an adjective. These are shown in the following
examples:
(10) Kono kusuri
this

wa

yoku kiku yoo

da.

medicine top well work inf.exp cop

‘I infer from my own experience that this medicine works well.’ [jpn] (Aoki, 1986, 232)

(11) Kono kusuri
this

wa

yoku kiku rasii.

medicine top well work inf.circum

‘I infer from what I heard that this medicine works well.’ [jpn] (Aoki, 1986, 232)

27

Evidential 4, like Evidential 1, is expressed with soo da, though Evidential 4 can only appear
with infinitive verbals; it therefore cannot occur with predicate nominal phrases:
(12) Ame ga

huri soo

da.

rain subj fall inf.imminent cop
‘It looks like it is going to rain (any minute).’ [jpn] (Aoki, 1986, 233)
Another example of a scattered system is Kazah. In Kazakh, as noted above, there is the
non-firsthand (indirective) past tense -IptI. There is also an indirective copula particle eken.
Take, for example, the two following sentences:
(13) kel-e-di

eken.

come-present-3s indir.cop
‘He/she/it is/was evidently coming.’ [kaz] (Johanson, 2003, 279)

(14) kel-ipti.
come-indir.past
‘He/she/it has evidently come, evidently came.’ [kaz] (author)
Here, the indirective past tense is expressed by a suffix on the verb, while the indirective can
also be expressed by another word.
3.3.2

Multiple Subsystems

Evidential subsystems may co-occur with each other, potentially with some constraints.
Here, a subsystem refers to an inventory of evidential terms like one of the types identified
by Aikhenvald in her typology; however, this subsystem may be combined with another
inventory that belongs to a different type. Often, the subsystems will occur in different
positions or contexts. For example, in Jarawara (anq), in the past tenses of main clauses,

28

there is a two-way distinction between firsthand and non-firsthand. These suffixes also
encode the gender of the subject. For example, the immediate past firsthand masculine
suffix is -(ha)re, whereas the immediate past non-firsthand masculine suffix is -(hi)no.
It is grammatical to have this firsthand/non-firsthand distinction be the only one in a
sentence. However, Jarawara contains two further optional evidential terms: one for hearsay
and one for inference. The hearsay term is marked by a suffix in the tense/modal system,
while the inferential term is expressed in a secondary verb. These can combine with a nonfirsthand past but not with a firsthand past. For example, the far past non-firsthand and
reported evidentials are combined in the following sentence:
(15) hi-we-himata-mona-ka.
Oc-see-fp.n.m-rep.m-decl.m
‘[She] saw him.’ [anq] (Dixon, 2003, 173)
Multiple subsystems may appear in a language when different syntactic contexts select different systems. For example, in Tucano (tuo), a declarative clause allows a system with four
terms: visual, non-visual sensory, inferred, reported, an interrogative clause allows a threeterm system: visual, non-visual sensory, inferred, and an imperative clause allows a two-term
system that distinguishes between hearsay and everything else (Aikhenvald, 2006, 85). The
meaning of evidentials in non-declarative clauses varies across languages. For example, the
hearsay/imperative combination mentioned above could range from being a simple politeness
marking, to indicating that the order came from someone other than the speaker.
3.4

Semantic Complexities

In addition to the simplest cases of evidentiality, which involve applying one evidential term
to a sentence, there are a number of more complex cases that arise. This section will deal
with these more complex cases, in which evidentials may interact idiosyncratically with other
evidentials, tense marking, and negation.

29

3.4.1

Multiple Evidential Marking

Evidentiality can be marked more than once in a single clause, but this multiple marking
is never redundant (Aikhenvald, 2006, 88). Instead, there can be multiple simultaneous
subsystems in a language that interact within a clause to produce nuances in the evidential
semantics. Aikhenvald (2006) identifies four semantic effects of evidential collocations:
(i) The different evidentials apply to different constituents of the clause
(ii) The different evidentials mark different information sources for the same event that
corroborate or complement one another
(iii) The different evidentials mark both that the information was reported to the speaker
as well as the reporter’s information source
(iv) In narratives, one evidential marks the information source of the narrator, and the
other evidential marks the information source of a character
An example of the first example is the following sentence from Jarawara (anq):
(16) Banawaa batori-tee-mone

jaa faja otaa

ka-waha-ro

Banawa mouth-cust-rep.f at then 1nsg.exc.s appl-become.dawn-rem.p.firsth.f
otaa-ke.
1nsg-decl.f
‘Then the day dawned on us (firsthand) at the place reported to be (customarily)
the mouth of the Banawa river.’ [anq] (Aikhenvald, 2006, 88)
This is an interesting example because it shows an evidential applying to a noun phrase,
rather than a verb phrase, semantically applying to an instance instead of an event.
Qiang (cng) and Shipibo-Konibo (shp) demonstrate two different ways in which the second approach can apply. In Qiang, the visual and inferred evidentials can be used together
in the case where visual evidence confirmed or supported a previously formed inference.
LaPolla provides an example, to which Aikhenvald adds the following real-world context:
“the speaker first guessed that someone was playing drums next door, and then went next

30

door and saw the person holding a drum or drumsticks" (Aikhenvald, 2006, 89).
(17) oh, the: ýb@

ýete-k-u.

oh 3sg drum beat-infr-vis
‘Oh, he WAS playing a drum!’ [cng] (LaPolla, 2003, 70)
In Shipibo-Konibo, on the other hand, when the inferential evidential is combined with either
the reported or firsthand evidential, the reported/firsthand evidential indicates the source of
the evidence on which the inference is based. Take, as an example, the following sentence:
(18) Ka-ment-tan-we

koka-baon-ra

jawe-bira

miin-ke,

go-quickly-go.do-imp maternal.uncle-pl:erg-dir.ev what:abs-infr bury-compl
bake-ra

sion

i-t-ai.

child:abs-dir.ev onmo do.intr-prog-inc
‘Go quickly and see! What could your uncles have buried, a child is crying.’ [shp]
(Valenzuela, 2003, 44)
In the first clause Ka-ment-tan-we koka-baon-ra jawe-bira miin-ke, the direct evidential -ra
and the inferential evidential -bira are both present, indicating that the clause (a question)
involves an inference based on direct evidence, in this case the inference being that the uncles
buried something, based on the direct evidence of the sound of a child crying underground.
The third semantic interaction is demonstrated by the following example from Bora (boa):
(19) Hotsée=Bá=Phá-ph e

Wm1Bá khWWBá-Póó-ha-tW.

Joseph=rep=nonwitnessed-past escaped dark-room-house-from
‘Joseph escaped from jail a while back.’ [boa] (Aikhenvald, 2006, 91)
Here, the reported and non-firsthand evidentials are both present, indicating that the speaker
learned of the event from a reporter, and the reporter learned of the event from a nonfirsthand source.

31

Tsafiki provides another example of this type of relationship between two evidentials,
where both the inferential and the reported are marked. In this sentence, it is reported that
the reporter inferred that the canoe was grabbed and turned over:
(20) kanowa=ka dilan=tala
canoe-acc

ka-to ke

ere-ka

jo-nu-ti-e

turn.over=dir get-s throw send-perf aux.be-infr-rep-decl

ti-e.
say-decl
‘The canoe must have been grabbed and turned over it is said.’ [cof] (Aikhenvald,
2006, 91)
Aikhenvald notes that in this mode of combining evidentials, the order of evidentials is
language-specific. As can be seen, Bora places the reported evidential closer to the stem
than the non-firsthand evidential, but in other languages the reported evidential can be
preceded by the reporter’s information source, as in Tsafiki. However, it is worth noting that
Thiesen and Weber analyze the evidentials in Bora not as affixes, but as clitics (Thiesen and
Weber, 2012, 306-310). Thus, the arbitrariness of ordering that Aikhenvald notes may not
apply to affixes on a verb.
In order to demonstrate the fourth approach to evidential combination, Aikhenvald cites
Eastern Pomo (peb). Two hearsay markers appear in this sentence, one an affix and one a
clitic in the second position. It is common, though not required, for both markers to appear
in Eastern Pomo sentences. In an example from a myth, the hero of the myth leaves the
dwelling of the old, blind villain of the story:
(21) bá=xa=khí

xówaqa-nk’e-e.

then=hs=3.agent outwards.move-sensory.ev-hs
‘Then he started to walk out, it is said.’ [peb] (McLendon, 2003, 110)

32

Here, the hearsay marker indicates that the narrative was reported to the speaker, as is
the norm with traditional tales, while the non-visual sensory evidential refers to how the
blind villain learned that the hero was leaving (since he is blind, presumably by hearing
the hero’s footsteps). It’s worth noting that the hearsay marker cannot combine with the
direct knowledge evidential in the same way, as “the direct knowledge evidential -(y)a cannot
combine with any of the three other suffixes” (McLendon, 2003, 109).
A feature of Eastern Pomo is that whether it uses the third or fourth modes of combination
depend on the specific evidentials used. When the reported evidential co-occurs with the
non-visual sensory, as is seen here, the meaning is constructed according to approach (iv).
However, when the reported evidential co-occurs with the inferential, the effect is the same
as in approach (iii), as seen in the following example:

(22) kalél=xa=kh í

maPór-al

q’á-ne-e.

simply=hs=3.agent daughter.in.law-patient leave-infr-rep
‘He must have simply left his daughter-in-law there, they say.’ [peb] (McLendon, 2003,
112)

Here, the speaker is making an inference from the report he heard. McLendon notes that
this combination “seems always to be interpreted as reflecting the narrator’s inferences, and
suggests perhaps that the narrator is not quite certain as to what happened at this point
in the narrative, perhaps because he/she didn’t recall exactly what was said by the person
from whom he/she had heard the narrative” (McLendon, 2003, 111).
These four ways that evidentials can interact with each other demonstrate that evidential
semantics can involve multiple roles, such as the source of information and the receiver of
information, in addition to the relationship between the evidential event and the main event.

33

3.4.2

Evidentiality and Negation

The ways that evidentiality applies to a negated sentence vary by language. “An evidential
usually has the whole clause within its scope” (Aikhenvald, 2006, 96). Aikhenvald cites the
following example from Maricopa (mrc) to illustrate this:
(23) waly-marsh-ma-’-yuu.
neg=win+dual-neg-1sg-visual
‘They didn’t win (i.e. they lost), I saw it.’ [mrc] (Aikhenvald, 2006, 96)
In this case, when an evidential co-occurs with negation, the evidential takes the whole
negated clause as its sentential argument. In other systems, the evidential can fall under the
scope of negation, as in the following example from Akha (ahk):
(24) É náa, h@
then

à,

àdjÉ

@

ḿmjÒ djáŋ

this noun.part what noun.part thing

‘Then, as (for this photo), what kind of things they are making (I don’t know: negated
visual experience), this one.’ [ahk] (Aikhenvald, 2006, 97)
In some languages, such as Japanese (jpn), it is possible to specify the scopal relationship
between negation and evidentiality by the ordering of the evidential and the negation words.
Take, for example, the following two sentences3 :
(25) ame ga

furi sou

ja

nai.

rain nom fall evid.seem cop neg
‘It doesn’t look like it’s going to rain.’ [jpn]
3

These example sentences and their translations were produced by Emily M. Bender and verified by a
native speaker of Japanese.

34

(26) ame ga

fura nasa sou

da.

rain nom fall neg evid.seem cop
‘It looks like it’s not going to rain.’ [jpn]

In the first sentence, the evidential is within the scope of the negation, as the whole clause
It looks like it’s going to rain is negated. In the second example the scopal relationship is
reversed: the negated clause It’s not going to rain is within the scope of the evidential.
Considering these examples, especially the Japanese sentences, it seems likely that evidentiality behaves like an independent predication, rather than as a property of the main
event’s predication. This is a conclusion that Aikhenvald agrees with, saying, “In all these
cases evidentials behave similarly to predications in their own right, unlike most other grammatical categories. In this way, evidentials resemble negation” (Aikhenvald, 2006, 100).

3.4.3

Tense of Evidentials

Sometimes the tense of an evidentially marked clause refers to the event being reported, and
sometimes to the evidential event, that is, the event of the speaker gaining knowledge of
the main event. For example, in Tariana (tae), tense indicates the time of the main event
when combined with the evidentials for visual, non-visual sensory, and inferential information
sources. This is illustrated in the following example:

(27) kya di-nu-ka-naka.
rain 3sgnf-come-decl-pres.vis
‘The rain is coming.’ (It is coming now and I see it now) [tae] (Aikhenvald, 2006, 100)

On the other hand, when a hearsay evidential is used, the tense indicates the time when the
speaker heard the main event reported, as in the following example:

35

(28) Tiago di-ñami-pida.
Tiago 3sgnf-die-pres.rep
‘Tiago has died.’ (I’m hearing about it right now.) [tae] (Aikhenvald, 2003, 148)
The context of this statement is that the speaker just heard a report of Tiago’s death on the
radio, hence the present tense marker, even though Tiago had died a few days before the
statement.
Evidentials in Tariana are not distinguished in the future tense except for a reported
evidential. When the main event is in the future and a reported evidential is used, the verb
will be marked with both a purposive marker and the appropriately tensed evidential marker,
as seen here:
(29) du-ñami-kaRu-pidaka.
3sgf-die-fut.nom-rec.p.rep
‘She was said (a short time ago) to be going to die (in the future).’ [tae] (Aikhenvald,
2003, 148)
Further, in Western Apache (apw), whether or not the past tense marker ni’ includes the
evidential or not depends on the evidential used. This marker indicates what de Reuse calls
an “asserted past tense”; that is, it is used when “the speaker emphasizes that something
happened in the past, and that s/he is quite certain that it happened” (de Reuse, 2003,
91). There are four evidential particles that can combine with ni’: hiłts’ad (non-eyewitness
experiential), ch’inı̄ı̄ (quotative), lę́k’eh (quotative), and lą̄ą̄ (mirative inferential).
If ni’ appears before the evidential, then the evidential event is not within the scope of
ni’. If ni’ appears after the evidential, the evidential event is within the scope of ni’ (along
with the main event) when the evidential is hiłts’ad or ch’inı̄ı̄. This distinction based on the
ordering of ni’ can be seen in the following two examples:

36

(30) Izee

baa

ch’inı̄ı̄ ni’.

gowąhyú óyāā

medicine about.it home=to 3sg.p.go.off quot assp
‘I heard she went to the hospital.’ [apw] (de Reuse, 2003, 92)

(31) Áłk’idá˛’ nnēē

gól˛ī˛ī

ni’

ch’inı̄ı̄.

long.ago people 3sg.imperf.asp.live assp quot
‘Long ago, people were living, it is said.’ [apw] (de Reuse, 2003, 92)

Note the past tense of I heard in the translation of the first example and the present tense
of it is said in the second example.
On the other hand, if the evidential is lę́k’eh or lą̄ą̄, ni’ does not include the evidential
event, even if it appears after the evidential; to illustrate de Reuse cites the following example:

(32) Adā˛ā˛dá˛’ magashi náyis’ah
yesterday cow

lé˛k’eh ni’.

3sg+3sg.p.butcher pdr

assp

‘It is clear that he butchered the cow yesterday.’ [apw] (de Reuse, 2003, 92)

Here, the present tense of it is clear in the translation communicates the present tense nature
of the evidential event, opposed to the main event, which happened in the past. De Reuse
further notes that ni’ is the only particle in Western Apache that can give an evidential event
its own time reference (de Reuse, 2003, 92).
These examples demonstrate how the tenses of the main event and the evidential event
(the event of the speaker coming to know about the main event) can be specified in various
languages. This provides further support to the interpretation of evidentiality existing as a
separate predication rather than as a property of the main event.

Summary

In this chapter I have attempted to provide a typological overview that is brief but nevertheless covers the issues most relevant to the project of this thesis. The summary of Aikhenvald’s
scheme for the classification of evidential systems shows the most common inventories of evidentials across the world’s languages as well as the forms by which these evidentials may be
expressed. The subsequent sections dealt with the complexities involved in the expression
of evidential systems across languages. These considerations will be important in making
design decisions, such as in choosing whether to model evidentiality as a property of the
main event or an independent event predication. This question will be addressed in more
detail in the next chapter. A number of linguistic phenomena have been addressed in this
chapter. For easy reference, in Table 3.1 I provide a table summarizing those phenomena.

ANALYSIS

In order to support evidentiality, the Grammar Matrix needs 1) a general semantic analysis of evidentiality in the Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS) framework and 2) an implementation that could accurately produce semantics based on this analysis for all the syntactic
and morphological means by which evidentiality is expressed. In this chapter, I will develop
a semantic analysis of evidentiality; the implementation will be discussed in the next chapter.
The primary goal of the present library is to support the development of grammars with
the most common type of evidential marking, which is a single evidential applying to a
single clause. However, as noted in Chapter 3, there are many ways that evidentials can
interact with other phenomena, such as when evidential events possess their own tense, the
interaction of multiple evidentials, and particular interactions of evidentiality and negation.
Many of these interactions are idiosyncratic to particular languages, and I consider them out
of the scope of this library. Nonetheless, grammars created using this library will provide a
starting point in the development of a more complete grammar when necessary.
This chapter discusses how to model evidential semantics in MRS, as well as how to
analyze lexical and phrase structure rules to produce the correct semantics. I will begin by
developing a general model of evidentiality in MRS that I expect will be able to cover all
evidential semantics found in natural language. Then, I will propose a more compact model
that will be used in the present library that will be sufficient for modeling its functionality,
and which could be extended by grammar engineers as necessary for particular languages.

40

4.1

Semantic Representation

In this section I will develop a generally applicable semantic model for evidentials in the MRS
framework. I will then propose a reduced model that covers the basic functionality that the
library requires. Even though it is not implemented in this library, the general model is
still explored to provide grammar engineers working on extending grammars produced by
the Grammar Matrix with a standard way of analyzing evidential phenomena found in the
languages under study.

4.1.1

Evidentials: Predicates or Features?

The first thing to determine is the best way to represent the semantics of evidentials in the
Grammar Matrix. Two options are available: 1) as an elementary predication (EP) and 2)
as a feature on event-type feature structures. Analyzing evidential semantics as EPs would
facilitate modeling scopal interactions between evidential EPs and other EPs; also, it allows
evidentials to carry their own tense information. Modeling evidentials as features on the
event would follow the established model for representing such semantic categories as tense,
aspect, and mood. Further, this would allow for multiple exponence of evidentiality, as
occurs with other phenomena such as tense and aspect.
A number of the examples in the typological review chapter suggest that at least some
languages treat evidentiality as a separate EP that scopes over the main EP. The fact that
evidentials can have their own time reference, for example, suggests an EP interpretation,
as do the interactions between negation and evidentiality observed in Japanese. In addition,
notes that “Marking evidentiality more than once is different from the multiple expression of
any other category: it is never semantically redundant. Having several evidentiality markers
in one clause allows speakers to express subtle nuances relating to types of evidence and
information source” (Aikhenvald, 2006, 88). Thus, it appears that support for multiple
exponence of evidentiality is not needed, removing one of the major motivators for a feature,
rather than EP, analysis.

Figure 4.1: The general semantic model for an evidential

In this thesis, then, I will analyze evidentials as EPs. This analysis agrees with the
approach of Murray (2017). Murray recognizes four major pieces of an evidential predicate.
First is the evidential proposition itself, which is related to the scope proposition, the main
proposition that the speaker is communicating. In addition to these propositions, there is
also the evidence holder, usually the speaker, the person who gained knowledge of the scope
proposition through the means expressed by the evidential proposition. Finally, there is the
evidence base, or source of the information. For example, if a hearsay evidential is expressed
along with an identification of the reporter, the reporter would be the evidence base of the
evidential (Murray, 2017, 10).
I adapt this terminology to the MRS framework by proposing a general template for an
evidential predicate, where each of the four pieces posited by Murray is an argument of the
predicate. The arg0 refers to an event, representing the evidential event itself (roughly
corresponding to Murray’s evidential proposition). The arg1 is handle-valued, representing
what I call the main EP, Murray’s scope proposition. The evidence holder and evidence base
are represented by arg2 and arg3 respectively. The evidential base is of type semarg since
an evidential EP can be the evidence base for another evidential EP, though it also needs
to support individuals being the source of information; semarg is an underspecified type
appropriate to both individuals and handles. The pred value would specify the particular
evidential term. A graphical representation of this can be found in Figure 4.1.

42

4.1.2

The Descriptive Adequacy of this Model

In this section, I will look at some examples that involve interactions between evidentials
and other phenomena of language. These examples should illustrate that this generalized
model can handle many, if not all, of the complexities found in the evidential systems of
natural languages.
This analysis supports the interaction between evidentials and negation in Japanese:
either the negation or the evidential may scope over the other, depending on the phrase
structure of the sentence. This analysis also allows separate tenses to be specified for the
main proposition and the gathering of the evidence, as required in Tariana (page 34) and
Western Apache (page 35), since the evidential predication is associated with its own event
through its arg0.
To illustrate how this predicate analysis can handle combinations of evidentials, I turn
now to a few examples of more complicated interactions of evidentials identified in the
typological review chapter. First of all, take the following example from Shipibo-Konibo
(shp). The context is that the speaker and his family have put some barbasco, a plant used
to poison fish for the purpose of fishing, into the river. Some time has passed since they
placed the barbasco.
(33) . . . moa=ra

i=bira-[a]i

yapa

paen-i

oin-non

bo-kan-we!

already=dir.ev do.i=infr-inc fish:abs become.dizzy-sssi see-prosp go.pl-pl-imp
‘ . . . the fish must be getting poisoned already, let’s go see (them)! [shp] (Valenzuela,
2003, 44)
Here, some direct evidence (the fact that a good deal of time has passed since they put the
poison in the river) informs the inference (that the fish must be poisoned already). The
semantics of the fish must be getting poisoned already could be expressed using the proposed
model like this in Figure 4.2. In this example, the direct evidential serves as the information
base of the inferential evidential. The direct evidential’s arg1 is underspecified because in

Figure 4.2: Evidential semantics of The fish must be getting poisoned

this situation the direct evidence that informs the inference is not explicitly stated. The
direct evidential is still included since it serves as the evidential base for the inferential
evidential.
In the case of Eastern Pomo (peb), the proposed approach can model the evidential
semantics of this sentence:

44

(34) kalél=xa=kh í

maPór-al

q’á-ne-e.

simply=hs=3.agent daughter.in.law-patient leave-infr-rep
‘He must have simply left his daughter-in-law there, they say.’ [peb] (McLendon, 2003,
112)
In the proposed model, this would be represented as in Figure 4.3. Here the information
receiver of one evidential is identified with the information source of another evidential.
In this section I have demonstrated how this general semantic analysis can be used to
cover some of the more complex situations that appear cross-linguistically with evidentials,
specifically the identification of information source in hearsay evidentials and the use of one
evidential as the information base of another.

4.1.3

The Representation in this Library

Recall that the purpose of this library is to model the basic cases of evidentiality where
there are no complex, idiosyncratic interactions between evidentials and tense, negation, or
other evidentials. In this basic case, the evidence holder is almost always the speaker. Since
MRS has no mechanism to identify any argument with the speaker, the presence of this
argument is superfluous for the library. Likewise, in the basic case, the evidence base often
is not explicitly stated in a way that is grammaticized, so this this argument is also omitted.
This yields a semantic representation as shown in Figure 4.4. Here, The arg0 points to the
evidential event and the arg1 points to the main EP. As an example, in Figure 4.5 I show
the analysis in this framework of the following sentence (Example 35) from Kazakh (kaz):

(35) tüs-ipti.
fall-past.indir
‘[He/she/it] has evidentily fallen, evidently fell.’ [kaz] (Johanson, 2003, 279)

Syntactic Means of Expressing Evidentiality

Evidentiality can be expressed by many means, some grammatical, some lexical. In this
library, I focus on providing support for the grammatical means. Based on my typological
review, the three main ways of expressing evidentiality appear to be verbal inflection, verbal
auxiliaries, and clitics. In this section I develop an analysis of how to tie these morphological
and syntactic means of expression to the semantics proposed in the previous section.

4.2.1

Verbal Inflection

The first formal means for expressing evidentiality that the Grammar Matrix must support is
verbal inflection. In the Grammar Matrix, inflection is handled by types called lexical rules.
In order to support lexical rules that add evidential semantics to the verb, there needs to
be a type that can link up the semantics of the evidential predication and main predication
correctly.

47

evidential-lex-rule := cont-change-only-lex-rule &
[ C-CONT [ RELS <! event-relation &
[ LBL #ltop,
ARG0 event,
ARG1 #harg ] !>,
HCONS <! qeq & [ HARG #harg,
LARG #larg ] !>,
HOOK [ LTOP #ltop,
INDEX #mainev,
XARG #mainagent ] ]
DTR [ SYNSEM.LOCAL [ CONT.HOOK [ INDEX #mainev,
XARG #mainagent ],
CAT.HEAD verb ] ] ].
Figure 4.6: The evidential-lex-rule supertype

The type evidential-lex-rule in Figure 4.6 maintains the main EP’s index and external
argument (the index and xarg features in hook) in the rule’s result’s hook. This allows
the rest of the sentence to interact with the semantics of the main EP. The ltop feature
of hook is identified with the evidential EP’s label (lbl), predicting that anything scoping
over the verb’s main EP also scopes over the evidential EP. The relationship between the
main EP and the evidential EP is handled by the qeq constraint in hcons, constraining the
arg1 of the evidential predication to be equal modulo quantifiers to the main predication.
Further, this type inherits from the cont-change-only-lex-rule, meaning that the evidential
lexical rules can only contribute semantic information; they may not alter the syntactic
properties of their daughter. In addition to the evidential-lex-rule supertype, there must be
individual types for each evidential term that is expressed in inflection, in order to correctly
specify the PRED relation. This is demonstrated in Figure 4.7 for an inferential evidential
term.
Finally, specific lexical rule types, representing the specific inflectional affixes that may
appear in a language, can inherit from one of these <evidential_term>-evidential-lex-rule
types to tie evidential semantics to individual affixes. With these types in place, it will be

48

inferential-evidential-lex-rule := evidential-lex-rule &
[ C-CONT.RELS <! [ PRED "ev_inferential_pred" ] !> ].
Figure 4.7: The inferential-evidential-lex-rule type

straightforward to add lexical rules that produce evidential semantics. In order to express
evidential semantics, a lexical rule type only needs to inherit from one of these types.

4.2.2

Auxiliary Verbs

Currently the Grammar Matrix provides support for auxiliary verbs, which may take verbs,
verb phrases, or sentences as their complements. This library will use the existing analysis
for auxiliary verbs that add a predicate scoping over the auxiliary’s complement. In this case,
several auxiliary verb types are developed by the Grammar Matrix to handle the interaction
of the auxiliary verb and its complement, both syntactically and semantically. A few types
like this are shown in Figure 4.8. These types were generated from the Grammar Matrix for
an auxiliary verb that takes a VP complement and appears after its complement. The aux-lex
type marks the auxiliary verb as AUX +, while the subj-raise-aux handles the identification
of the auxiliary verb’s subject with the complement’s subject. Finally, subj-raise-aux-withpred is what auxiliary lexical entries inherit from, combining the constraints of three types,
including subj-raise-aux and trans-first-arg-raising-lex-item-1. In this example, the transfirst-arg-raising-lex-item-1 type from matrix.tdl handles the identification of the argument
of the introduced predicate and the label of the complement, as shown in Figure 4.9.
The final main component here is to specify the relation of the introduced predicate.
This is handled in the lexicon; an example of this is shown in Figure 4.10, where the TDL
for an inferential evidential auxiliary spelled infer is shown.
This analysis results in slightly different semantics for evidentials expressed by auxiliaries
and those expressed by verbal inflection. Specifically, in the case of verbal inflection, the
index of the rule is identified with the index of the dtr, while in the auxiliary case the

currently handles negation.

4.2.3

Clitics

Some languages use clitics to mark evidentiality. These clitics often may be analyzed as
auxiliary verbs, allowing us to use the Grammar Matrix’s current machinery to account for
them. For example, in Tariana the tense/evidential marker is a clitic that usually immediately follows the verb (Aikhenvald, 2003, 131). Representing this as an auxiliary verb
immediately following its complement is straightforward.
One case that requires more thought is that of second-position clitics. The Grammar
Matrix currently supports auxiliary verbs in the second position, as long as the rest of the

51

sentence has free word order. Thus, if evidential-marking second-position clitics do not
constrain word order, the analysis developed in the previous section for evidential-marking
auxiliary verbs would also apply to second-position clitics, requiring no further analysis.
Aikhenvald cites only two languages using second-position clitics to mark evidentiality:
Shipibo-Konibo (shp) and Quechua (que) (Aikhenvald, 2006, 68). In the case of ShipiboKonibo, Camacho notes that “word order is fairly flexible” (Camacho, 2010, 219). Likewise, Weber notes that Huallaga Quechua “has a fairly free word order, particularly in nonsuboardinate clauses” (Weber, 1989, 15). Thus, the treatment in the Grammar Matrix that
second-position auxiliary verbs are correlated with an otherwise free word order appears to
hold, requiring no special work for supporting evidential second-position clitics.
It is worth noting that in some languages, such as Quechua (Aikhenvald, 2006, 68), these
clitics can also appear attached to a focused element of the sentence. This behavior is not
be covered by this library.
4.3

Summary

In this chapter I have developed two analyses of evidential semantics, one that should be
generally applicable, based on the work by Murray (2017), and a reduced analysis that omits
those arguments not affected by this library. If grammar engineers need these arguments
for grammars created by the Grammar Matrix, it should be straightforward to add them
as necessary. Further, I have identified the analyses for the grammatical means by which
evidentiality is usually expressed: verbal inflection and auxiliary verbs, which includes evidential clitics. In Table 4.1, I summarize the phenomena discussed in the Typology chapter
in another table, this time noting whether the phenomenon is supported by the analysis
developed in this chapter.

IMPLEMENTATION
As mentioned in Chapter 2, the Grammar Matrix consists of a core grammar and a
customization system. The customization system includes the questionnaire, which is a web
app that produces a choices file, and a body of Python code, which produces a grammatical
model in TDL from the choices file. In order to update the Grammar Matrix to support
evidentiality, both the questionnaire and the grammar-producing code need to be modified,
which I describe in this chapter.

5.1

Questionnaire

The questionnaire consists of multiple web pages, each one dedicated to a particular grammatical phenomenon, such as Tense/Aspect/Mood, Morphology, Sentential Negation. In
addition, there are pages for defining the lexicon and test sentences. I have added an “Evidentials” web page to the questionnaire, which allows the user-linguist to define the inventory
of evidential terms in the language. This can be done either by selecting common terms with
checkboxes, or by producing a custom inventory by means of an iterable. A screenshot of
this page is found in Figure 5.1.
The questionnaire treats evidentiality as a feature, able to take any of the terms as values.
Then it can be constrained, for example, in the Morphology page’s treatment of a lexical rule
type, as shown in Figure 5.2. However, evidentiality is properly conceived of as a pseudofeature, since it will appear as a predication, not a feature, in the final TDL-format grammar.
How this is accomplished is described in the next section. The content of a choices file of a
small pseudo-language that exhibits evidentiality is included in Figure 5.3.

5.2

Grammar-producing Code

The customization system outputs a formal grammar of the language being studied by automatically producing TDL code based on the selections made in the choices file. In the semantic analysis I’ve developed for evidentials, evidentials are elementary predications (EPs),
rather than features. Because they are represented as (pseudo-)features in the questionnaire,
some special processing is necessary to produce the correct semantics. In this section I first
explain this processing as it is relevant to evidential verbal inflection, then I move on to
discussing the processing of auxiliary verbs marking evidentiality.
The Grammar Matrix organizes inflection into a hierarchy of position classes and lexical
rule types. Each position class represents a morphological “slot” on a word and has a number
of associated lexical rule types; a lexical rule type represents a set of affixes that produce the
same results. Each lexical rule type then has a series of lexical rule instances, each of which
indicates a phonological/orthographic form that expresses the lexical rule type’s effects. In
order to model an evidential affix on the verb, it’s necessary to define a lexical rule type that
inherits from the appropriate types defined in Chapter 4.
First, these rules must be added to the TDL. I have updated the morphotactics module of
the customization system to automatically introduce the necessary evidential inflectional rule
types. If any lexical rule types defined in the choices file constrain the feature evidential, then
the evidential-lex-rule type is introduced. Also, the subtypes corresponding to the lexical rule
types’ evidential values are also introduced. The code that adds the evidential lexical rule
types is found in the morphotactics.py file in a function called write_evidential_behavior.
The code is shown in Figure 5.4.
In addition to defining these types in the TDL, it is also necessary to make the correct
lexical rule types inherit from them. To this end, I further modified the morphotactics
module of the customization system. When features are being processed, each feature is
checked to see if it is an evidential. If it is, the normal processing that adds a feature to
the relevant TDL feature structure is averted. Instead, the value of the evidential feature

is read, and the lexical rule type being defined is made to inherit from the corresponding
lexical rule supertype. For example, if the evidential pseudo-feature is marked indirective,
the lexical rule type will be made to inherit from indirective-evidential-lex-rule. Inheriting
from the appropriate subtype of evidential-lex-rule will introduce the correct predication
structure required for all evidentials as defined in the evidential-lex-rule type, as well as the
specific pred value provided by the subtype.
According to my analysis laid out in Chapter 4, in addition to verbal inflection, evidentiality is also expressed through auxiliary verbs. In order to get auxiliary verbs to produce
the correct EP-based semantics, I leveraged the existing code that handles auxiliaries introducing predicates. The code for this is shown in Figure 5.5. The variable sem is taken from
the choices file, and it indicates that the user explicitly specified a predicate for the auxiliary to add, while evid_present is a variable that indicates whether an evidential constraint
has been placed on the auxiliary. In this implementation, the auxiliary is assumed to only
ever contribute one predicate; this seems to be the case for evidential markers. However, if
an evidential is ever found that introduces another predicate in addition to the evidential
predicate, this implementation will have to be revised. Further, if the user both specifies a
predicate explicitly and constrains the evidential pseudo-feature on an auxiliary verb, the
evidential predicate takes precedence.

Summary

This chapter provided an overview of the implementation changes made to the Grammar
Matrix to support the analysis of evidential semantics proposed in the previous chapter.
The customization system’s treatment of both verbal inflection and auxiliary verbs have
been updated to express evidential semantics, and the questionnaire has been updated to
allow users to specify the expression of evidentials.

Chapter 6
EVALUATION
In order to evaluate the coverage and effectiveness of the analysis and implementation
described in the preceding two chapters, I employ a testing strategy common to most libraries
extending the Grammar Matrix. The testing is split up into regression tests, pseudo-language
tests, illustrative language tests, and held-out language tests.
The regression tests are a suite of tests already compiled for the Grammar Matrix. The
purpose of these tests is to ensure that any changes a new library introduces to the software
does not break any of the previous features of the Grammar Matrix. The pseudo-language
tests are created by the library developer to check whether the library behaves the way
expected. These pseudo-languages are small grammars developed to test the possible logical
combinations of grammatical forms supported by the library. The illustrative language tests
are used to test whether the library supports the relevant linguistic phenomena in natural
languages. These are languages that may have been consulted in the development of the
library. The held-out language tests are used to test whether the library is sufficiently
robust to support the relevant phenomena in natural languages not consulted during the
development of the library. For this reason, these languages’ grammars must be examined
by the library developer only after the final changes are made to the library. Further,
these held-out languages should be selected from different language families to ensure broad
coverage.
The files for these language tests are organized in pairs of a choices file and a test suite
file. The choices file saves the input to the questionnaire. The test suite includes grammatical
and ungrammatical sentences in the language in question. In addition to these files, gold
standard MRS representations of every parseable test sentence are generated and stored. In

62

order to run these tests, the matrix.py script is invoked with the regression-test argument.
This automatically generates grammars from the tests’ choices files, attempts to parse all
test items, and compares all MRS representations produced by those parses to the gold
standards. If all grammatical examples parse, all ungrammatical exmaples do not parse, and
all MRS representations produced are the same as the gold standards, the regression tests
pass.1
The next three sections describe the test languages I’ve selected for evaluating this library.
In these sections I provide tables summarizing my test results. In these tables, coverage refers
to the percentage of grammatical sentences that parse; overgeneration refers to the percentage
of ungrammatical sentences that parse; and correct semantics refers to the percentage of
grammatical, parseable sentences that produce the MRS representation I expect.
6.1

Pseudo-language Tests

In order to test the basic functionality of this library, I produced four ‘pseudo-languages’, two
using inflectional marking of evidentiality, and two using auxiliary verbs to mark evidentiality.
Further, for each way of marking evidentiality, I specify the evidential inventory using predefined terms in one pseudo-language and user-defined terms in the other. I developed a test
suite of sentences to test and built grammars of the pseudo-languages with the Grammar
Matrix to test the present library’s basic functionality.

The files for the tests described in this section can be found in the Grammar Matrix repository at Revision 39811. The regression test files are found in the directory trunk/gmcs/regression_tests. The test suites are located at regression_tests/txt-suites/{testname}, the choices files
are located at regression_tests/choices/{testname}, and the MRS gold standards are located at
regression_tests/home/gold/{testname}. The names of the individual tests are all prepended by
‘evidentials’. The pseudo-language and illustrative language tests have been added to the regression
testing setup in the Grammar Matrix repository, but regression tests based on the held-out language tests
have not been incorporated yet.

two evidential terms in this language, ‘directive’ and ‘indirective’. To test this language, I
developed a test suite consisting of 6 items, all of them grammatical. Three test transitive
sentences, and three test intransitive sentences. Each set of three consists of an evidentially
unmarked sentence, a sentence marked ‘indirective’, and a sentence marked ‘directive’. The
lack of ungrammatical sentences is due to the flexibility of this language, which does not impose constraints on the evidential system that would render a sentence ungrammatical. This
test language, as with the other pseudo-language tests, is meant only to check the semantic
representation of the test sentences. I selected the terms ‘directive’ and ‘indirective’ to test
the questionnaire’s ability to define a custom inventory of evidential terms. In Figure 6.1 I
show the text representation of the semantics of one of the sentences in this test suite.

evidentials-auxiliary-choose: Like the previous pseudo-language, the word order is SVO,
with auxiliary verbs coming after their verbal complements. The only difference is that
the system has an evidential system consisting of the terms ‘firsthand’ and ‘non-firsthand’.
Again, the test suite consists of 6 test items, all grammatical, with two groups of three
sentences, one for transitive and one for intransitive verbs, each group consisting of an
evidentially unmarked sentence, a ‘firsthand’ sentence, and a ‘non-firsthand’ sentence. The
terms ‘firsthand’ and ‘non-firsthand’ were selected to test the questionnaire’s ability to create
evidential inventories from a list of suggested terms.

64

evidentials-inflection-build: This pseudo-language has a basic SVO word order and expresses evidentiality through optional, mutually exclusive suffixes on the verb. It contains
two evidential terms, ‘directive’ and ‘indirective’. Similar to the other pseudo-language tests,
the test suite contains 6 grammatical test items, to test both transitive and intransitive verbs
with neutral, ‘directive,’ and ‘indirective’ markings. These terms were selected to test the
ability of the questionnaire to combine inflection and a user-defined evidential term inventory.
evidentials-inflection-choose: Like the previous pseudo-language, this pseudo-language’s
basic word order is SVO, and it expresses evidentiality through optional and mutually exclusive suffixes on the verb. The evidential system consists of the terms ‘firsthand’ and ‘nonfirsthand’. The test suite contains 6 grammatical test items to test transitive and intransitive
sentences with each of the possible evidential values (neutral, ‘firsthand,’ ‘non-firsthand’). I
chose the terms ‘firsthand’ and ‘non-firsthand’ to test the questionnaire’s ability to produce
an evidential term inventory from suggested terms that works with inflection.
6.1.2

Results

The results of these tests are summarized in Table 6.1. Not shown is the number of parses;
each sentence that parses has a single parse. Also, note that the “Correct Semantics” percentage is out of sentences that parse, not out of the total number of sentences. The system
was able to parse all examples, and I checked to verify that the semantic representations
were what I expected them to be.
6.2

Illustrative Language Tests

In order to verify that the evidentiality can cover phenomena found in natural languages, I
developed grammar fragments of seven natural languages with the Grammar Matrix, focusing on their evidentiality systems. I developed these grammars for Kazakh (kaz) (Turkic),
Qiang (cng) (Tibeto-Burman), Western Apache (apw) (Athabaskan, Shipibo-Konibo (shp)
(Panoan), Kolyma Yukaghir (yux) (Yukaghir), Eastern Pomo (peb) (Pomoan), and West

Greenlandic (kal) (Eskaleut). The geographic distribution of these languages is shown in
Figure 6.2 (Dryer and Haspelmath, 2013). The grammaticality and semantic correctness
judgment for these languages have not been verified by native speakers, but are based on my
understanding according to the sources cited in the description of each language.
6.2.1

Test Languages

Kazakh [kaz] (Turkic): Kazakh is an SOV language that in simple nominal sentences
lacks a copula, instead directly inflecting the final word of the nominal predicate. The evidential system is split between two terms: directive and indirective. The directive is technically
evidentially ambiguous, being applicable both when the speaker has directly gained the
knowledge s/he is expressing and when there was an intermediate information source. In the
past tense, evidentiality can be expressed by the choice of past tense suffix: the standard past
tense -DI and the perfective past tense -GAn are directive, while the suffix -IptI expresses an
indirective past tense. There is also an auxiliary verb eken, which takes both nominal and
verbal predicates. Nominal predicates are morphologically unmarked for person, while verbal

Figure 6.3: Test suite for Kazakh

predicates are morphologically marked to agree with third-person subjects. Agreement with
the true subject is thus marked on eken, not on the verbal predicate (Muhamedowa, 2015). I
developed a test suite of 13 items, 9 grammatical and 4 ungrammatical sentences. I test both
the auxiliary evidential eken and the past tense -ipti. This test suite is given as an example
in Figure 6.3. Also, as an example I show the IGT of one of the sentences in the test suite
and the text representation of that sentence’s semantics produced for the regression tests in
Figure 6.4.

Qiang [cng] (Tibeto-Burman): Evidentials are expressed in affixes to the verb. Each
evidential affix has its own position class. There are three terms: the inferential/mirative
marker -k, the visual marker -u, and the hearsay marker -i. The inferential marker can
co-occur with either the visual or the hearsay marker (LaPolla, 2003). In order to test this
behavior, I developed a test suite of 13 sentences, 10 grammatical and 3 ungrammatical,
testing all the combinations of evidentials. Figure 6.5 shows the IGT and semantic representation produced for one of the Qiang test items where two evidentials are marked.

Western Apache [apw] (Athabaskan): The language is basically SOV, and evidential
markers are particles that follow the verb. I analyze these as auxiliary verbs that take
sentential complements. The terms in the system include a non-eyewitness experiential
marker (hiłts’ad), a mirative inferential (lą̄ą̄), a non-mirative inferential (golnīī), a physical
inferential (noli˛h), and two quotatives (ch’inı̄ı̄, lę́k’eh). When a sentence lacks an evidential
marker, it “tends to be interpreted as a statement that the speaker is quite certain of, and
such statements tend to imply that the speaker was an eyewitness of the event” (de Reuse,
2003, 83). The test suite for this language consists of 8 items, all of them grammatical,
testing six evidential particles, an evidentially unmarked sentence, and the co-occurrence of
the asserted past marker and an evidential marker. In my grammar of this language I do not
have the lack of an evidential marker introduce a visual evidential term in the semantics. This
is because, based on my interpretation of de Reuse’s wording “tend to imply,” the implication
of being an eyewitness is not necessary to the semantics of the unmarked sentence; rather,
the primary meaning of the unmarked sentence is certainty, rather than information source.

Shipibo-Konibo [shp] (Panoan): In pragmatically unmarked simple standalone sentences, a second-position clitic marks either direct (=ra) or hearsay (=ronki) evidentiality,
with flexible word order otherwise, though with a tendency toward SOV. A third, optional
inferential evidential term (-bira) occurs within the verb’s morphology. This term can, however, appear as a clitic attaching to a pragmatically emphasized constituent of the sentence
(Valenzuela, 2003). This behavior is outside of the scope of this library. I developed a test
suite of 8 items, 7 grammatical and 1 ungrammatical, testing =ra and =ronki occurring
independently and with -bira. One test item demonstrates bira occurring as a clitic after
an emphasized constituent. I have modeled the grammar of this language by analyzing the
required second-position clitic as an auxiliary verb, with the basic word order being V2, with
the inferential term analyzed as a suffix to the verb.

70

Kolyma Yukaghir [yux] (Yukaghir): The grammar is generally agglutinative, with an
SOV word order. Verbs have several position classes, most of them optional. Evidentiality
is marked by one of the optional position classes, which can express an inferential evidential
term (-l’el) or a prospective (-moži). This prospective marks future time and could be
analyzed as also evidential, since it indicates an expected future event based on current
evidence (Maslova, 2003a,b). The test suite for this language includes 7 items, 5 grammatical
and 2 ungrammatical. I test the combination of the inferential and propspective with the
future tense marker and irrealis marker.

Eastern Pomo [peb] (Pomoan): Verbs have eight suffix position classes. Evidentiality is
expressed by one member of the seventh position class, the logical inferential evidential -ine,
and by three members of the eighth position class: the direct evidential -ya, the non-visual
sensory evidential ink’e, and the hearsay evidential -le (McLendon, 1975, 2003). I developed
a test suite of 12 sentences with 11 grammatical and 1 ungrammatical. I test the various
evidential markers and their co-occurence with aspect markers.

West Greenlandic [kal] (Eskaleut): Evidentiality is expressed in the extensive morphological system. The system’s inventory is quite extensive, including terms for auditory
(-(r)pallaC), nonfirsthand (-(r)paluC), sensory inferential (-gunar), hearsay or hearsay-based
inferential (-sima), general knowledge-based inferential (-jannarsi), and an experience-based
inferential (-nnguatsiar). In addition to these morphological means of expression, there are
two further hearsay markers, the gossip hearsay marker unnia, which appears at the beginning of the sentence, and the quoatative enclitic =guuq which appears in the second position
(Fortescue, 2003). This language’s test suite contains 12 items, 11 grammatical sentences
and 1 ungrammatical sentence. I test the various evidential suffixes, as well as a grammatically unmarked sentence. I also test the placement of the two independent hearsay markers.
I would analyze both of the independent quotative markers as auxiliary verbs, but since they
appear in different positions and the Grammar Matrix only allows one order for all auxiliary

71

verbs in a language, I chose to model the sentence-initial marker unnia.

Results

The results of these tests are summarized in Table 6.2. Not shown is the number of parses;
each sentence that parses has a single parse. Also, note that the “Correct Semantics” percentage is out of sentences that parse, not out of the total number of sentences. In most
cases, the evidential systems of the languages described could be modeled effectively using
this present library. However, there are some deficiencies. For example, in the case of West
Greenlandic, the Grammar Matrix cannot correctly model the two hearsay markers unnia
and =guuq, leading to one grammatical test item to fail to parse. Further, the Grammar
Matrix would have to support more flexible word orders to support the range of positions
that the inferential =bira occurs in, since it can appear after any focused element; this is
what causes one grammatical test item in Shipibo-Konibo’s test suite to fail to parse. These
issues could be addressed by supporting freer word order in the Grammar Matrix, especially
when it comes to auxiliaries.

6.3

Held-Out Language Tests

I’ve selected five held-out languages to test the general applicability of this library to languages with evidential systems: Ladakhi (lbj) (Tibeto-Burman), (Khalkha) Mongolian (mon)
(Mongolic), Gulf Arabic (afb) (Semitic), Wichita (wic) (Caddoan), and Basque (eus) (Language Isloate/Vasconic). The geographic distribution of these languages is shown in Figure
6.6 (Dryer and Haspelmath, 2013). In selecting these langauges, I had both genetic and areal
diversity in mind. I used the online edition of the World Atlas of Language Structures to see
a map of languages based on type of evidential system (de Haan, 2013). I tried to pick out
languages across a wide geographic area with different means of expressing evidentials that
also were not related to each other.

6.3.1

Test Languages

Ladakhi [lbj] (Tibeto-Burman): Evidentiality is expressed through a number of suffixes
on the verb. Ladakhi has six evidential terms: observed, narrative, fact-based inferential,
appearance-based inferential, attested inferential, and experiential. In addition to these,
there is an evidentially neutral reportive (Koshal, 1979). I’ve developed a test suite of 13
items, 10 grammatical and 3 ungrammatical, testing that all these evidentials are correctly
modeled and that ungrammatical combinations of multiple evidentials, such as combining
the observed and the fact-based inferential. I modeled this language’s evidential system by
developing the appropriate position classes on the Morphology page and adding lexical rule
types for the evidential suffixes, as well as position classes for aspect and tense, so as to test
the interaction between the evidentials and the tense-aspect system. Figure 6.7 shows the
IGT of one of the sentences in the test suite and the text representation of its semantics
produced for the regression tests.

75

Mongolian [mon] (Mongolic): Two past tense suffixes, -jee and -laa also encode evidentiality: -jee expresses non-firsthand semantics, while -laa expresses firsthand. These are in
contrast with two evidentially neutral past tense suffixes, -san and -v (Street, 1963; Song,
2013). I test this with a test suite of 4 items, 3 grammatical, each testing one of the past tense
suffixes, and 1 ungrammatical item to verify that the past tense suffixes cannot co-occur. I
was able to model this system by defining a past-tense position class with four lexical rule
types, each one requiring the past tense, and the two evidential suffixes also requiring their
specific evidential value.

Gulf Arabic [afb] (Semitic): There is a single evidential auxiliary, yikuun, that precedes
a sentence to express non-firsthand evidentiality. This auxiliary verb is identical to the
third-person masculine singular form of the explicit copula kaan (Holes, 1990). A small test
suite of 5 items, 3 grammatical and 2 ungrammatical, test that both evidentially-marked
and unmarked sentences parse correctly and that ungrammatical locations of the evidential
marker yikuun are prohibited. The usage of yikuun as an evidential marker is sufficiently
different than kaan’s normal meaning that to model it I defined an invariable auxiliary verb
yikuun that takes a saturated sentence as its complement, which it precedes, and in the
questionnaire is constrained to the evidential value of non-firsthand. Holes also notes that
the verb yiguuluun, literally meaning ‘they say’, can be used to mark hearsay. However, I
see no reason to model this as a grammatical marker of evidentiality separate from a verb
meaning ‘to say’.

Wichita [wic] (Caddoan): There are three means of expressing evidentiality in Wichita:
the quotative prefix kiya-, the future quotative prefix ehe-, and the inferential particle wéra’
(Rood and Charney, 1976). Though Rood and Charney use the different words quotative and
inferential here, their description of their usage leads me to believe that these three markers
all refer to a single non-firsthand term. In the test suite for this language, I test that the three
evidential markers all parse correctly and that an evidentially unmarked sentence also parses

76

correctly. In addition, I test the ordering of evidential affixes and the word order involving
the auxiliary. This results in a test suite with 6 items, 4 grammatical and 2 ungrammatical.
I successfully model the two prefixes in the morphology system with evidential features set
to non-firsthand, and I model the particle as an auxiliary verb preceding the verb phrase.

Basque [eus] (Language Isolate/Vasconic): Basque has two ways to conjugate verbs:
synthetic and periphrastic conjugation. In periphrastic conjugation, by far the more common
means of conjugation, a nonfinite form of the verb is followed by a finite auxiliary verb. A
small class of verbs may be conjugated morphologically to produce a finite form without an
auxiliary verb. There are two evidential terms in Basque, the hearsay marker omen and the
inferential marker bide, which are proclitics that precede the finite verb (Rijk, 2008). I tested
this with a test suite of 10 items, 6 grammatical and 4 ungrammatical. The 6 grammatical
examples are split evenly between synthetic and periphrastic conjugation, testing hearsay, inferential, and unmarked evidentiality. In trying to implement this system, I’ve run up against
a couple of restrictions in the Grammar Matrix system. First of all, all auxiliaries must share
the same word order relationship with their complements. Thus, since the complement of
the periphrastic conjugation auxiliary precedes it, and the evidential clitic precedes it, the
clitic should be considered part of the complement. However, this will not work, because
the Grammar Matrix does not currently support non-predicate-introducing auxiliaries (such
as the conjugation auxiliary) taking [AUX +] complements. These two restrictions, when
combined with my analysis of evidential clitics as auxiliary verbs and the understanding of
the Basque evidential marker as a clitic, make it so that the Grammar Matrix cannot model
Basque’s periphrastic conjugation combined with the evidential markers.

show that the present library supports the evidential systems of most of these languages.
The primary shortcoming is in modeling Basque, since in Basque conjugation auxiliaries
follow their complement, while evidential auxiliaries precede their complement. This could
be remedied by allowing multiple auxiliary verb word orders within a single language.
6.4

Summary

The results of these evaluations demonstrate that, in a large majority of cases, this library
operates correctly when handling sentences with a single evidential, as well as provides a
simplified analysis of sentences with more than one evidential (see Figure 6.5). Evidentiality
can also combine with other grammatical categories, such as tense, correctly. There are some
insufficiencies, as revealed in the Basque example. These issues point a few ways forward for
further development of the Grammar Matrix, which I will touch on in the next chapter.

Chapter 7
CONCLUSION
In this thesis I have described the linguistic foundation, formal analysis, implementation,
and evaluation involved in developing a library for modeling evidentiality in the LinGO
Grammar Matrix. The process of developing this library has turned up some potential
avenues for further development of the Grammar Matrix. As described in Chapter 3, there
are more complex evidential situations in some languages. Many of these complexities are
idiosyncratic to particular languages, so altering the Grammar Matrix to support every way
evidentials may be expressed, if it’s even possible, would likely render the user interface so
cumbersome as to be unusable.
That said, the evidentiality module described in this thesis could likely be refined to
handle some of the identified complexities, such as producing a more nuanced analysis of how
multiple evidentials interact. On the other hand, there are interesting grammar engineering
challenges with regard to evidentials, such as how best to handle the interactions of the
asserted past particle ni’ with the evidentials in Western Apache (described in 3.4.3).
Considering the inability of the current library to handle evidentials with periphrastic
conjugation in Basque, it may be desirable to alter some restrictions on the auxiliary verb
system in the Grammar Matrix, allowing different orderings of auxiliary verb head and
complement within a single language.
In this thesis I have reviewed the linguistic literature on a phenomenon known as evidentiality, the grammatical encoding of information source. I have developed an analysis in
HPSG-style syntax and Minimal Recursion Semantics that should apply to evidential systems across the world’s languages. I have also implemented support for the fundamental
phenomena related to evidentiality in the Grammar Matrix. This project’s aim has been

79

to facilitate linguists in developing computational grammars of languages, for NLP applications, linguistic research, or both. There is still more to be done in this area, but the
work presented in this thesis should provide a foundation on which further research can be
conducted.
