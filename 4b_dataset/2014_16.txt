ABSTRACT OF THE DISSERTATION
A Knowledge-Sharing Communication Network Approach to Transactive Memory
Systems in Virtual Work Arrangements
By YOUNG HOON KIM

Dissertation Director:
Jennifer Gibbs

This study explores the relationships between expertise recognition—which is the
key element of transactive memory systems (TMS)—and virtuality, while taking into
account the effects of network diversity and network closure. It also examines the
relationships between expertise recognition and knowledge-seeking behaviors and
between expertise recognition and information-allocation. This study sheds light on the
difficulties that individuals may face in establishing TMS in virtual work arrangements.
Using hierarchical multiple regression and exponential random graph modeling, this
study shows that the two main network properties, network diversity and network closure,
not only influence expertise recognition positively but also moderate the effects of the
structural aspects of virtuality on expertise recognition. Further, this study identifies
alternating bivariate network relationships among the three main elements of TMS—

expertise recognition, knowledge seeking, and information allocation—indicating that
individuals’ perceptions of others’ expertise shape patterns of knowledge-sharing.

Chapter 1. Introduction
To be successful, modern organizations must respond swiftly to ever-changing
business needs. In recent decades, advanced information and communication
technologies have radically transformed the way that organizations can navigate dynamic
organizational environments. Virtual network organizations have emerged as one way to
facilitate innovation and knowledge-sharing (Ahuja & Carley, 1999; DeSanctis & Monge,
1999). Despite their usefulness in mitigating the spatial and temporal limitations of work
processes, virtual work environments also pose challenges to knowledge-sharing.
Because virtual workers are physically distributed across space, their work often involves
a fluid network structure that is characterized by electronic communication with
culturally-diverse individuals. The characteristics of virtuality—which include
“geographic dispersion”, “electronic dependence”, “national diversity”, and “dynamic
structure” (Gibson & Gibbs, 2006)—may make it more difficult to establish mutual
knowledge and form shared mental models of tasks (Cramton, 2001; Senge, 1990).
Virtual work environments present opportunities and challenges. They can
mobilize diverse sets of unevenly distributed knowledge resources via various virtual
organizations. Traditional forms of organizational relationships are not feasible when
members work in different locations and rely primarily on electronic communication. For
instance, individuals cannot readily observe how much effort others are expending.
Performing tasks with previously unacquainted team members could be challenging.
Unfamiliarity with each other could lead to less confidence in coworkers’ abilities. Due
to the situational invisibility inherent to distributed work, virtual workers may be prone to
attribute another individual’s behaviors to his or her dispositional characteristics rather

2

than situational information about that person’s behaviors, which would likely produce
more false attributions (Cramton, Orvis, & Wilson, 2007). However, when face-to-face
contact is too costly or simply impossible, virtual organizations use cooperative work to
accomplish goals. Despite challenges such as low cohesion, disconnection, and
knowledge-sharing difficulties, virtual organizations have become increasingly prevalent.
Virtual teams are quite prevalent (Okkonen, 2004); however, they are not the only
type of virtual work arrangement. The word “virtual” describes multiple aspects of the
workplace: virtual employees, virtual groups, virtual teams, and virtual organizations
(Watson-Manheim, Chudoba, & Crowston, 2002). Virtual employees are those who are
not all affiliated with the same organization or workgroup membership, or those who are
physically and/or temporally distant from one another. Individuals in virtual groups and
virtual teams use technology to span geographic and temporal boundaries. According to
Watson-Manheim et al., the main difference between virtual groups and virtual teams is
that the composition of virtual teams can be discontinuous in that virtual teams could
include individuals who are affiliated with different organizations, whereas virtual groups
only include individuals within the same organization. Virtual organizations contain
individuals who collaborate across traditional organizational boundaries (e.g., a
consortium created by multiple organizations).
In contrast to previous studies of virtual work environments, which have tended to
focus exclusively on virtual teams (Gibson & Gibbs, 2006; Griffith & Neale, 2001), this
study focuses more broadly on virtual work arrangements, which are characterized by
virtual and/or non-virtual dynamics within organizations. The term “team” can be overly
narrow because it is often used to refer to a specific organizational unit; virtual work

3

arrangements are fluid and do not always involve virtual teams. Consider, for example,
an individual virtual work pattern like telecommuting, which may or may not be used
within a conventional work group, team, or organization.
Virtuality is the defining concept that underlies virtual work environments.
Departing from an earlier understanding of virtuality as being completely mediated by
technology, Griffith, Sawyer, and Neale (2003) portrayed virtuality as existing along a
continuum from complete reliance on technological mediation to entirely face-to-face
interactions. While Griffith et al. mainly focused on virtual work that uses technology to
connect workers who are separated by great physical distances, virtual work does not
necessarily require high levels of technical support, nor must virtual workers be
physically distant from one another. Gibson and Gibbs (2006) broadened the dimensions
of virtuality to include the following: “geographic dispersion”, “dynamic structure”,
“electronic dependence”, and “national/cultural diversity”. Geographic dispersion refers
to the extent to which coworkers operate in different geographic locations (Chudoba,
Wynn, Lu, & Watson-Manheim, 2005; Gibson & Gibbs). Dynamic structure refers to the
degree of turnover in workgroup membership (Gibson & Gibbs). Electronic dependence
indicates the extent to which an individual relies on electronic communication tools to
communicate with other people in their organizational units (Gibson & Gibbs). Cultural
diversity is defined by the degree to which an individual works with people from diverse
cultural backgrounds (Chudoba et al.). Given the fact that virtuality is a broader and
higher-level concept than its specific instantiations in virtual employees, groups, teams,
or organizations, the present study was not restricted to any specific virtual work

4

arrangement; rather, it focused on virtuality emerging in and across various types of
virtual work arrangements.
Compared with traditional organizations, individuals who work in virtual work
environments may experience difficulty in becoming familiar with one another. As a
result, knowing what other members know is a challenge for individuals who work in
virtual work environments. One of the advantages of using virtual work arrangements
(particularly, virtual teams) is that they are comprised of individuals with diverse
expertise. However, individuals may not be able to take advantage of the benefits of
virtual work arrangements if they are not aware of their coworkers’ expertise. It is the
active use of such diverse expertise that provides desirable benefits. Given that virtual
work arrangements are often distributed across space, time, and culture, individuals will
require an active communication network. For the benefits of diversity in virtual work
arrangements to be realized, a requisite condition is the presence of transactive memory
system (TMS), that is, “a set of individual memory systems in combination with the
communication that takes place between individuals” (Wegner, 1987, p. 186). TMS
theory suggests that knowing “who knows what” (Monge & Contractor, 2003, p. 198)
influences how effectively people utilize others’ expertise (Wegner). TMS forms when
people become cognizant of others’ knowledge, expertise, and skills, and it develops
more fully as individuals learn about one another. Such “expertise recognition” (Garner,
2006) is one of the most important antecedents for effective knowledge-sharing, which
ultimately leads to better group performance (Hollingshead, 2000). Regarding
information processing, Hollingshead has defined TMS as “the specialized division of
labor with respect to the encoding, storage, and retrieval of information” (p. 258). Each

5

individual has his or her own knowledge and skills, and TMS development depends on
how specialized that knowledge is (Moreland & Myaskovsky, 2000). Organizational
members who work in virtual work arrangements cannot attempt to utilize one another’s
expertise and knowledge if they do not know who knows what. The presence of a welldeveloped TMS is considered a necessary condition for distributed teams to perform
successfully.
Why do transactive memory systems matter in organizations? The answer can
easily be found in situations in which organizations want their members to make the best
use of other members’ expertise and skills for tasks, rather than learn these on their own
de novo. Previous studies (Moreland, 1999; Moreland & Myaskovsky, 2000) have
implied that each team member does not necessarily need to learn all necessary skills and
expertise, because they can exchange knowledge with one other. The existence of a welldeveloped TMS may indicate optimal knowledge-sharing in an organization.
This study has several goals. First, it aims to better understand the development of
expertise recognition—the key element of TMS—using communication networks.
Although pertinent studies tend to view TMS in terms of significantly improving
organizational performance—for example, in terms of increased knowledge sharing
(Argote & Ingram, 2000; Rulke, Zaheer, & Anderson, 2000)—little is known about how
communication is associated with perceptions of expertise. Virtual work arrangements
can make TMS development particularly difficult. It is reasonable to speculate that some
of the challenges faced by organizational members who work in virtual work
environments may also affect TMS development negatively. However, this study rests on
the premise that communication plays a key role in moderating the effects of

6

discontinuities on virtuality. For example, establishing a psychologically-safe
communication climate—in which individuals can say what they think and identify
potential problems in the organization—may help to mitigate the negative effect of
virtuality on innovation (Gibson & Gibbs, 2006).
To capture the effects of communication on virtuality, this study sees
communication in terms of networks. Communication networks are defined as “the
regular patterns of person-to-person contacts that we discern as people exchange
information in a human social system” (Monge & Contractor, 1988, p.107). A
knowledge-sharing communication network can capture relationships among individuals
with diverse knowledge, skills, experiences, and expertise (Monge & Contractor, 2003).
Provided that communication networks represent actual communication reasonably well,
I argue that the negative relationship between virtuality and TMS may be attenuated by
two of the main features of emergent knowledge-sharing communication networks:
network closure and network diversity. Network closure refers to the extent to which
individuals create more cohesive relationships (Coleman, 1988), whereas network
diversity reflects the extent to which individuals have more efficient access to
information resources (Burt, 1992). In the context of knowledge-sharing communication
networks, network diversity reflects the degree of nonredundant communication ties for
knowledge-sharing and network closure reflects the degree of clustering/embeddedness
in a communication network.
Second, this study examines TMS in virtual work arrangements. Previous studies
have examined TMS in various contexts, including AM radio assembly in an
experimental setting (Moreland, Argote, & Krishnan, 1996), interpersonal relationships

7

(Hollingshead, 1998a; 1998b), and actual organizational sites (Palazzolo, 2005; Yuan,
Fulk, & Monge, 2007; Yuan, Fulk, Monge, & Contractor, 2010). However, existing TMS
studies have not explicitly considered how virtuality may affect TMS formation and
development. Virtual work arrangements present opportunities to examine interactions
which are not limited to face-to-face interaction within certain physical places, but rather,
take place in virtual environments. This study investigates the relationship between
virtuality and TMS in the context of virtual work arrangements.
This study also examines the specific network configurations (e.g., transitivity)
that result from patterns of interaction among organizational members who are
geographically dispersed. Predicated on the notion that an entire communication network
is the product of each of the specific network configurations that it contains, this study
examines the emergence of specific patterns of interaction in a communication network.
To that end, I investigate whether TMS produces specific patterns of interaction.
In sum, this study addresses the following questions:


What is the relationship between virtuality and expertise recognition, the key
element of TMS?



How do the properties of an emergent knowledge-sharing communication
network moderate the relationship between virtuality and expertise
recognition?



To what extent does TMS explain the specific interaction patterns that emerge
in a knowledge-sharing communication network?

This dissertation proceeds as follows. I begin by reviewing the literature on TMS. After
discussing the theories that inform my hypotheses and research questions, I describe the

8

methods I used to test those hypotheses. After presenting the results, I conclude by
discussing the theoretical and practical implications of this study.

Chapter 2. Literature Review
Transactive Memory Systems as a Pre-Condition of Knowledge-Sharing
When TMS is well-developed among individuals in an organization, knowledgesharing flourishes. TMS, which is a pre-condition of knowledge-sharing in organizations
(Hollingshead & Brandon, 2003), is intimately related to what virtual work arrangements
aim to achieve: diverse sources of information, knowledge, and expertise. For virtual
work arrangements to achieve these benefits, a relevant condition should be met: the
presence of a well-developed TMS. If there is a well-functioning TMS in an organization,
then this means that its members possess differentiated knowledge (i.e., expertise), trust
one another’s expertise, and can effectively coordinate their expertise. Once
organizational members have developed TMS, the cognitive burden on each individual is
reduced, providing them with access to diverse sources of information (Monge &
Contractor, 2003).
In particular, TMS is relevant to understanding how knowledge is shared in an
organizational setting. It is important for organizational members to recognize one
another’s expertise so that they can successfully complete their own tasks, but
recognizing that expertise can be difficult (Garner, 2006). TMS theory has been
employed widely as an instrumental theoretical framework to explain knowledge- and
resource-management, including knowledge-sharing. Wegner’s concept of TMS has its
origins in information-processing theory (Wegner, 1987). It is beneficial to know
Wegner’s earlier conceptualization of TMS. Following his categorization of memory, I
will discuss individual memory, external memory, and transactive memory.

10

Individual memory. According to Wegner (1987), individual memory is shaped
and developed as individuals encode, store, and retrieve information. When individuals
encounter new information, they categorize and label it (“encoding”). For example, an
object lily could be encoded with the smell sweet. Even if someone has encoded an event
that he or she experienced, he or she may have difficulty in retrieving information related
to that event. Effective retrieval requires that information be stored in an organized
manner (Kim, 2010). Thus, Wegner emphasizes the importance of metamemory, that is,
an individual’s ability to recall information about memories, such as the kind of memory
(the senses that were used, the emotions that were at play, etc.) and the richness of the
memory (its duration, the breadth of the details that were stored, etc.).
External memory. As knowledge becomes more specialized and the amount of
information increases exponentially, it is impossible for individuals to learn everything.
No one can memorize all of the information needed to complete certain complex tasks,
and no one wants to. Accordingly, no employer wants employees to be overburdened by
learning too many new skills and memorizing vast quantities of information. Rather than
learn or master it themselves, individuals can store information externally. According to
Wegner (1987), external storage entails identifying the location of the information
whereas internal storage entails knowing the particular items that are stored. In the realm
of external memory, loss of information may ensue if an item’s location is not memorized.
Just as things like USB sticks, notebooks, stickers, organizers, index cards, etc., function
as “external storage,” so too does the cognitive capacity of others.
Transactive memory. While individuals build up their own individual memories,
they also contribute to collective memory, which is stored interdependently. Just as with

11

individuals’ internal memory, transactive memory is formed through the encoding,
storage, and retrieval of information (Wegner, 1987). Transactive memory, however, is
shaped and developed across different people (Lewis, 2003). According to Wegner,
transactive encoding entails decisions about who will store what information, and
transactive retrieval occurs when individuals with different kinds of internal memory
seek out other people’s internal memory.
The TMS concept originated in laboratory studies exploring the extent to which
individuals use their capacity for social cognition to solve a given task by sharing
knowledge with one another (Wegner, 1987). The earliest TMS studies centered on
whether TMS could be possible in dyads: memory (Wegner, Erber, & Raymond, 1991)
and memory tasks (Hollingshead, 1998a; 1998b) in the context of romantic relationships.
However, because these studies were performed in laboratories, they were unable to
address whether TMS could develop in natural (non-laboratory) settings. Moreland (1999)
provided a basis for the transition from interpersonal relationships to larger groups, such
as workgroups and organizations. Liang et al. (1995) demonstrated that subjects who
were trained in groups to complete tasks tended to exhibit higher levels of performance
and to recall more task-related information than those who were trained alone, mainly
because of task differentiation and specialization by those in groups. Moreland argued
that TMS will develop best when group members continue working as a group after
training together and receive continued training as a group. However, as he admitted, this
often is impractical, especially in virtual teams, which are characterized by dynamic
changes in structure (Gibson & Gibbs, 2006). As an alternative to group training,
Moreland suggested that managers inform their groups about each member’s role and

12

expertise. However, this may be an inadequate way to keep abreast of changes in team
members’ performance.
Early TMS studies also centered on the impact of TMS on group performance.
The literature demonstrates that TMS does impact group performance (Liang et al., 1995;
Moreland, 1999). TMS has emerged as a significant concept in organization studies.
TMS has been studied empirically and is theoretically useful for explaining informationsharing (Fulk, Monge, & Hollingshead, 2005; Palazzolo, 2005; Palazzolo, Serb, She, Su,
& Contractor, 2006; Yuan et al., 2010).
There are two emerging streams in recent TMS studies: the social constructivist
approach (Leonardi & Treem, 2012) and stochastic network analysis (Su & Contractor,
2011; Su, Huang, & Contractor, 2010). According to Leonardi and Treem, many studies
have assumed that a TMS is something that can be identified or recognized; in contrast,
Leonardi and Treem stress that expertise is something that can be performed and
constructed. Using an ethnographic approach, Leonardi and Treem found that people
who are spatially isolated from their team members tend not to reveal their actual
expertise as it is; rather, they engage in a strategic presentation of their expertise.
Leonardi and Treem argued that TMS researchers should pay more attention to how
people recognize others’ expertise in distributed contexts and to the factors that play a
role in expertise recognition.
Recent TMS studies in organizational communication have also attempted to
employ stochastic network analysis to explain the formation and development of TMS
(Palazzolo, 2005; Palazzolo et al., 2006). Using the p* model, Palazzolo found that a
variety of forms of interaction in dyads, triads, and larger groups may be reflected in

13

information-sharing. Extending the use of stochastic network analysis (e.g., exponential
random graph modeling (ERGM)), Su et al. (2010) found that if person i retrieves
information from person j, then i is likely to forward unsolicited information to j, and if
person i retrieves information from person j, then j will tend to forward some information
to i. Expertise recognition, a key aspect of TMS, is associated with information-seeking
behaviors (Su & Contractor, 2011). These ERGM-driven studies revealed that TMS plays
a key role in producing certain patterns of knowledge-sharing.
Mutual knowledge. To clarify the factors that affect TMS, this study
distinguishes between TMS and several similar concepts to explain shared mental
activities among coworkers. First, TMS is not domain-specific knowledge that may be
used for a specific task (e.g., financial analysis, computer programming, etc.), but rather
may be thought of as a shared mental model of individuals’ tasks. According to Senge
(1990), mental models are defined as “deeply ingrained assumptions, generalizations,
pictures, or images that influence how we understand the world and how we take action”
(p. 8). Shared mental models occur when individuals understand a given task in a similar
way (Blickensderfer, Cannon-Bower, & Sales, 1997). Yet, in most situations, Senge has
argued that coworkers tend to be unaware that they share a mental model and are thus
unaware that it affects their behavior (Senge).
There is also a distinction between knowledge transfer and TMS. Knowledge
transfer reflects actual behaviors—the exchange of knowledge between people—whereas
TMS centers on perceptions of, for example, what others are doing and how well they are
performing. TMS is unique because it depends on specific situations where individuals
are involved in a given task. TMS does not reflect individual group members’ domain-

14

specific knowledge, but rather a team’s shared mental model of what is occurring among
team members as they complete a task. Mutual knowledge is created when individuals
share what they know with one another and know that they share it (Krauss & Fussell,
1990). Although the presence of mutual knowledge helps virtual collaborators to develop
and maintain TMS, mutual knowledge in itself does not constitute TMS.
Cognitive interdependence. Wegner, Giuliano, and Hertel (1985) have viewed
TMS as a mechanism for distributing cognition across individuals. Wegner et al. did not
directly consider other factors that may influence how people form TMS; however, they
helped to conceptualize TMS in a way that is crucial to better understanding how
individuals use one another’s cognitive capacity. Distributed team members may suffer
from lack of mutual knowledge among team members (Cramton, 2001). But an increase
in mutual knowledge can increase cognitive interdependence.
Cognitive factors significantly influence the development of TMS (Brandon &
Hollingshead, 2004). Hollingshead (2001) has incorporated two important factors into
TMS theory: cognitive interdependence and convergent expectations. Cognitive
interdependence occurs when individuals must pool their knowledge in order to be
successful in a given task. Individuals with differentiated knowledge will only become
cognitively interdependent if they have convergent expectations of one another. As
Hollingshead has pointed out, “the extent to which group members share expectations
about one another’s knowledge affects how they tacitly coordinate who will learn what”
(p. 1082). Cognitive interdependence is essential for TMS development.
It is important to know that cognitive interdependence among individuals occurs
in the context of a given situation, such as whether people are working in virtual work

15

arrangements, affects TMS development. Regarding virtual work arrangements, one
should consider that cognitive interdependence may be influenced by virtuality. For
example, it may be difficult for team members who are separated by various well-defined
boundaries (e.g., geographic, cultural, or functional boundaries) to achieve cognitive
interdependence, thus making it difficult for them to establish TMS, whereas a team with
more porous boundaries may develop TMS relatively easily and achieve higher levels of
cognitive interdependence. It also should be noted that cognitive interdependence in
virtual work environments may be affected by in-group dynamics—stemming from, for
example, a shared cultural identity.
Dimensions of TMS
There are divergent views on what specifically constitutes TMS. Wegner (1995)
has argued that TMS depends on three processes: “directory updating”, “retrieval
coordination”, and “information allocation”. Directory updating refers to a process by
which individuals update their knowledge of other people’s skills and expertise. Retrieval
coordination is a process by which people coordinate for effective retrieval of
information they need to use. Information allocation occurs when individuals distribute
information to those who appear to be the best stores for its future use.
Moreland (1999) has categorized different TMS in terms of the differentiation of
each member’s expertise or knowledge (i.e., specialization), the reliability of members’
awareness of others’ expertise or knowledge (i.e., credibility), and the effectiveness of
members’ coordination of knowledge and expertise (i.e., coordination). Pointing out that
there is a tendency to equate these manifestations of TMS with one or more of its
components, Lewis and Herdon (2011) have argued that when specialization, credibility,

16

and coordination are manifest, then a TMS is assumed to exist. Conversely, if there is a
well-developed TMS in a team, then this means that team members possess specialized
knowledge, trust other members’ expertise, and are able to integrate their knowledge,
skills, and expertise.
More recent TMS studies have used different terms to describe the same concepts
(Kanawattanachai & Yoo, 2007; Yoo & Kanawattanachai, 2001). In Kanawattanachai
and Yoo’s study, credibility and coordination were operationalized as cognition-based
trust and task-knowledge coordination, respectively. Moreland himself later defined
specialization in terms of the complexity of the knowledge that each group member
possesses. Specialization refers to the extent to which individuals possess differentiated
knowledge or expertise (Liang et al., 1995; Moreland & Myaskovsky, 2000). Lewis
(2003) claimed that a well-established TMS results in more differentiated and specialized
knowledge or expertise, because as members become accustomed to relying on others’
knowledge, they gain confidence in developing knowledge that does not overlap.
Brandon and Hollingshead (2004) have argued that the notion of task
representation/coordination—or “who does what” and “who knows who does what”
(Monge & Contractor, 2003, p. 198) —is an important element of TMS. As
organizational members perform their roles and tasks, the important thing that initially
emerges is not their expertise, but their perceptions of who performs what and their
ability to coordinate their performance. Credibility has been defined as people’s
perceptions of the reliability of other members’ knowledge and expertise (Moreland &
Myaskovsky, 2000). In order to gain reliable knowledge from one another, team
members must have a sufficient level of trust in each other’s expertise (Weick & Roberts,

17

1993). What is important for credibility is not only team members’ beliefs about one
another’s knowledge but also their beliefs about how reliably other team members can
execute a given task (Kanawattanachai & Yoo, 2007).
Lewis, Belliveau, Herndon, and Keller (2007) distinguish the existence of TMS
from the existence of the components that usually constitute TMS. Although people tend
to equate what Moreland identified as manifestations of TMS with what they call the
components of TMS, these two things cannot be the same. According to Lewis et al.,
specialization, credibility, and coordination are present when a TMS is functioning and,
thus, indicate that a TMS exists, but they cannot be mapped onto the process by which a
TMS operates. Further, Lewis et al. have suggested that the components of TMS be
understood in terms of structures and processes. They define the structure of TMS as “a
representation of members’ shared understanding of which member possesses, and is
responsible for, what knowledge” (p. 162). It seems that TMS structure is more closely
related to the three factors that Moreland identified (i.e., specialization, credibility, and
coordination) than to the processes that Wegner claimed constituted TMS (i.e., “directory
updating”, “information allocation”, and “retrieval coordination”). Lewis et al. have
defined TMS processes as “the set of transactive processes that occur as a group encodes,
stores, or retrieves information relevant to the group or [the] group’s task” (p. 162).
These processes focus more on the behavioral aspects of TMS, such as the extent to
which people allocate information to others who they believe can store it, and the extent
to which that information can be retrieved when it becomes necessary to use it. Thus, the
TMS processes are related to Wegner’s understanding of how TMS operates.

18

Although there are diverging views on how to conceptualize TMS (a latent
variable-based approach vs. a TMS process-focused approach), both approaches have one
thing in common: expertise recognition. Regardless of whether one focuses on processes
(Austin, 2003; Wegner, 1995) or on specialization, coordination, and credibility
(Kanawattanachai & Yoo, 2007; Lewis, 2003; Moreland, 1999), expertise recognition—
the underlying premise of TMS—is assumed to be at play. In order for individuals to
develop expertise (i.e., differentiated knowledge or specialization), be capable of
integrating their knowledge and expertise with that of others (coordination), and trust the
reliability of others’ expertise (credibility), they must first recognize others’ expertise.
Borgatti and Cross (2003) reported that information-seeking behaviors are positively
associated with (a) “knowing what another person knows,” (b) “valuing what that other
person knows in relation to one’s work,” and (c) “ being able to gain timely access to that
person’s thinking” (p. 440). Additionally, from Wegner’s point of view (1995), it is
possible to argue that directory updating precedes information allocation and retrieval,
and what is updated is an individual’s perception of others’ expertise.
In sum, expertise recognition rests on the notion that collaborators can only use
others’ expertise if they know who knows what (Wegner, 1987). Expertise recognition
can be defined as the extent to which individuals recognize who in their team knows what
(Monge & Contractor, 2003). Individuals use other collaborators as repositories for
necessary information, knowledge, or any other resources outside of their own
knowledge base (Wegner). Rather than becoming experts themselves, individuals can
find and use others’ expertise. But to do so, they must be aware of who knows what. In

19

organizations, expertise recognition plays a key role in predicting individuals’
information-seeking behaviors.

Chapter 3. Transactive Memory Systems and Virtuality
Virtuality, Discontinuities, and TMS
According to Chudoba et al. (2005), virtuality is characterized by discontinuities
that are widely seen as posing difficulties, such as with communication, conflict
management, and the maintenance of social interactions across time, space, and/or
organizational entities. Discontinuities are defined as “gaps or a lack of coherence in
aspects of work” (Watson-Manheim, Chudoba, & Crowston, 2002, p. 194). Examples of
discontinuities include temporal and spatial separation between virtual work processes
(Chudoba et al.). Discontinuities can also occur when coworkers come from different
cultural backgrounds (Chudoba et al.).
As Gibbs, Nekrassova, Grushina, & Abdul Wahab (2008) have pointed out, early
laboratory-based studies tended to portray virtuality as a dichotomous variable: either 100%
technology-mediated or 100% face-to-face (FtF). However, more recent studies view
virtuality along a continuum from purely virtual to completely FtF (Griffith, Sawyer, &
Neale, 2003); that is, what matters is the degree of levels of virtuality in a specific work
arrangement (e.g., virtual workers or virtual teams) rather than being purely
technologically mediated or completely collocated. Griffith et al. proposed three
dimensions of virtuality: the percentage of time spent working across spatial and
temporal discontinuities, the amount of physical separation between workers, and the
degree of technological mediation.
Chudoba et al. (2005) has extended the definition of virtuality to include three
dimensions: team distribution, workplace mobility, and variety of work practices. Team
distribution refers to the degree to which coworkers operate across different time zone

21

and locations. Workplace mobility refers to the degree to which they operate in multiple
workplaces. Finally, variety of practices refers to the degree to which coworkers are
culturally diverse and engage in a variety of work processes.
Kirkman and Mathieu (2005) have proposed a somewhat different threedimensional model of virtuality that includes (a) the degree to which individuals use
virtual technologies for their communication and tasks, (b) the informational value
achieved by using virtual tools, and (c) the degree to which interactions are synchronous.
Because collocated teams might actually exhibit higher levels of virtuality than
distributed teams, Kirkman and Mathieu chose to deemphasize the importance of
geographical dispersion in their definition of virtuality.
Virtuality enables virtual workers to span the boundaries of space, time, and
organizations. Griffith and Neale (2001) have stated that the basic reason why
organizations implement virtual work arrangements is to benefit from diverse sources of
expertise and resources, connecting people across teams, organizations, and countries (cf.
Chudoba et al., 2005). Moreover, virtuality is also thought to reduce redundancies in
expertise. One of the advantages of virtual work arrangements, spanning boundaries,
reflects the importance of weak ties. Granovetter (1973) has argued that weak ties are
sometimes beneficial because weak ties may increase access to more nonredundant
sources of information. On the other hand, the boundaries of space, time, and
organizations may weaken cohesion. Scott and Timmerman (1999) have pointed out that
advanced communication technologies are a double-edged sword: they eliminate spatial
barriers to collaboration, providing workers with freedom and flexibility, but they
distance them from their organizations.

22

Work within virtual organizations is often disconnected or lacking coherence
(Chudoba et al., 2005). Virtual organizations in which members show cohesion in their
work arrangements are “continuous,” whereas those whose members lack cohesion are
“discontinuous.” For example, discontinuities may occur during trust development.
Compared with those who communicate FtF, those who belong to a virtual organization
may have more difficulty trusting their coworkers. Discontinuities in virtual
organizations may delay or even hamper the development of trust. In this vein, virtuality
may make it difficult to develop TMS.
There are two reasons why expertise recognition and, further, overall TMS
formation is likely to be negatively affected by virtuality. First, geographic dispersion
makes it difficult to attain mutual knowledge, which in turn makes it difficult to form
TMS (Cramton, 2001; Thompson & Coovert, 2003). Technological mediation offers
diminished social and contextual cues. To perform effectively, it is crucial that
organizations develop mutual knowledge (Cramton). However, compared to collocated
workers, geographically distributed team members may experience some difficulty in
obtaining direct knowledge from one another (Driskell, Radtke, & Salas, 2003).
Second, virtuality may hamper the development of TMS if distributed
collaborators lack a shared understanding of their tasks and the way that other
collaborators work. For example, person i may feel that there is an issue with the way
person j shares what he or she knows. Simultaneously, j may think that the way he or she
shares knowledge with i works well. Such disparity in understanding one another’s way
of operating may be more likely to occur in virtual work arrangements.

23

In sum, this study is predicated on the notion that TMS can thrive only under
certain conditions, including effective communication, warm social relationships, and
acceptance of cultural differences. Virtuality decreases individuals’ shared understanding
of a given task (Watson-Manheim et al., 2002). Shared understanding of tasks and others’
expertise are crucial features of TMS. The following subsections discuss how each
element of virtuality affects TMS by fostering (or inhibiting) discontinuities.
Geographic dispersion. In contrast with physically collocated work
arrangements, individuals in virtual work arrangements are dispersed across various
locations and time zones (Gibbs et al., 2008). Geographic dispersion needs to be
discussed in terms of its impact on performance and relationship-building. The distance
between people affects how they interact with each other. Collocated interactions offer
individuals rapid, often nonverbal, feedback about what is on one another’s mind, which
can help resolve misunderstandings or disagreements, or possibly prevent them from
occurring (Olson & Olson, 2000). Geographically dispersed collaborators lack the
advantages that collocated workers can enjoy. Increased physical distance has been
linked to reduced attention and effort among workers (Kiesler & Cummings, 2002).
Further, geographically dispersed members may experience more difficulty in forming
shared mental models, which are essential for a well-functioning team.
Because geographically dispersed collaborators tend to have less frequent
communication than collocated workers, virtuality is likely to impede the three main
processes of TMS (directory updating, information allocation, and retrieval coordination).
Specifically, geographic dispersion often requires that coworkers spend more time and
effort to be aware of one another’s expertise and tasks. Likewise, they may be unable to

24

retrieve relevant information from others when necessary. If locating, storing, and
retrieving information cannot occur seamlessly, virtual workers may feel less confident in
relying on one another’s expertise, becoming less interdependent. As a result, they may
not have a mutually shared understanding of one another’s expertise. In addition, they
may not be able to keep track of the specific tasks that each team member is working on.
The above discussion suggests the following hypothesis:
Hypothesis 1: Geographic dispersion is negatively related to expertise
recognition in virtual work arrangements.
Dynamic structure. According to Gibson and Gibbs (2006), dynamic structure of
virtual collaboration is a main aspect of virtuality. This dynamism seems to contradict
what Moreland (1999) regarded as the ideal situation for TMS, in which team members
train together and continue to work together as one team. However, virtual work
arrangements are often structurally dynamic due to frequent changes in the composition
of organization members and their task-related roles (Brown & Eisenhardt, 1995). As
such, Moreland’s recommendation may not be applicable to virtual work arrangements.
Gibson and Gibbs (2006) have pointed out that dynamically structured
collaborations would bring about more uncertainty to virtual collaborators, weaken their
relationships, and negatively impact team innovation. A compositional change in a team
would inevitably spur instability in an already-established shared mental model and/or
mutual knowledge, making it difficult to learn other people’s expertise and their tasks
(Moreland, 1999). Frequent turnover is harmful to TMS, because it renders obsolete team
members’ awareness of other members’ knowledge and skills (Moreland). Given that
certain levels of cumulative interaction are vital for establishing shared mental models,

25

any compositional changes, especially frequent ones, would likely hinder virtual
collaborators’ ability to establish and sustain shared mental models of their tasks and
relevant contexts surrounding their tasks, making it difficult to learn other works’
expertise and knowledge. In addition, it usually takes time for newcomers to learn the
shared mental models of the incumbent members. Dynamic structure might make it even
more difficult for coworkers to attain a shared mental model. Instability in virtual work
arrangements may reduce organizational members’ motivation to actively collaborate
with one another. As discussed previously, geographic dispersion makes it difficult to
form and sustain individuals’ perceptions of one another’s expertise, but I speculate that
the dynamic nature of structure disrupts perceptions of expertise, making it difficult to
establish or maintain TMS. The above discussion leads to the following hypothesis:
Hypothesis 2: Dynamic structure is negatively related to expertise recognition in
virtual work arrangements.
Electronic dependence. Due to geographic dispersion, individuals who work in
virtual work arrangements often rely more on communication technologies and less on
FtF communication (Shin, 2005). Electronic communication has been framed in two
different ways: either as deficient (the “Cues-Filtered-Out” perspective, Culnan &
Markus, 1987) or not deficient (Social Information Processing Theory and the
Hyperpersonal Communication Perspective, Walther, 1992). Early computer-mediated
communication (CMC) research argued that the lack of nonverbal cues may hamper
effective communication and that using electronic media may limit the amount of social
and nonverbal cues that characterize effective communication (Kiesler, Siegel, &
McGuire, 1984; Sproull & Kiesler, 1986). Electronic dependence makes it more difficult

26

for workers to form cohesive interactions that would help them to establish mutual
knowledge of their task and necessary expertise. Gibson and Gibbs (2006) argued that the
more virtual team members rely on electronic communication, the more difficulties they
will have in exercising subtle control over their interactions with others and interpreting
the knowledge which they process for innovation. Likewise, despite the availability of
synchronous electronic media, CMC may delay feedback among workers, constraining
their ability to learn who knows what and who does what.
However, social information processing (SIP) theory provides a different
perspective on electronic dependence. This theory argues that it is possible to form and
develop productive interpersonal relationships via CMC (Walther, 1992). According to
SIP theory, the only difference between CMC and FtF lies in the initial difference in the
degree of information transfer, not the extent of possible information exchange. Such
differences will be resolved with repeated interactions over time (Walther). There have
been studies that compare the capabilities of CMC and FtF in terms of information
exchange. When team members who use CMC interact with one another for a sufficient
amount of time, they turn out to be just as effective as FtF teams (Chidambaram, 1996;
Wilson, Straus, & McEvily, 2006). Wilson et al. have demonstrated that over time there
is no significant difference between levels of trust in teams that have only FtF contact and
those that are mediated by communication technologies. Virtual groups with CMC
develop similar levels of trust as FtF groups, due to the fact that CMC groups exchange
more messages (Krebs, Hobman, & Bordia, 2006). In sum, according to SIP theory,
CMC does not necessarily inhibit the development of TMS, because virtual group

27

members may use CMC technologies to learn the expertise and know-how of other
members who work in different geographic locations.
There is disagreement as to how electronic communication impacts TMS.
Moreland (1999) has suggested the use of what he called electronic Yellow Pages in
promoting one’s perception of who knows what. He claimed that people can easily access
the information and knowledge necessary to complete their tasks when it is organized
based on well-defined keywords. Hollingshead, Fulk, and Monge (2002) have suggested
that using an intranet makes information more accessible. Digital information repositories
have been highlighted as an effective tool for sharing information and knowledge that
cannot be shared via FtF communication (Hollingshead, 2000; Hollingshead et al., 2002;
Moreland, 1999). The emphasis on such information repositories reflects the fact that
organizations are becoming increasingly more reliant on electronic communication.
However, although online knowledge repositories are widely believed to provide
some advantages, such as speedy and cost-effective access to vast amounts of
information, their presumed benefits to TMS development have yet to be established
empirically. A recent study has revealed that the use of online knowledge repositories
does not boost the accuracy of expertise recognition. Su (2012) found that digital
knowledge repositories (e.g., an intranet) do not have an impact on how accurately team
members recognize one another’s expertise, suggesting that, due to the overwhelming
amount of information that is available in online knowledge repositories, people use
digital knowledge repositories for time- and cost-effectiveness. Su explained that they use
digital knowledge repositories to avoid the social costs inherent in FtF meetings. As a
result, they tend not to pay attention to who authors what on digital repositories, which

28

prevents them from being able to accurately recognize the identity of experts. For online
information repositories to promote TMS, it is crucial to keep relevant information up to
date (Su). Outdated information accumulated in digital knowledge repositories may not
help individuals learn who knows what, and can even discourage them from taking
advantage of such repositories. The aforementioned conflicting theories and results led
me to propose the following research question:
Research question 1: For virtual workers, what is the relationship between
electronic dependence and expertise recognition?
Cultural diversity. Cultural diversity may have differing effects in organizations.
On one hand, culturally diverse teams are often expected to exhibit a variety of
innovative perspectives. On the other hand, “thinking differently” may not always yield
positive results. In some cases, the ostensible merits of virtual work arrangements, such
as diversity, might also produce unintended consequences (e.g., disharmony among
members, or conflicting solutions). Cultural diversity—i.e., the extent to which
individuals have different cultural backgrounds (Shin, 2005)—can make it difficult for
workers to communicate with one another. Culturally diverse teams have been found to
yield weak performance in terms of communication, decision making, and conflict
resolution (Thompson, 1999).
Cultural diversity can fragment the flow of communication in a team by
facilitating the formation of subgroups (Cramton, 2001). The existing literature has
shown that the presence of cultural subgroups can fragment communication (Cramton)
and foster conflicts (Mortensen & Hinds, 2001). The logic behind this is that there are
more negative than positive impacts on group performance when cultural homophily

29

generates in-group–out-group dynamics within a geographically distributed team. Due to
the presence of strong subgroups, the emergent communication network may be limited
to the boundaries of a relatively homogenous faction/clan. This may lead to a complete
breakdown in communication, which in turn may result in an underdeveloped TMS.
However, the subgroups created by cultural diversity can be productive (Gibson
& Vermeulen, 2003). In particular, subgroups with moderate strength are conducive to
learning behavior while weak and strong subgroups are negatively related to learning
behavior (Gibson & Vermeulen). Throughout the learning process, a cohesive cultural
subgroup may play the role of a “cohort” (Gibson & Vermeulen). This cohort effect can
be supported by the fact that members within cohesive subgroups interact proactively. In
addition to the positive cohort effect, subgroups may help to preserve diverse ideas within
a dense cluster, which results in larger quantities of information in the overall network
(Fang, Lee, & Schilling, 2010). A medium level of subgroup strength is related to low
levels of conflict in the work process and high levels of performance and morale while
either low or high levels of subgroup strength have a negative impact on these outcomes
(Thatcher, Jehn, & Zanutto, 2003).
With respect to the positive effect of moderate subgroup strength, cultural
diversity may not always make it difficult for team members to obtain and maintain such
a collective understanding of their work. A recent study has shown that pockets of shared
cultural backgrounds can be helpful in fostering awareness of other individuals’ expertise.
Because cultural cues may play a role as heuristics, individuals with similar cultural
backgrounds may be better able to discern one another’s expertise (Yuan, Bazarova, Fulk,
& Zhang, 2013)

30

Interestingly, a meta-analysis has shown that cultural diversity has a nuanced
effect on communication effectiveness (Stahl, Maznevski, Voigt, & Jonsen, 2010): the
effect appears to be negative when assessing cultural diversity with manifest measures
(i.e., race, ethnicity, and nationality), and positive when using latent variables (i.e.,
personality, values, and attitudes). Cultural diversity has been found to hinder the
development of common goals and commitments (in what is termed “convergence”),
while fostering heterogeneous inputs such as different ideas and perspectives (in what is
called “divergence”) (Stahl et al.). These conflicting conclusions about whether cultural
diversity helps or hinders the collective understanding of tasks led me to propose the
following research question:
Research question 2: For virtual workers, what is the relationship between
cultural diversity and expertise recognition?
An Emergent Communication Network Perspective
Though virtual work is characterized by discontinuities, it is also characterized by
continuities. Continuities are “a collective understanding of some aspects of the work
environment” (Watson-Manheim et al., 2002, p. 200), such as “shared motivation,
understanding of the task, [and] mutual expectations” (p. 201). It is legitimate to ask how
such continuities can be achieved and maintained in virtual work arrangements.
Some of the discontinuities that virtual collaborators encounter stem from not
operating in the same physical location, not sharing the same/similar nationality, and not
obtaining a stable organizational structure of membership. Watson-Manheim et al. (2002)
point out that discontinuities are inherent to virtuality. However, virtual workers are
typically required and/or expected to forge communication ties with other members who

31

have different cultural or national backgrounds at a physical distance. That is, the
emergence of communication networks in and/or across virtual work units is inevitable.
Even if this process is not prescribed by the plans of management, it often emerges from
organizational members’ necessities. To better understand the continuities produced by
virtual work arrangements, it is important to understand the role of emergent
communication networks within and/or across teams.
An emergent communication network perspective helps explain why some
continuities can be achieved and sustained. For example, Watson-Manheim et al. (2002)
showed that a shared understanding of tasks is an important indicator of continuities in
virtual networks. It is difficult to think that those in virtual work arrangements would
exhibit such continuities at the start of their relationship. Although management may seek
to impose continuities from above, continuities are mainly achieved and maintained by ad
hoc communication.
As discussed previously, one TMS premise is that individuals can serve as
external information repositories for one another. TMS requires individuals to encode,
store, and retrieve one another’s knowledge and information (Wegner). Whereas
individual memory is basically a cognitive process occurring within individual brains,
transactive memory operates across individuals, with each person acting as external
memory for the others. Thus, without communication, individuals cannot share their
knowledge with others (i.e., transactive encoding), cannot acquire new information from
them (i.e., transactive retrieval) and, subsequently, cannot sustain a transactive memory
system (Hollingshead & Brandon, 2003). Communication enables people to identify
experts and share knowledge and information with one another (Hollingshead &

32

Brandon). Yuan et al. (2010) have analyzed expertise exchange in organizations by
examining the strength of communication ties among individuals. Analyzing data from
individuals belonging to different organizations, Yuan et al. found that as the strength of
individual communication ties increases, individuals will likely exchange expertise, one
of the outcomes of TMS.
Incorporating social network analysis perspectives into communication theory
was made possible by Rogers and Kincaid’s convergence model of communication
(1981). By critiquing the conventional model of communication, which emphasized the
mechanical, unidirectional flow of content, Rogers and Kincaid proposed a convergence
model of human communication that is characterized by “mutual causation” and by an
“interdependent relationship” among communicators. This model shifts the focus of
communication from what is transferred among communicators to what they create and
share. Rogers and Kincaid defined communication as a “process in which the participants
create and share information with one another in order to reach a mutual understanding”
(p. 63). Because communication is a “joint occurrence” and a “mutual process of
information-sharing between two or more persons,” a communication network is
comprised of “interconnected individuals who are linked by patterned flows of
information” (p. 63).
Social network approaches provide a new understanding of emergent
communication networks (Monge & Contractor, 2001; Monge & Eisenberg, 1987).
Stated differently, communication networks reflect “who speaks to whom in a group or
organization” (Feeley & Barnett, 1997, p. 371). Ties between nodes/actors in a given
communication network represent actual communicative behaviors (e.g., individual

33

members have contact with one another, and share the information, skills, and knowledge
necessary for task completion). Because the way in which individuals communicate
directly influences their behavior, studying communication networks adds explanatory
value to their actions in an organizational context—e.g., group connectivity and attitude–
belief uniformity (Danowski, 1980) and organizational commitment (Eisenberg, Monge,
& Miller, 1983).
The literature has shown that the social network approach is one of the relevant
tools for examining how TMS form and evolve in organizational settings (Palazzolo,
2005; Palazzolo et al., 2006). A social network approach can explain how individuals’
communication ties affect information retrieval (Palazzolo). The structural and relational
attributes of teams may account for perceptions of expertise, because communication ties
can be used to depict patterns of interaction among team members.
Network Diversity and Network Closure
In this section, I propose that the two major network perspectives—network
closure (Coleman, 1990) and network diversity (Burt, 1992)—are two mechanisms that
affect expertise recognition and moderate the negative effects of virtuality on expertise
recognition. In particular, I base this argument on Reagans and McEvily’s (2003)
findings that network cohesion and diversity can work together to promote knowledge
transfer. In this section, I review their work and related studies.
Social cohesion and structural holes can benefit social networks (Burt, 1992;
Coleman, 1990). A network closure perspective (Coleman) suggests that network closure,
which is defined by the presence of cohesive strong ties, benefits social networks.
Arguably, cohesion is an indicator of continuity. Similarly, the lack of cohesion indicates

34

the existence of organizational discontinuities. Group cohesion is associated with strong
ties (Wasserman & Faust, 1994). However, a structural holes perspective (Burt) holds
that network benefits can be realized through access to nonredundant information ties.
Network closure is defined as the degree to which people in relationships are
connected by “mutual third parties” (Coleman, 1988; 1990). The network closure
perspective highlights people’s relationships in terms of multiple third-party relationships
rather than purely dyadic relationships. According to Coleman, the more closely tied
people are in a network, the more they will be required to honor obligations and social
norms, which ultimately increases mutual trust. Coleman has emphasized the emergence
of normative environments where people are, voluntarily or involuntarily, expected to
show some level of commitment to one another. Contrastingly, diversity reflects the
extent to which individuals have access to diverse information resources (Burt, 1992).
The benefits of diversity are facilitated not only by weak ties (Granovetter, 1973) but also
by structural holes (Burt). Diverse and nonredundant communication ties promote a sense
of which other members have specialized knowledge and expertise. According to Burt,
the benefits of social networks may result from increased access to diverse sources of
information via brokers, who span otherwise disconnected network clusters and thus have
more information and resources at their disposal.
A cohesive network provides trust and cooperation among closely-tied people,
while a network that includes more structural holes provides access to more diverse
sources of information (Podolny & Baron, 1997). Reagans & McEvily (2003) showed
that social cohesion, measured by network density, and network diversity, measured by
network range, can both facilitate knowledge transfer. Based on the above discussion,

35

this study argues that the development of expertise recognition should be understood in
terms of two seemingly conflicting, yet not mutually exclusive, factors: network closure
and network diversity. This is because these network effects have a different advantage in
fostering expertise recognition. Such a synergistic effect has been examined in the
context of knowledge-sharing (Reagans & McEvily). Network diversity and network
closure are likely to attenuate the possible negative effects of virtuality on expertise
recognition. This study argues that both network diversity and network closure increase
the level of continuity in virtual work arrangements, albeit in different ways: network
closure can promote cohesion by increasing connections, and network diversity can
reduce discontinuities by spanning the boundaries between distinct networks. As
discussed previously, virtuality is characterized by multiple discontinuities that are
thought to hamper TMS. The existence of boundaries presents virtual team members with
challenges such as gaps in their work (Watson-Manheim et al., 2002). However, if
individuals do not feel that such boundaries hinder their ability to determine who knows
what, then these boundaries may not in themselves be an obstacle for the development of
TMS (Chudoba & Watson-Manheim, 2008).
Whereas transactive memory can be an individual cognitive capability, TMS
exists and operates among individuals (Lewis, 2003). Reflecting this, TMS can be best
understood in light of a network. I would argue that TMS can be a perceived network
formed and shaped in team members’ minds reflecting their perceptions of who knows
what and “who knows who knows what” (Monge & Contractor, 2003, p. 198). For
example, TMS is very similar to a network that includes possibly many nonredundant
contacts/information sources (i.e., structural holes) and more cohesive clusters.

36

(Individuals who are embedded are more likely to perceive “who knows what” and “who
does what” in Figure 2 than in Figure 1.) Although it may sound too prescriptive,
expertise recognition can be better developed in a network that includes possibly many
structural holes (i.e., more diverse communication ties) and, simultaneously, more
cohesive clusters.
INSERT FIGURE 1 AND FIGURE 2 ABOUT HERE
Network diversity. From the emergent communication network perspective,
information does not always flow along formal organizational channels (Krackhardt &
Hanson, 1993). Communication networks emerge as individuals share information with
one another, regardless of whether they are connected according to a formal
organizational structure (Monge & Eisenberg, 1987). If, despite being dispersed
geographically and connected electronically, virtual collaborators are able to develop and
maintain communication ties within and/or across their work unit, they may be able to
use informal networks to bridge the discontinuities in virtual work arrangements.
Network diversity, defined as the degree of nonredundant ties among individuals,
can bridge the gaps created by various boundaries inherent in virtual work arrangements.
Such gaps created by boundaries may be bridged through the emergence of
communication networks among virtual team members. Larger numbers of nonredundant
communication ties, conceptualized as increased network diversity, increase access to
information about what other people are working on and, furthermore, to information
about which of these people might possess relevant expertise.
Structural holes theory (Burt, 1992) provides a relevant theoretical framework
regarding the benefits of diverse and nonredundant ties: individuals whose network spans

37

structural holes benefit from an increased flow of information. By linking individuals to
others’ work without being directly connected to their activities, structural holes grant
virtual coworkers access to diverse sources of information. Structural holes present
opportunities for brokering the flow of information among individuals. Those who broker
information between different units have enhanced access to other people’s knowledge
and expertise. They tend to be promoted sooner than workers with less-diverse ties (Burt).
The more an individual’s workgroup spans structural holes, the more likely he or she can
broker the flow of information within the organization (Burt, 2000). Spanning structural
holes has been shown to impact team performance within the context of organizations.
For example, it can help teams to more efficiently coordinate information, which can lead
to more effective solutions to organizational problems (Powell, Koput, & Smith-Doerr,
1996). Organizational units differ in their “absorptive capacity”—that is, the extent to
which they are capable of assimilating and replicating knowledge obtained from external
sources (Cohen & Levinthal, 1990; Tsai, 2001). Spanning structural holes can increase
absorptive capacity and, by extension, team performance (Burt, 2005). It can also
enhance the diversity of views and ideas within an organization (Balkundi, Kilduff,
Barsness, & Michael, 2007).
Nonredundant ties allow for increased access to many otherwise-unconnected
people and, consequently, to more information (Burt, 1992). In explaining expertise
recognition in virtual work arrangements, nonredundancy of communication ties plays a
significant role. This is because nonredundant knowledge-sharing communication ties
positively influence perceptions of who knows what and who knows who does what.
Virtual workers who develop more nonredundant communication ties make the most of

38

diverse resources and expertise within and across workgroups. It can be speculated that
individuals who have developed and maintained an expansive communication network
are less constrained by the discontinuities inherent to virtuality, compared to those who
have more redundant communication ties.
The extent to which an individual can shape and expand his or her communication
ties directly increases his or her ability to benefit from distributed expertise across
multiple virtual work arrangements. An individual who expands his or her
communication ties across multiple units of his or her organizations such as a team tends
to develop higher levels of recognition of other workers’ expertise and tasks. This is
important for organizations because virtual workers are often unaware of one another’s
working processes (Leinonen, Jarvela, & Hakkinen, 2005). The extent to which a group
is aware of its relationships with other groups is a type of TMS that is distinct from taskoriented transactive memory. Increasing nonredundant communication ties is linked to
greater awareness of external relationships and, as a result, more accurate understanding
of how to take advantage of other people’s knowledge (Austin, 2003). A well-developed
perception of expertise is associated with higher network diversity. The number of
nonredundant ties provides those who operate in virtual work arrangements more chances
to forge boundary-spanning ties. Furthermore, when one forges communication ties with
those who operate in other units of their organization, he or she may benefit their
immediate team as well as their overall organization (Cross & Cummings, 2004). Team
members who are connected to the boundary-spanner gain access to other organizational
units―not necessarily within their own organization―and thus become aware of others’
expertise and experiences without having to toil to span the boundary on their own. By

39

bridging the gaps caused by boundaries, network diversity facilitates virtual team
members’ perceptions of who knows what and who does what. The above discussion
leads to the following hypothesis:
Hypothesis 3: Network diversity is positively related to expertise recognition in
virtual work arrangements.
Network diversity may affect the degree to which individuals experience
discontinuities in their virtual work arrangements. If virtual workers are able to develop
more diverse communication ties, the constraints that are inherent to virtuality can be
overcome; individuals can develop a shared understanding of their goals and complete
their tasks more efficiently. Once virtual collaborators use expanded communication ties
to bridge gaps and span boundaries, they may not perceive objectively existing
discontinuities as obstacles.
As discussed previously, virtual work arrangements inhibit close interactions and
rapid feedback, making it more difficult to get to know coworkers’ expertise. Virtual
work arrangements with high levels of compositional change inevitably produce
instability, making it hard for individuals to form mutual knowledge and a shared mental
model of their work. However, individuals with diverse ties have access to diverse
sources of knowledge, which can compensate for the aforementioned difficulties posed
by virtual work arrangements. Therefore, for those who are able to develop diverse
communication ties with other workers, the discontinuities stemming from geographic
dispersion, dynamic structure, and, possibly, electronic dependence and cultural diversity
may not be as disadvantageous as they might otherwise have been.

40

Considering that there have been conflicting theoretical perspectives and research
findings regarding the relationships between electronic dependence and expertise
recognition and between cultural diversity and expertise recognition, I did not
hypothesize any specific moderating effects between network diversity and electronic
dependence or between network diversity and cultural diversity. However, the same logic
that applies to the moderating effect of network diversity on the associations between
expertise recognition and geographic dispersion and between expertise recognition and
dynamic structure can be applied to these relationships; it is thus speculated that network
diversity would moderate the relationships between expertise recognition and electronic
dependence and between expertise recognition and cultural diversity. The above
discussion leads to the following hypothesis and research question:
Hypothesis 4: Network diversity moderates the negative effects of (a) geographic
dispersion and (b) dynamic structure on expertise recognition.
Research question 3: In virtual work arrangements, does network diversity
moderate the relationship between expertise recognition and (a) electronic
dependence and (b) cultural diversity?
Network closure. A widely accepted indicator for network closure, social
cohesion has been defined not only by the degree to which coworkers develop intense
relationships with one another, but also by the degree to which they maintain overlapping
ties (Coleman, 1990). Unless individuals share adequate levels of cohesion, they may not
share information during their tasks, and thus have difficulty in trusting and relying on
one another’s expertise.

41

Cohesion may facilitate interpersonal interactions. The social network literature
has argued that densely intertwined clusters promote trust and reciprocity among people
and are, thus, conducive to a normative environment that in turn allows for higher levels
of trust in network relationships (Coleman, 1988). Reciprocal relationships among
members represent the degree to which teamwork is solid and stable (Ahuja & Carley,
1999). In networks with higher reciprocity, actors are more likely to get involved in more
communication and are more likely to transfer more information throughout the network.
Thus, the more reciprocally individuals communicate with each other, the more likely it
will be for them to trust one another’s expertise. For a virtual work arrangement to be
successful, members directly or indirectly embedded in a unit must reach out to each
other reciprocally, because they work with interdependent roles and tasks and are
mutually responsible for completing a given task.
Network density reflects the extent to which “individuals are connected to one
another” (Bélanger & Allport, 2008, p. 108). Network density increases coworkers’
awareness of their responsibilities, i.e., role clarity (Meyerson, Weick, & Kramer, 1996).
Wellman (1988) has also suggested that network density enhances social support and
solidarity. An increase in density, which means an increase in interconnection among
team members, may also lead to an increase in the credibility of other members’ team
performance.
The social network literature has illuminated the role of cohesive subgroups in the
formation of networks (Coleman, 1990). Members of a virtual organization may not act
as undifferentiated equals but rather as members of the subgroup to which they belong.
The formation of cohesive subgroups may mainly be driven by homophily. That is,

42

subgroups often are shaped by group members’ demographic attributes (e.g., age, gender,
ethnicity, etc.) as well as by other characteristics (e.g., education, tenure, and position in
their organization) (Cramton & Hinds, 2005). Regarding social cohesion, subgroups have
two conflicting impacts: they weaken cohesion in the overall organization, while
strengthening cohesion within a given subgroup. The presence of strong subgroups
reduces overall cohesion in the organization because subgroups are essentially
fragmentations that develop and exist in the organization. However, while such
fragmentation may constrain access to diverse sources of information, subgroup members
tend to show higher cohesion via more interconnected ties (Uzzi, 1997). Social cohesion
is widely seen as being related to trust (Coleman).
Individuals who are densely clustered are more willing to exchange information
because they tend to have a shared identity and high levels of mutual trust (Ahuja, 2000;
Coleman, 1988). Although members of cohesive subgroups tend to develop cognitivebased trust, there are different impacts of subgroup strength on information flow. The
members of highly cohesive subgroups share a high level of communality, which tends to
isolate them from people and information that are external to their subgroup (Lau &
Murnighan, 1998). However, moderately cohesive subgroups may facilitate positive
learning behaviors (Gibson & Vermeulen, 2003). A medium level of subgroup strength is
related to low levels of conflict in the work process and high levels of performance and
morale, while low and high levels of subgroup strength have a negative impact on these
outcomes (Thatcher et al., 2003). That is, one can see a curvilinear relationship between
subgroup strength and performance-related factors. Subgroup strength may indicate a
positive impact that social cohesion may have on group performance.

43

This study also argues that cohesion increases interaction among team members,
promoting perceived proximity (Wilson, O’Leary, Metiu, & Jett, 2008), which in turn
reduces barriers to becoming aware of who knows what and who knows who does what.
To better explain how network closure plays a role in virtual work arrangements, in this
section I review the implications of perceived proximity. Proximity is one of the
fundamental factors that directly influences the formation and development of ties.
Proximity facilitates interpersonal interactions and, thus, knowledge sharing (Inkpen &
Tsang, 2005), and it positively influences an individual’s perception of being affiliated
with organizations and communities (Allen, 1977). The closer people are to one another
within a network, the easier it is for them to forge ties. For example, Maskell &
Malmberg (1999) have examined the relationship between tacit knowledge and spatial
proximity: the more tacit knowledge individuals want to share, the closer they must be to
one another.
But proximity is a multifaceted concept. It is not enough to ask whether team
members are physically proximate. In certain contexts, perceived proximity plays a more
significant role than physical proximity; thus, each type of proximity may be more or less
salient in a given situation. In virtual work arrangements, individuals are by definition
geographically dispersed. Perceived proximity has emerged as a concept useful in
understanding the relationship between discontinuities and continuities. It is becoming
more important to know how group members perceive their closeness to other team
members (Wilson et al., 2008). A virtual organization’s members may perceive one
another as being close, regardless of physical distance. What is important is not the actual
physical distance that separates them but their perception of relational or social distance.

44

People’s perception of proximity may be influenced by the degree to which they interact
with each other.
As reviewed in the previous section, individuals in virtual work arrangements are
physically dispersed across different worksites. Physical distance may weaken
individuals’ identification with their team and result in greater levels of conflict (O’Leary
& Mortensen, 2010). Individuals who communicate with one another less frequently tend
to feel more physically distant from one another (Allen, 1977). Contrastingly, however, it
is possible to say that more frequent communication between individuals increases their
sense of closeness (Cross & Borgatti, 2000). Perceived proximity often results not from
physical co-presence but from a high frequency interactions; as a result, team members’
perceptions of distance are not perfectly correlated with actual distance (Wilson et al.,
2008). For example, two members may be on opposite sides of the world, but they may
be able to develop a higher level of perceived proximity if they establish and maintain
frequent, consistent, and intense communicative ties. This speculation is consistent with
literature suggesting that when people perceive their partners as being proximate, they
tend to have more contact with one another and communicate more frequently (Festinger,
Schachter, & Back, 1950). The literature on organizational commitment explores the
implications of “cognitive distance”, which has been defined as “the degree of cognitive
immediacy and salience that the employee associates with an organizational unit”
(Mueller & Lawler, 1999, p. 327). An increase in communicative interactions will
increase “the cognitive salience of the other” and the degree of “envisioning the other’s
context,” while decreasing “uncertainty regarding the other” (Wilson et al., 2008, p. 985).

45

It is speculated that higher levels of network closure may increase perceived proximity,
which in turn promotes expertise recognition. This leads to the following hypothesis:
Hypothesis 5: Network closure is positively related to expertise recognition in
virtual work arrangements.
Network closure that brings about an increased level of cohesion may affect the
degree to which individuals experience the geographic, cultural, and structural
discontinuities posed by virtuality. As discussed previously, virtuality is associated with
gaps and a lack of coherence in individuals’ tasks. Although these discontinuities can
make it difficult to know others’ expertise, network closure may moderate such
difficulties by promoting perceived proximity and a sense of cohesion among individuals.
For example, it is important to see that physical distance itself may not always be
detrimental to virtual work arrangements because increased communicative interactions
may cause team members to perceive one another as being close, thus offsetting many of
the negative outcomes associated with virtuality. This logic is consistent with a previous
study (Wilson et al., 2008), in which coworkers’ perceived proximity was affected by the
degree to which they interacted with one another via CMC or FtF. As such, those who
work in virtual work arrangements may feel little, if any, difficulty interacting with other
members if they maintain adequate levels of communication, regardless of their physical
distance from one another.
Cohesive communicative and knowledge-sharing ties can amplify perceived
proximity within a virtual work arrangement, which may in turn moderate the negative
effects of geographic dispersion and compositional instability on expertise recognition.
By the same logic that applies to the moderating effect of network closure on the

46

relationships between expertise recognition and geographic dispersion and between
expertise recognition and dynamic structure, it is speculated that network closure also
may moderate the relationships between expertise recognition and electronic dependence
and between expertise recognition and cultural diversity. The above discussion leads to
the following hypothesis and research question:
Hypothesis 6: Network closure moderates the negative effects of (a) geographic
dispersion and (b) dynamic structure on expertise recognition.
Research question 4: In virtual work arrangements, does network closure
moderate the relationship between expertise recognition and (a) electronic
dependence and (b) cultural diversity?

Expertise Recognition and Multiple Ties
The previous sections investigated how the major elements of virtuality affect
expertise recognition, and how those relationships can change when taking into account
the network features of a communication network. That was an effort to understand TMS
in relation to virtuality. At the same time, I discussed the importance of communication
ties in developing TMS. In this section, the focus now is on the relationships that the
main component of TMS, expertise recognition, has with the other two components of
TMS (information retrieval/knowledge seeking in this study and information allocation).
This effort is expected to broaden our understanding of how a communication network
emerges and of how expertise recognition causes multiple knowledge-sharing
communication ties to form. Communication-network ties, which are captured in network
configurations (e.g., reciprocity, in-stars, or out-stars), reflect interactions among team

47

members. This section, which examines the ways in which specific patterns of interaction
emerge across individuals connected by multiple ties, is based on the notion that specific
network configurations result from patterns of interaction that occur among
geographically-dispersed individuals.
Although there are many reasons why it might be important to understand
emergent communication networks in organizational settings, little research has
examined exactly how communication networks are emergent. The meaning or
implication of being emergent has largely been discussed in terms of a discrepancy
between a formal organizational structure prescribed by management and an informal
network structure (Aldrich, 1976; Aldrich, 1982; Heald, Contractor, Koehly, &
Wasserman, 1998); that is, the formal structure visualized as a chart may be inconsistent
with the actual way that people communicate with one another. However, this
conventional perspective on the emergence of communication networks may not fully
explain the fact that an entire communication network is a function of each specific
network configuration that reflects the patterns of communicative interaction. Further,
this perspective cannot explain the mechanism by which these network configurations
form. Contractor, Wasserman, and Faust (2006) have argued that it is necessary to
understand “the emergence of organizational networks” through “modeling the dynamics
through which flexible organizational forms emerge” (p. 682). By investigating the
mechanism of network configurations, this study examines the relationships among the
main elements of TMS.
Within virtual work arrangements, individuals’ perceptions of where expertise is
located shape their knowledge-sharing communication networks. People’s specific

48

patterns of interaction, such as who they interact with, produce specific network
configurations (e.g., choice, reciprocity, cyclicity, transitivity, and/or in-degree popularity)
(Palazzolo, 2005). In organizational settings, such patterns of interaction are guided by
one’s perception of who knows what and who does what. Several studies have
investigated the effects of network configurations on TMS (Palazzolo; Palazzolo et al.,
2006). The present study focuses on how individuals’ perceptions of others’ expertise—
which will be examined across different types of relationships—guides their patterns of
interaction. Perceptions of one another’s expertise are intertwined with other ties that
may be forged during a task (e.g., advice-seeking and knowledge-sharing ties). These
ultimately contribute to the creation of an overall network.
Though it has been some time since Wegner (1995) described three processes that
characterize TMS (directory updating, information allocation, and retrieval coordination),
we have learned relatively little about how these processes are interrelated. Wegner (1987)
stated that a TMS begins to develop as people have knowledge of one another’s expertise.
Expertise recognition is thought of as a guide that directs group members to others who
have the information and expertise that they need. Further, it helps them to evaluate the
usefulness of that information by knowing its source (Moreland, 1999). Su and
Contractor (2011) showed that in an organizational contexts individuals tended to seek
information from a digital repository (their company’s intranet) that they believed to be
relevant and accessible. Further, they found that the consulting company’s workers were
more likely to seek information from their company’s intranet if others with whom they
communicated via telephone, email, or in person also sought information from that digital
knowledge source.

49

Although the TMS literature implicitly assumes that directory updating,
information allocation, and information retrieval are all related to one another through the
mediation of communication, it is not clear what those specific relationships are. An
explanation for the relationships among the three processes of TMS can be found in a
study claiming that communication acts as an opportunity for information allocation and
retrieval (Hollingshead & Brandon, 2003). Communication helps individuals to get a
sense of the context in which information allocation and retrieval takes place. As
discussed previously, directory updating is the process by which one keeps his/her
knowledge of who knows what up to date. Retrieval coordination refers to the process by
which individuals use their directory of others’ expertise to contact those people who
possess relevant knowledge (Wegner, 1987; 1995). The terms, transactional retrieval
(Hollingshead & Brandon) and information retrieval (Monge & Contractor, 2003) have
been derived from retrieval coordination. Since retrieval coordination subsequently leads
to effective retrieval of the information or knowledge that people need to use, this study
focuses on knowledge seeking that occurs as a result of retrieval coordination. Lastly,
information allocation refers to the process by which people transfer information or
knowledge to others who would likely find that information or knowledge to be relevant
(Wegner). Information allocation can occur when a person comes across information or
knowledge that others would be better able to use or store. Palazzolo’s (2005) study
demonstrated that people tend to seek information from people whom they recognize as
having relevant expertise. Such perceptions play a key role in information retrieval.
In relation to the role of expertise recognition, this study emphasizes that an
individual’s perception of other people’s expertise may play a role that is equivalent to

50

that of latent ties. As defined by Haythornthwaite (2002), a latent tie is “a tie for which a
connection is available technically but that has not yet been activated by social
interaction” (p. 389). Haythornthwaite argued that latent ties are not necessarily
established by individuals, but might be established by organizations. For example, an
organization might send an email to several people who do not know one another, or it
might maintain a digital directory of people who are not currently involved in any
activities in their organization, but who are on the organization’s radar. Although
Haythornthwaite viewed the formation of latent ties as the result of organizational
structure (e.g., individuals are enrolled in an organization’s email system), it is also
possible that individuals might themselves form latent ties. This is what Wegner called
directory updating. That is, individuals can develop an awareness of who knows what and
who does what and update these perceptions as they learn new information about these
people and as members enter and leave the organization (Wegner, 1995). Their awareness
of who knows what and who does what may then be activated to become an actual tie.
When seeking advice, it is unlikely that team members contact other people at random. It
is more likely that they will contact team members who they perceive as having relevant
expertise. Based on the above discussion, I argue that expertise recognition precedes
retrieval coordination (in this study, knowledge seeking) and information allocation (or,
in Hollingshead and Brandon’s term, “encoding”). The above discussion leads to the
following hypotheses:
Hypothesis 7. Expertise recognition leads to knowledge seeking.
INSERT FIGURE 4 ABOUT HERE
Hypothesis 8. Expertise recognition leads to information allocation.

51

INSERT FIGURE 5 ABOUT HERE
Transitivity. Supported by balance theory (Heider, 1958), transitivity is an
important network mechanism, explaining how actors form triadic relationships: e.g., my
friend’s friend could become my friend. The concept of transitivity has its origins in
cognitive theory, which explains how people perceive other people’s relationships: e.g., if
person i knows that person j is acquainted with person l and that person l is acquainted
with person k, then i might expect that j and k will become acquainted with one another
(Heider). Ties formed and developed among three parties may generate favorable
outcomes such as friendships, information-sharing, and project collaboration (Louch,
2000). The relationship between transitivity and trust is even observed in social contexts
with low generalized trust (Batjargal, 2007). Batjargal has suggested that transitivity
facilitates interpersonal trust that is formed in investment decisions of venture capitalists
in transitional economies (e.g., China and Russia).
Extending this cognitive balance mechanism to general social relationships, the
literature has shown that people have a tendency to maintain balanced relationships
(Freeman, 1992). Cognitive balance is an underlying cause of transitive triadic
relationships (Monge & Contractor, 2003). People tend to be cognitively balanced in
perceiving others’ relationships (Kilduff & Tsai, 2003). In explaining the difference
between a contagion network perspective and a cognitive consistency perspective, Monge
and Contractor emphasize that the attributes of actors are influenced not by the attributes
of others but by the network configuration of transitive triads.
The tendency to prefer cognitively balanced attitudes towards making
relationships may also pertain to organizational information-sharing. People retrieve

52

information from a third party when their contact person retrieves information from the
third party (Palazzolo, 2005). They prefer balance when one person has relevant expertise
or knowledge that other people possess. A classic example of transitivity shows that
person i may feel uncomfortable when person j—with whom he or she is acquainted—
has a friendship with person k, with whom he or she has yet to be acquainted. Applying
this logic to an organizational setting, it is argued that i may experience unease when he
or she does not have a knowledge-sharing communication tie with k, but j does. Because
of this unease, i may forge a tie with k to balance the flow of information.
It is noteworthy to see that the conventional understanding of transitivity is
predicated on a single type of tie among actors. For example, if i has a knowledgesharing tie with j, and if j has a knowledge-sharing tie with k, then i would likely come to
forge a knowledge-sharing tie with k. In other words, new ties that are created transitively
are assumed to be of the same type as previous ties (in this case, ties for knowledgesharing). Given that individuals are embedded in organizations and develop multiple ties,
the following question captures what a single-tie network analysis lacks: does one type of
a tie lead to the formation of ties of other types?
Multiplex transitivity. It is worth noting that conventional balance theories
explain the formation of transitive ties by focusing on the tendency to maintain cognitive
consistency (Heider, 1958). However, Feld (1981) has argued that the conventional
understanding of transitivity does not adequately explain why people with common
interests (or foci) tend to form ties with one another, which in turn causes other ties to be
formed. Feld explained that the formation of transitive ties depends on the extent and
types of pre-existing foci that define the relationships. Foci have been defined as “any

53

social, psychological, or physical entity around which joint activities of individuals are
organized” (Feld, p. 1025). Foci may include people, places, social positions, social and
personal activities, and groups. If people are focused on common activities, then they will
tend to have similar interactions and sentiments that occur around foci where they form
and in which they engage. Although one might be tempted to define foci in terms of
physical entities such as workplaces, foci are not limited to physical locations. Rather,
foci include anything that might link individuals, such as common interests. For example,
in the context of virtual work arrangements, if an individual perceives that another person
has expertise and knowledge that is useful for completing his or her task, he or she may
forge a tie with that person defined by their focus on completing that particular task. Then,
once these individuals are connected, they may be more likely to form other ties, such as
advice-seeking or collaborative ties.
According to Feld’s perspective on transitivity, an individual who perceives
another person as having a common interest will tend to forge a tie based on that interest,
paving the way for other ties between them. This idea is closely related to the concept of
multiplexity, which refers to the degree to which individuals who interact in one focused
context also interact in another context (Monge & Eisenberg, 1987). By measuring the
number of relationships that two people share, multiplexity captures the multifaceted
nature of their exchange relationship (Ibarra, 1993; Marsden). Individuals’ patterns of
interaction may not be limited to only one type of tie; rather, they may occur across
discrete types of relations (Lee & Monge, 2011). This is congruent with the fact that in
organizational settings, ties that are relevant to one another—such as creative-interaction,
advice-seeking, friendship, and knowledge-sharing ties—often evolve in tandem (Robins

54

& Pattison, 2006; Lee & Lee, 2012). For example, Lee and Lee have shown that if i has a
creative-interaction-seeking tie (measured by generating new ideas) with j, then i is likely
to seek advice from k with whom j has an advice-seeking tie. Given such a tendency, and
further extending the logic of multiplexity to transitivity, it is plausible to speculate that
individuals are more likely to form a transitive relationship that includes multiple types of
ties rather than just a single type of tie. It also is reasoned that if someone perceives
another person as having relevant expertise, this may be a precursor to joint attention
between these people (in Feld’s perspective). That is, based on the individual’s awareness
of the other person’s expertise, he or she may forge a collaborative tie with them. Then,
once a collaborative relationship is formed, the individual may learn more about the other
person’s expertise, which may cause additional ties to form in the future. This leads to
my speculation that if one’s network will likely entail multiple ties, then an individual
will be more likely to form a bivariate transitive relationship between discrete ties (e.g.,
expertise-recognition and knowledge-seeking in this study) via multiple individuals
rather than one individual.
I also argue that the formation of the bivariate transitive relationships between
expertise recognition and knowledge seeking and between expertise recognition and
information allocation would be more likely to occur via an individual’s perceptions of
the expertise of multiple individuals. That is, a bivariate transitive relationship is likely to
form between expertise recognition and knowledge seeking ties via multiple individuals
rather than one individual. In other words, if person i has an accurate perception of the
expertise of persons k, l, and m who are already aware of person j’s expertise, then i
would likely develop a knowledge-seeking tie with j, even if i initially does not retrieve

55

information from j. Likewise, if i has an accurate perception of the expertise of k, l, and m
who are aware of j’s expertise, then i would be likely to develop an informationallocation tie with j, even if i initially does not currently forward information to j. In sum,
expertise recognition is predicted to foster other types of knowledge-sharing ties (e.g.,
information allocation and knowledge seeking as a result of retrieval
coordination/information retrieval). The aforementioned discussion leads to the following
hypotheses:
Hypothesis 9. There is an alternating transitive relationship between expertise
recognition and knowledge-seeking ties: if individuals k, l, and m perceive person
j’s expertise accurately, and if person i has an accurate perception of the
expertise of direct contacts k, l, and m, this will lead to the formation of a
knowledge-seeking tie between i and j.

recognition and information-allocation ties: if individuals k, l, and m perceive

information-allocation tie between i and j.

Chapter 4. Methods
This study’s research design was primarily shaped by a variable analytic approach.
Its main purpose was to examine a series of hypotheses and research questions that were
formulated to test the relationships between virtuality and expertise recognition, between
expertise recognition and knowledge seeking, and between expertise recognition and
information allocation. To investigate these relationships, the first step was to measure
the above concepts based on data obtained through a structured survey questionnaire.
This survey consisted of two parts: one part measured virtuality, while the other part
measured knowledge-seeking and information-allocation networks. The main aspects of
virtuality were measured on a five point scale, and the two network properties (network
diversity and network closure) were calculated from data obtained through namegenerating network questions. As a next step, this study used established statistical
methods—hierarchical multiple regression and bivariate exponential random graph
modeling (ERGM)—to examine the relationships among the variables and concepts.
What follows is a detailed description of the research site, the sample, procedures, and
measures.
Research Site
The data used for this study were collected through a survey of employees in a
U.S.-based company called “BizTech” (a pseudonym). A member of the S&P 500,
BizTech develops computer hardware and computer software, and it provides IT services
and IT consulting across the world. Its business ranges from IT solutions (IT integrated
systems, service oriented architecture, smarter computing, business analytics, business
strategy, e-Commerce consulting, cloud computing, data management, and data

57

warehousing) to products (business analytic tools, collaboration, websphere, IT systems,
and storage). According to its 2012 year-end financial report, BizTech earned over $100
billion in revenue, with roughly $15 billion in net income, and it possesses nearly $125
billion in total assets. The company employs hundreds of thousands of people. As a
global company, BizTech was a reasonable site for studying virtuality.
The focus of this study was on BizTech’s inside sale representatives. Instead of
conventional sales, which are made face-to-face, inside sales representatives mostly use
telephones and web-based communication (Krogue, 2013). Inside sales representatives
use a personalized website to sell BizTech’s brands and services and to interact, via video
or text chat, with their colleagues and with prospective clients. BizTech’s inside sale
representatives represent BizTech’s offering and provide clients with solutions that
incorporate BizTech’s hardware and software, such as servers, networking devices, and
options for offsite data storage (e.g., in the “cloud”). They work on generating and
developing leads (i.e., sparking prospective customers’ interest in BizTech and/or
encouraging existing customers to make additional inquiries into products or services) or
client relations. Inside sales representatives who participated in this study can largely be
categorized into two groups: brand-focused representatives (type A) and client-focused
representatives (type B). The former (type A) identify and manage new business
opportunities through outbound marketing campaigns and inbound web and telephone
inquiries; they promote sales by catching prospective customers’ interest, and/or they
encourage past customers to purchase more products or services. The latter (type B) help
clients to understand how BizTech’s offerings could meet the needs of their organization

58

(e.g., identity management, data protection, and the maintenance of their information
infrastructure).
Like employees in most organizations, inside sales representatives in BizTech
work in teams. For example, according to organizational charts, BizTech Latin America
had 18 managers who each supervised an average of 10 individuals (SD = 7.31). When it
comes to interaction, which is closely related to TMS, these immediate teams might not
be the most meaningful unit of interaction. Rather, extended teams explained most of the
variation in BizTech representatives’ interactions. For client-focused representatives, for
example, routine tasks such as marketing software did not involve heavy interaction with
their immediate team. However, client-focused representatives often teamed up with
specialists, including brand-focused representatives to handle complicated tasks, such as
providing consulting to a specific business about an optimal IT system, resulting in
multiple inside sales representatives’ involvement. Since inside sales representatives’ job
entails helping client businesses to better understand how BizTech could provide
solutions to their diverse challenges and needs, sales representatives with different areas
of expertise routinely coordinated their efforts. And the necessity for teaming up was not
limited to client representatives. For example, brand-focused representatives (say,
software brand specialists) also teamed up with other BizTech sales representatives,
partners, and consultants and marketing specialists to meet their clients’ needs. In sum,
the degree to which inside sales representatives’ interactions center on their immediate
team or extended team may vary on a task-by-task basis. When working as part of an
extended team, knowing the expertise of other inside sales representatives is particularly
important, so they will interact with one another to a greater extent. Note that the present

59

study used individuals’ relations within and/or across teams as the unit of analysis.
Though it used teams (both immediate and extended) as the context for capturing
interactions among individuals in a knowledge network, this study mainly has
implications for individuals’ relations within and/or across teams.
Given BizTech’s interest in optimizing individual inside sales representatives’ job
performance, it routinely encourages them to take advantage of communication
technologies. Not only does it promote the use of publicly available electronic
communication tools (like LinkedIn, Twitter, and Skype); it also encourages them to use
proprietary tools. To this end, the company designed a program called Digital Matters (a
pseudonym) to single out high-performance employees who use electronic
communication tools. By highlighting these success stories, BizTech hopes to encourage
other employees to boost their own performance by adopting the same tools and using
them effectively.
Sample
Participants came from the three regional centers of BizTech: Australia and New
Zealand (abbreviated ANZ), Colombia and Argentina (Latin America), and France and
Ireland (France). As of the time the survey was conducted, the number of inside sales
representatives was as follows: ANZ (n = 132), Latin America (n = 180), and France (n =
120). Those who asked for their names to be removed or who did not hold the position of
inside sales representatives were removed from the list of the survey respondents. This
led to the following potential numbers of survey participants: ANZ (n = 114), Latin
America (n = 177), and France (n = 116). In the end, the response rate was 52% for ANZ
(n = 59), 75% for Latin America (n = 132), and 41% for France (n = 47).

60

With respect to demographics, it should be noted that, due to BizTech’s concerns
about the privacy of its employees, respondents’ information was collected on a
categorical basis. Further, respondents could freely opt out of answering demographic
questions. Regarding gender, the ANZ sample contained an equal number of males and
females; the Latin American sample was 56.6% male and 43.4% female; and the French
sample was 57.9% male and 42.1% female. Regarding age, the distribution of ANZ
respondents was as follows: 18–24 (16.7%), 25–35 (31.3%), 36–46 (35.4%), 47–57
(16.7%), and 58 or older (0%). For Latin America, the age distribution was as follows:
18–24 (11.7%), 25–35 (69.4%), and 36–46 (18.9%), and 47 or older (0%). For France,
the age distribution was as follows: 18–24 (5.3%), 25–35 (36.8%), 36–46 (36.8%), and
47–57 (21.1%), and 58 or older (0%). The Latin American respondents were the youngest
while the French respondents were the oldest.
Regarding highest level of education, ANZ respondents were broken down as
follows: high school degree (6.1%), some college (8.2%), associate’s degree (4.1%),
bachelor’s degree (61.2%), master’s degree (18.4%), and PhD, MD, or other advanced
degree (2.0%). For Latin America: high school degree (0.9%), some college (3.6%),
associate’s degree (42.0%), bachelor’s degree (26.8%), master’s degree (25.9%), and
PhD, MD, or other advanced degree (0.9%). For France: high school degree (2.7%),
some college (8.1%), associate’s degree (10.0%), bachelor’s degree (24.3%), master’s
degree (45.9%), and PhD, MD, or other advanced degree (2.7%). The French respondents
were most highly educated while Latin American and ANZ respondents showed similar
education levels in terms of advanced degrees.

Procedures
The data for this study were collected in tandem with one of BizTech’s internal
research projects. As discussed, BizTech was very interested in assessing the effect of its
program, Digital Matters, on the way that its inside sales representatives use electronic
communication tools to interact with their clients and coworkers. One of my dissertation
committee members helped me to set up a meeting in mid-January 2013 with researchers
at BizTech. Following that meeting, my survey questionnaire was revised multiple times
with input from BizTech’s researchers; these interactions greatly improved the clarity of
its content and wording and helped to accommodate the specific situation of the research
site. For example, to take into account the fact that BizTech’s inside sales representatives
interact with people on extended teams rather than their immediate team, some of the
survey wording was revised as follows: “Please think about the BizTechers you work
with on your extended team. Rate how strongly you agree with each of the following
statements.”
Compared with collecting data from one region, using multiple regions better
represents the organization, which is globally distributed. Further, I anticipated that using
multiple regions would produce more variability in terms of virtuality. Although inside
sales representatives rarely interact across these regions, using multiple regional centers
provides more variance in terms of geographic dispersion, electronic dependence, cultural
diversity, and dynamic structure.
To adequately perform network analysis, this study needed to obtain a bounded
network from each regional center. A problem associated with the name-generating
method is that it often produces open-ended networks; for example, an ego might list an

62

individual for a given network question who does not belong to the organization. Such
open-ended networks would not represent any meaningful interactions among the
organization’s members. Using region-based data helped ensure that respondents’
networks were bounded by their regional centers. Given that the present study used a
name-generating network measure, this means that an inside sales representative
operating at, say, Latin America would presumably list his or her fellow inside sales
representatives who also work at Latin America. To ensure that the network would be
bounded—meaning that the network would include only BizTech employees—the
network question required respondents to limit their responses to BizTech employees.
Inside sales representatives from the three regional centers were invited to
participate in the survey. To accommodate Spanish- and French-speaking participants,
the survey questionnaire was translated into Spanish and French by a native Spanish
speaker and two native French speakers. Another native French speaker checked the
French version for accuracy. These translators also helped translate the invitation emails.
All of them were doctoral students at a U.S. university and were thus familiar with
academic research.
The survey was administered over six weeks, from March 8 through April 15,
2013 at an online survey site, Qualtrics.com. Given the Internet-intensive nature of inside
sales representatives’ jobs, they were expected to be comfortable with taking online
surveys. Based on the list of active inside sales representatives in the three regions
provided by BizTech Inside Sales, the first round of invitation emails was sent during the
first week of March 2013, and four reminder emails were sent out through mid-April.
These emails were sent using the message-sending function of Qualtrics. Those who

63

expressed their unwillingness to receive these emails were all removed from the contact
list saved at Qualtrics.
Measures
Expertise recognition. The list of expertise was collected from research
participants’ LinkedIn pages. In a previous study, participants’ expertise was assessed by
interviewing supervisors (Austin, 2003). Despite the advantages of third-person
evaluations, there are two issues with using interview-induced expertise. First, there is no
guarantee that the supervisors selected for an interview are good judges of their
subordinates’ expertise. Second, even if they manage to accurately report the expertise of
their subordinates, there is the question of how well this represents the expertise of the
entire organization. Instead, to develop the list of expertise used in the survey
questionnaire, the list of expertise was obtained directly from information about skills or
knowledge that BizTech’s inside sale representatives had themselves listed on LinkedIn.
There were merits to exploring the expertise that inside sales representatives listed on
social networking sites. In a sense, conducting an additional survey would be redundant,
since potential survey respondents have already made their expertise public. Also, given
that their supervisors, colleagues, and clients may have access to their LinkedIn page, it is
assumed that there is little, if any, incentive to manipulate their expertise. Further, using
information regarding expertise on LinkedIn allowed the researcher to collect specific
types of expertise rather than the broader domains of expertise that have been used in
most research.
The researcher looked up all publicly accessible expertise-related information on
BizTech’s inside sales representatives’ LinkedIn pages and used this to generate overall

64

categories of expertise that might be relevant to inside sales representatives. These
categories were used to create a master list of expertise domains. At the time of data
collection, the number of inside sale representatives who had a LinkedIn account was 35
for ANZ, 28 for Latin America, and 15 for France. Note that not all representatives are
included on BizTech’s official websites, so the number of those with LinkedIn pages did
not match the number of representatives that was confirmed by the list provided by
BizTech. Further, the actual survey participants may or may not have publicized their
information on LinkedIn. Given that this study’s respondents were also performing the
same/similar jobs as inside sales persons, it is assumed that the list of expertise generated
from publicly accessible information on LinkedIn reasonably represented the actual
respondents’ expertise.
To narrow down each BizTech inside sales representative’s areas of expertise, the
researcher only included those areas of expertise that the rep’s LinkedIn visitors had
endorsed. Among the areas of endorsed expertise (see Table 1 for the entire list), the top
20 areas which were endorsed more than three times overall by LinkedIn visitors were
selected: account management; business analysis/business development; channel/channel
partners; collaboration solutions; client financing, client relationship management; cloud
computing; customer service; data analysis/data center; disaster recovery; demand
generation; lead generation/lead development/lead management; network security; new
business development; online commerce; project management; sales/sales management;
solution selling; storage/storage solutions; and virtualization. Finally, BizTech’s research
team added three more areas of expertise: marketing, digital technology, and digital
selling. From this list of 23 areas, respondents were asked to select their areas of

65

expertise and to identify the main area of expertise for each of the individuals they had
contacted for knowledge seeking and information allocation.
INSERT TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE
Expertise recognition was measured in terms of whether a research participant
accurately perceived the expertise of the BizTech colleagues he or she contacted for
knowledge seeking and information allocation. Note that respondents’ expertise can be
known only if they participated in the survey and someone else who had participated in
the survey had listed them as a contact for knowledge seeking and information allocation.
The researcher matched an individual’s perceptions of another person’s expertise with
that person’s self-reported area(s) of expertise (Su, 2012). For example, if j reported
his/her expertise as “client financing” and i associated j with the same area of expertise,
then i was assigned a 1, otherwise 0.
Previous studies have measured expertise recognition by asking respondents to
rate others’ expertise on a numerical scale and have then determined the accuracy of
expertise recognition by comparing those subjective assessments with self-reported
expertise (Austin, 2003; Su, 2012). But in this study, respondents directly selected their
contacts’ expertise from a dropdown menu of the 23 pre-sorted domains of expertise.
This method aimed to gauge whether respondents accurately recognized others’ expertise
as classified by a series of specific domains existing in the company. This is a more
straightforward and accurate way to determine expertise recognition, because perceptions
may be subject to bias. Further, it is well-suited to network analysis, which requires
constructing ties that are binary (1 for accurate recognition, 0 otherwise). People are
naturally subjective, so it is important to understand bias in expertise recognition.

66

Because knowing others’ expertise tends to be determined by the degree to which one
interacts with the person whom he or she perceives to be an expert, expertise recognition
is indeed an outcome of one’s subjective perceptions. Of course, the longer and deeper
the interaction, the more objectively accurate one’s perception will be. The
aforementioned way of measuring expertise recognition was intended to minimize bias
stemming from subjectivity.
In testing hypotheses 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 and addressing research questions 1, 2, 3,
and 4, the measure of expertise recognition for each participant was calculated by
dividing the number of experts that he or she correctly identified by the total number of
experts that he or she attempted to identify (e.g., if someone associated 12 people with
particular areas of expertise but only 6 of them were actually experts in those areas, he or
she was assigned .5). The average score was .14 (SD = .15). Since individuals who listed
more experts tended to record higher scores of expertise recognition, the measure was
normalized by dividing by the total number of experts each respondent attempted to
identify. In testing hypotheses 7 and 8, an adjacency matrix was created to represent
individuals’ identification of others’ expertise. To use the bivariate ERGM, the measure
of expertise recognition needed to be arrayed in an adjacency matrix that included each
individual’s accurate identification of others’ expertise in a dyadic fashion.
In using a self-reported measure of expertise as a reference point in measuring
accuracy of expertise recognition, it was assumed that self-reports of expertise accurately
represent one’s true expertise. Self-reported measures of expertise have been shown to be
reliable (Littlepage & Silbiger, 1992). When respondents assess their own expertise or
knowledge in their natural work environment, compared to a performance-measuring

67

experiment, self-reported measures of expertise more accurately reflect their true
expertise (Sue, 2012). Furthermore, self-reported measures of expertise are less biased
and less prone to exaggeration when individuals do not feel pressured in their ordinary
work environment (Austin, 2003). Unlike a previous study (Austin), this research was
conducted in a naturally occurring situation. Therefore, it is unlikely that the survey
caused respondents to fake or exaggerate their expertise.
Virtuality measures. The elements of virtuality (geographic dispersion,
electronic dependence, cultural diversity, and dynamic structure) were measured by five
items on a five-point scale, with values ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree.
These items were slightly modified from those used by Gibson and Gibbs (2006) and
Chudoba et al. (2005). Geographic dispersion was measured by agreement with
statements like “my colleagues are in different geographic locations” (M = 4.17, SD =
0.71, Cronbach’s α = 0.64). Electronic dependence was measured by agreement with
statements like “I rely on electronic communication tools to communicate with my
colleagues on a daily basis” (M = 4.27, SD = 0.61, Cronbach’s α = 0.80). Cultural
diversity was measured by agreement with statements like “I work with colleagues whose
cultural backgrounds differ from my own” (M = 3.65, SD = 0.86, Cronbach’s α = 0.59).
Dynamic structure was measured by agreement with statements like “there is high
turnover among the colleagues I work with” (M = 3.09, SD = 0.99, Cronbach’s α = 0.94).
Network measures. This study used a name-generated network. Two network
questions, which asked survey respondents to list the names of coworkers, were designed
to measure the two main elements of TMS: knowledge seeking and information
allocation. The knowledge-seeking communication networks question came from

68

Reagans & McEvily (2003) but was modified to reflect the research site’s situation.
Based on theories of information allocation (Monge & Contractor, 2003), the researcher
created the question for information allocation.
Knowledge-seeking communication networks. Guided by their knowledge of
others’ expertise (i.e., their “directory” of expertise), individuals can allocate relevant
knowledge to others (transactive encoding) or receive it from them (transactive retrieval)
(Hollingshead & Brandon, 2003). In Wegner’s terms, transactive retrieval/information
retrieval is conceptually equivalent to “retrieval coordination”—a process by which
individuals are aware of the specific knowledge that is necessary for their tasks and,
using their directory of others’ expertise, contact those who possess that knowledge
(Wegner, 1987; 1995). A key aspect of retrieval coordination is that humans do not have
the capacity to possess all necessary knowledge on their own, so they form TMS to be
aware of the information that others possess and use that awareness to seek relevant
information (Hollingshead & Brandon). Focusing on the extent to which individuals seek
knowledge from their colleagues, the current study used the following name-generating
network question to measure knowledge-seeking communication networks within
BizTech: “Think about the BizTech colleagues who have acted as a critical source of
knowledge for your work during the past six months. These are the people you reached
out to when you needed help with your job, whether you work directly with them or not.”
Information-allocation communication networks. Information allocation refers
to a process by which individuals, based on their directory of expertise, transfer
information to others who might find it relevant (Wegner, 1995). Palazzolo (2005) has
explained that the underlying reason why humans allocate information to others, rather

69

than storing it all themselves, is that they can reserve more of their cognitive capacity for
information that they feel is most relevant to their own activities. According to TMS
theories, once an individual transfers his or her information to someone who is deemed
better qualified to handle that information, he or she is no longer responsible for storing
that information and can preserve his or her cognitive capacity for other tasks (Wegner,
1987). A key aspect of information allocation is that individuals forward information to
others who they think might find it more relevant or who are better able to process it,
regardless of whether the other person specifically requested the information.
Emphasizing the importance of forwarding unsolicited knowledge to others as the most
significant aspect of information allocation, the present study used the following namegenerating network question to measure information-allocation communication networks
within BizTech: “Think about the BizTech colleagues with whom you have shared
unsolicited knowledge (e.g., advice or information that you thought they would find
helpful in their jobs) during the past six months, whether you work directly with them or
not.” In measuring knowledge-seeking and information-allocation communication
networks, “knowledge” was used as a general term to refer to any information-sharing
related to the creation, furthering, or closing of business opportunities.
It should be noted that, unlike a complete network, networks created by using a
name-generating questionnaire typically do not capture all of the possible connections
among individuals. For example, someone might list five people whom he or she has
contacted for knowledge, but it cannot be known whether these five people know one
another unless these people are surveyed and list one another. The name-generating

70

technique could thus lead researchers to underestimate the number of ties among contacts.
Two things were done to attenuate these limitations.
First, to overcome this limitation of egocentric networks, a bounded network was
obtained. A bounded network can be created by ensuring that survey respondents
consider and list individuals who come from the same pool to which survey respondents
belong (e.g., same kinship unit, organization, or community). One premise here is that if
survey respondents list contacts who come from the same pool, then contacts may be
listed more than one time. Because organizational members tend to develop ties with
those who have relevant information and skills, it is reasonable to expect that several of
BizTech’s inside sales representatives might be seeking expertise from the same
individual. While informal friendship ties tend to be more diverse and expansive, workbased ties may be limited to relatively few individuals. Another premise is that if the
survey respondents who are listed as contacts by other survey respondents themselves
actually list their contact(s), it is more likely that potential ties among contacts could be
captured. For example, if inside sales representative i lists representatives j, k, l, and m as
his/her contacts, one cannot know if there is a communication tie between j and k, unless
j or k lists the other as a contact. But if j lists any other of i’s contacts (k, l, and m) as his
or her contact(s), it is then possible to know how i’s contacts are connected. This is a key
factor about addressing the aforementioned underestimation issue in an egocentric
network’s problem. So to maximize the number of inside sales representatives who
completed the survey, it was important for j to answer the network questions, regardless
of whether j actually had a tie with k. Thus, when using bounded networks, achieving a
high response rate matters.

71

To do so, the survey respondents were asked to list only those people who they
had contacted for knowledge seeking and information allocation within the context of a
professional relationship; more specifically, the survey questionnaire asked them to list
people in their company who had helped them to identify, progress, or close business
opportunities during the past six months. Second, unlike conventional egocentric
networks, the survey respondents were not limited to listing a specified number of
contacts; rather, they were asked to list as many contacts as possible.
According to Kossinets (2006), a network might contain missing data for any of
the following three reasons: fixed-choice design, boundary specification, and survey nonresponse. A fixed-choice design effect occurs when researchers limit the number of
contacts that respondents can report (Kossinets). As mentioned previously, this study did
not employ a fixed-choice design; rather, it encouraged each survey respondent to list as
many of their contacts as possible.
The boundary specification issue arises when a researcher sets a rule regarding
who to include in and exclude from a network (Laumann, Marsden, & Prensky, 1983).
An improper boundary specification might cause a researcher to miss important ties
(Kossinets). Laumann, Marsden, & Prensky (1983) have suggested that there are two
strategies for boundary specification: the realist approach and the nominalist approach.
According to Laumann et al., the realist approach rests on the assumption that individuals
who constitute a network view it as a social fact and are aware of the other individuals
who constitute their network. From the realist standpoint, the researcher’s assessment of
how confidently actors define their network plays a key role in setting a network
boundary (Everton, 2012). According to the nominalist approach, however, networks do

72

not exist as objective social facts, and individuals are not expected to be aware of who the
members of their network are. Thus, this approach emphasizes that setting the boundary
of a network is related to the researcher’s theoretical interest (Wasserman & Faust, 1994)
and what they aim to study (Laumann et al.). As a result, a network might end up having
arbitrary boundaries.
Wasserman and Faust (1994) have emphasized the importance of the population
of the interest in setting the boundary of a network. The present study attempted to make
inferences about individuals who work in virtual work arrangements and who actively
engage in knowledge sharing. To that end, I focused on the knowledge-sharing
communication ties of BizTech inside sales representatives—virtual workers who
actively share knowledge with one another. Even though some BizTech representatives
might have significant knowledge-sharing communication ties with individuals beyond
the context of their inside sales center (possibly even outside of the company), it was
speculated that most if not all of their communication ties centered on their fellow inside
sales representatives. This was reasonable because knowledge-sharing communication
ties are more likely to emerge within a particular organization than across organizations.
Missing data from non-responses (either missing actors or missing ties) are
present in most network studies. The possible negative effects of missing data in network
analysis have been well-documented (Knoke & Yang, 2008). Despite the obvious
problems posed by missing data, Knoke and Yang have reported that there is no effective
solution, except to attain the highest possible response rate. Out of the three regions
examined in this study, only Latin America showed a relatively high response rate (about
73%), so the other two regions (ANZ and France) were eliminated from analysis.

73

As mentioned previously, although missing data are believed to negatively impact
network analysis, no robust remedy has been developed. Each of the potential solutions—
imputing the unconditional mean, reconstruction, preferential attachment, and hot deck
imputation—has its advantages and disadvantages (Huisman, 2009). According to
Huisman’s simulation-based study of directed networks, missing data most affected
degree and inverse geodesic measure; interestingly, ignoring missing data performed
better than imputation for measures such as reciprocity, transitivity, and assortativity.
For this study, the decision to ignore missing data rested on the finding that
ERGMs work with moderate amounts of missing data (Robins, Pattison, & Woolcock,
2004). By artificially creating a network with non-responses and comparing ERGM
results from a complete network and a network with non-responses, Robins et al. showed
that in case of ERGMs, missing data may not seriously distort the analysis. According to
Robins et al., conventional network analysis is prone to missing data because it focuses
on measured network structures. However, ERGMs “adduce the global structure of a
network as the aggregation of local sub-structure” (p. 278). Based on the notion that
ERGMs can adequately test local social neighborhoods, despite any gaps stemming from
non-responses, the researcher chose to ignore missing data rather than reconstruct it
through imputation or discard particular cases.
Network diversity and network closure were obtained from the name-generated
networks. First, the name-generated network data were stored in the form of edgelists for
knowledge-seeking networks and information-allocation networks. On average, each
survey respondent listed 5.20 names (SD = 3.47) for knowledge seeking and 3.90 names
(SD = 2.45) for information allocation. Then, following a recommended routine (Borgatti,

74

Everett, & Freeman, 2002a), name-generated network data were converted into adjacency
matrices using a UCINET procedure. To use the bivariate ERGM software XPnet, which
only processes square matrices, the network data for knowledge seeking and information
networks were converted into square matrices.
To test the interaction effect of network diversity and network closure on the
relationship between virtuality and expertise recognition, the knowledge-seeking and
information-allocation networks were combined into one network. This was done
because a combined network of knowledge seeking and information allocation can fully
represent one’s knowledge-sharing communication network. To investigate the
relationships among expertise recognition, knowledge seeking, and information
allocation, the knowledge-seeking and information-allocation networks were not merged;
instead, they were used separately in order to reflect the two main elements of TMS,
knowledge seeking and information allocation.
Network diversity. Network diversity was operationalized in terms of the degree
to which one has nonredundant ties. Redundancy has been understood as the degree to
which “one’s contacts are connected to each other” (Borgatti, 1997, p. 35). In networks
with nonredundant ties, some people are only connected with one another indirectly or
not at all (Burt, 1992). Network efficiency was used to measure network diversity. To
calculate the efficiency of a network, I started by measuring effective size.
The original concept of i’s effective size was proposed by Burt (1992) as follows:
, q ≠ i, j
where

is defined by dividing i’s tie with i’s contact q by the total number of i’s

linkages with every other one of his/her contacts, and

is defined by dividing j’s

75

linkage with his or her contact q by the maximum value of j’s ties, max(

). If one

treats the network as consisting of 1 (tie) and 0 (no tie), the maximum value of a tie is 1,
which makes max (

) equal to the interaction of j with k that has a maximum

value of 1. This allows one to focus on degree of redundancy due to overlapping ties
rather than redundancy caused by a strong tie.
According to Borgatti (1997), redundancy is understood as the average number of
ties that alters forge with one another, excluding their ties to ego. Then, the degree of
nonredundancy can be seen as the portion of all ties among alters minus redundancy,
which is equivalent to the definition of effective size (and further applying to efficiency).
Along this logic, Borgatti defined effective size by excluding the average number of ties
that alters form with each other from the total number of alters that exist in one’s network,
which measures nonredundancy. Guided by Borgatti’s definition of effective size,
UCINET 6.0 (Borgatti, Everett, & Freeman, 2002a) calculates effective size as

,

where t is the average number of ties among the alters in one’s network (ties with ego are
excluded) and n is the number of alters. However, effective size tends to increase as one
has more contacts (Burt, 1992). To normalize the effect of the number of contacts in
one’s network on effective size, effective size was divided by the number of other actors
in one’s network, which produces the following formula: efficiency

. Given the

above logic of obtaining a measure of nonredundancy, efficiency was used to measure
network diversity.
Network closure. Existing studies (e.g., Reagans & McEvily, 2003) have used
Burt’s measure of social cohesion:
to individual q and

, where

is the tie from individual i

is the tie from q to j. This measure reflects a triadic density that

76

indicates whether there are strong third-party connections around a focal relationship
(Reagans & McEvily). However, it may not reflect the fact that network closure needs to
explain the degree to which one is tied to surrounding others. To take this into account,
UCINET 6.0 was used to calculate cluster coefficients for each actor. Unlike density or
clique, cluster coefficients measure an individual’s level of network closure. They are
defined as the proportion of the number of alters who are connected to each other to the
possible maximum number of pairs of alters (Borgatti, Everett, & Freeman, 2002a). For
example, if actor i has 5 neighbors, then there are a total of 10 pairs of neighbors because
=

= 10. And actor i would have four neighbors who are connected to each other.

Thus the local clustering coefficient for actor i would be 4/10 = .40. So actor i would not
be highly clustered, because just about 40% of all the possible ties among these neighbors
would be present. If actor i had a local cluster coefficient of .80, this would indicate that
he or she was embedded in highly clustered neighborhoods.
Control variables. Perceptions of other people’s expertise are by nature
subjective, resulting in bias in expertise recognition. As discussed, this study minimized
this subjective bias by employing a direct measure of expertise recognition. In addition,
this study controlled for individuals’ perceptions of their coworkers’ expertise by asking
four questions (e.g., “I am aware of the skills and expertise that my colleagues have,” M
= 4.07, SD = 0.62, Cronbach’s α = 0.68) using a five-point scale from 1 = strongly
disagree to 5 = strongly agree (Kanawattanachai & Yoo, 2007). This study also
controlled for how long individuals had worked in their current role, which would
presumably be correlated with expertise recognition. Regarding respondents’ tenure in
their current job roles, ANZ respondents were broken down as follows: 6–12 months

77

(32.8%), 1–2 years (32.8%), 2–4 years (27.6%), 4–6 years (5.2%), and more than 6 years
(1.7%). For Latin America: 6–12 months (44.0%), 1–2 years (32.8%), 2–4 years (20.0%),
4–6 years (2.4%), and more than 6 years (0.8%). For France: 6–12 months (22.4%), 1–2
years (20.4%), 2–4 years (26.5%), 4–6 years (10.2%), and more than 6 years (20.4%).
The French respondents had longer tenures in their current job roles than the ANZ and
Latin American respondents. Latin American respondents were more likely to have
entered into their current roles quite recently.
Data Analysis
Hierarchical multiple regression. The proposed relationships between virtuality
and expertise recognition were tested (see Figure 3) using hierarchical multiple
regression analysis with a stepwise procedure. Before running regression models,
histograms and Q-Q plots were used to examine the normality and linearity of virtuality,
network diversity, and network closure. Only network closure looked positively skewed,
but since the skew was reasonably moderate, the data were not transformed.
Hierarchical multiple regression was performed as follows. As a first step,
expertise recognition was regressed on the control variables (perception of expertise and
tenure at the current job role). In step 2, the main effect of virtuality on expertise
recognition was adjusted for control variables (geographic dispersion, electronic
dependence, cultural diversity, and dynamic structure). To examine the main effect of
network diversity and network closure on expertise recognition, in step 3, controlling for
the control variables and the main effects of geographic dispersion, electronic
dependence, cultural diversity, and dynamic structure, I tested network diversity and
network closure, separately. In step 3, two hierarchical multiple regression models were

78

created: model 1 with network diversity as a moderator and model 2 with network closure
as a moderator. In step four, controlling for the aforementioned factors in the previous
steps, interaction terms for network diversity and the four virtuality dimensions were
examined, and interaction terms for network closure and the four dimensions of virtuality
were examined in model 1 and model 2.
Exponential random graph modeling (ERGM). To test hypotheses 7, 8, 9, and
10 regarding the relationship between expertise recognition and the two knowledge
sharing networks, the bivariate ERGM programs PNet and XPNet were used (Wang,
Robins, & Pattison, 2009). For hypotheses 7 and 8, the multiple link parameter (Arc AB)
was estimated for expertise-recognition and knowledge-seeking ties, and expertiserecognition and information-allocation ties; for hypotheses 9 and 10, the alternating
bivariate transitivity parameter (TKT-ABA in XPNet terms) was estimated for alternating
bivariate transitivity of expertise-recognition and knowledge-seeking ties, and expertiserecognition and information-allocation ties (Koehly & Pattison, 2005). ERGM uses a
randomly-generated set of graphs to test whether a specific network configuration of
interest is found in the observed network by chance (Snijders, Steglich, & van de Bunt,
2010). P-values were used to determine whether the presence of the proposed network
configuration was statistically significant. Estimated parameters are considered
converged when the t-ratio for convergence is less than 0.1 (Robins, Snijders, Wang,
Handcock, & Pattison, 2007). When models were converged, a goodness-of-fit (GOF)
test was used to examine whether the observed statistics differed significantly from the
simulated statistics induced by the fitted model. An estimated parameter is said to

79

converge when the t-ratio is smaller than 0.1, but non-estimated parameters are said to
converge when the t-ratio is less than 2.0 (Robins, Pattison, & Wang, 2009).
It is recommended that, for bivariate ERGM, one starts by estimating baseline
parameters for univariate networks; the target parameters (in the current study, the two
bivariate parameters) should only be estimated when these univariate parameters
converge adequately (Huitsing, van Dujin, Snijders, Wang, Sainio, Salmivalli, &
Veenstra, 2012). Since the main objective of bivariate ERGM is to test for the presence
of bivariate configurations (e.g., bivariate transitivity between tie A and tie B), the
significance of the fit of each bivariate parameter was tested while controlling for
univariate parameters. The first step for bivariate ERGM analysis was to construct a
parsimonious model for the two univariate networks: expertise recognition and
knowledge seeking, and expertise recognition and information allocation. To determine
the parsimonious univariate parameters for each network, the univariate ERGM was
fitted to the expertise-recognition and knowledge-seeking networks (and later the
information-allocation network).
The models (the univariate ERGM and the bivariate ERGM) were fitted a
stepwise manner; that is, one parameter was added at a time, beginning with the link
parameter (Arc) and examining its GOF. Not surprisingly, the GOF for the model that
contains only the Arc parameter was not satisfactory so reciprocity was added in the
second model. Parameters were added until a model yielded acceptable levels of GOF (tratios less than 0.1 for fitted parameters and less than 2.0 for nonfitted parameters) (see
Tables 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, & 7 for details). When the univariate ERGMs for expertise
recognition and knowledge seeking, and expertise recognition and information allocation

80

reached an acceptable GOF, the researcher began to fit the bivariate ERGM. The
following univariate parameters were estimated: arc, reciprocity, A-In-S, AkT and A2P-T.
These univariate parameters were controlled for while estimating bivariate parameters.

Chapter 5. Results
Table 8 shows descriptive statistics for the variables of interest. Network diversity
and network closure were positively correlated with expertise recognition (r = .49, p
< .001; r = .43, p < .001). With regard to the relationships among each of the elements of
virtuality, geographic dispersion was positively correlated with electronic dependence (r
= .21, p < .05) and cultural diversity (r = .46, p < .01). Cultural diversity was positively
correlated with dynamic structure (r = .24, p < .05).
INSERT TABLE 8 ABOUT HERE
The results from step 2 did not support hypotheses 1 or 2; there was no
statistically significant relationship between geographic dispersion and expertise
recognition or between dynamic structure and expertise recognition in either model 1 or
model 2. Thus, hypotheses 1 and 2 were not confirmed. With respect to research question
1, the relationship between electronic dependence and expertise recognition was not
statistically significant. In response to research question 2, the relationship between
cultural diversity and expertise recognition was not statistically significant. In support of
hypothesis 3, network diversity was positively associated with expertise recognition (β =
0.43, p < .001). With respect to hypothesis 4, the interaction effect between network
diversity and geographic dispersion on expertise recognition was statistically significant
(β = ‒0.32, p < .05), supporting hypothesis 4-a, but, contrary to hypothesis 4-b, the
interaction effect between network diversity and dynamic structure on expertise
recognition was only marginally significant (β = ‒0.19, p < .10). Regarding research
question 3, the interaction effect between network diversity and electronic dependence on
expertise recognition was not statistically significant, and there was no significant

82

interaction effect between network diversity and cultural diversity on expertise
recognition. In support of hypothesis 5, network closure was positively related to
expertise recognition (β = 0.39, p < .001). With respect to hypothesis 6, the interaction
effect between network closure and geographic dispersion on expertise recognition was
statistically significant (β = 0.41, p < .05), supporting hypothesis 6-a, but, with regard to
hypothesis 6-b, the interaction effect between network closure and dynamic structure on
expertise recognition was only marginally significant (β =

.22, p < .10). In response to

research question 4, the interaction effect between network closure and electronic
dependence on expertise recognition was not statistically significant, nor was the
interaction effect between network closure and cultural diversity, indicating that network
closure does not moderate the relationship between cultural diversity and expertise
recognition.

Plots are useful for interpreting the interaction effects. As such, I plotted the
relationships between geographic dispersion and expertise recognition at one unit below
the mean of network diversity and at one unit above the mean (Aiken & West, 1991).
Likewise, I plotted the relationships between geographic dispersion and expertise
recognition and between dynamic structure and expertise recognition at one unit below
the mean of network closure and at one unit above the mean.
Figure 8 shows that those who exhibited the higher level of network diversity
tended to perceive others’ expertise more accurately than those who exhibited the lower
level of network diversity, regardless of levels of geographic dispersion. When

83

geographic dispersion was larger, both those with higher levels of network diversity and
with lower levels of network diversity recognized expertise less accurately. However, the
relationship between expertise recognition and geographic dispersion was less negative at
higher levels of network diversity. That is, those with the higher level of network
diversity perceived others’ expertise more accurately than those with the lower level of
network diversity, even when the degree of geographic dispersion is higher. This
indicates that when individuals work in situations where geographic dispersion exists,
network diversity is helpful in perceiving others’ expertise. Figure 9 shows the same
pattern for the relationship between network closure and expertise recognition. That is,
those with the higher level of network closure perceived others’ expertise more
accurately than those with the lower level of network closure, even when the degree of
geographic dispersion was higher. This indicates that network closure is helpful in
perceiving others’ expertise when they work in a situation where geographic dispersion
exists.

Tables 11 and 12 show how the estimated model fits the data. The GOF t-ratios
for fitted statistics need to be smaller than 0.1, while the GOF t-ratio for nonfitted
statistics should be less than 2.0 (Robins & Lusher, 2013). The bivariate ERGM with
expertise recognition and knowledge seeking yielded several graph statistics whose GOF
t-ratios did not meet the suggested criteria (0.12 for A2P-TA; 0.13 for Arc B; 0.18 for
A2P-TB; and 0.12 for Reciprocity B). Since these were all fitted statistics, the failure to
meet the suggested criteria could be problematic. However, three of the four GOF t-ratios

84

were only slightly greater than 0.10 (A2P-TB was a bit higher). Furthermore,
acknowledging that it is highly unlikely to have all statistics meet satisfactory criteria for
the GOF test for ERGM, Robins and Lusher have recommend focusing on fitting those
statistics that are most relevant to a particular research question. For example, if a
researcher is particularly interested in degree, he or she would want to have the degreerelated statistics fit very well. This study focused on the presence of bivariate parameters,
and these univariate graph statistics were used as controls for the bivariate ERGM,
meaning that they were not used to test hypotheses.
INSERT TABLE 11 ABOUT HERE
INSERT TABLE 12 ABOUT HERE
Tables 13 and 14 show the results of the bivariate ERGM. The first model
estimated a total of ten univariate parameters, which were used as controls, and two
bivariate configurations (Arc AB and TKT-ABA). The negative univariate link parameter
for expertise recognition (Arc A) indicates that expertise-recognition ties are sparse
(‒6.13, SE = 0.44, p < .05). And the negative univariate link parameter for knowledge
seeking (Arc B) indicates that knowledge-seeking ties also are sparse (‒6.27, SE = 0.43, p
< .05). With respect to the negative link parameters, it is worth noting that social
networks with densities less than 0.5, out-degree parameters (Arc parameter) tend to be
negative (Steglich, Snijders, & Pearson, 2010). In this study, respondents might have had
sparse expertise-recognition ties because they underreported their coworkers’ expertise or
because they perceived others’ expertise incorrectly. Likewise, respondents might have
had sparse knowledge-seeking ties because they underreported the number of times they
sought out knowledge or because they rarely sought out knowledge from their coworkers.

85

The second model, which focused on expertise recognition and information allocation,
estimated a total of six univariate parameters and three bivariate parameters (Arc AB,
Reciprocity AB, and TKT-ABA). The univariate arc parameters for expertise recognition
and information allocation were both negative (‒7.50, SE = 0.52, p < .05; ‒7.08, SE =
0.42, p < .05). The interpretation of the negative parameter is the same as the case of
knowledge seeking.
Interestingly, the multiplex reciprocal relationship between expertise recognition
and information also turned out to be statistically significant (5.61, SE = 1.18, p < .05).
This indicates that if person i perceives person j’s expertise correctly, then j will tend to
forward unsolicited information to i. However, since this graph statistic was not the focus
of this study (but was merely included to improve the fitness of the model), the researcher
did not develop a theory to explain the relationship.
Hypothesis 7 predicted that expertise recognition leads to knowledge seeking. In
testing hypothesis 7, the parameter estimate of interest was the multiplex link parameter
(Arc AB in XPnet terms). Whereas the arc parameter represents the propensity to form a
tie (Robins & Lusher, 2013), the multiplex arc parameter captures the tendency to form
two different ties between actors. The hypothesized parameter converged properly (t-ratio
for convergence = −0.03) and was positive and statistically significant (7.98, SE = 0.33, p
< .05). Hypothesis 8 predicted that expertise recognition leads to information allocation.
In testing hypothesis 8, the parameter estimate of interest was the multiplex link
parameter containing expertise recognition and information allocation. The hypothesized
parameter converged properly (t-ratio for convergence = −0.06) and was positive and
statistically significant (10.16, SE = 0.69, p < .05).

86

Hypothesis 9 predicted alternating bivariate transitivity of expertise-recognition
and knowledge-seeking ties, so the parameter estimate of interest was the alternating
bivariate transitivity parameter (TKT-ABA in XPnet terms). The hypothesized parameter
was not statistically significant. Hypothesis 10 predicted alternating bivariate transitivity
of expertise-recognition and information-allocation ties. To test hypothesis 10, the
bivariate transitivity parameter TKT-ABA was estimated but was not statistically
significant. Therefore, hypotheses 9 and 10 were not supported, indicating that there were
no alternating bivariate transitive relationships between expertise recognition and
knowledge seeking or between expertise recognition and information allocation.

Chapter 6. Discussion
Virtual work arrangements have become increasingly prevalent with the rise of
the knowledge economy. Organizations introduce and manage virtual collaborations in
order to take advantage of diverse sources of information, knowledge, and expertise.
Oftentimes, this entails building up TMS among workers. Reflecting this context, this
study attempted to understand TMS in relation to virtuality and networks. To this end,
this study used network analysis to analyze TMS in actual virtual work arrangements. It
specifically addressed (a) the relationship between virtuality and expertise recognition,
which is a key element of TMS, (b) the effects of an emergent knowledge-sharing
communication network’s properties on the relationship between virtuality and expertise
recognition, and (c) the extent to which TMS explains the specific patterns of interaction
that emerge in knowledge-sharing communication networks.
In this study, the relationship between virtuality and expertise recognition was not
confirmed. Instead, the effect of virtuality on expertise recognition should be understood
in light of the fact that network mechanisms, network diversity and network closure,
moderated the relationship. The results show that when network diversity interacts with
geographic dispersion, it can moderate the relationship between expertise recognition and
geographic dispersion. As described previously, those who were high on network
diversity perceived others’ expertise more accurately than those who were low on
network diversity, even when the degree of geographic dispersion was higher. When
focusing on geographic dispersion as a barrier to connections, it could be reasoned that
geographic dispersion might hinder people’s perceptions of expertise. However, even if
people feel that they are geographically distant from their coworkers, if they form and

88

maintain higher levels of nonredundant ties, then they will not necessarily feel that
geographic dispersion hampers their perceptions of others’ expertise. Perhaps individuals
who feel physically and geographically distant from one another can still feel connected
if they maintain nonredundant ties.
On the other hand, network closure, which was measured by the degree to which
one is embedded in a clustered network, moderated the relationship between expertise
recognition and geographic dispersion. Though being physically distant from coworkers
would likely make a virtual worker feel distant and even isolated (Gibson & Gibbs, 2006),
the results of this study show that such feelings may be attenuated if the individual is
embedded in a highly clustered network. Redundant but intertwined relationships may
thus be helpful in alleviating a feeling of being distant from coworkers that may hinder
their perceptions of others’ expertise. By being in a dense network, people can sustain
their relationships with team members or coworkers who work at different sites.
Consistent with previous theoretical discussions, this study suggests that network
diversity and network closure may play a vital role in accurately perceiving others’
expertise. Interestingly, network diversity and network closure can both contribute to
expertise recognition. As discussed in the literature review, theorists of network diversity
(Burt, 1992) and network closure (Coleman, 1988) emphasize, respectively, the benefits
of weak yet diverse ties and redundant yet solid ties. It is tempting to think about these
two network mechanisms as being in conflict; however, subsequent studies have shown
otherwise. After analyzing the relationships between structural holes and performance,
and between network closure and performance, Burt (2000) argued that “structural holes
and network closure can be brought together in a productive way” (p. 398). Burt

89

illustrated that performance is maximized when organizational members develop
nonredundant ties beyond their immediate workgroups, while simultaneously maintaining
cohesive relationships within those groups.
To measure network closure, Burt used network density, which is the proportion
of actors who are linked with another actor to all possible dyadic linkages, and hierarchy.
These two types of network closure were both positively associated with performance.
Reagans and McEvily (2003) demonstrated that network range, an indicator of network
diversity, and cohesion were contributing together when predicting knowledge transfer.
Reagans and McEvily used triadic density to focus on the presence of strong third-party
connections. As discussed in the methods section, there were continuities and
discontinuities in using clustering coefficients to measure network closure. Network
density and clustering coefficients are both indicators of network closure. Burt stated that
network density is one of the measures of network closure, not the only way. Further,
because network density is a group-based measure, it did not fit well with this study’s
research context. While clustering coefficients capture the degree of cohesion within a
network, they are individual-based measures. Thus, it is reasonable to attempt to measure
network closure in another way (clustering coefficient in this study).
Extending a perspective that does not see network diversity and closure as
conflicting, I suggest that network diversity and network closure can both be seen as
making information-seeking and knowledge-sharing more effective. Consistent with the
main point of each of these two perspectives, network diversity grants people access to
diverse information and expands the boundaries of personal networks (Burt, 1992),
whereas network closure enables individuals to develop more precise knowledge of

90

others along multiple dimensions. While network diversity provides individuals with
various sources of information about others’ expertise and skills, network closure allows
individuals to perceive others’ knowledge and skills from various angles. This is
important because in networks with less closure, virtual workers might experience limited
aspects of a person’s expertise and might misconstrue the actual nature of his or her
expertise. In some cases, an individual’s perceptions of other people’s expertise may
reflect what he or she wants one to perceive (Leonardi & Treem, 2012). But if multiple
third-party individuals corroborate his or her impressions, then he or she may be able to
make more accurate assessments through triangulation. In sum, overlapping ties may be
redundant in terms of the sources of information, but they may bring additional ways of
understanding others’ expertise.
In an effort to better understand the relationship between the main elements of
TMS, I used bivariate ERGM to investigate the relationships between expertise
recognition and knowledge seeking and between expertise recognition and information
allocation. The results of this study indicate that expertise recognition forms a multiplex
relationship with knowledge-seeking ties and information-allocation ties.
Theoretical Implications
This study has illuminated the relationships between one’s perception of expertise
and (a) virtuality, (b) virtuality when taking into account the effect of network diversity
and network closure, and (c) knowledge-seeking and information allocation ties. Given
that TMS can be best understood in the light of a network (Lewis, 2003; Wegner, 1995),
this study examined the relationship between virtuality and expertise recognition in terms
of the two main network properties, network diversity and network closure. By doing so,

91

it focused on interactions between virtual collaborators who operate in virtual work
arrangements rather than on the structural aspects of those arrangements.
Implications for virtuality theory. This study suggests that TMS needs to be
studied in relation to virtual work arrangements, which are becoming more prevalent in
the workplace. Building up TMS among workers is critically related to what virtual work
arrangements aim to achieve: diverse sources of information, knowledge, and expertise.
This study examined how expertise recognition, the prominent element of TMS, is related
to virtuality, which may make a well-functioning TMS more difficult to establish. The
results of this study counter previous assumptions by showing that the structural barriers
inherent in virtuality do not necessarily hinder expertise recognition because two
prominent network properties, network diversity and network closure, may moderate
some of the structural effects of virtuality on expertise recognition.
This study sought to better understand the emergence of communication networks
in virtual work arrangements. To get a better understanding of the effect of
communication on expertise recognition and, potentially, on TMS, this study adopted a
communication network approach. Whereas previous TMS studies focused on the content
of communication (Leonardi & Treem, 2012) or the strength of communication ties
(Yuan et al., 2010), this study examined communication ties themselves (specifically,
knowledge-sharing communication ties). By focusing on the relational aspects of
communication, this study contributes to the understanding of the emergent
communication network perspective—in particular, the meaning of emergence in a
network. It is important to focus on the relational aspect of communication, because it

92

allows one to understand the emergence of patterned interactions in the network of
interest through self-organization mechanisms of the network structure.
According to Contractor (1994), self-organizing systems theory aims “to explain
the emergence of patterned behavior in systems that are initially in a state of
disorganization or in a different state of organization” (p. 51). Further, Contractor
proposed that “organizational members’ coordinated activity and their shared
interpretations are, in part, self-generating” (p. 53). Drawing on self-organizing systems
theory, Contractor and Grant (1996) showed that initial levels of communication and
patterns of interaction in semantic networks predict ensuing patterns of interaction. In
explaining the emergence of communication networks, the multi-theoretical and multilevel (MTML) framework (Monge & Contractor, 2003) is a useful tool. In the MTML
framework, the endogenous elements of networks are represented by various graph
configurations, such as links, reciprocity, transitivity, and clustering. These endogenous
components help explain how the relational aspects of networks affect the self-organizing
process (Contractor, Wasserman, & Faust, 2006). According to Contractor et al., the
endogenous elements of a network, which reflect its relational characteristics, affect the
chance that particular linkages are present in the network. The present study shows that
such endogenous patterns of communicative interaction constitute the overall structure of
the communication network, which is the essential part of understanding emergence in
the context of networks. That is, endogenous network configurations, such as links,
reciprocity, and triangles, are basic components of networks that eventually combine to
shape what the network will be like.

93

This study reminds us that understanding the potential benefits of network
diversity and network closure requires a balanced approach. One should be cautioned
against assuming that diverse ties will always promote expertise recognition or that
network closure will always inhibit it. The present study tells us why such
overgeneralizations are not always the case. Although weak yet diverse ties can promote
expertise recognition, being embedded in a network with overlapping ties—which the
measure of network closure used in the present study aimed to capture—may also
promote expertise recognition. This study demonstrates that network diversity and
network closure are not mutually exclusive, but can work together to promote expertise
recognition, which is a key factor in TMS. The benefits of network diversity—more
efficient access to information resources (Burt, 1992)—can be achieved through weak
ties (Granovetter, 1973). Nonredundant and diverse communication ties can give people a
better sense of who in their network has what specialized knowledge. Network closure,
which is associated with fewer nonredundant ties, provides people with an increased
chance to look at others’ expertise from different angles.
Implications for TMS theory. Ever since Wegner (1995) conceptualized the
main elements of TMS, there have not been serious attempts to examine potential
relationships among expertise recognition, knowledge retrieval, and information
allocation. If these relationships exist, what kind of relationships might they be? This
study helps to answer this question and suggests some mechanisms responsible for
establishing relationships among the elements of TMS. By showing the presence of the
multiplex links between expertise recognition and knowledge seeking, and between
expertise recognition and information allocation, this study attempted to answer the

94

above question. The findings show that individuals in an organization tend to form
multiplex ties, rather than just uniplex relationships (based on a single type of linkage). If
someone perceives another person as having relevant expertise, this may be a precursor to
joint attention between these people. That is, based on the individual’s awareness of the
other person’s expertise, he or she may forge a knowledge-sharing tie with them. Then,
once a knowledge-sharing relationship is formed, the individual may learn more about
the other person’s expertise, which may cause additional ties to form in the future.
What this study showed is congruent with literature that emphasizes the
multifaceted nature of individuals’ relationship—that is, that people’s relationships tend
to be defined by multiple ties rather than just a single type of a tie (Ibarra, 1993; Robins
& Pattison, 2006). An individual who perceives another person as having a common
interest will tend to forge a tie based on that interest, paving the way for other ties (Feld,
1981). Individuals’ patterns of interaction may not be limited to only one type of tie;
rather, they may occur across discrete types of relations (Lee & Monge, 2011).
The above discussion supports my speculation that individuals who share one tie
will tend to form other ties (e.g., expertise recognition and knowledge seeking in this
study). For example, in the context of virtual work arrangements, if an individual
perceives that another person has expertise and knowledge that is useful for completing
his or her task, he or she may forge a tie with that person defined by their focus on
completing that particular task. Then, once these individuals are connected, they may be
more likely to form other ties, such as advice-seeking or collaborative ties. This study
showed that individuals seek knowledge from, and/or allocate information to, others in
their organization who they view as experts. It is interesting to see that such a tendency

95

within general interpersonal relationships is also evident in the relationships among the
elements of TMS. This may have to do with the fact that people’s perceptions of one
another’s expertise, and possibly ensuing knowledge-sharing behaviors, may reflect their
relationships.
The above discussion leads to the conclusion that a network approach is useful for
examining TMS. According to Wegner’s (1987) definition, a TMS is “a set of individual
memory systems in combination with the communication that takes place between
individuals” (p.186). TMS can be understood in network terms because network ties exist
and operate between individuals (Lewis, 2003). Thus, I would argue that TMS can be a
perceived network—formed and shaped in individuals’ minds, reflecting their
perceptions of who knows what and who knows who knows what, and, further, who
knows who does what. In other words, one can project his or her mental representation of
who knows who knows what (expertise recognition, Wegner, 1987) and who knows who
does what (task-knowledge coordination, Brandon & Hollingshead, 2003) onto a network.
What needs to be emphasized, of course, is the fact that one’s social interaction
influences this process of developing perceptions of expertise. The above mentioned
mental representations of others’ expertise are an outcome of interactions, instead of
individuals’ independent efforts.
This study has attempted to go beyond rational approaches to TMS (Austin, 2003;
Kanawattanachai & Yoo, 2007), which implicitly assume that if the pre-conditions of
TMS are met—namely, individuals develop and possess specialized expertise and are
able to correctly identify experts—then an individual will reach out to those experts when
their expertise is needed. This approach neglects the social reasons that individuals may

96

knowingly reach out to non-experts. Focusing on vicarious learning patterns that emerge
among people who use and adapt technology in their organization, social influence
models (Fulk, Schmitz, & Steinfield, 1990) argue that social context and influence play a
critical role in shaping one’s perception of technology and technology uses in
organizations. This study emphasizes the social features of expertise recognition.
Identifying and contacting the right person(s) may not solely depend on an individual’s
rationality or judgment; instead, an individual’s awareness of others’ expertise and actual
contact with the right person(s) may be guided and shaped by his or her social
interactions with others. In this matter, a network approach provides an alternative in that
it views TMS as an outcome of social connections.
Practical Implications
As discussed, accurate recognition of expertise helps relevant knowledge and
information to be shared among employees. Thus, for managers to promote more active
knowledge sharing in their companies or organizations, they might wish to foster work
environments where employees are more aware of one another’s expertise in terms of not
only their general domains of expertise (i.e., the kinds of expertise they possess) but also
their task-specific expertise (i.e., the kinds of tasks/projects that they use their expertise to
complete). In this matter, managers might wish to increase the degree to which their
employees develop nonredundant ties. Again, nonredundant ties are significantly related
to coworkers’ ability to perceive one another’s expertise, which is a key element of TMS.
Because building more diverse networks is an ideal way to foster expertise recognition,
management might be able to provide some opportunities for employees to connect with

97

those they otherwise would not know (e.g., introducing more formal and/or informal
social meetings inside and/or outside of work).
Given the finding that network diversity and network closure played a significant
role in perceiving others’ expertise, management may wish to focus on how their
employees’ networks evolve during the process of TMS formation. For organizations to
know whether they have TMS operating among their employees, they need to have a
clear sense of the types of employee communication networks that are operating at
various levels of work units. Managers should regularly observe how their employees’
local communication networks (i.e., work units) evolve in relation to the organization’s
overall communication network. To do so, it is recommended that companies conduct
regular network surveys that focus on their employees’ expertise recognition and
knowledge sharing. Based on the results of these surveys, managers and supervisors
could map the flow of knowledge among their employees and better identify sources of
expertise.
Managers may wish to know if there are discrepancies between an individual’s
actual expertise and what others perceive as his or her expertise or between the expertise
that an individual wants to be known for and what others end up perceiving as their
expertise. It has been documented that digital expert databases in an organization are a
useful way to inform coworkers about one another’s expertise (Fulk, Heino, Flanagin,
Monge, & Bar, 2004). However, although such databases function as a convenient means
for helping an organization’s members to identify expertise, managers should be aware
that what individuals display and share on these repositories may not fully and accurately
reflect their actual expertise. To address such discrepancies, companies should regularly

98

conduct surveys of expertise. Such surveys should be similar to those that were
administered for this study. They should compare “actual” expertise (through selfreported expertise, which was used in this study, or perhaps through a supervisor’s
evaluation) with what coworkers perceive. By doing so, management may be able to
better identify the degree to which their organizational members are aware of others’
expertise accurately.
Limitations and Future Research
Some limitations stem from this study’s use of a name-generating technique to
construct networks. Since this study was unable to employ a full network method to
measure knowledge sharing and information allocation, survey respondents were not
given a list of people that defined the range of their network. A general limitation of
name generators is that they might not fully capture all ties, but are limited to those that
were recalled and listed by egos. This could have led to underestimation of the number of
ties among BizTech’s inside sales representatives.
While this study asked respondents to list their own multiple areas of expertise, it
only asked them to state one main area of expertise for the people they listed. There were
reasons for doing this. First, there was a need to avoid making the survey too lengthy. For
many if not all respondents, asking them to identify multiple areas of expertise for each
contact could lead to fatigue for the remaining survey questions. However, it should be
noted that it constrained respondents’ choices for reporting others’ expertise. Related to
this limitation, this study was unable to measure expertise recognition in terms of
consensus about an individual’s area(s) of expertise.

99

To surmount the above mentioned limitations, future studies could employ a full
network measure. This would avoid underestimation of possible ties among research
participations. Though there have been previous attempts to measure expertise
recognition (Austin, 2003; Lewis et al., 2007), there is no agreed upon method for doing
so. Future studies may wish to come up with a new idea for how to boost the validity of
measuring expertise recognition. Following other studies (Austin, 2003; Su, 2012), this
study adopted self-reported expertise as a benchmark for determining whether others
perceive one’s expertise correctly. However, one might wonder whether self-reported
expertise is the best benchmark. To address this concern, future studies could use others’
consensus about a particular individual’s expertise.
To avoid confusion, it is important to note this study’s complexity in terms of the
unit of analysis. This study collected data from individuals in virtual work arrangements,
but drew conclusions about the relations among individuals who work in a team and/or
across teams. This complexity—which ultimately prompted me to use both network
analysis and regression analysis—might obfuscate the unit of analysis of this study. For
regression analysis, data collected from individuals were used to describe the
relationships between expertise recognition and each of the elements of virtuality; the
unit of analysis was thus individuals who were working in a team. However, in network
analysis, it is not the individual, but the relations among individuals (people, groups, or
organizations), that is the unit of analysis (Emirbayer & Goodwin, 1994; Wasserman &
Faust, 1994). I used network diversity and closure to examine the moderating effect of
network properties on the relationship between virtuality and expertise recognition.
Further, the bivariate ERGM analysis was based on network measures and network

100

analysis. In sum, I collected data from teams, and drew implications about their relations
in that team and/or across teams.
Conclusion
In knowledge-based economies, one cannot over-emphasize the importance of
knowledge sharing. Better known as one’s perception of who knows what, TMS is
widely considered a prerequisite of knowledge sharing and coordination in organizations
(Hollingshead & Brandon, 2003). TMS is critically related to what managers actually aim
to gain by using virtual work arrangements: diverse sources of information, knowledge,
and expertise. TMS not only helps to reduce each individual’s burden of maintaining and
processing information but also enables people to access to diverse information (Monge
& Contractor, 2003). For management to attain these benefits of virtual work
arrangements, it is crucial that TMS exist among their employees.
To better understand TMS in relation to virtuality, this study used a network
approach. Specifically, this study examined the relationship between virtuality and
expertise recognition, and the relationships between expertise recognition and (a)
knowledge seeking and (b) information allocation. The two main network properties—
network diversity and network closure—not only influenced expertise recognition
positively but also moderated the effects of the structural aspects of virtuality on
expertise recognition. This study expanded the focus of the relationship between
virtuality and TMS beyond expertise recognition. Although awareness of other people’s
expertise indeed is a key element of TMS (Palazzolo, 2005; Wegner, 1987), it is not the
only element. In this vein, this study used a cutting-edge statistical network method to

101

examine the relationships among the three main elements of TMS: expertise recognition,
knowledge seeking, and information allocation.

Section III: The following questions ask you to identify the people with whom

you work closely. Your answers to these questions will be used to map the informal
communication networks within the organization. As you think about the questions below,
keep in mind that “knowledge” is a general term that refers to any information-sharing
related to identifying, progressing, or closing business opportunities. It is important for
the following that you provide the first name and last name for each person that you
identify. This will allow the researchers running the study to create an accurate “map” of
connections within BizTech. Remember that ALL DATA provided in this section will
be de-identified by the researchers at Rutgers University, and no identifying data
about you or anyone else will be shared back with BizTech.

6. Think about the BizTechers who “acted as a critical source of knowledge” for your
work (i.e., they help you to identify, progress, or close business opportunities) during the
past six months. These are the people you reached out to when you needed help with your
job, whether you work directly with them or not (Adapted from Reagans & McEvily,
2003, p. 253). Please list the names of as many of these people as possible, and for each
person, report their main area of expertise (select their expertise as you understand it).
Select the ways you usually communicate with them.
7. Think about the BizTechers with whom you have shared unsolicited knowledge (e.g.
advice or information that you thought they would find helpful in their jobs) during the
past six months, whether you work directly with them or not. Please list the names of as
many of these people as possible, and for each person, report their main area of expertise
(select their expertise as you understand it).
