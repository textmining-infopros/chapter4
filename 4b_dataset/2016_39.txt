Abstract
There is no core leadership education in library schools for those aspiring to be
leaders of public libraries and those wanting to lead public entities that support the
mission of libraries. A gap analysis was performed between leadership competencies
and the core curriculum subjects of a sample of library schools. The survey
instrument listed the leadership competencies and asked the participants to rank the
relevance and importance of these competencies to their work. Accordingly, they
were asked to rank the degree by which such competencies had been included in the
core curriculum of the library school they attended. The survey questions were based
on the U.S. Office of Personnel Management Executive Core Qualification (ECQs),
which are competencies required for executive leadership and management positions.
Specifically, the ECQs define the competencies needed to lead change, lead people,
drive results, business acumen, and building coalitions. The foundation for success in
each of the ECQs is the fundamental competencies which are Interpersonal Skills,
Oral and Written Communications, Lifelong Learning, Integrity/Honesty, and Public
Service Motivation. Based on this study’s findings, the recommendations of this
researcher are for the American Library Association (ALA), the accrediting body of
library schools in the U.S.A. to: 1) Incorporate library leadership standards in the core
curriculum of the Masters in Library Science degree program, and 2) Create a
separate library leadership track for those aspiring to be State Librarians or leaders on
the County or Federal levels. This would include a one-year paid hybrid internship as
part of the degree requirements.

Chapter I
Introduction
Leadership is characterized by some core principles and competencies. The
application of these foundational competencies defines organizations and the
momentum by which they realize their vision and mission (Byham, Smith, & Paese,
2002). Similarly, for libraries, ingrained application of leadership or the lack of,
because if it’s transformational effects, has directly defined and will continue to
define library development and evolution into the 21st Century (Wilson, Del Tufo, &
Norman (2007). Leaders possess personal characteristics and traits that motivate and
enable an organization to achieve its long and short term goals and ultimately its
vision. Warren Bennis and Burt Nanus (1985) defined the four strategies of
leadership as a function of knowing yourself, having a vision that is well
communicated, building trust among colleagues, and taking effective action to realize
your own leadership potential.
John Maxwell (1998) simply defined leadership as the “ability to influence”
others (p. 11). By providing the right environment and tools, it in essence will create
a multitude of internal leaders, which will create the evergreen foundation from
which success will be built upon. Creating the right environment though requires that
a leader must also know and practice the principles of management of resources and
operations. Bennis and Nanus (1985) explained the difference between management
and leadership. Manage is described as: “To bring about, to accomplish, to have

1

charge of or responsibility for, to conduct” (p. 21), whereas, leading refers to
“influencing, guiding in direction, course, action, and opinion” (p. 21).
Given the importance, dynamism, and complexities of leadership, the
development of leadership talent through a core curriculum in institutions of higher
education, such as library schools should become a strategic imperative. According
to the latest information from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (2015), in the 10
years between “2014 and 2024, the employment of librarians is projected to grow at 2
percent, which is slower than the average for all occupations, which is 7%” (“Quick
Facts: Librarians Table”). The job prospects are that in the beginning of the decade,
competition will be high because of the limited leadership positions available, but it
will ease up in the latter part of the decade due to many more retirements of the baby
boom generation.
Professional librarians are not predominantly hired for their leadership skills
or potential, but rather they are selected and rewarded for their library experience or
simply because they possess a library degree. When hired, librarians are mainly
tasked to focus on the complexity of their jobs which often makes them (due largely
to “their” leadership’s direction) to neglect the aspect of their responsibilities related
to strategic planning, innovation, and planning for the future. “Most institutions have
never analyzed their organization’s leadership supply and demand, and when they do,
they underestimate the impact of mediocre leadership” (Hill, 2005, p. 27).
As per Hill (2005), “mediocre leadership may be the culprit to resistance to
change or no change at all” (p. 29). Being a leader should be a full-time job devoted

2

to building a culture of learning and change, especially cultural change throughout all
stratospheres of an organization. This cannot happen overnight and it cannot happen
with exercising unfledged leadership. It involves being a coach and mentor;
identifying and developing talent in people; building and leading a diverse team;
exercising influence without formal authority; managing conflict among multiple
internal and external stakeholders; and envisioning and implementing change as the
organization evolves, stewarding all along the vision and mission, objectives and
goals.
Natalie Bulick (2014) in her article “From Peer to Manager: Preparing to Lead
at the Beginning of Your Career,” she quotes Rooney (2010) saying that “Finding
time to mentor and providing financial support for staff to attend leadership training
in times of shrinking budgets and staff, is becoming more and more challenging and
problematic” (p. 5).
Given the statements of these authors, these challenges are obstructing leaders
from being leaders, which have and will have an impact on the rate at which libraries
are changing compared to the rate at which the market conditions are changing. At
the Earthware Symposium at Carnegie Mellon in October 2000, Raymond Kurzweil,
futurist and Founder and Chief Technology Officer of Kurzweil Applied Intelligence
said that,
The rate of technological progress currently doubles every decade, so a
hundred years of progress at the current rate will happen in 25 years, and that
change itself will reach an exponential rate of growth by 2015, meaning that
the rate of technological change is 75% or more, faster. (YouTube Video)

The subject of leadership, as in leading an organization, is not common, if at
all present in the core curricula of library schools around the nation. Unfortunately,
the traditional LIS curriculum does not adequately prepare graduate students for the
level of management responsibility assumed in many entry-level positions (Bulick,
2014). Only in alternative settings, such as seminars, conferences, or specialized
certificate programs can librarians seek to educate themselves (mostly by choice
rather than it being mandated) on these subjects (again, on-the-job training). The
infusion of leadership and management competencies are needed to mitigate the
challenges that the profession is facing in meeting the needs of service evolution,
leadership drain, aging workforce, and the lessoned degree in which new
professionals are entering the field.
Students graduating with a Master Degree in Library Science are often asked
to become either Directors of libraries or State Librarians, which requires more of
public and business administration competencies, more so than information
management. A high majority of current librarians in leadership positions have
learned to do their jobs while on the job. Only a small percentage of what their job
requires relates to being a traditional librarian as taught in library schools (MacKenzie
& Smith, 2009; Bulick, 2014). Though there are numerous studies on leadership
competencies among various professionals and advocacy groups, there is limited
literature on what the formal pedagogy for library leadership should be. The main
reason why librarians pursue a Masters in Library Science is to qualify for a library
leadership position, but then, once hired, they find themselves lacking the

4

fundamental competencies to be a leader. It is, therefore, important that the
profession focus on and identify these competencies and put in place the formal
infrastructure by which to deliver them.
Although there is no universally agreed upon definition of competencies,
various studies have proposed definitions that link core competencies to an
individual’s success in a particular activity. Dole, Hurych, and Liebst (2005) defined
competencies as: “skills and knowledge that can be learned and can be measured” (p.
125), which means that these competencies are acquired through knowledge and can
be quantified. The same is said by Hill (2005), “attributes and skills that cannot be
learned or evaluated cannot be developed through training, but can be acquired
through experience” (p. 29). Osa (2003) defined competencies as, “The combination
of knowledge, skills, and abilities which are relevant to a particular job position and
which, when acquired, allow a person to perform a task or function at a high level of
proficiency” (p. 37).
Giesecke and McNeil (1999) defined competencies “as a set of abilities,
attributes, skills, and knowledge that employees must possess to contribute to the
achievement of the set organizational goals” (p. 158). Irrespective of the definition,
the key aspect about these competencies is that they are something that can be learned
and then refined through experience.
Stewarding a vision and carrying out the mission requires steadfast leadership
and sound business administration. As with any business, a sound library is also one
that uses its operational resources efficiently and effectively, which calls for a strong

5

business and management foundation (MacKenzie & Smith, 2009). The library
profession, starting with the library schools, often oversees this side of operating a
library. Based on this researcher’s own experience from working in the library field,
and the literature to be presented, library schools perform a good job at preparing
librarians to be managers of information, but not managers of people, funding, and
other operating logistics.
Although the researcher realizes that librarianship is not a business-oriented
profession, the job still requires stewardship of taxpayer money, and must still be held
accountable for the administration of it. Libraries have to market their products,
navigate through the political environment, understand and evaluate economic and
demographic indicators vital to their programming and their collections, develop
budgets and strategic plans, use data and forecasting, manage human resources,
develop and evaluate policies, and measure results. This sounds more like a business
and public administration professional rather than a library professional. However,
the paragraph above just described a typical State Librarian’s responsibilities, yet
little, if any of these core competencies are taught in library schools.

Statement of the Problem
It is unknown what the content and pedagogy of a leadership program for
librarians would be. For someone seeking a leadership position in libraries, obtaining
a graduate degree in Library Information Science has little to do with the leadership
competencies needed to successfully lead and operationally manage a library in the
real world, as evidenced by the core curricula subjects of some of the top ten library

6

schools across the nation. As expected, these library schools support information
literacy and the philosophy of librarianship, which they should, but only a very small
percentage, if at all, have any business or public administration classes as part of their
core courses.
Although many outside (of library school) library advocacy organizations
have made concerted efforts in developing core competency lists, professional
development programs, leadership institutes, and measurement instruments to
improve management and administration of libraries, no formal curriculum has been
standardized regarding leadership and organizational management across the board.
In 2009, MacKenzie and Smith reviewed the curricula of 48 graduate library
school programs accredited by the American Library Association (ALA). The study
confirms that library managers are trained on the job. The focus of the question for
this exploratory study was on the library school programs accredited by the ALA that
should offer their students the knowledge they need to enter leadership and
management positions within the library profession. They found that only about
“43.8% of the 48 programs reviewed did not require management-related courses” (p.
7). “Of the 24 syllabi reviewed, 58.3% of the management courses included some
components of human resources concepts, and 54.2% included overviews of strategic
planning processes” (MacKenzie & Smith, 2009, p. 8). These results suggest that the
library profession is not yet clear and has yet to agree on the requirements for
preparing future library managers and leaders.

7

The role of library leader has greatly expanded, as well as the services.
Among what the 21st Century calls for are increased accountability, justification, and
proper use of the funding available to the libraries, as well as the outcomes and
results. In the current times, as we struggle to climb out of the economic downturn of
2008, financial, human, and material resources are scarce. This emphasizes even
more the need for effective business management and leadership skills.
Furthermore, this emphasis gets even more important with how the role of
libraries is evolving. Libraries tend to be all things to all people: a place for books, a
community center, a after school activity center, a lifelong learning center, a place for
relaxation and entertainment, a computer or job center, etc. If ten libraries were
asked what their core functions are, one would get close to ten different versions of
what those may be. Therefore, if library core services have been expanded, how can
library schools know what the core curriculum should be (Mulvaney & O’Connor,
2006)?
The importance of library and information services is; therefore, profound and
affects many facets of the community. Leadership development should be aimed at
preparing and positioning the organization’s most valued assets, that is, their staff, to
lead and with that, have the requisite skills to operationally manage libraries,
effectively and efficiently, in the 21st Century and beyond. In an ideal situation, the
field should have a formalized method by which to deliver such skills. In library
schools, it can be formalized through the curriculum, and in the library field, there
can be formalized continuing education forums specifically designed to create and

8

enhance leadership traits—which should become a continuing education mandated
requirement for the profession. Realizing the important role played by the leaders in
providing visionary guidance to the information service organizations, accrediting
bodies need to focus on developing leaders who can motivate and influence other
staff members in achieving the complex and ever changing roles of the libraries of the
future. The main question; therefore, rests on how best potential leaders can be
identified, and how best to provide support and opportunities for them to develop, as
well as encourage them to grow in the organization setting.
According to Mulvaney and O’Connor (2006), the library profession is going
through an identity crisis, based primarily because of the mismatch of what library
schools are teaching and the real-life demands of librarianship. Educators are
pushing theory and idealistic values of information provision, while practitioners are
experiencing challenges which most of the time have little to do with what they were
taught in library school. The gap is widening, according to “Statistical Reporting:
Summary of Changes in ALA-accredited Programs Fall 2010 to Fall 2011” (ALA,
2012), and that certainly does not support ALA’s accreditation standards (2015b)
II.2.5 (provides direction for future development of a rapidly changing field); and
II.3.7 (promotes commitment to continuous professional growth). Therefore, if the
“knowledge value” of the library degree is decreasing, (i.e. because of the mismatch
to real-world demands and the inflexibility of the degree married to the profession), it
may potentially result in the demise of the library profession, because the higher

9

education degree in library science will be meaningless to the profession and;
therefore, will not attract people to pursue this as a career track.
The consensus among practicing librarians as to what the core functions of a
library are seems to fall into four categories, which are also reflected by the majority
of the type of core courses library schools offer. These are cataloging, reference
services, acquisitions (purchases)/collection development, and management (of
information). The majority of libraries; however, have typically outsourced these
core functions because of lack of staff, lack of appropriate competencies, lack of
systems, and increased patron demands for quality service. Therefore, if library
schools mainly focus on the four categories mentioned above, and if these core
functions are outsourced the majority of the time, this brings up the key question as to
what the “knowledge value” of a library graduate degree really is. Outside of these
four core functions though, lies the business/operational side of the library, which has
been largely neglected.
Megan Oakleaf in her 2010 study named “The Value of Academic Libraries”
takes it a step further. She mentions the academic library, which is one of the types
of libraries, and cautions that not only are leaders supposed to provide managerial
services, but are also supposed to create value. In her work, she says:
Academic libraries have long enjoyed their status as the “heart of the
university.” However, in recent decades, higher education environments have
changed. Government officials see higher education as a national resource.
Employers view higher education institutions as producers of a commodity—
student learning. Top academic faculty expects higher education institutions

10

to support and promote cutting-edge research. Parents and students expect
higher education to enhance students’ collegiate experience, as well as propel
their career placement and earning potential. Not only do stakeholders count
on higher education institutions to achieve these goals, they also require them
to demonstrate evidence that they have achieved them. The same is true for
academic libraries; they too can provide evidence of their value. Community
college and university librarians no longer can rely on their stakeholders’
belief in their importance. Rather, they must demonstrate their value.
(Oakleaf, 2010, p. 11)
In describing the learning journey of a librarian and what it currently takes to
lead a library, a Children’s Librarian, which holds a Masters in Library Information
Science (MLIS) from the Seattle Public Library, wrote on the Association for Library
Services to Children (ALSC) blog:
Most of what you need to know to perform your job you will learn on the job.
Sometimes it will be a hard learning experience, but you will remember it
always. Other times it is the training you get from your employer. And
mostly it is getting to know and understanding the nuances of the particular
community you serve. Library school can teach you the philosophy and
provide you some practical experience, but there is nothing like being right in
the mix and learning every day. (Wallace, 2009, para. 1)
If libraries want to stay relevant in today’s and tomorrow’s economy, libraries
need a focused approach to leadership and business principles and practices. This
will help to better adapt and proactively plan for the evolving communities and
markets they serve, as well as provide the tools to establish systematic operational
foundations for consistency in quality and sustainability of library services. For many

11

years, Fortune 100 companies have used sophisticated mapping tools and advanced
databases to segment their markets in order to deliver products and services that meet
their customer’s expectations. Now more than ever, taxpayers and the government
demand more accountability in how budgets are managed and expect to see effective
program outcomes in their communities. For this to happen, it requires strong
leadership and a solid understanding of business principles and practices.

Purpose of Study
The purpose for this quantitative study is to provide evidence through gap
analysis (between the core curricula courses of library schools and the competencies
required to be an effective and successful library leader), as a basis to heighten the
urgency for the need to formalize leadership pedagogy for librarians.
The organization that accredits the curricula of library schools is the American
Library Association. This study recommends that the national accreditation standards
be expanded by creating a separate leadership track for those librarians seeking
leadership positions. This track would mainly include leadership, as well as business
and public administration courses, coupled with real-time field experience in a
leadership internship position as part of the core curriculum.
This separate leadership track would formalize and standardize a leadership
and organizational management core competency curriculum across the board, but
most importantly it would provide a basis by which to properly prepare library
students to assume library leadership positions upon graduation.

12

Need for the Study
ALA accreditation is a powerful tool. However, with the identity crises
libraries are going through, it is time to re-evaluate the curriculum that is accredited
and what ripple effects this has in the library profession.
Based on the latest trend summary statistical report by the American Library
Association, comparing enrollment numbers in fifty-six universities across the nation,
Puerto Rico and Canada, offering ALA accredited Masters in Library Science
degrees, between 2002 and 2015, we can see a decrease in the percentage of students
enrolling as a full-time student by 83% (ALA, 2016, “COA Stats Chart”). In this
report, the researcher took the actual enrollment numbers of each university from
2002 to 2015; then calculated the percentage of increase or decrease in the enrollment
year by year for each university. Those results were then averaged across all
universities by year. The researcher then compared the difference in percentage
between 2002 and 2015 to arrive at the 83% difference, see Figure 1 below. Could it
be because of the marriage of the Masters of Library Science degree to the profession
offering little flexibility to use in various careers may be decreasing the value of the
graduate library degree and; therefore, the enticement to enter library school by newer
generations?

Studies reveal that “more than 40% of librarians working today belong to the
Baby Boomer generation” (Tordella & Godfrey, 2009a, p. 7). The “average age” of
all working librarians today is in the “mid-50s” (Tordella & Godfrey, 2009a, p. 7).
This means that within a ten-year period or less, the majority of the “knowledge base”
will be vacating the profession. In addition, new librarians entering the profession are
middle aged too, which accelerates this phenomenon. The rate of students entering
the profession is much less than the rate of librarians retiring. Another phenomenon
that limits new librarians from entering the field is the economic downturn. Older
librarians are delaying retirement; therefore, limiting the number of open positions,
see Figure 2. As per Davis (2005), “between 2010 and 2020, the biggest retirement

14

wave occurs creating a deficit” of LIS graduates between 2015 and 2019 (p. 43).
Another valid point that Davis brings up is that it is not simply having LIS graduates
in the marketplace; it is having enough qualified librarians to promote into leadership
positions (p. 43).

This phenomenon is also evidenced by a longitudinal study called “Libraries A voyage of Discovery” conducted by Genoni and Smith (2005), which found that
out of the 419 graduates surveyed at Curtin University in Australia between 19881992, “all were qualified to practice as librarians. When the survey was repeated in
1998-2002, the survey was taken by 338 students of whom 289 were qualified to
practice as librarians” (Genoni & Smith , 2005, p. 15). Thus, this study revealed that
fewer students were entering the library field and even fewer were qualified to
practice as librarians. Although this is an example of an Australian University, the

15

central theme of the researcher’s message is that it is not only an issue trending in this
country, but one that applies globally in the library profession which makes it even
more concerning.

One can argue as to why we need libraries and librarians in the digital age in
the first place. In fact, an article written by Steve Barker in the Wall Street Journal
(2016) entitled “In Age of Google, Librarians Get Shelved: A Library-Science Degree
can’t Compete with Online Search, but We Still Have a Role” suggested that we may
be seeing “the end of a dying breed, the professional librarian” (para. 1).

16

Perhaps, this may explain the dwindling of new library professionals entering
the field. However, to this, in the American Libraries Magazine (2016) responded
ALA President Sari Feldman and President-Elect Julie Todaro that Barker’s view of
libraries rests in the traditional way people think about libraries (i.e. “as only books
and stewards of books”) (para. 4). Feldman and Todaro (2016) contend that the role
of a librarian and libraries, in general, has evolved beyond books (para. 4). Existing
space in libraries is being repurposed to support 21st Century learning and
innovation. For example, new technologies and equipment are provided to patrons
and primarily to underserved communities for learning more about and exploring
their passions, such as: making electronic music, building robots, utilizing 3-D
printers, attending teamwork-based programs, or even provide spaces to explore the
realms of entrepreneurship and starting their own business. More recently, with the
economic downturn, libraries have become job center hubs where people can create
resumes and learn how to apply for jobs online.
As a matter of fact, in an article in the Library Journal (2011) named “The
Recession's Effects,” Ray Lyons and Keith Curry Lance presented the findings of
their research on the effects of the “Great Recession” on libraries, which according to
the National Bureau of Economic Research, began in December 2007 and ended in
June 2009. The data sets for their study were obtained from the national database of
the Institute of Museum and Library Services. They compared the pre and postrecession, year to year changes in circulation and library visits per capita by
expenditure category. They found that in the majority of the spending categories, the

17

circulation and visits had doubled or even tripled (p. 7). This revealed an indirect
relationship between economic downturn and use of the libraries. As the economy
goes down, the use of libraries goes up.
This presents a huge dilemma for libraries, in that in hard economic times,
when budget cuts, staff shortages, and library branch closings are realized, the
demand for services exponentially increases, thus requiring doing more with less.
As per the latest survey from the Institute of Museum and Library Services
(IMLS), “in fiscal year 2013, there have been 1.5 billion in-person visits to libraries,
which is equivalent to about 4 million per day” (IMLS, 2016, p. 7). The value that
people still see in libraries is that it’s a place where they can trust for access to be
free, vetted research and information literacy, and this spans across to people of all
ages, socioeconomic, and educational backgrounds.
Statistical studies, such as these highlight and heighten the urgency for the
need to reassess and look for areas to strengthen the foundation of libraries and the
library profession starting from the core teachings of leadership and organizational
management in library schools, to developing cultures of assessment for performance
management for the sustainability of library institutions.
Libraries can no longer rest on their laurels as just being a public and valuable
public good. In times of competing budgets, it is critical that libraries are able to
articulate their value through evidence-based systems and assessment tools (Farkas,
2013).

18

A prerequisite in doing so is that library professionals possess and master the
appropriate competencies in leadership and organizational management.

Research Questions
The research questions that guide this study are:
1. What leadership competencies do incumbent library leaders in the nation
consider to be critical to their responsibilities?
2. Because the core curriculum must be more in-line with the actual duties
expected of those students when they enter the workforce as library
leaders, are library schools teaching their students these leadership
competencies?
3. What core curriculum topics should be added to fill the gaps between
leadership competencies required in the field and what library schools are
teaching Masters in Library Science degree program?

Chapter II
Literature Review
Introduction
This chapter is a detailed review of the literature and studies on leadership
competencies for library readers. The chapter presents a detailed account of
leadership competencies as discussed in various studies conducted in this field. This
researcher has read through and analyzed various studies, as well as conducted a
critical review of these studies.

Inclusion Criteria
The majority of the literature review was found in the Wilmington
University’s online library. The main databases accessed included EBSCO host,
Academic Search Premier, ERIC, Education Research Complete, Library Journal
Locator (journals, such as Library Journal, American Library), and Library
Information Science & Technology Abstract (LISTA). Search terms, such as library
leadership; library management and administration; library school and business
management; library and information science education; and library core
competencies were used in searching the databases. Specific websites searched were
the American Library Association (ALA); the American Assembly of Collegiate
Schools of Business (AACSB); and Association for Library and Information Science
Education (ALISE).
In addition, Google was utilized to locate current events, related information,
blogs, and other pertinent references. Other resources included books and journals

20

loaned from the library or the researcher’s personal library, such as Library Journal,
American Library, Online Computer Literacy Center (OCLC) “Perceptions of
Libraries” (2011b); “Geek the Library: A Community Awareness Campaign”
(2011a); Public Agenda, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation with support from the
Americans for Libraries Council (ALC) “Long Overdue: A Fresh Look at Public and
Leadership Attitudes about Libraries in the 21st Century (2006);” and “The Atlas of
New Librarianship” (Lankes, 2011).

History of Library Education
It was in the mid-1800s, with the expansion of libraries and their collections
when those in the library field saw the need for systematic education and training on
how to bring order to the collections, specifically, techniques of information
organization and management (Lynch, 2008).
The year 1876 is noted as the year the library profession emerged (Lynch,
2008, p. 932). Although there is evidence that the profession had emerged earlier, in
1853, with the organization of the first Librarians’ Conference, the Civil War and the
post war construction had consumed the country and thus stifled the progress in
formally establishing librarianship as a profession. The reason why 1876 was noted
as the year the library profession emerged was because of three key events that took
place that year: the first was the issuance of the first publication of Library Journal
(founded as the American Library Journal); the second was the 1876 conference in
Philadelphia, which led to the formation of the American Library Association; and
the third is the publication by the U.S. Bureau of Education (1965) of “Public

21

Libraries in the United States of America (1876 Report), Their History, Condition,
and Management.” This publication documented the development of libraries and
featured papers on the perceived standards of practice, as they existed at the time.
Specifically, the 1876 publication called for the recognition of the scope and value of
the library profession, that it is “more than being a mere custodian of books” (Lynch,
2008, p. 934).
According to Lynch (2008), Dr. F. Rullman, in 1874, a librarian at the
University of Frieberg in Germany, was the first to formally propose that the
librarians should be educated and trained for a period of three years and in the end be
examined and certified (p. 934). As part of this recommendation, Rullman proposed
the first curriculum. Interestingly enough, the nature of this curriculum is not really
different from today’s library school philosophy (p. 934).
Linguistics was a major part of the curriculum where the librarian had to
know German, French, Latin, Greek, Hebrew, English, Italian, and Spanish. Other
courses included:


General history and collateral studies, such as diplomacy;



Systematic universal encyclopedia of sciences, with special emphasis as to
the best way of defining the proper limits of each science;



Universal history of literature production with special focus on their
scientific and booksellers’ value;



Knowledge of manuscripts;



History of art and printing;



History of book trade;

22



Some knowledge of fine arts so to allow the librarian to distinguish the
true value of engravings, (copper, steel, and wood) lithographs, and
photographs;



Library science;



Bibliothecography (study of books);



Library economy (administration, financial management, etc.);



Cataloguing and classifying books and manuscripts;



Management of archives. (Lynch, 2008, p. 935)

During this time, leaders in the United States university libraries were also
seeking systematic ways of expanding their knowledge of librarianship, especially
after the Civil War. According to the publication of Public Libraries in the United
States, “2,240 libraries were established between 1850 and 1875” (Lynch, 2008, p.
936).
One of the leaders during this time was Andrew Carnegie. He was a big
supporter of libraries and invested a considerable amount of money in building them.
As libraries expanded, the competencies of library administrators began to come into
focus even more. Because at the time there was no official or standardized training
for librarians, the method of instruction was “management by imitation,” where the
board of a new library would send their librarian for two or three weeks to a large and
established city library to learn by observation from the more seasoned librarians, and
to get a chance to work in some of its departments (Lynch, 2008; Vann, 1961).
Another library pioneer during this era was Melvil Dewey (Lynch, 2008). He
is most famously known for developing the classification system for library

23

collections—the Dewey decimal system. His influence on library education in the
United States has been the center of much study (Lynch, 2008; Vann, 1961; Wiegand,
1996) and criticism (Lynch, 2008; Williamson, 1971).
Dewey was faulted for being too technical and making library education “antiintellectual” or too vocational and not research based. He did not require graduation
as an entrance requirement. Dewey was seeking ways of making the practice more
economical and standardized. He did not have a lot of experience in a large
university until his appointment to Columbia University and thus was less interested
in the administration of libraries. He was; however, credited for developing the
“ABCs of practice”, something that was not in existence prior to the Dewey school
(Lynch, 2008; Miska, 1986; Williamson, 1971).
In 1915, the Carnegie Foundation had a growing interest in library training
and hired a consultant to evaluate how adequate were the library schools that the
Foundation was supporting in their outputs of trained librarians. The Foundation at
the time was supporting four library training programs at Western Reserve
University, the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, the Carnegie Library of Atlanta, and
the New York public libraries.
The consultant Alvin Saunders Johnson’s findings were not exactly what
Carnegie wanted to hear (Lynch, 2008). Johnson found that all of the thirteen library
schools in existence failed to meet expectations and adequately prepare librarians for
administration (lack of standards) (Lynch, 2008, p. 938).

24

Although the Foundation rejected most of the recommendations made by
Johnson, they did make note of them realizing that there are many more issues in
training librarians. Despite that, Johnson was replaced by C.C. Williamson (Lynch,
2008).
Williamson (1971) proved to be another pioneer in American library
education history. Ironically enough, Williamson’s findings were similar to
Johnson’s. Williamson advocated for the establishment of standards for library
education and demanded that the profession go beyond technique and become
research based. Williamson’s efforts are credited in establishing the American
Library Association as the accrediting agency for library schools (Lynch, 2008).
Williamson (1923/1971) was one of the first to distinguish and define library
job roles. He distinguished between professional work and clerical work and
recommended different trainings to be offered to each of the job roles. He contended
that the clerical work can be performed by someone with a high school diploma
coupled with a short training course in library methods provided by their individual
library. The challenge with this, however, was that as the jobs and roles of librarians
evolved and changed, so did what was considered professional or paraprofessional,
and so did the expectations of the people working in libraries (Lynch, 2008; Lynch &
Smith, 2001; Oberg, 1992; Rider, 1996; Sweeney, 2006; Veaner, 1982).
Williamson (1923/1971) believed that library schools should provide four
years of general studies (almost like today’s Liberal Arts degree), with an additional
year of graduate study in a “properly organized library school” (Williamson,

25

1923/1971, pp. 12-13). He left the responsibility of nuts and bolts training to the
individual library level. His reasoning behind this was that each library was unique in
its needs and; therefore, the knowledge, skills, and abilities of their staff should match
those needs (Lynch, 2008).
In his reports, Williamson (1971) studied the curriculum of eleven library
schools and found that the top five courses offered were Cataloging, Book Selection,
Reference Work, Classification, and Administration. Specializations that were taught
were Children’s Work, Public Documents, History of Libraries, and School Libraries.
These topics reflected the demands of librarians that were employing the graduates.
Library schools were offering what they called “education for the field” (Lynch,
2008, p. 932).
Between 1970 and 2002, with the influence of the Williamson (1971) reports,
the American Library Association changed and evolved their education policy
statement from “Library Education and Manpower”, to “Library Education and
Personnel Utilization”, to “Library Information Studies and Human Resource
Utilization.” These policy documents attempt to identify the various categories of
library personnel, and the training and education required for each level. Since the
Williamson (1971) reports, the library jobs have expanded into specializations
(children’s librarian, reference librarian, academic librarian, K-12 school librarian,
and more) and the Association recognized that other specializations, in addition to the
librarian’s job, are required for the effective and efficient operation of libraries. The

26

specializations were the reason why elective courses were infused into the LIS
curriculum.
Between 1980 and 1990 marked the era of the Information Age due to the
introduction of the Internet. This era set a new set of challenges for libraries to adept
to the digital age. Over the course of the years, libraries had to dissolve the physical
boundaries for providing information and evolve into “libraries without walls”,
“digital libraries”, or “virtual libraries”. This as we can imagine, must have placed
tremendous pressure to infuse new training requirements and standards of operation
for libraries, establish a culture of change, and a new way of thinking.
This prompted the Kellogg-ALISE Information Professions and Education
Renewal (KALIPER) project (1998-2000), which was the most comprehensive study
of the Library and Information Science (LIS) curricula, since the Williamson (1971)
report in 1923. It was conducted by the Association for Library and Information
Science Education (ALISE), a non-profit organization that promotes and advocates
for innovation and excellence in library education. The research team was made up
of twenty library scholars from a variety of library disciplines. It was a two-year
study, implemented in phases, incorporating the participation of library schools
around the nation and Canada.
Joan Durrance, a professor of library science and chair of the Advisory
Committee to KALIPER, stated the following at the Annual Meeting of ALISE in
2000:

27

The Williamson Report, credited with major changes in education of
librarians including the development of the first standards for library
education, was quite negative about the state of library education at the
beginning of the 20th Century. On the other hand, the KALIPER Scholars
have found a vibrant, dynamic, changing field which is under-taking an array
of initiatives as seen in the large number of schools examined by the
KALIPER Scholars. (Chandler, 2001, p. 248)
The KALIPER project researchers, in their Executive Summary, indicated
some trends that were shaping the LIS programs (Chandler, 2001):
1. In addition to libraries as institutions and library-specific operations, LIS
curriculum is addressing broad-based information environments and
information problems.
2. While LIS curriculum continues to incorporate perspectives from other
disciplines, a unique core has taken shape that is predominantly user
centered.
3. LIS schools are increasing their investment and infusion of information
technology into their curricula.
4. LIS schools are offering students greater flexibility in tailoring their
programs around specific areas of interest.
5. LIS schools are offering instruction in different formats to provide
students with more flexibility.
6. LIS schools are expanding their programs by offering related degrees at
the undergraduate, master’s, and doctoral levels. (p. 248)
The core LIS knowledge base was constant for the first half-century of the
nation’s library education. The introduction of computers and the internet in the
1990’s was a pivotal turning point in the information industry. Marco (1994)

28

identified two factors that greatly diversified and deemphasized this core base of
knowledge (p. 176). The first factor was “the introduction of technology into the
curriculum: use of technology became a must for solving information problems” (p.
176). The second factor was “the emphasis on specialization in library practice and
the introduction of elective courses” (p. 176).
Despite the evolution of library education from the Williamson reports (1971)
to the KALIPER report (2000) and beyond, library leadership and organizational
management (as an executive specialization) still have a very weak presence in the
core curriculum, as seen in the literature review, and have yet to be added or
recognized as a needed specialization.
Although there will always be areas where library staff need to be trained on
the individual library level, the education for the leadership and business
administration of libraries is universal and needs to rise to the graduate level library
school.

Accreditation Standards, Guidelines and Bodies
Accreditation history. Around the time of the library fathers (Andrew
Carnegie, Dewey…etc.) and when the first libraries started to emerge was when the
first regional accrediting agencies started to form (1880s). The focus was to form
educational standards and admissions procedures for higher education institutions.
The need eventually arose to develop policies to allow transfer of credits and
recognition of degrees between the United States and foreign countries, so; therefore,
the first national (minimum quality) standards were formed.

29

The first to establish national accrediting standards was a group of twenty
three private career schools in 1912 that formed the National Association of
Accredited Commercial Schools (ACICS, 2010, para. 2). Forty-four years later, with
the passing of the Vietnam-Era Veteran’s Readjustment Assistance Act of 1974,
which federally recognized accrediting agencies, the U.S. Department of Education
recognized ACICS as a reliable source for determining the quality of education and
training of institutions of higher education (ACICS, 2010, para. 2).
Six years after ACICS was formed, another national accreditation association
emerged called the American Council on Education (ACE). This association inserted
more qualitative aspects to the accreditation process by not only looking for
standardization, but also effectiveness and the reduction of duplications in the
accreditation process (ACICS, 2010, para. 3).
By the 1930’s accreditation of higher education was well established. By the
end of World War II, and with the aid of the Servicemen’s Readjustment Act, known
as the GI Bill (1944) where many sought higher education, national accrediting
agencies exponentially increased (ACICS, 2010, para. 4).
In 1949, in response to this rapid increase of agencies, the need to further
standardize was realized, so the major national higher education accrediting
associations consolidated and formed a national association on institutional
accreditation called the National Commission on Accrediting (NCA) (ACICS, 2010,
para. 4). At the same time and for the same reasons, the regional accrediting agencies
consolidated as well and formed the National Committee of Regional Accrediting

30

agencies (NRCAA), which was eventually renamed the Federation of Regional
Accrediting Commissions of Higher Education (FRACHE) (ACICS, 2010, para. 4).
In 1975, in an effort to even further improve the accreditation process, the
self-regulating national accrediting agencies NCA (national) and FRACHE (regional)
merged and created a unified national organization called the Council on
Postsecondary Accreditation (COPA) (ACICS, 2010, para. 6). Eventually, in 1996,
due to Higher Education challenges in the late 1980s and early 1990s, COPA was
replaced with the Council for Higher Education (CHEA). In addition to the U.S.
Department of Education, CHEA has also recognized ACICS as a reliable source for
determining the quality of education and training of institutions of higher education
(ACICS, 2010, para. 8).
The American Library Association is recognized by CHEA as the accrediting
agency for library schools (ACICS, 2010, para. 8). Within the ALA, there is a 12member committee called the Committee on Accreditation (COA), which is
responsible for the execution of the library school accreditation program. The
membership consists of ten personal ALA members of which one needs to be from
Canada and the two remaining are at-large members representing the public.
ALA accreditation standards. Presently ALA accredits 63 programs at 58
higher education institutions in the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico. As an
accrediting body, they set the standards for librarianship. There are five components
that are evaluated for accreditation. Among the five is the evaluation of curriculum.

31

Below, the researcher lists the five by name and quotes the standard for curriculum,
because this is where the focal point is (American Library Association, 2015b):

II.

Systematic Planning
Curriculum
II.1 The curriculum is based on goals and objectives, and evolves in
response to an ongoing systematic planning process involving
representation from all constituencies. Within this general
framework, the curriculum provides, through a variety of
educational experiences, for the study of theory, principles,
practice, and legal and ethical issues and values necessary for the
provision of service in libraries and information agencies and in
other contexts. The curriculum is revised regularly to keep it
current.
II.2 The curriculum is concerned with information resources and the
services and technologies to facilitate their management and use.
Within this overarching concept, the curriculum of library and
information studies encompasses information and knowledge
creation, communication, identification, selection, acquisition,
organization and description, storage and retrieval, preservation
and curation, analysis, interpretation, evaluation, synthesis,
dissemination, use and users, and management of human and
information resources.
II.2.1 Fosters development of libraries and information
professionals’ who will assume a leadership role in
providing services and collections appropriate for the
communities that are served;
II.2.2 Emphasizes an evolving body of knowledge that
reflects the findings of basic and applied research from
relevant fields;

32

II.2.3 Integrates technology and the theories that underpin its
design, application, and use;
II.2.4 Responds to the needs of a diverse and global society,
including the needs of underserved groups;
II.2.5 Provides direction for future development of a rapidly
changing field;
II.2.6 Promotes commitment to continuous professional
development and lifelong learning, including the skills
and competencies that are needed for the practitioner of
the future.
II.3 The curriculum provides the opportunity for students to construct
coherent programs of study that allow individual needs, goals,
and aspirations to be met within the context of program
requirements established by the school and that will foster the
attainment of student learning outcomes. The curriculum
includes as appropriate cooperative degree programs,
interdisciplinary coursework and research, experiential
opportunities, and other similar activities. Course content and
sequence relationships within the curriculum are evident.
II.4 Design of general and specialized curricula takes into account the
statements of knowledge and competencies developed by
relevant professional organizations.
II.5 Procedures for the continual evaluation of the curriculum are
established with input not only from faculty but also
representatives from those served. The curriculum is continually
evaluated with input not only from faculty, but also
representatives from those served including students, employers,
alumni, and other constituents. Curricular evaluation is used for

33

ongoing appraisal and to make improvements. Evaluation of the
curriculum includes assessment of students' achievements.
II.6 The program has explicit, documented evidence of its ongoing
decision-making processes and the data to substantiate the
evaluation of the curriculum.
II.7 The program demonstrates how the results of the evaluation of
the curriculum are systematically used to improve the program
and to plan for the future.

In reviewing the 2015 accreditation standards, despite the fact that they
support and look for systematic evaluation processes in place to ensure the
adaptation, evolution, peer review, and relevant student learning outcomes of the
curriculum content, further research has shown that there is still a disconnect between
what is taught in library schools and the real demands of the job. For the most part,
the proper training needed by a professional librarian has been obtained on-the-job.
Lynch (2008) found that the responsibility rested with the individual library, not
library school as to the nature and level of training needed for their staff.
Business acumen set aside, Gorman who was the ALA President in 2006,
commented and criticized the process of updating the 1992 [ALA] Standards for
accreditation of master’s programs in library and information studies saying that the
updating of the standards concentrated more on process rather than substance, and
that it had serious flaws (Gorman, 2006, p. 1).

34

Gorman went on to say that the minor changes that were made were mostly
wording changes which still had to address the real concerns of the profession and of
ALA members (p. 6). The Standards continued to be “indicative” and not
prescriptive and the descriptions of the core programs were still not standardized
across the board, leaving much room for individual interpretation by the schools (p.
2). This to Gorman was the primary reason why ALA-accredited library schools have
been failing to provide adequate library science education (p. 3). This issue is
compounded by the fact that Information Science full-time faculty, where many are
from other fields, are not enough or adequate and the research that they do is often
unrelated to the library information field. The core curriculum is taught by part-time
staff, which do not do research on the core courses (p. 5)
MacKenzie and Smith (2009) studied the curricula of 48 programs offered by
library schools and found that “almost half of those programs did not require
organizational management-related courses and only 2% of the elective courses were
management-related” (p. 136). The MacKenzie-Smith study concluded that “… as a
result of the lack of explicit guidance from ALA as to how the master’s level
curriculum should endure specific people-management learning outcomes, library
managers enter the field at a disadvantage” (p. 140).
Schreiner and Pope (2011), in their study related to library school curricula,
where 1,093 professional librarians responded (defined as librarians with a Masters
degree accredited by ALA), found that “40.0% either thought not enough

35

management training was provided by library schools or they were uncertain if library
schools were providing adequate training in management (45.6%)” (p. 6).
Challenges to change. ALA cannot change library education on its own
(Burger, 2007). The change in library education must be a grassroots effort at the
institutional levels. ALA accreditation is considered a “gold standard” for graduate
library degrees. As Leslie Burger (2007), past ALA President noted: “Clearly,
whatever standards we adopt dealing with program accreditation have the ability to
influence and change the nature of library education” (p. 5).
June Lester, a past ALA accreditation committee member and involved in
library education for 17 years, in her article in the Library Journal (1990), discussed
three issues that she perceived as challenges to change: library accreditation, library
identity, and the supply of library educators and library students.
To expand ALA’s accreditation charge, the Council on Postsecondary
Accreditation (COPA), which is now the Council for Higher Education (CHEA),
would have to recognize a change in the scope of ALA’s oversight and activities as
an accrediting agency; for right now they are not about to give up their stronghold
(Lester, 1990). Other accreditation bodies have interests and potential claims on the
Information Science systems turf, such as the Computing Sciences Accreditation
Board, the American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business, and the
Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology.
The identity issue is two-pronged: one is the discrepancy between what library
schools teach and the type of competencies needed to be productive in the workspace;

36

and the other is the library school’s own identity as embodied within a university.
With the widening scope of information services, the universities seek to expand
information studies to a broader market of institutions, not just libraries, in order to
ensure an adequate supply of students. The domino effect of these market conditions
and concerns has forced library school dean resignations and program cuts to many
schools.
On the issue of supply, Lester (1990) pointed out that “we have to ensure not
only how to provide an adequate flow of entrants to the profession, but also how to
ensure an adequate supply of students for the schools” (p. 583). If market forces
eliminate specialty programs from the curriculum or there is insufficient full-time
staff to teach a specialty, it would deter students from choosing these
underrepresented specialties. This marks the beginning of a vicious cycle where the
atrophy in these specialties will result in an inadequate supply of professional
librarians with doctorate degrees in these underrepresented specialties to teach in
library schools. Universities would not want to hire them because they lack the
doctorate.
As per Lester (1990), the cures to these challenges would be to:
a) Broaden the support and participation in the accreditation process. ALA
should take a leadership role in moving towards accrediting information
studies, beyond just the scope of librarianship;
b) Develop a policy aimed at increasing the supply of students and faculty by
encouraging higher and more competitive salaries, focusing on labor
market needs, illustrating the value of information specialists, and

37

intensifying recruitment efforts at the national, state and regional levels,
and
c) Initiate a dialog between the library schools, ALA, and other library
associations, so that library schools become more aware and be more in
tune with the concerns of the field, such as staff shortages and curriculum
issues. (pp. 581-582)
Other studies. The “Long Overdue: A Fresh Look at Public and Leadership
Attitudes about Libraries in the 21st Century” study conducted by Public Agenda and
supported by the Americans for Libraries Council (ALC) (2006), interviewed national
and community political leaders, businesses, education, public health, library users
and none users, those who run libraries, and those who provide oversight and funding
to libraries. After randomly interviewing 1,203 adults, 18 years of age and older,
there were six themes that started to emerge, which according to ALC, is the first step
in developing a national agenda for libraries, library development, and library funding
in the 21st Century. Interviewed leaders believed that libraries are indispensable, but
vulnerable. Civic leaders worried that libraries may be resting on their laurels and are
not open enough to change. There was a general consensus among these leaders that
libraries can take a more active role in helping tackle economic development, adult
education, immigration, and public health. However, despite the fact that some
libraries do a fantastic job at showcasing these capabilities, the majority (summative)
feeling out there is that libraries are not persuasive enough (Public Agenda, 2006, p.
36). Although they do great things, they always tend to fall to the bottom of the list
when it comes to local and state budget priorities.

38

Many leaders believe “that library education needs to change so that librarians
are better trained to be advocates and leaders of institutional growth and change”
(Public Agenda, 2006, p. 36).
In “The Atlas of New Librarianship” (Lankes, 2011), in talking about library
education, believes that today’s library schools need to go beyond the status quo
curriculum and proactively seek content and programming outside of the current
knowledge of the field. He goes on to say that two years at the Master’s level
education is not enough to possibly learn all that they need to know. This is why he
and other high-level administrators at library schools, as part of the McArthur project,
believe that the library school Master’s level education has failed to contribute the
value and the respect the library field deserves.
Lankes (2011) contends that librarians need to know different things
depending on which level they are in their career, therefore, library education should
not be restricted to the Master’s level, but should be expanded to the bachelor’s and
doctorate levels.
AACSB accreditation standards. The preamble in the accreditation
standards of The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (2016) for
business schools emphasizes that there is a direct relationship between the evolution
of business and the evolution of higher education. Higher education needs to be in
the forefront, preparing, changing, and adapting its curriculum to the current and
future trends so that businesses can be relevant and sustainable. It would then be
logical to conclude that libraries, being a “business” would require the same demands

39

of its higher education institutions so that they too would be relevant and sustainable
organizations.
There are 15 business accreditation standards that the AACSB (2016)
requires, which are the mission and vision statements, student focused standards,
faculty and staff focused standards, financial responsibility of the school, continuous
improvement, and innovation in course design, and ethics. One of the standards is the
curriculum and this researcher quotes as she did with ALA. It is interesting to note
how relevant this content is in preparing a library professional/leader.

Review of Current Literature on Library Leadership Skills
Developing leadership and competency among library leaders. A number
of scholars distinguish the role of management and that of leadership. Leadership
deals with mentoring, motivating, empowering, and inspiring others while
management deals with organizing the functions within a given organization. In
reality, they are two halves of the same whole—you can’t have one without the other.
Ammons-Stephens, Cole, Jenkins-Gibbs, Richle, and Weare (2009) indicated that
there are several competencies that are required by librarian leaders. These are
crucial competencies that leaders should possess to propel the library organization
further. Ammons-Stephens et al. (2009) listed six main attributes that are required for
the library profession. These include “leadership, planning, abilities, skills,
individual traits, and areas of knowledge” (p. 65). In their work, Ammons-Stephens
et al. (2009) listed the major attributes of prospective directors under three
subheadings, namely:
Managerial attributes, personal characteristics, and general areas of
knowledge. Managerial attributes encompass managing, leading and
planning; personal characteristics entail strategies that leaders use to deal with

42

others and motivate them while general areas of knowledge deal with learning
and assimilations of the tactics into the leadership role. (p. 65)
Hopper (2005) and Hernon and Rossiter (2006) introduced another attribute
defining leadership effectiveness that had not been mentioned in library studies
before. It was the “attribute of Emotional Intelligence (EI)” (p. 1). To do their
research, they used the Hernon and Rossiter (2006) study data to compare the top five
rated traits plus other identified traits not mentioned in the report to Emotional
Intelligence (Euster, 1988; Hernon, Powell, & Young, 2001, 2002; Mason &
Wetherbee, 2004; Phipps, 2004; Weiner, 2003; Williams & Winston, 2003). The
Hernon and Rossiter study was the first empirical study on library leadership
effectiveness using the characteristics that defined EI.
The Hernon and Rossiter (2006) study based its research on the Daniel
Goleman’s study on Emotional Intelligence. Goleman (1995) was the first to
popularize the term Emotional Intelligence and his findings revealed a direct
relationship between levels of EI and leadership effectiveness. Furthermore,
Goleman distilled EI into five categories, which were self-awareness, self-regulation,
motivation, empathy, and social skills. The first three relate to self-management and
the other two relate to managing others.
The Hernon and Rossiter (2006) study consisted of two parts. The first part
consisted of a content analysis of job advertisements placed in the College &
Research Libraries News publications from 2000 through 2004 (226 advertisements)
for the position of library director by professional academic library institutions (p.

43

261). The objective for analyzing these advertisements was to look for leadership
traits sought by these institutions. The leadership traits found in the advertisements
were sorted by the Goleman EI categories and prioritized by the number of times each
trait was mentioned.
The second part was a questionnaire surveyed directors in the Academic
Research Library (ARL) professional institution (p. 262). “Total population surveyed
was 102 of which 70 responded (68.6% response rate)” (Hernon & Rossiter, 2006, p.
262). The survey tabulated Goleman’s five EI categories and asked the respondents
to list traits they thought were important for that category and then, among those,
choose the five most important ones.

Hernon-Rossiter 2006 Study
Part I: Content analysis of advertisements. The first category, selfawareness (understanding of one’s self and one’s effect on others) listed five traits.
“The highest trait mentioned 45 times out of 226 advertisements, 19.9% was record
of proven innovative and effective leadership” (p. 262). The second highest was
“respect for individuality and diversity (ten times),” followed by “Respect
scholarship, learning, and teaching (3 times);” “Articulate (2 times);” and
“Enthusiastic (2 times)” (Hernon & Rossiter, 2006, p. 262).
The second category, self-regulation (think before acting and self-control)
listed four traits. The highest trait mentioned (ten times) was “broad knowledge of
issues”, followed by “comfortable with change” (6); “think ‘outside the box’ in new

44

and creative ways” (4); “flexible in adapting to change or overcoming obstacles” (1)
(Hernon & Rossiter, 2006, p. 262).
The third category, motivation (pursue goals with energy and persistence,
passion for work, and getting others to pursue a shared vision), listed eight traits. The
order in which they came in was “Visionary—able to build a shared vision and rally
others around it” (forty six times); “Commitment to job, organization, institution, and
profession” (18); “Creative” (17); “Good oral and written presentation skills” (15);
“Create an environment that fosters accountability” (5); “High energy level” (5);
“Motivate people to develop and adhere to a shared vision” (1); “Encourage
reasonable risk taking” (1) (Hernon & Rossiter, 2006, p. 262).
The fourth category, empathy (ability to understand the emotional makeup of
others and the skill to treat people according to their emotional reactions) listed only
two traits. The first was “good interpersonal/people skills” (mentioned twenty-seven
times), and “cross-cultural sensitivity and record of achievement” (1) (Hernon &
Rossiter, 2006, p. 262).
The fifth and final category, social skill (ability to manage relationships and
build networks, and ability to find common ground and build rapport) listed ten traits.
They appeared as follows: “Collaborative” (thirty five times); “advocate for
librarians’ role in higher education” (13); “develop and foster partnerships” (8); “help
participants in meetings, consortia, and cooperative endeavors to be results oriented
(6); “lead in a shared decision-making environment” (5), “consensus building in
carrying out strategic direction” (4); “expertise in building and leading teams”(4), and

45

“enabler and facilitator” (3); “good people networking skills” (1); and “resonance
(inspiring people to work together to solve problems, inspiring excellence)” (1)
(Hernon & Rossiter, 2006, pp. 262-263).
Part II: Survey. In the first category, self-awareness (understanding of one’s
self and one’s effect on others), the five most important traits were ranked as follows:
1. Cognitive ability to deal with complex scenarios/situations;
2. Realistic understanding of oneself: emotions, strengths, weaknesses,
needs, and drives;
3. Know where he or she is going—taking the organization;
4. Sense of humor; and
5. Respect individuality and diversity. (Hernon & Rossiter, 2006, p. 264)
In the second category, self-regulation (think before acting and self-control):
1. Stable temperament and ability to maintain an emotional balance under
constant tensions;
2. Integrity;
3. Tied were Comfortable in making judgment calls and Comfortable with
ambiguity;
4. Flexible in adapting to change or overcoming obstacles; and
5. Skill at diagnostic, strategic, and tactical reasoning. (Hernon & Rossiter,
2006, p. 265)
In the third category, motivation (pursue goals with energy and persistence,
passion for work, and getting others to pursue a shared vision):
1. Visionary;
2. Motivate people to develop and adhere to a shared vision;
3. Commitment to job, organization, institution, and profession;

46

4. Articulate direction for the library; and
5. Optimism (even in the face of failure). (Hernon & Rossiter, 2006, p. 265)
In the fourth category, empathy (ability to understand the emotional makeup
of others and the skill to treat people according to their emotional reactions):
1. Treat people with dignity/ respect;
2. Tied were Attract, build, and retain talent and Good interpersonal/people
skills;
3. Keep organization focused on high-quality service
4. Exercises good judgment; and
5. Good listener. (Hernon & Rossiter, 2006, p. 266)
In the fifth and final category, social skill (ability to manage relationships and
build networks, and ability to find common ground and build rapport):
1. Ability to function in a political environment;
2. Effective in leading change;
3. Develop and foster partnerships;
4. Collaborative; and
5. Tied were Build rapport with a wide circle of people and Resonance
(inspiring people to work together to solve problems, inspiring
excellence). (Hernon & Rossiter, 2006, p. 266)
The Hopper study compared the Hernon-Rossiter analysis and findings in the
five EI categories with the preferred traits for library leaders cited by authors of
articles on library leadership (Gertzog, 1989; Mech & McCabe, 1998; Riggs, 1998;
Winston, 2001; Woodsworth & Von Wahlde, 1988). The objective was to see how
many times the ninety six traits in the Hernon-Rossiter (2006) study were repeated in

47

the library leader articles and to also list any additional traits not mentioned by
Hernon-Rossiter.
In the self-awareness, first EI category, each of the twenty-three traits in the
Hernon-Rossiter (2006) study was mentioned at least once in the library leader
articles. The trait that ranked the highest in both studies was “self-confidence,” but
not a trait that ranked among the highest five in the Hernon-Rossiter study. “Overall,
the combined total points given to the traits associated with self-awareness by both
studies were 550 with a combined average of 22.916” (Hopper, 2005, p. 11). This
average makes self-awareness the least valued among the five EI components. New
traits that fit in this category that were found in the library leader articles were
“professional credentials, such as: a Ph.D., communicating the teaching role of
librarians, sharing power, truth-seeking, and risk-taking” (p. 10).
In the self-regulation, second EI category, each of the twenty-five traits in the
Hernon-Rossiter study also received at least one mention in the library leader articles.
The trait that ranked the highest in both studies was “comfortable with change”—a
trait that appeared in the top five rankings in the Hernon study. Overall, “the
combined total points given to this category by both studies was 613 with a combined
average of 47.15, making self-regulation the highest valued trait among the five EI
components” (Hopper, 2005, p. 15). There were twenty-three new traits mentioned in
the library leader articles, but the two most highest mentioned were decisive and
generous (p. 14).

48

In the motivation, third EI category, the trait of “visionary” received twice as
much the mentions in both studies. This trait ranked number one in both parts of the
Hernon-Rossiter study. Overall, “the combined total points given to this category by
both studies was 701 with a combined average of 35.05, making it the third most
valued trait among the five EI components” (Hopper, 2005, p. 18). There were
sixteen new traits mentioned in the library leader articles, but the four highest
mentioned were action-oriented, inspired, ambitious, and leads by example (p. 18).
In the empathy, fourth EI category, the traits were mentioned the least amount
of times; only ten times. However, the traits received high value points. The highest
ranking trait was “treat people with dignity/respect” (Hopper, 2005, p. 19). In the
Hernon-Rossiter (2006) study, this trait did not make it to the highest mentioned in
the job advertisement part, but was ranked number one in the second part where
library professionals were surveyed. Overall, “the combined total points given to this
category by both studies was 462 with a combined average of 42, making empathy
the second most valued of the EI components” (p. 21). There were fourteen new
traits mentioned in the library leader articles, but the single highest mentioned was
trusting (in others) (p. 20). The Hernon-Rossiter study lists trustworthiness under the
second EI category of self-regulation, but the meaning is different in that it means
how trustworthy the leader is vs. how trusting the leader is of others.
In the social skills, final and fifth EI category, the traits were mentioned
moderately between the two studies with “build rapport with a wide circle of people”
and “collaborative” ranking the highest (p. 21). These traits ranked number one in

49

both parts of the Hernon-Rossiter study. Overall, “the combined total points given to
this category by both studies was 540 with a combined average of 27, making it the
fourth most valued trait among the five EI components” (Hopper, 2005, p. 22). There
were nine new traits mentioned in the library leader articles, but the single highest
mentioned was promotion/salesmanship (p. 22).
The authors in both these studies expanded the purview of essential
competencies needed for effective leadership by adding the components of emotional
intelligence in the mix. The conclusion was that the Goleman theory of EI was
validated. Therefore, it is a relevant tool for describing effective library leaders and
one that should be considered by decision makers as a credible source when planning
or offering training on library leadership.
Emotional intelligence competencies indicate more transformational-type
leadership traits requiring one to be a visionary and to be able inspire and motivate
others to achieve a future goal. Hopper (2005) argued that the modern library
leadership “skills entail “seeing” and “reading” the future of libraries” (p. 15).
Hopper (2005) suggested that “a 21st Century leader should use ideas and dreams in
developing a mental model of what leadership should entail” (p. 15). Such leadership
should focus on “vision and innovations” especially in the digital era where one is
able to forecast the future of libraries (p. 15). Self-regulation was a highly valued
trait, where managers should be comfortable and agile enough to address short run
and long run changes (p. 14). Leaders in the 21st Century should anticipate changes

50

especially due to the fast pace by which technology is changing nowadays. Quoting
from the words of Lynch (1988):
Clearly what is before us is the realization that we must know and
learn as much as we can about the present and future technologies so
as to participate in a meaningful way in the necessary decision-making
regarding our libraries and the services they provide. (p. 77)
Leaders must have the ability to forecast the direction that future information
technologies are headed to and make the appropriate decisions that will ensure that
libraries provide their intended role in the future. It is, therefore, necessary to train
leaders, impart the necessary leadership skills and competencies, and ensure that a
new way of thinking is developed. Riggs (2001) says that:
Managing change is not good enough. We must anticipate, plan, and lead
change. With the impact of the evolving library technology, some librarians
who have been successful in the past may not be successful in the future if
they continue doing things they have been doing in the past. They will have
to talk with different people, listen to different people, and in a sense they will
have to unlearn those activities that brought them success in the past. (p. 10)
Therefore, it is important for future leaders to anticipate change through study of the
current and future environment and develop strategies that will make the organization
successful in the future.
Dr. Suresh Jange (2011) noted that given the continual evolution of economic
and market conditions, and the ever-changing political and organizational factors that
affect library services, the education of library professionals should be diversified
enough to be able to correspond to these internal and external changes and which

51

education should include operational management and leadership among other topics.
It is precisely this reason (i.e. the lack of diversification/correspondence in the core
curriculum) why these (library school) institutions have difficulty adapting to the
knowledge demands of the 21st Century.
Jange’s findings are in agreement with Hawkins and Marcum (2002) who
state that there has been a shift in the information leader’s role from a specialist to a
generalist (p. 37). This necessitates the leaders to become effective managers of not
only information, but also, have rudimental knowhow on managing people, grants,
contract administration, endowment spending, intercollegiate athletics, tuition
discounting among other activities. It is therefore important that the 21st Century
skills be integrated in the librarian’s core training and education, starting with library
schools. The changes that have occurred not only in the market conditions, but also
in the information and technology sectors necessitate changes in curriculum so that
library leaders and other senior professionals in the field are able to analyze the
current situation, weigh the different tradeoffs and strategies, and make informed
decisions that will strategically propel the organization forward. The authors
indicated that institutions and accrediting bodies need to find an optimal solution that
will incorporate these crucial skills into their core curricula (p. 26). Furthermore, the
incumbent leaders within the profession must also be flexible and open to adapt and
respond to the current rapidly changing market demands and accordingly invest and
plan wisely while focusing on supporting and motivating their most valuable resource
which is their human capital. The study also emphasizes that having a leadership role

52

is not an individual activity, but that it involves teamwork and collaboration among
all levels internal and external to the organization.

The Role of Education in Promoting Good Leadership
As the literature review indicated, the debate about library curriculum and the
methodology by which to carry out library education has been going on since the
early years of librarianship. Hansen (2004) and Elgohary (2003) have extensively
debated the effectiveness of library education programs. They argued that such
programs should shift towards developing library leaders.
Elgohary (2003) in his research mainly supports the need for increased
internship as part of a library leadership program. He argued that internships will
allow the future library leader to experience, in real time, some of the management
decisions that will need to take place. This stemmed from the fact that he believed
library schools did not prepare their students properly for entry-level leadership
positions. A web-based survey was designed and distributed to 45 entry-level
research librarians and 18 heads of departments within the same libraries. The
findings validated 28 required or expected entry-level competencies (from 2005 to
2010) and revealed that the library schools only imparted about 64% of that
knowledge (p. xii).
The Elgohary (2003) research recommended at least five methods by which
library schools could improve the quality of graduates in leadership positions. The
first was to implement (mandatory) programs that offered “more field experience” (p.
95), as a way to balance theory and practice and to bring more value and appreciation

53

to the applicability of the theory to the demands of the workplace. The
recommendation was to make these field experiences part of the degree requirements,
and not have it be an option. The second method was to increase courses in
management, marketing, and performance measures. This confirmed that entry-level
librarians had been inadequately prepared in management and marketing concepts.
The third method suggested by the study was to utilize practicing professionals as
instructors. This was seen as a way to keep the content fresh by bringing in on-thejob experiences and relating them to course content. Adding more information
technology to the curriculum ranked as the fourth method of improvement. In
contrast to the general belief that library schools overemphasized information
technology, this finding reveals the high value placed on information technology by
library educators. As a fifth method of improvement, and ranked as the least
important, was to require a post-master’s certificate program. Respondents thought
that expanding the Masters curriculum would be better to achieve improvement rather
than having additional specialized certification programs to which there was limited
research on.
Hansen (2004) in her study explored the dynamics that influenced library
education ten years prior to the Williamson report in 1923. The focus was the diverse
perspectives and philosophies of three California library administrators on effective
library education and administration. Specifically, they were Everett Perry of the Los
Angeles Public Library, Joseph Daniels of the Riverside Public Library, and James
Gillis, California State Librarian. Each developed unique and innovative training

54

programs (library schools) at their respective institutions. Although their
philosophies differed and were often debated, their common contribution to library
education was that they played a critical role in professionalizing and legitimizing
library science as an academic discipline and the eventual transferal of library training
to the university level.
Perry founded the Library School at the Los Angeles Public Library (LAPL)
and pioneered the standardization of the theory and practice of library science,
bringing professional credibility to library education. Although conservative and
rigid in his style, he believed that library education should not only focus on one’s
specialization, but also on best practices or “comparative methods” as he called it,
across the nation (Hansen, 2004, p. 973). He believed in innovation and continuing
education. Perry was also the first to distinguish between professional and
paraprofessional. Perry’s pedagogical methods included bringing in “library
luminaries,” as he called them, to give “inspirational talks” about current events on
library issues outside of Los Angeles (Hansen, 2004, p. 974). Students would also
take field trips to visit other libraries around their state to broaden their appreciation
for the different varieties of library institutions. In 1918, Perry’s program was
recognized and admitted to the Association of American Library Schools making it
California’s only accredited program. The Library School at the Los Angeles Public
Library had become a huge success, but by the time of the great depression in the
1930’s, pressure was mounting to relocate the program to a University setting. As
public sector jobs were continuing to fall, Perry was convinced even further that the

55

time had come. In 1932, Perry officially closed the school at LAPL. In 1936, the
program re-opened at the University of Southern California (USC), which was the
University Perry was hoping for. Unfortunately though, Perry fell ill and died at the
age of fifty-seven from heart disease in 1934, not seeing the opening of the school
(Hansen, 2004, p. 975).
Daniels was the founder of the school at the Riverside Public Library (RPL).
His focus was more on customer service and people rather than practice and
established theory and methods. He aimed at developing the character and the
executive ability of his graduates. Daniels often complained that library schools
focused too much on the books and theory. He advocated that in addition to the
intellect, training should also aim at developing the heart (Hansen, 2004, p. 977).
Daniels believed that the community valued libraries more as a moral force rather
than for its literary collections. In antithesis to Perry’s conservative style, Daniels
was open and experimental. Daniels’s school did not have assigned texts, regular
instruction or established classrooms. He believed that the best learning was handson rather than taking notes and listening to theory all day. The curriculum was
designed to prompt the students to form teams of two or three and undertake actual
library assignments as they rotated through different departments. Daniels also did
not agree with the concept of having library science faculty. He contended that over
time, faculty lost touch with the current professional practices and that their courses
became “predigested” and “fixed” by too much standardization (Hansen, 2004, p.
978). Instead, in place of faculty, his idea for keeping the program vibrant, current,

56

and interesting to the students was to bring in leading authorities from around the
nation to lecture in the area of their expertise.
Unlike Perry’s school which trained its students for specific types of libraries
and positions, where the curriculum was easier to measure, it wasn’t so at RPL.
There was no standard curriculum at RPL as students took random courses, according
to their interests. Three separate tracks were offered: an eleven-month long course, a
six-week summer course, and an eight-week winter course. The eleven-month course
was the regular library science program and the pre-requisite was to be a full-time
student with either at least two years of college or no college, but sufficient
experience. Classes were not organized, so students could attach themselves to
groups and join the long course at any time. These students could also attend lectures
and classes as they pleased in the summer and winter courses. The transcripts did not
record courses, but rather how many hours were devoted to each topic, such as:
cataloging, bibliography, book selection, and serials. Typical hours recorded on
transcripts were between 1,500 and 1,700 hours (Hansen, 2004, p. 979). The
prerequisite for the summer and winter courses was to have previous library
experience and these courses were meant to be a refresher course and to introduce
new techniques. It was up to the student to choose which courses they wanted to
attend according to their training needs. Upon course completion, they would receive
a certificate listing the courses taken and the hours devoted to each. Because the RPL
school emphasized service and focus to the customer, some of the study topics
offered were “reference problems,” “the foreigner in the library,” “the psychology of

57

book selection for children,” “administrative discretion,” and “the library militant”
(Hansen, 2004, p. 979).
Daniels’s unorthodox methods of teaching drew much criticism, attention, and
even praise from scholars and professionals in the library field, but it was this
unorthodoxy in the end that prevented the school from being accredited. Daniels
fought hard to get his educational philosophy accepted, but after many years, he
conceded that the accreditation authorities were looking for certification and
standardization. In an unpublished news release, Daniels had said “People who go to
school want ‘units’ and ‘credits’. Library boards, schools boards, and other
employers demand it. . . .” (News release, n.d., RPL, as cited in Hansen, 2004, p.
985). Charles Woods eventually succeeded Daniels in operating the school, until it
permanently closed, never having attained accreditation by ALA, during World War
II (Hansen, 2004, p. 985).
Gillis sought and was hired as the State Librarian of California. He had
political experience and was a great networker. At the time, the State Library only
offered its reference services to government officials. Gillis’s vision was to expand
services to all residents in the state knowing well that there were remote regions that
were lacking books and libraries. He was also keen of pockets of population that
were underserved, such as Hispanic communities, and the shifting demographics.
Gillis was open to experimenting and innovation, which gave his staff the freedom to
attempt new and ambitious projects. Gillis projected confidence, creative energy, and
personal warmth, which attracted people and allowed him to maneuver successfully

58

within the state’s political web. Thanks to his leadership, the State Library
transformed into a thriving research center. Gillis also introduced new and
“innovative statewide programs statewide, such as the library for the blind, traveling
libraries (equivalent to today’s bookmobile), and a California union catalog to support
interlibrary loan” (Hansen, 2004, p. 967).
Gillis was credited with establishing a county library system which allowed
the provision of books and librarians to thirty-six counties throughout the state
(Conmy, 1961; Brewitt, 1953, as cited in Hansen 2004, p. 967). Given the demands
of this job Gillis contended that these “librarians needed to be certified and not simply
trained on the job” (p. 967). Therefore, “he initiated legislation stipulating that only
certified librarians would be qualified to be hired by the county system” (p. 967).
This was the “first such piece of legislation in the United States” (Hansen, 2004, p.
967). Some of the first core competencies that Gillis identified as being essential for
a county librarian were an “in-depth knowledge of California’s history,
demographics, and politics” (p. 967). He further contended that they “needed to have
a certain amount of library experience and executive ability” (Hansen, 2004, p. 967).
Gillis, wanting to teach the librarians himself, initially sought legislation to create the
State Library School, but was unsuccessful (p. 967). He then tried to lobby the
University of California at Berkeley to convince them to expand their summer school
program into a full-fledged academic program for library science (Hansen, 2004, p.
967; Kunkle, 1972, p. 233), but again failed. A determined Gillis then, made the
executive decision to start a training program at the State Library without legislative

59

support or financing. “The program was so successful, that in September of 1913 the
California State Library Board of Trustees unanimously adopted his plan, resolving
that classes would be begin the following January” (California State Library, 1903–
1921, Book D, p. 287, as cited in Hansen, 2004, p. 968). The core curriculum
followed the conventional library school courses to include cataloging, classification,
and library administration. There was also a field component to gain practical
experience where students were assigned to various departments within the State
Library, as well as various nearby libraries. Lectures and coursework were balanced
with hands-on work. He also had rigorous standard for admittance to the program.
Students had to be between twenty and thirty years old and possess “a good general
educational foundation, executive ability, tact, judgment, energy, and an open,
receptive mind in order to grasp the needs of the people” (California State Library
School Circular, 1915, p. 3, as cited in Hansen, 2004, p. 969). As part of the
admission process applicants were given a rigorous written exam covering current
events, history, and literature. Gillis, having a keen understanding of competing
markets, and as a way to keep highly qualifies staff, went further in increasing the
standards by successfully “increasing staff salaries from 20 percent to 50 percent” (p.
968). Gillis also switched the school year to match the regular school year which ran
from September to June.
Gillis’s State Library School was a success. It produced a total of 76 students,
who went on to hold positions, such as assistants, special librarians, and heads of
libraries.

60

“On July 27, 1917, Gillis died of a fatal heart attack” (Hansen, 2004, p. 970).
Assistant State Librarian Milton Ferguson succeeded Gillis who operated the school
for several more years. Despite Gillis’s efforts, the State Library School was not
accredited by AALS—perhaps because of Gillis’s death, in addition to the institution
of a new Department of Library Science at the University of California at the time.
Not long after, “in 1920, the State Board of Library Trustees voted to discontinue the
State Library School and supported the transfer of it to the University of California at
Berkeley’s new Library Science Department” (California State Library, 1903–1921,
Book E, p. 105, as cited in Hansen, 2004, p. 970).
Koenig (2007) carried out a study and published four articles in the Education
for Information journal. His finding indicated that there has been a significant
difference between what was expected and what is currently been implemented in
leading and managing a library in the real world. The study indicated that there is
major dissatisfaction among the library professionals with the current library
curriculum in library schools. In his work, the author primarily stated that “the
tension and gap between the theoretical and the practical is growing” (p. 58). In his
own words, Michael Koenig (2007) states that:
Many of the major concerns seem to be those that have always been with us
and likely always will be-most obviously:


Dissatisfaction from the field with professional Library and Information
Science (LIS) education;



Struggle with the balance between the theoretical and practical; and



A plea for more emphasis on leadership and operational management in
LIS programs. (p. 5)

61

Koenig gave an insight about the main areas that need to be improved in the
curriculum; these included improvement in the marketing, financial management and
administrative training for all the library professionals.

Controversy between MLS vs. MBA
Faced with dwindling funding over time and the ever changing competitive
and economic market conditions, researchers pointed out that there is a need for
competent leaders in the library field that possess the adequate business education
that will enable them to operate their libraries effectively and efficiently so that they
will yield outcome-based financial and programmatic results. Here then lies the
question as to whether a library professional should pursue a Master’s in Business
Administration (MBA), or a Masters in Library/Information Science (MLS/MIS), or a
hybrid of the two.
There are three main accrediting bodies for business colleges and they are the
Association to Advance Collegiate School of Business (AACSB), the Accreditation
Council for Business Schools and Programs (ACBSP), and the International
Assembly for Collegiate Business Education (IACBE).
The AACSB accredits colleges and universities within the United States and
internationally. It is known as the longest standing and most recognized accreditation
body for having the highest standards of achievements regarding business schools and
business programs worldwide. “Only five percent of the 13,000 business programs
worldwide have met these high standards” (Business Management Degree, 2016,

62

para. 2). AACSB accredited institutions offers degrees for business and accounting
programs at the bachelor’s, master’s, and doctoral levels. The AACSB’s focus is on
the research and teaching of the school and its continual assurance of providing highquality educational programs through continuous high-level research (Business
Management Degree, 2016, para. 7).
The ACBSP’s focus is not so much on the research and programs of the
school, but on the quality of staff and teaching excellence. “The ACBSP accredits
business-related programs worldwide at the associate, baccalaureate, master, and
doctorate degree levels in regards to business-related programs” (para. 7). They also
“instill the need for continuous research in colleges and universities as a way to
maintain and enhance the quality of the curricula” (para. 7).
“IACBE was founded in 1997 and is recognized as a worldwide leader in
accrediting business colleges and universities whose programs are ‘outcome-based’”
(Business Management Degree, 2016, para. 8). “IACBE’s target was to afford
business accreditation to over 600 smaller, private liberal arts colleges, and mid-size
public and private colleges that offer associate degrees in business programs. In
2011, Council for Higher Education Association (CHEA) granted recognition to the
IACBE” (para. 9-10).
Therefore, it is these accrediting bodies where through their rigorous
accreditation standards ensure that the curricula of business schools are continually
evaluated and enhanced to provide relevant and essential content needed for
preparing business leaders worldwide.

63

With traditional and newer business curricula content to include management
principles, human resource management, organizational behavior, operations
management, cultural and gender diversity, decision making processes, strategic
planning and management, and ethics, MBA graduates have the basic skills and
abilities to join any organization at an administrative level. The “IACBE New
Program Accreditation Manual (2016), Section 2.2 Common Professional
Components” states that
Academic quality in undergraduate business programs requires a broad
educational background on which to base collegiate business studies. This
requires students in the new business programs to have the general knowledge
and skills that will prepare them to understand and appreciate the broader
historical, cultural, social, political, and economic contexts in which business
takes place and to function effectively in an ever-changing global
environment. (p. 23)
On the other hand, a Masters in Library Science (MLS) offers traditional
library science courses, such as cataloging/classification, ethics of information
management (copyrights, etc.), management of information, and children and youth
services among other related topics, which may be adequate for specializations, but is
not adequate in preparing graduates for leadership positions (Gorman, 2006, p. 10).
A study carried out by Mackenzie and Smith (2009) on the effectiveness of
ALA accredited courses in preparing library leaders revealed a very large gap
between the expectations and job requirements in the real library world and the
syllabus. The study reviewed 48 syllabi from ALA accredited institutions both in the

64

United States and Canada. Among the findings were that the ALA accrediting
standards were indicative and not prescriptive. For example, although the word
management is constantly used, it is used in line with management of information
services and such technologies, and not of people or the organization. The research
indicated that the ALA has no clear direction on the preparation of graduates for
managerial and leadership roles in their respective organizations. Other findings
revealed that “43.8% of the ALA accredited colleges offered programs that did not
include (business) management courses not only in the core curriculum, but also in
the elective pool of courses” (p. 1).

Leadership and Competency Models
Leadership models. Various studies have developed different leadership
competency models for library leaders. These models promote strategies that leaders
can use or should possess to ensure the successful operation of the organization. In
2009, Ammons-Stephens et al. designed a model listing the core leadership
competencies that a library leader should possess. These include:


Cognitive ability: This entails a set of characteristics that include critical
thinking, analytical thinking, creative thinking, proper decision making
process, data manipulation, and synthesis of information.



Vision: Leaders should have the ability to think about the future. Forward
thinking and creativity should be inculcated to all the leadership
professionals.



Interpersonal effectiveness: Futuristic leaders should be responsible,
respectful and should inspire others towards achieving their personal and

65

organizational goals. Leaders should create a positive environment for all
the employees.


Managerial effectiveness: Leaders should also be able to manage their
organization effectively. They should be able to manage resources, make
future predictions, collaborate with other library institutions, and manage
any change. (pp. 68-71)

Workplace factors influencing library productivity. In his research, Jain
(2004) identified the critical workplace factors that enhance and contribute to
efficient library services. They were team building; leadership; strategic
management; transformational leadership; reward systems for employees; employee
empowerment to influence organizational culture; and employee performance
appraisals. He also focused more on the staff issues as essential to good library
management which were “sense of purpose and achievement; recognition; self-worth;
job satisfaction; continuous educations and development; and motivational factors as
effective communication” to name a few (Jain, 2004, Abstract, p. xix). Moghaddam
and Moballeghi (2008) talked about the Total Quality Management (TQM) concepts
as an essential part of library operations.
Quality is a very big part of library development. When systems and
processes are in place to make services seamless to the customer it is bound to have a
positive impact on library users. Whatever the case may be, the bottom line is that
libraries should know their markets through various marketing strategies and analysis,
such as gaining a broad knowledge about data usage, different types of use, actual
user needs, and changes in users’ skills and competencies. Libraries need such

66

competencies to analyze data for justifying their resources and their social value
(Poll, 2008).
Competency models, 21st Century skills. A number of studies and
researchers document the need for better and advanced leadership in the library
institutions Library leadership skills for the 21st Century. Kent (2009) in her
presentation states that:
Developing leadership for the public library in the 21st Century is imperative
in a world in which technology is changing everything libraries do. If public
libraries are going too truly “add value” to their users, then library leaders
must have the skills to create and nurture a new type of library culture in
which change is encouraged and new visions of service can be implemented.
(p. 3)
One of Kent’s main emphases is the rapidly changing world necessitating the
development of new leadership and management tactics. She continues to add that
the 21st Century curriculum must address the following issues:
1. How to mentor and develop new leaders;
2. How to recognize leadership traits in individual;
3. Identify the new skills and competencies that leaders need when doing
business and managing the organization;
4. Identify methods of changing the organizational culture of library
institutions; and
5. How to develop leadership model that can be effectively applied in library
institutions. (p. 3)
Kent (2009) indicated that one of the main challenges that face library leaders
in the modern world is describing the library services in the future. The information

67

era has brought about rapid developments in the Information and Communications
Technology (ICT) sector and it is important that leaders adopt change and harness the
ICT services for their own advantages. Key issues that arise in the current leadership
are architecture of modern library, technological aspects, as well as planning. In
terms of architecture, new libraries must incorporate spaces designed for the modern
generation so that they can support new innovative technologies. This calls for a
redesign in the physical and service models in the library sector. To cope with the
rapid changes in ICT, library leaders must be trained on the current technologies and
how best they can be incorporated in the information knowledge management.
In 2009, the federal funding agency for state libraries, the Institute of Museum
and Library Services, issued the “Museum and Library 21st Century Skills”. These
skills are as follows:
1. Learning And Innovation Skills
•

Critical Thinking and Problem Solving

WebJunction competency index. An organization called the Online
Computer Library Center, Inc. (OCLC), originally founded in 1967 as the Ohio
College Library Center. It is a (free) member-based, nonprofit research organization
on computer library services with a focus on furthering public access to the world's
information and reducing information costs. Its core mission is advocacy for
libraries, supporting their core purpose, which is access to information. One of its
most notable contributions is WorldCat, which is maintained and produced
cooperatively with its member libraries and is the largest publically accessed online
catalog in the world.
In 2003, via a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, a division of
OCLC was created called WebJunction. The mission of this division is to provide
relevant and current training services to librarians.

69

WebJunction worked diligently, where in 2014, with the input of a wide
spectrum of library practitioners, subject matter experts, leaders in the field, and from
other library organizations that had defined competencies, published the Competency
Index for the Library Field (Appendix A). This is believed to be the most
comprehensive index, and is largely now accepted as the guide by the library
profession. It outlines five core competency umbrellas, among which is Library
Management (in the business sense). In summary, these competencies are listed in
Table 1 below.
Despite these competencies being so widely accepted by the profession across
the nation, as of 2016, the American Library Association has yet to consider the
incorporation of these competencies in its accreditation standards for library schools
(as seen in section 2.3, ALA Accreditation Standards, 2015b). This, despite having
created many (ALA) leadership and management training resources and venues over
the years, with one of the latest being the ALA Leadership Institute, “the cost per
participant is $1,600 which includes training, materials, lodging, and all meals” (para.
8). The Libraries Transform initiative offers Emerging Leaders programs, Grow
Your Leadership Skills, and Mentoring Opportunities each year for 50 newer library
workers from across the country so they can grow and develop skills necessary to
problem-solve, as well as to have the opportunity to serve the profession in a
leadership capacity (para. 1-3).

What the researcher wants to emphasize is that even though there are many
competency models, they still, for the most part, remain outside the core and formal
pedagogical infrastructure of library schools. There is no standardized or mandated
leadership component, and training is heavily based on the ability of the local budgets
to support such training and the workload schedules. In addition, although
competency lists such as the one created by OCLC exist, and are widely accepted as
the standard by practicing library professionals, ALA has its own list of
competencies, which have not been updated since 2009 (Appendix B). This indicates
that there is still disconnect in the consensus as to the design of the core leadership
and management competencies.
FLIGBY® competencies. As noted in the literature review, many researchers
and scholars not only emphasized the need for the evolution and adaptation of the
curricula of library schools to the market needs, but they also gave heavy emphasis on
the importance of incorporating more experiential, or hands-on requirements as part
of the core library leadership pedagogy.
In the current times that we are in, with the fascinating and diverse technology
available to us, it is perplexing as to why the subject of leadership training has not yet
leveraged the power of simulated learning, especially being a field that is so heavily
vested in technology and information.
One such program called FLIGBY®, which stands for “Flow is Good
Business,” is an online game simulating the flow-based leadership growth process in
the real world. It was researched and designed by top leaders and experts around the

72

world. The research was based on and extends the lifetime work of Professor
Csikszentmihalyi of Claremont University, California, who teaches this program
there. The concept of Flow was born when Professor Csikszentmihalyi sought to find
out what enriches people’s lives and what makes them happy. Eventually, this
concept extended to organizational performance improvement and leadership
development. In 2012, this program won the Gold Medal Prize, International Serious
Play Awards and was recognized as the globe’s top leadership development game.
The first steps for the development of FLIGBY® were to identify the
leadership skills that enabled the Flow-based leadership growth process and culture in
an organization. These were identified by studying forty years-worth of documented
conversations and interviews Prof. Csikszentmihalyi conducted of mainly various
professionals in leadership positions, focus groups, and MBA students. His quest was
to try to understand the sources of creativity and happiness of people, personally and
professionally. What he found was that people were most happy when they were
doing something that was rewarding to them personally and not because they had to
make a living out of it or out of duty. Specifically, Csikszentmihalyi’s subjects
described these feelings as “things flowing effortlessly, like being carried away by a
river” (p. 47). This was the basis behind naming such experiences “Flow”
experiences.
The study of Csikszentmihalyi’s work resulted in the development of twentynine FLIGBY® management/leadership skill measures, see Table 2 below.

73

Table 2
FLIGBY® Leadership Skill-set
1

Active Listening

Active listening is a way of responding to another person that improves
mutual understanding. This is a method of listening that involves
understanding the content of a message as well as the intent of the sender
and the circumstances under which the message is given. Active listening is
a structured form of listening and responding that focuses the attention on
the speaker. The listener does not have to agree with the speaker. He or she
must simply state what he or she thinks the speaker said.

2

Analytical Skills

Analytical skill is the readiness to visualize, articulate, and solve complex
problems and concepts and make decisions that are sensible based on the
available information. Such skills include demonstration of the ability to
apply logical thinking to gathering and analyzing information, designing
and testing solutions to problems, and formulating plans.

3

Assertiveness

4

Balancing Skill

Assertiveness is the readiness to express your emotions and needs without
violating the rights of others and without being aggressive. Assertiveness is
the behavior which enables you to act in your own best interests, to stand up
for yourself without undue anxiety, to express your honest feelings
comfortably, or the exercise your own rights without denying the rights of
others.
Balancing skill is the readiness to maintain the same importance between
things, considering them in the same way. Effective leadership is about
balance. A balance between challenges and skills is necessary for Flow. It
is easier to become completely involved in a task if we believe it is doable.
If it appears to be beyond our capacity, we tend to respond to it by feeling
anxious; if the task is too easy we get bored. In either case attention shifts
from what needs to be accomplished--the anxious person is distracted by
worries about the outcome, while the bored one starts searching for other
things to do. The ideal condition can be expressed by the simple formula:
Flow occurs when both challenges and skills are high and equal to each
other.

5

Engagement and
Trust

Building engagement is the readiness to create trust and a positive,
fulfilling, work-related state of mind that is characterized by dedication.
Dedication refers to being strongly involved in one's work and experiencing
a sense of significance, enthusiasm, and challenge. Building someone's (the
colleagues, the community) confidence in or reliance on some quality or
attribute of a person or a thing, or the truth in a statement.

6

BusinessOriented
Thinking

Business-oriented thinking is the readiness to manage situations and solve
problems in order to create added value to the company and in the end,
create value for the shareholders/stakeholders. To be successful in business
development you need to manage the opportunities and threats of the
corporate environment and to recognize organizational weaknesses to avoid,
and strengths to build upon.

7

Communication

Communication skills are the set of skills that enables a person to convey
information that is received and understood. Communication skills refer to
the repertoire of interpersonal behavior.

Conflict
Management

Conflict-management is the practice of identifying and handling conflicts in
a sensible, fair, and efficient manner. Conflict management is the principle
that all conflicts cannot necessarily be resolved, but learning how to manage
conflicts can decrease the odds of nonproductive escalation.
Delegation is the readiness to confer functions or powers on another person
so he or she can act on behalf of the manager. Delegation empowers a
subordinate to make decisions, i.e. it is a shift of decision-making authority
from one organizational level to a lower one.

9

Delegating

10

Diplomacy

Diplomacy is the readiness to take into account, the varying interests and
values of the other parties involved in the negotiation, treating those
differences with respect, and dealing with people in a tactful manner.

11

Emotional
Intelligence

Emotional intelligence is the capacity and readiness to understand, express
and regulate emotions in one-self and in others.

12

Empowerment

Empowerment is a skill of sharing information, rewards, and power with
employees so that they can take initiative and make decisions to solve
problems and improve service and performance.

13

Entrepreneurship
(Risk-Taking)

Entrepreneurship is the capacity and willingness to undertake conceptions,
organization, and management of a productive nature with all attendant
risks, while seeking profit as a reward. Entrepreneurial spirit is
characterized by innovation and risk-taking, and an essential component to
succeed in an ever changing and more competitive global marketplace.

14

Execution

Execution is the act of performing, the completion of managerial tasks
(execution of a plan, a task, etc.), and the readiness of doing something
successfully. Managing the business aligned with the common values.
Executing strategic goals is by far the greatest challenge in business today.

15

Feedback

Feedback to employees is information regarding their performance that they
can also act on. Feedback must be shared in a manner that is
understandable and perceived by them as being provided in a highly
respectful manner. As an organization seeks to improve its performance,
feedback helps it to make the required adjustments. Feedback is immediate.
It is difficult for people to stay absorbed in an activity unless they get
timely, "online" information about how well they are doing. The sense of
total involvement of the flow experience derives in large part from knowing
that what one does matters and has consequences. Feedback may come
from colleagues or supervisors who comment on performance, but
preferably it is the activity itself that will provide this information.

16

Future
Orientation

Future-focused thinking is the readiness to think in long terms. This is the
skill of "forward-looking".

17

Information
Gathering

Information gathering is the readiness to collect adequate information to
perform the next step based on this information. Managers must know what
information to gather, where to find it, how to collect it, and ultimately how
to process the collected information.

18

Intuitive
Thinking

Intuitive thinking is a way of thinking that does not pursue rational
processes such as facts and data. It is unfocused, non-linear, sees many
things at once, and views the big picture and contains perspective. Good
intuition comes from years of knowledge and experience that allows you to
understand how people and the world works. Its strength is that it can
produce a rapid result. It is acting on feelings or hunches. It can also be
guided by emotions.
Involvement is the readiness of sharing in the activities of the team/group.
It is an active participation in teamwork activities and in the execution
process.

19

Involvement

20

Motivation

Motivational skills are those that enable a person to become motivated and
work toward achieving goals. This is the readiness to understand what
causes a person to become motivated and stay that way. It helps with
making sure people are the most productive that they can be.

21

Organizing

22

Prioritizing

Organizing is the readiness to initiate, arrange, and manage several
elements into a purposeful structure. This is the ability to create throughout
the organization a network of people who can help solve implementation
problems as they occur. Good implementers customize this network to
include individuals who can handle the special types of problems
anticipated in the implementation of a particular strategy.
Prioritization is the readiness to evaluate a group of items and ranking them
in their order of importance or urgency.

23

Timely
Decision-Making

24

Applying
Personal
Strengths

25

Social System
Thinking

26

Social
Responsibility

27

Strategic
Thinking

Quick decision-making is a readiness the enables effective decision-making
under time pressure when limited and inadequate information is available.
This is the skill to decide authoritatively and to be consistent with one's
decisions.
Applying personal strengths is the readiness to realize you own or others'
strengths, which are personal attributes that someone may have been born
with and cultivated over the course of many years and life experiences. It
is the realization that these strengths can be potentially used to the benefit
of the company.
Social system thinking is the readiness that includes an awareness of
situations and the social dynamics that govern them. It includes the
knowledge of interaction styles and strategies that can help a person
achieve his or her objectives in dealing with others.
Social responsibility is the readiness to manage the business process to
produce an overall positive impact on the company's stakeholders and the
whole society.
Strategic thinking helps managers to set goals, to determine priorities, to
review policy issues, and to perform long-term planning. Clear goals are
necessary to reach the flow-state. For a person to become deeply involved
in any activity it is essential that he or she know precisely what tasks he or
she must accomplish moment by moment. Of course the ultimate goals of
an activity are also important but true enjoyment comes from the steps one
takes toward attaining a goal, not from actually reaching it.

FLIGBY® Leadership Skill-set
28

Teamwork

Teamwork management is the readiness to form, facilitate, and control the
teamwork. In case of effective teamwork management each person on the
team puts aside his or her individual needs to work towards the larger group
objective.

29

Time
Management

Time management is a readiness of systematic, priority-based structuring of
time allocation and distribution among competing demands.

In summary, as taken from the FAQ page some quick facts about FLIGBY®
are the following (2016):


Employs real-life simulation, in an interactive, movie-like setting;
teaching how Flow can be promoted at the workplace. Aspiring, as well
as experienced managers will identify with it and learn from it.



Although FLIGBY® is Flow-based, the leadership challenges and the
options it presents are fully compatible with a wide range of leadership
theories and approaches, enhancing them all.



The content and the decision structure of the FLIGBY® game have been
built up to test, measure and develop these important leadership skills
directly. The FLIGBY® “MAP” (Master Analytics Profiler) gives detailed
and quantified feedback on the current state of each skill, identifying those
needing improvement.



At the Game’s end, FLIGBY® provides an individual report to each player
on his/her skill-set, with a range of benchmarking options available.



FLIGBY® brings excitement and inspiration to the teaching of a wide span
of leadership topics; most players experience personal Flow during the
Game.

77



FLIGBY® is available as a powerful management-training and consulting
tool with which to approach any organization interested in improving the
performance of its managers/leaders.



FLIGBY’s large data-set offers a unique research opportunity because the
players’ leadership skill measurements are based on non-intrusive
observations, yielding unbiased outcomes.



Knowledge of the skill-levels obtained can be especially useful for
predictive-people-analysis identifying leadership skill gaps and suggesting
remedial action. (“Quick Facts Table”)

Since companies, as well as government agencies and non-government/nonprofit organizations operate in different industries with different cultures and visions,
they often identify a contextually different blend of skills pertinent to their missions.
Each such “blend” can be custom-made from the FLIGBY 29. As such, the FLIGBY
29 have been blended and categorized into the Executive Core Competency model.
The researcher, within the findings of each of the ECQ categories in Chapter
III lists the FLIGBY® leadership skills blended for that category as a way of
suggesting the nature of the core courses to be considered for the leadership track in
library schools.
What librarians and LIS students are saying. Many of the uneasy tensions
since the beginning of the 19th Century continue to face the library profession in the
21st Century (Wikipedia LIS, 2011, para. 1). According to the LIS Wiki (2011), the
tensions are:


Generalization versus specialization;



Practice versus theory;

78



1 year versus 2 year graduate degree;



Education for Information (the “I” word) versus Education for Library
Science (the “L” word) or is it LIS Education?



Cataloging education versus Knowledge organization (or organization of
information) approaches;



Distance learning versus classroom delivery: Librarians were chastised by
the Williamson report and called them "prejudiced" for failing to take
advantage of new technologies that would provide access (to library
education through DE - distance education) to rural areas;



Crisis Criers –According to many in the literature, LIS education has been
in crisis now for over a hundred years in the US (since inception in fact).
(“Uneasy Tensions in the LIS Education”)

Chapter III
Methodology and Research Approach
The approach for this research study will be quantitative. Myers (1997)
indicates that the aforementioned method is universally adopted as the main research
methods (p. 242). Quantitative methods are grounded on positivism claims where
numerical manipulation of variables is used to understand given phenomena. In the
quantitative research method, empirical methods are used to describe aspects in the
real world. These empirical statements are described in terms of numerical terms and
facts can be drawn from them. Creswell (2003) describes quantitative research
methods as:
A quantitative approach is one in which the investigator primarily uses postpositivist claims for developing knowledge (that is, cause and effect thinking,
reduction to specific variables, hypothesis and questions, use of measurement
and observations, and the test of theories). (p. 18)
The method, having evolved as a research method for conducting natural
sciences research has evolved and is currently used to study behavioral sciences
phenomena. The method is widely used where mathematical manipulation, graphing,
and numerical analysis are used to generate results (Creswell, 2003, p. 19). In this
research, the researcher has used this method by administering a survey, which
necessitates quantitative methods.

80

Research Design, Instrumentation, and Data Collection
Under the ambit of quantitative research methods, a survey was used to collect
primary data from the respondents. Owens (2002) describes a survey as a research
where a data collection method entails the use of questions to study people’s
perceptions, attitudes, and views. Generally, a survey entails: (i) The formulation of
the questionnaire, (ii) Administering the questionnaire; (iii) Data collection, (iv)
Determining the methods to measure the results, and (v) Data analysis. Survey
converts the respondents’ attitudes and perceptions into statistics which can then be
analyzed, graphed, and generalizations made so as to yield a given phenomenon. The
principle survey instrument for this study was a questionnaire. This was used to
collect information from 52 State Librarians as per the Chief Officers of State
Libraries (COSLA) list, 35 Public Library Directors, and other library leaders who
have possession of an ALA accredited MLS, and 13 Heads of Library Schools. The
sample of Heads of Library Schools was taken from the list of the fifteen library
schools identified in this study. Participants used a Likert-type scale to identify to
what degree the surveyed competencies were important or unimportant to their
profession. Participants used the same scale to evaluate the degree at which the
library schools teach these competencies. The main reasons for using the survey
were:
Research data: This study sought to collect views from library professionals
to assess the state of leadership education in LIS schools and to identify

81

potential gaps between what is actually taught in library schools vs.
competencies needed to run a library in the real world.
Accuracy: Since that this is a quantitative study, the results from the survey
can be easily validated and are accurate and reliable.
Uniqueness: Unlike previous studies, these questions distributed through the
questionnaire were unique and were used to identify leadership gaps existing
in the curriculum. The researcher customized the questions to suit the initial
objective of the study.
Cost: Surveys through questionnaires are less costly and uses less time as
compared to interviews and other data collection procedures. (Owens, 2002)
In this study, descriptive statistics were used. The sample selected provided
pertinent information that would support the position that there is a need for further
development of leadership training in the current curricula of library schools.
The survey instrument was designed by the researcher and its content was
based on the federal Executive Core Qualifications (ECQs). It was distributed to all
State Librarians in the nation, library school heads from a sample of school libraries
across the nation, and all the Library Directors in Delaware.
Ex-post facto data were gathered and analyzed in three stages: Stage one:
Distribute the survey; stage two: Collect the ex-post facto data; and stage three:
Analyze the data to determine gap analysis in field perspectives vs. what library
schools teach. In the first stage, the researcher will use quantitative research methods.
These were grounded on:

82

Stage One: Quantitative—Distribute survey to current list of State Librarians,
public library Directors in DE, and heads of Library Schools nationally to capture
their experiences as managers and leaders.
For this stage, a survey was designed in surveymonkey.com. The core
competencies that were surveyed for this research were taken from the Office of
Personnel Management (OPM) of the federal government. They are called Executive
Core Qualifications or ECQs. Anyone applying for a public executive leadership
position must demonstrate knowledge and experience in all of these qualifications.
The logic in choosing these core competencies was that essentially, a State Librarian
or a public library Director are public executive leadership positions. In these, the
researcher found a good balance of IQ (Intelligence Quotient) and EQ (Emotional
Intelligence) that are fundamental to being an effective leader and/or manager. In
addition, it is also an independent executive core competency resource, outside of the
library realm, which is broadly accepted and is standardized across the nation.
This tool not only allowed the probing of their experiences as library leaders
and managers, but also identified the gap between what core competencies they
identified as being important to the profession and if library schools are adequately
teaching to those. The gap was statistically measured for its significance.
Stage Two: Quantitative—collected ex-post facto data: Stratified the research
of ALA-Accredited Graduate Library programs offered in the United States, Canada,
and Puerto Rico. Stratified research sample will include the 5 highest-ranked library

83

schools, 5 middle-ranked, and 5 lower-ranked. The focus in looking at these
programs was as follows:
1. How many offer business management courses and/or internships.
2. Capture descriptive statistics about these schools like their locations, how
many offer doctorate degrees, and the variety of graduate titles for the
degrees offered (to determine overlap, if any).
3. Review their curricula and analyze frequencies and percentages as to
which of these business management courses is part of the core curriculum
or part of the electives pool.
Stage Three: Quantitative—analyzing survey results to determine what core
curriculum topics are lacking to fill the gaps between leadership competencies
required in the field and what library schools are teaching on leadership and
organizational management in the Masters in Library Science degree program.
Depending on the findings, the goal of this stage will be to suggest standard core
curriculum topics for the management/leadership track at the ALA accredited library
schools, based on a combination of core curriculum contents of business schools, and
core competency models formulated and widely accepted by subject matter experts in
the library field.
The questionnaire used for this study was divided into three main parts: A)
Inquired general identifying information about the respondent, such as name,
company and obtaining informed consent, B) Inquired about the general demographic
information of the respondent, such as age, gender, and personal information, and C)

84

Prompted the respondents to answer the survey instrument questions and provide
anecdotal data about the main issues dealing with leadership in the library profession
so as to identify gaps in competencies.

Limitations of the Study
While this study focused on capturing the structure and content of the current
core curricula of library schools around the United States, the methods used have
certain limitations. First, the categorization of core content is a subjective process
and, therefore, may introduce bias into the data. Every effort was made to use the
exact language in the syllabi and course descriptions to categorize them accordingly.
Any content that was not clearly mentioned was not categorized. Second, the course
and curriculum content strictly relied on what was freely available on the LIS
program websites. Third, further clarification, or qualitative aspects as to the
different structures and content of the curricula may have been obtained by
interviewing faculty and administrators of LIS schools, which this researcher has not
done. Further, this study mostly focused on public and not specialized libraries,
therefore, it focused on general and not specialized core curricula.

Data triangulation, Validation and Ethical Consideration
It is important that the survey results obtained are triangulated and validated.
This will ensure that the results obtained were accurate and reliable and not subject to
bias and other systematic errors (Creswell, 2003). From the set of four main
triangulation methods (data triangulation, investigator triangulation, theoretical

85

triangulation, and methodological triangulation), the data triangulation chosen was
methodological data triangulation where the data collected using the questionnaire
was complemented using results obtained in stage 2 of the research (that is collect
data on (i) How many offer management courses or internships related to
management, (ii) Capture descriptive statistics about these schools like their
locations, how many offer doctorate degrees, and the variety of graduate titles of the
degrees offered (to determine overlap, if any), and (iii) Review their curricula and
analyze frequencies and percentages as to which of these management courses is part
of the core curriculum or part of the electives pool.
Validation involved the determination of whether the survey tool measured
the intended variable. The survey was pilot tested among librarians and library
directors before its final release. To validate the data, both construct validity and
concurrent validity was done. Concurrent validation entailed checking if the results
obtained were consistent with other studies carried within the same or different area
and time. Construct validity entailed checking the results statistically to determine
that the variable being measured had significant effects on the outcome (Creswell,
2003).
Part A of the survey instrument included an introduction letter detailing the
type of research being carried out and asking the respondents to fill the questionnaire.
The letter described the nature and the importance of the results and promised
respondents that all the data will be privately recorded using numbers so as to ensure
privacy and confidentiality of the responses given.

86

Data Analysis Framework
Data analysis is a vital component for this research. Yin (2003) described the
process of data analysis as: “Data analysis consists of examining, categorizing,
tabulating, testing, or otherwise recombining both quantitative and qualitative
evidences to address the initial propositions of a study” (“Abstract”).
For the quantitative research methods, numerical analysis methods were used.
These entailed:
Data categorization: Grouping of data into different groups.
Data tabulation: Data was tabulated so as to assist in graphical representation
of this information.
Statistical data analysis: The arithmetic mean of the data in all the groups
was determined so as to aid in establishing the tendency of all the aspects under
study.

Survey Response Rate and Demographics
Each of the findings obtained from the survey instrument is presented and
quantitative methods were used to draw meaning from it and also compared to the
existing literature.
The survey was sent to 100 people, which consisted of 52 State Librarians
(Chief Officers), 35 Delaware Library Directors/Leaders, and 13 Library School
leaders. The overall response rate for this research averaged 71%. Of the 71
respondents, the response rate within each category of ECQ’s varied because of the
non-response of some participants. Therefore, 67 of 71 participants responded to

87

survey questions 6 and 7 for Fundamental Leadership Competencies, 94.4% (n = 67);
63 of 71 participants responded to questions 8 and 9 for Leading Change
Competencies, 87.3% (n = 62); 62 of 71 responded to questions 10 and 11 for
Leading People, 87.3% (n = 62); 59 of 71 responded to questions 12 and 13 for
Delivering Results, 83% (n = 59); 59 of 71 responded to questions 14 and 15 for
Business Acumen, 83% (n = 59); and 58 of 71 responded to questions 16 and 17 for
Building Coalitions, 81.7% (n = 58). Of the 71 respondents, 50.7% were above the
age of 60 years, while 25.4% were between 50-60 years. In total, 76.1% were above
the age of 50 years. These facts imply that most of the respondents in these
institutions are at or close to retirement. From the results, only 5.6% were between
the ages of 30-39 years while 18.3% of them were between the ages of 40-49 years.
Figure 4 below shows a pie chart describing the respondents based on age.

Figure 4. Age distribution of all the respondents. Response rate 71% (n = 71); Male
35.2% (n = 25); Female 64.8% (n = 46).

88

The illustration shows that the majority of the respondents are aged, meaning
between 50 to 60 years old or above. This has a two-fold impact on library leadership
and librarianship in general. First, is the rapid changing of Information and
Communication Technologies (ICT). This can be a major impediment to the
adaptation of new technologies and systems. Various research studies (Beier &
Ackerman, 2005; Campbell, 2004; Carroll, 1993; Charness, Kelley, Bosman, &
Mottram, 2001; Fisk, Rogers, Charness, Czaja, & Sharit, 2004; Rogers, Hertzog, &
Fisk, 2000) have documented that younger generations are more likely to learn and
adapt to new technologies, and expand on ICT systems to incorporate into their
organizations.
Czaja et al. (2006) concluded in their research on factors that predict the use
of technology that:
Although older adults are increasingly using technology, data indicate that
they typically have more difficulty than do younger people in learning to use
and operate current technologies, such as computers, the Internet,
videocassette recorders, automatic teller machines, and telephone menu
systems. (p. 333)
The sample size for Czaja et al.’s study consisted of 1,204 participants of
which 750 were women and 454 were men, ranging from ages 18 to 91. The findings
further indicated that women had higher levels of anxiety related to computer use
than men did. The same was found by Broos (2005) in a quantitative study where

89

1,058 participants were surveyed examining gender anxieties in information and
communication technologies.
Van Volkom, Stapley, and Malter (2013) in addition to confirming the Czaja
et al. (2006) findings, they found that gender, age, and attitude were also factors
influencing the use of information and computer technologies. The older age group
felt that they could not adapt easily to technology and felt even less comfortable with
newer technology.
Czaja et al. (2006) in their research also made mention of the direct
relationship between age and the decline in agility and cognitive abilities with the use
of technology. They concluded that people who were younger, better educated, and
who had higher cognitive abilities had lower levels of computer anxiety and were
more likely to adapt to and use more types of technology (p. 341).
Based on these findings, it is reasonable to conclude that the leadership
propelled by the older generations will most likely result in institutions that are more
likely to be resistant to change not only in the adoption of new technologies, but also
in developing leadership competencies in employees.
The second challenge associated with aged leadership is the lack of continuity
when these people leave their leadership positions. Upon leaving, if processes are
systematically documented, most of the institutional knowledge leaves with them.
Succession planning and a more balanced distribution of people in terms of age in
leadership positions and school institutions should deliver better results as there will
be a better chance of continuity in leadership and management.

90

As the various components and findings of the survey are discussed next, we
must consider the factors mentioned (such as: age, gender, and attitude) as challenges
to the learning and continual learning of library professionals.
Fundamental Leadership Competencies
The first questions for this study sought to determine the gap between the
fundamental leadership competencies required and what library schools are teaching.
The response rate was 94.4%, (n = 67). The importance of these competencies to
leaders and directors and the level of education of these traits at library institutions
were evaluated. These fundamental competencies were defined as follows:


Interpersonal Skills: Treats others with courtesy, sensitivity, and respect.
Considers and responds appropriately to the needs and feelings of different
people in different situations.



Oral Communication: Makes clear and convincing oral presentations.
Listens effectively; clarifies information as needed.



Integrity/Honesty: Behaves in an honest, fair, and ethical manner. Shows
consistency in words and actions. Models high standards of ethics.



Written Communication: Writes in a clear, concise, organized, and
convincing manner for the intended audience.



Continual Learning: Assesses and recognizes own strengths and
weaknesses; pursues self-development; lifelong learning.



Public Service Motivation: Shows a commitment to serve the public.
Ensures that actions meet public needs; aligns organizational objectives
and practices with public interests.

The findings confirmed that there is indeed a gap between the fundamental
leadership competencies needed and the level of teaching for these competencies.

91

The first set of questions prompted the respondent to rate the main competencies that
leaders should have for effective management. Table 3 below shows the rating on a 1
to 5 scale, with 5 being most important.

Integrity and honesty were valued as the most important skill that library
leaders should possess. This was followed by interpersonal skills and oral
communication. Of all the factors that were surveyed, all of them had a very high
rating (4.63 - 4.82 out of 5). This translates to about 92.6% for the lowest score and
96.8% for the highest score. This indicated that all the leadership qualifications listed
were important in developing a competent library leader.
However, when the same respondents were asked to describe how well library
schools taught these competencies, the ratings were very low. For example, in Table
3, integrity/honesty was ranked as one of the most important competencies, yet it
ranked among the lowest as far as being taught in library schools, see Table 4 below.

Clearly, there exists a knowledge gap between the expected training level and
the level of training carried out in the library institutions. Figure 5 illustrates the gap
between the importance of the fundamental competencies and the level they are
taught in library schools.

teaching for fundamental leadership competencies. Response rate was 94.4% (n =
67).

93

To test the statistical significance of these gaps with a null hypothesis of zero
(H0), a paired two sample for means t-test was conducted. The results suggest the
difference was significant between essential competencies (M = 4.76, SD = 0.074)
and what libraries are teaching (M = 3.11, SD = 0.257); t(5) = 14.03, p = 0.000033, t
Critical = 2.57 < t = 14.03. Statistically, with a significance of .05, there is more than
a 95% probability that there will be significant gaps between the importance of these
competencies and what is taught in library schools; therefore, the null hypothesis is
rejected.

From the results (Table 4) interpersonal skills, integrity/honesty were ranked
lowest meaning that little, if none, training in these skills is offered by library
institutions. On the other hand, directors and school heads rank these as the key
leadership competencies. Refer to Table 3 where honesty/integrity is ranked first

94

with an importance of 4.8. The findings indicate that a big knowledge gap exists
between the expected level of training and the current training level, particularly on
the fundamental competencies. For example, honesty/integrity has a ranking of 4.8
importance is about 4.8 ÷ 5 × 100 = 96%, while the level of training at library
institutions is about 2.94 ÷ 5 × 100 = 58.8%. Second in importance are interpersonal
skills and oral communication (see Table 4). While these fundamental skills are
considered important by the professionals, their level of training is very low and is
ranked 2.76 out of 5 and 3.04 out of 5, respectively. The survey results indicate that
about 52 respondents out of 67 (~ 78%) said that teachers are not prepared or were
not taught interpersonal skills while 46 (~69%) of the respondents were either not
taught or were not sure if they learned oral communication skills. The same case
applied to integrity where most of the respondents indicated that they were not
adequately trained in this area.
A study by Levy (1992) indicated that employers expect institutions of higher
learning to give grounding training in competencies, such as: personal skills, problem
solving, leadership, and teamwork. The current training in most of the library schools
have been criticized for allowing passive absorption of these skills and competencies
rather than encouraging active participation which imparts permanent skills into the
minds of the learner and encourages them to participate in solution development and
the learning process. Various studies have criticized emphasis on specialization by
most of the formal education institutions. In their arguments, these studies document
that specialization in the current market is unsustainable as most employers in the

95

21st Century are looking for professionals with a more rounded competency portfolio
who are agile and have the ability to adapt to changing economic and market
conditions.
According to Wiegand (2000, 2005), there has been no paradigm change in
the way library schools are run ever since their inception way back in 1887. This was
when Melvil Dewey started the first library school at Columbia University. His
pioneering work was applauded by many as it opened a new chapter in the
organization and provision of information services. Previously, the work of securing
and retrieving books was a very laborious matter. Dewey’s vision during that time
was the establishment of institutions that would provide accurate, reliable, and high
quality information. The curriculum developed by Dewey at that time, was more
centered on practical matters regarding information storage, retrieval, and
management (Wiegand, 2000, 2005). For Dewey, the main aim of his pioneering
work was to produce professionals who could handle cataloging, classification, and
management of information. Dewey’s main endeavor was to improve information
access and management by providing tools/systems and human resources for running
these institutions. Dewey’s pioneering work was no-doubt successful; however,
research studies and common practice over the years have proved that fundamentally,
library schools, and accrediting bodies have continued his work without making
necessary changes and improvement that cater to the needs of the 21st Century
challenges. The stagnation in curriculum development has been caused by the
conservativeness of library schools and accrediting bodies who are resistant to

96

change. Although the accreditation standards have been periodically updated over the
years, they have still to incorporate new disciplines and competencies needed to
compete in a 21st Century world. The character of modern day library learning
institutions is still the same as that formulated by Dewey centuries ago. In terms of
library management, Dewey’s main emphasis was on information management. The
same traits that Dewey inculcated in students are the same that the current institutions
train students on. Moreover, Dewey’s main emphasis was on character, expertise,
institution, and authority (Wiegand, 1986). These are discussed as follows:
Character: Library professions were to have possession of a college degree
and be members of a homogenous social and political group. This enabled
students being trained to have moral and intellectual capabilities.
Expertise: The curriculum and methods of educating the professional was to
impart knowledge on cataloguing, classification, reference work and the
conventional library services. The core emphasis of the traditional curriculum
is on developing core competencies in information handling.
Institution: The old curriculum emphasizes the managing of the library
institution, its employees, and organization. In the modern time, this is
confused with leadership of such institutions.
Authority: This is related to power vested upon the librarians. They are
mandated with the task of preserving information and all individuals regard
them as custodians of information. (Wiegand, 1986, pp. 394-396)
Gorman (2006) in his study, stated that “even though the aim of ALA
accredited courses is to ensure that students receive the adequate library education,
the main question is whether or not ALA accredited courses give the students the
opportunity to gain knowledge on leadership so as to effectively manage libraries” (p.

97

10). The focus, however, of ALA as confirmed by the ALA curriculum standards on
issues regarding leadership and management, is to enlighten students on how to
manage information and not on how to manage people or lead an organization. As
such, a large aspect of leadership has been completely neglected.
As per the Standards for Accreditation of Master's Programs in Library and
Information Studies:
The curriculum is concerned with recordable information and knowledge, and
the services and technologies to facilitate their management and use. The
curriculum of library and information studies encompasses information and
knowledge creation, communication, identification, selection, acquisition,
organization and description, storage and retrieval, preservation, analysis,
interpretation, evaluation, synthesis, dissemination, and management. (ALA,
1992, p. 4)
Palomino (2002) carried out a research on the state of library education in the
United States against the learning goals established by Dewey curricula. In his
opening statement, he stated that information studies and library schools are not
producing well trained leaders for the library profession. He attributed this to the fact
that most of the school curricula are not focused on developing skills, and for that
matter, leadership skills – rather, most of the institutions focus on producing highly
trained professionals in a given or focused specialization. Currently, there exists
tension between generalization and specialization. A seasoned professional should
not only possess information system (IS) skills, but should also be an all-around
person capable of handling both leadership and managerial roles. The focus on

98

specialization was also emphasized by Wiegand (2000, 2005) who indicated that
library schools for the most part still follow the Melvin Dewey philosophy of
focusing more on library information and information handling rather than
generalization. Further, this concept is reinforced in the 21st Century by the
expansion of computers and information technologies, which have opened up vast
information study areas among the library professionals.
MacKenzie and Smith (2009) in their paper entitled “Management Education
for Library Directors: Are Graduate Library Programs Providing Future Library
Directors with the Skills and Knowledge They Will Need?” carried out an exploratory
study on whether or not library students acquire knowledge on the leadership
competency for effective management of library institutions. The results obtained are
very similar to what was found in this research: Out of 24 programs, 43.8% did not
offer management related courses and further, there exists a very large gap between
the skills that leaders should possess and those offered by the ALA. Time series
analysis of MacKenzie and Smith’s (2009) study and those done in the past show that
lack of leadership competencies among the library professional is, and will always be,
a big impediment to the operation and success of the library institution; therefore,
necessitating that appropriate strategies are undertaken to change the curriculum and
the standards.
Interpersonal skills have been regarded in several studies as being imperative
in training modern day leaders. Ammons-Stephens et al. (2009) indicated that “one
of the core competencies among library leaders is interpersonal and communication

99

skills” (p. 65). Interpersonal effectiveness and managerial tactics are some of the key
competencies that 21st Century leaders should possess in their decision making
process. A leader with good interpersonal skills is able to create a positive
environment, respect others, takes up responsibilities, and motivate others.
A document created by Canadian Association of Research Libraries (CARL)
on the leadership competencies for the 21st Century indicates that interpersonal skills
play a central role in defining the success of these institutions in the 21st Century. In
the document, interpersonal competencies are taken to encompass the following
(CARL, 2010):


Agility: A leader who is adaptable, flexible and eager to learn new skills
and knowledge;



Effective communication: The leader must be able to effectively convey
the institution values to the employees and other stakeholders. In addition,
the leader must encourage freedom of speech and expression, right to
information and knowledge and empower users and employees to be selfsufficient;



Must be able to negotiate on behalf of the institution;



Ability to handle change: The individual must be open minded to the
change process and advocate for it;



Decision-making: The individual must be able to make good logical
decisions. Furthermore, these decisions should be well informed so as to
assist the organizations achieve its goals;



Problem solving: The individual must be able to identify problems,
explore different solutions and alternatives that can be used to solve these
problems and select the best alternative. A leader should be able to
resolve conflict;

100



Innovation: A leader should apply imagination so as to develop solutions
to the problems;



Collaboration: Leaders should work with others so as to achieve the
organization goals; and



Other interpersonal skills: Included mentoring, writing skills, and
presentation skills. (p. 7)

Abels, Howarth, and Smith (2016) highlighted that as the character and role of
the library profession changes, so shall LIS educators transform the LIS education to
meet the demands of the profession. In their article, they highlighted the urgency of
looking beyond the traditional core teachings of LIS.
As mentioned earlier, the “Occupational Outlook Handbook” (Bureau of
Labor Statistics, 2015) projects only a “two percent growth from 2014 to 2024 for the
librarian occupation” (“Quick Facts, Librarians”), which is “much slower than the
seven percent projected growth for all other occupations” (“Job Outlook, Librarians
Chart”. This means that librarian professionals having the information management
and computer skills needed, and not being able to find jobs in the library arena, have a
high probability of being absorbed by the other occupations. For example, it has been
predicted that by 2018 there will be a shortage of between 140,000 and 190,000
people to fill the demand for 1.5 million data professionals (McKinsey Global
Institute, 2011, as cited by Abels et. al., 2016, p. 86).
Based on this outlook, there is an immediate need to design the future of the
profession “purposefully and with deliberation” (Abels et. al., 2016, p. 86).
Specifically, the design should aim at:

101

1) Educating information professionals to successfully lead and shape the
information future;
2) Paving a path for students to understand the challenges ahead;
3) Preparing students to excel in their abilities to keep pace with the rate of
change; and
4) Ensuring that LIS educators stay ahead of trends that are shaping the
information world. (p. 86)
Actions identified from the November 2015 annual conference of the
Association for Information Science and Technology (ASIST) included “the need to
recruit a wider and more diverse range of students; break down academic silos and
build bridges to create a broader discipline; and adapt for the future by creating
mechanisms to prepare faculty to teach for the changing future” (p. 92).
The ALA website provides a list of the accredited courses and those currently
in the process of accreditation. It is interesting to note that most of them do not
provide an education path where these fundamental competencies can be attained.
Further findings confirm this.
As an illustration and example, the ALA accredited core course outline of the
top ranked library school in the nation for the Master of Science in Library Science
(MSLS) Curriculum (University of Illinois–Urbana-Champaign) requires “40
customizable hours of which there are two core courses; one in Information
Organization and Access,” and the other in Libraries, Information, and Society
(University of IL, 2016, para 3). All the rest are electives, chosen by the student,
depending on the specialization(s) they want to pursue. The specializations offered

102

are Certificate in Community Informatics; Data Curation; K-12 School Librarianship;
Socio-technical Data Analytics; Special Collections Certificate; and Certificate in
Youth Services. The basic entry requirements for these courses are computer skills,
and various information competency tests one must pass.
ALA seems to be sitting in the same miasma of confusion. ALA policy
provides that librarians who have training on ALA accredited courses have the
necessary skills and are recommended for leadership positions by the body. This is
confirmed in the ALA policy manual - Section 54.2:
The master’s degree from a program accredited by the American Library
Association (or from a master’s level program in library and information
studies accredited or recognized by the appropriate national body of another
country) is the appropriate professional degree for librarians. (ALA, 2011,
“Section 54.2”)
The ALA Accreditation Standards of 2015b show positive progress towards
inclusiveness of outside constituents, emphasis of practice vs. theory, leadership and
the evolving roles of the profession, and for evidence of systematic processes in place
for decision-making, evaluation and outcome-based results in curriculum design.
However, in practice, and as per the findings in this section, very little if anything in
the delivery of the curriculum has fundamentally changed over time. Professionals
still feel either they are not or have not been properly prepared by library school to
assume leadership roles. Perhaps June Lester’s (1990) recommendation still needs to
be heeded in that more of an effort needs to be done to initiate a dialog between the
library schools, ALA, and other library associations, so that library schools become

103

more aware and be more in tune with the concerns of the field, such as staff shortages
and curriculum issues. It almost seems that ALA is listening in theory (a.k.a.,
updating the Standards), but not in practice (a.k.a., still a gap between student
learning outcomes and competencies needed by library leaders).
Figure 6 maps the changes made from the 2008 ALA Standards to the 2015b
Standards. The changes are summarized as follows:


Standard II.1 emphasizes the involvement and representation of all
constituents in the planning of the curriculum; introduces legal and ethical
issues; and the regular revision of the curriculum to keep it current.



Standard II.2 incorporated all of the old II.3 as its sub-section. It changed
the focus of the curriculum from recorded information to the broader term
of information resources and specified the management to be of people
and information.
 Sub-Section II.2.1 is the first time we see the word leadership
where assertive role of professionals was replaced with leadership
role. Also, it introduces a hint of market analysis in that it goes
beyond the realm of just providing services. It also stipulates the
provision of collections appropriate for the communities that are
served.
 Sub-Section II.2.3 de-emphasizes the theory of technology and
emphasizes the design, application, and use of technologies—
which gets more into the relevancy and experiential side of
technology in the field.
 Sub-Section II.2.5, took focus away from responding to the rapidly
changing technology and global society, and focused on
curriculum directing the rapidly changing field. This is substantial
because it’s looking proactively at the changing role of the library

104

profession and how it needs to adapt and evolve within the rapidly
changing world around it and not the other way around—i.e. being
proactive instead of reactive.
 Sub-Section II.2.6 introduces the importance of the skills needed in
the field and continuous learning, by replacing professional growth
with professional development and lifelong learning to include the
skills needed by practitioners.


Section II.5 emphasizes the involvement of end-users in the evaluation of
curriculum. It also replaces the term “reviewed” with “evaluated”.

Finally, two new sections were added:


Section II.6 looks for systems and processes in place that documents the
decision-making process along with the data to support the evaluation of
the curriculum; and



Section II.7 looks for demonstration of how the results are being used to
continuously improve the curriculum. The chart below shows the 2008
Standards mapped to the 2015 Standards (red text illustrates the
differences). (ALA, 2011, p. 6)

All librarian courses accentuate the importance of collecting, preserving, and
handling information. In contrast, the role of library in the society has changed from
a specialist to a generalist necessitating changes in the curriculum and the training
methods.
A number of library institutions having realized this shift and the vagueness of
the accreditation bodies are now shifting their focus on the provision of better and
more pertinent education to enable the students to gain much of the expected practical
skills. Tenopir (2000) in her article “Curriculum Changes in LIS: I never Learned
about that in Library School” documents that most of the institutions are changing
and broadening the scope of their institutions. First and foremost, the name of the
master’s degree program is changing more towards Information Science from Library
Science to reflect service to a wide range of professionals and also incorporate
electronic data storage and publishing, the internet, and the intranet management.
Most of the changes piloted by institutions and later by the ALA focused on
increasing distance education access, information resources, information
management, research, and information policy. This, although indicates a change, is
still focusing on improving information accesses and management, and again neglects
to focus on business management and leadership competencies among these
institutions.
Internationally, the calls for improved library education targeting the
improvement of leadership core competencies have been taken positively with some
library schools incorporating leadership courses within their programs. Chiang Mai

107

University made such an attempt to improve or design new library courses so as to
improve training on information and knowledge management and leadership (NaLamphun & Lee, 2002). However, leadership roles in this article are not so profound
and are not given the required attention. Most of the attention to the curriculum was
to keep up with the national and international trends of adding more information
management and technology courses. Any courses pertinent to organizational
management and leadership still remained as elective courses. Specifically, the
elective classes from the Faculty of Business Administration (Business
Administration) were:
•

Business organization and management (703733)

•

Management information system (703741)

•

Human resource management (703735)

The elective classes from the Faculty of Humanities (Industrial and
Organizational Psychology) were:
•

Managerial psychology and leadership (033761)

•

Organizational analysis and development (033762).

The authors also highlight the lack of funding as one of the main forces that
necessitates proper management of the new library institutions. The mechanism by
which the University was able to keep up with the changing needs of the curriculum
and best practices in programming was through faculty research, funded by grant
programs. However, with Thailand cutting back government funding to public
universities which forced budget cuts, reducing operating expenditures, and in turn,

108

reducing the number of faculty in the department. In four years, faculty decreased
from fifteen to ten and with continued retirement incentives, faculty further reduced
to nine. This created increased workloads to the remaining staff, hindering further
research, and taking away the focus from curriculum/program updates. This scenario
is universally true in times of economic downturns, such as the one experienced in the
United States in 2008. In an attempt to improve the proper management of the
University, its objectives were to increase the full-time faculty to ten and add a
number of adjunct faculty members as needed. In addition, they sought to identify
alternate sources of funding that would allow the continuous professional
development of faculty through venues, such as attending international conferences,
seminars, and short courses; allowing study leaves for advanced degrees; and
undertaking research projects.
McGann, Frost, Matta, and Huang (2007) studied the current information
system curriculum and proposed a new model for change. First, the author pointed
out that the old curriculum lacks integration, is not consistent, and contains outdated
and irreverent courses. More specifically, these authors point out that implementation
of the proposed changes is one of the main factors hindering the change process. The
authors developed a model that could be used for making informed curriculum
decisions and change management. The author compares library education courses
with other pedagogical research in medicine where integrated curricula are used. The
authors emphasize that the integrated approach to education will result to students

109

learning more, retaining more, and are able to use the learned skill in the business
environment.
The integration components were defined as: a) All courses must follow a
common framework and process; b) Pre-requisite courses must be substantial enough
so that they build essential foundational knowledge, which will be used in subsequent
courses; and c) Subsequent courses must start where the previous courses ended and
be consistent in building upon the skills, tools, and deliverables taught in the
prerequisite courses.
In line with the findings of this research, the authors found that real world
scenarios need to be incorporated in the curriculum so that students can apply these
skills to improve the library institutions. In their articles, the authors developed and
successfully applied their proposed model.
The qualitative data for the McGann et al.’s (2007) research was collected in
three ways. The first was through conducting approximately 30 formal and informal
interviews and various focus groups with Information Science (IS) students and
alumni. The second was bi-annual meetings with their IS advisory board, and the
third was studying IS career competency and system development models of top
corporate and consulting organizations.
As a result of the data collected, the following changes were integrated into
the curriculum:


An experiential component was added to the Information Science theory
to make the course more relative to real-world scenarios.

110



The curriculum was streamlined and a clear continuum and distinction was
made between the pre-requisite and core courses.



As opposed to just focusing on technology and programming, more
emphasis was given on business solutions and applications to make the
courses relevant to both IS and Business students alike.



A systems development life cycle (SDLC) process was built into the
development of the courses, meaning that the process was designed to
keep the courses updated and aligned with the industry technology
developments.



The introductory IS course was revamped and made relative to the courses
that followed. First impressions of this course as it was originally taught
was turning students away—most of it was a video and irrelevant to the
subsequent courses. The aim in the design of the new introductory course
was to have it serve as a recruiting tool for new IS majors by making it
more engaging and giving the students a positive experience.
Strategically, the best professors were assigned to teach this class as
opposed to any junior or adjunct faculty in the past. The same strategic
move was replicated for the other courses as well (i.e. matching faculty
strengths with teaching course content).



More emphasis was placed on the business side of systems development,
as opposed to the technical side. Before the revamp, business students
could not differentiate what they did from what computer science students
did.



Career path clarity was provided to the students by demonstrating how
what is taught can be leveraged and applied in the industry.



Fundamental business concepts were introduced early and consistently
throughout the curriculum. Originally, these fundamental concepts were
first introduced in the capstone classes.

111



Technical details of software tools were de-emphasized and more focus
was placed on the development of business systems. (McGann et al.,
2007, pp. 57-59)

The curriculum overhaul model is summarized in Figure 7 below:

Figure 7. Curriculum overhaul model. Adapted from “Meeting the Challenge of IS
Curriculum Modernization: A Guide to Overhaul, Integration, and Continuous
Improvement,” by S. T. McGann, R. D. Frost, V. Matta, & W. Huang, 2007, Journal
of Information Systems Education, 18(1), p. 53.

Leading Change Competencies
Next, this study sought to research the gap that exists between the leadership
competencies needed for leading change (creativity and innovation, external
awareness, flexibility, resilience, strategic thinking, vision) and the level these

112

competencies are taught in library schools. The response rate was 88.7% of the total
population surveyed (n = 63). The Executive Core Qualification skills by the U.S.
Office of Personnel Management (2016) are defined as:


Creativity & Innovation: Develops new insights into situations; questions
conventional approaches; encourages new ideas and innovations; designs and
implements new or cutting edge programs/processes.



External Awareness: Understands and keeps up-to-date on local, national,
and international policies and trends that affect the organization and shape
stakeholders' views; is aware of the organization's impact on the external
environment.



Flexibility: Is open to change and new information; rapidly adapts to new
information, changing conditions, or unexpected obstacles.



Resilience: Deals effectively with pressure; remains optimistic and persistent,
even under adversity. Recovers quickly from setbacks.



Strategic Thinking: Formulates objectives and priorities, and implements
plans consistent with the long-term interests of the organization in a global
environment. Capitalizes on opportunities and manages risks.



Vision: Takes a long-term view and builds a shared vision with others; acts as
a catalyst for organizational change. Influences others to translate vision into
action. Tables 6 and 7 rate the importance of these competencies and the level
at which library schools teach these respectively. (U.S. Office of Personnel
Management, 2016, “ECQ 1: Leading Change”)

competencies in leading change. Response rate is 88.7% (n = 63).

To test the statistical significance of these gaps, and with a null hypothesis of
zero (H0), a paired two sample for means t-test was conducted. The results suggest
the difference was significant between essential competencies (M = 4.61, SD = 0.076)

114

and what libraries are teaching (M = 2.73, SD = 0.218); t(5) = 17.12, p = 0.0000124,
(t Critical = 2.57 < t = 17.12). Statistically, with a significance of .05, there is more
than a 95% probability that there will be significant gaps between the importance of
these competencies and what is taught in library schools; therefore, the null
hypothesis is rejected.

Intuitive thinking is a way of thinking that does not
pursue rational processes such as facts and data. It is
unfocused, non-linear, sees many things at once, views
the big picture, and contains perspective. Good intuition
comes from years of knowledge and experience that
allows you to understand how people and the world
works. Its strength is that it can produce a rapid result.
It is acting on feelings or hunches. It can also be guided
by emotions.
Strategic thinking helps managers to set goals, to
determine priorities, to review policy issues, and to
perform long-term planning. Clear goals are necessary
to reach the flow-state. For a person to become deeply
involved in any activity it is essential that he or she
know precisely what tasks he or she must accomplish
moment by moment. Of course the ultimate goals of an
activity are also important, but true enjoyment comes
from the steps one takes toward attaining a goal, not
from actually reaching it.

The leadership competencies in this group comprised of traits that enable a
leader to guide the institution in the current and future business environment. In
terms of vision, a good leader should develop a vision and influence others within the
organization to work towards achieving this vision. The findings indicate that most
library directors and other professionals in this field ranked this trait as being very
important (average rating of 4.68 which is approximately 93.6%) while most of the
respondents felt that this trait was poorly trained in library institutions, the average
rating for level of training was 2.68, which represents a very low rating.
The ability for leaders to have a vision was ranked as having fundamental
importance in this study. Vision has been documented by a number of studies as one
of the key attributes of an effective modern day leader. Ammons-Stephens et al.
(2009) said that “a visionary leader integrates all the other traits, such as innovation,
forwards thinking, ability to analyze the external environment, ability to think
critically so as to organize the activities of the organization to achieve its goals” (p.
69). Further, they said that “leaders should be able to see the bigger picture of the
library institutions, that is, examine the local, regional, and global trends and imagine
the performance of the institution in the external environment” (p. 69). Sherman,
Bishop, Eggenberger, and Karden (2007) asserted that “good leaders must not only
possess vision, but should also create the vision” (p. 93). Ammons-Stephens et al.
(2009) cited “vision, authenticity, and confidence as the most important competency
for an effective library leader” (p. 69). In their work, Ammons-Stephens et al. (2009)
pointed out that “leaders should be able to inspire others, make inquiries from various

117

sources, and work for others” (p. 69). They also stated that “A good leader should
not only be able to create a vision, but, should also inspire people to work towards
achieving this vision” (p. 69). This calls for leaders to effectively create and
communicate the vision of the organization, as well as allow others to take the lead in
achieving this vision.
Studies carried out by Hopper (2005) indicated that vision is one of the crucial
leadership competencies that managers should possess. Their findings indicated that
a total of 96 traits are related to the ability of a leader to be visionary. He stated the
following:
The challenge is to become skilled in the ‘art of seeing’ and in the ‘art of
reading’ the future of libraries. Dreams, ideas, and even metaphors may be
helpful in developing the mental model of the 21st Century library. (p. 15)
Hopper continued to add that “vision, innovation, and technology are vital in
the future demand of the library institutions” (p. 15).
Resilience is the process of adapting well in the face of adversity or the
workplace and market stressors common in the business environment, and being able
to “bounce back” from difficult situations. More often than not, library institutions,
being the linchpin of the communities they are in, are constantly faced with internal
and external challenges and a leader must be able to identify, deal, and recover from
such challenges. The findings of this study indicate that there exists a large gap
between the professional expectation (4.67) and what is currently trained in these
institutions (2.32).

118

Ammons-Stephens et al. (2009) indicated that it is necessary for teachers to
train students on how well to manage the change process (p. 65). In the 21st Century,
information management tactics are rapidly changing and evolving and thus this
necessitates the development of new strategies. According to Ammons-Stephens et
al. (2009) a flexible leader should:


Have an open mind to new ideas and strategies;



Adapt to any change;



Have the ability to lead the organization through difficult situations;



Have the ability to manage the change process against the backdrop of
resistance to change by staff and the external environment. (p. 70)

Strategic thinking goes hand in hand with resilience. Having knowledge of
the market environment and the developing trends, helps form planning activities and
initiatives not only to respond and be relevant in the current conditions, but also to be
sustainable as a service in the long-term. The findings indicated a significant gap
between what is trained (2.84) and the expected importance of this trait (4.65). With
the lack of teaching in this skill, the ability to develop a library institution to cope
with future demands and a rapidly changing environment is seriously hampered. The
same trend was observed in the last two traits, External Awareness and Creativity and
Innovation; the findings indicated a significant gap between how library schools teach
external awareness (Teach at 2.92 vs. Importance 4.57) and encourage the
professional to be creative and innovative (Teach 2.86 vs. Important 4.48). The
findings obtained show that library professionals regarded all these leadership

119

competencies as important, yet the students are not guided on the proper path which
can enable them to acquire these competencies.
Wong, Gerras, Kidd, Pricone, and Swengros (2003) emphasized the need for
training library leaders on strategic planning and thinking. They emphasized that
“leaders must be, know, and do everything in their line of duty” (p. 5). This calls for
a more generalist than specialist approach when training futuristic library leaders. A
modern leader must encompass strategic planning skills, which will enable the ability
to:


Identify the outcome of strategies;



Have short and long term planning skills;



Be able to effectively plan actions of the organization. (Wong et al., 2008,
p. 3)

In terms of innovation, the findings of Ammons-Stephens et al. (2009)
documented innovation and creativity as some of the key competency skills that
modern leaders should possess. Innovation skills are important as they enable leaders
to creatively think. Such skills should be encouraged so as to ensure that students
develop inventive thoughts that will assist them in developing new strategies and
plans in the ever changing information environment. Also, the fulfillment of the
institutions goals and objectives require the development of innovative strategies and
tactics.
The ability of a library “leader to understand the external environment” is also
an important trait documented by the Ammons-Stephens et al.’s study (p. 70). They
indicated that the rapidly changing external environment in which the library operates

120

in requires leaders to have knowledge in the field so as to develop strategies that will
propel the organization into the future. For strategic leadership and change, leaders
must be aware of the external environment (Ammons-Stephens et al., 2009).

Ability to Lead Other People
The next set of attributes studied were the skills needed to obtain the ability to
lead other people. The response rate was 87.3% of the population size surveyed (n =
62). Under this construct, the main attributes for this ECQ 2: Leading People skill set
are:


Conflict Management: Encourages creative tension and differences of
opinions. Anticipates and takes steps to prevent counter-productive
confrontations. Manages and resolves conflicts and disagreements in a
constructive manner.



Leveraging Diversity: Fosters an inclusive workplace where diversity and
individual differences are valued and leveraged to achieve the vision and
mission of the organization.



Developing Others: Develops the ability of others to perform and
contribute to the organization by providing ongoing feedback and by
providing opportunities to learn through formal and informal methods.



Team Building: Inspires and fosters team commitment, spirit, pride, and
trust. Facilitates cooperation and motivates team members to accomplish
group goals. (U.S. Office of Personnel Management, 2016, “ECQ 2:
Leading People”)

The finding of this study indicated that there is a significant gap between the
library leader expectations and how well these skills are taught in library schools.

121

leading people and the level they are taught in library schools.

Figure 9. Leading people. Gap in importance and level of teaching for competencies
in leading people. Response rate 87.3% (n = 62).

For Figure 9, there exists a large knowledge gap between the expected level of
these skills and what is taught in library schools. All the skills that entail leading

122

others were highly recommended as being pivotal for the library profession, yet the
respondents indicated that these skills are barely taught. Team building received the
highest importance ranking among the four competencies in this class (4.61);
whereas, leveraging diversity scored the lowest in importance (yet still very
important) at 4.26.
To test the statistical significance of these gaps and with a null hypothesis of
zero (H0), a paired two sample for means t-test was conducted. The results suggest
the difference was significant between essential competencies (M = 4.44, SD = 0.163)
and what libraries are teaching (M = 2.44, SD = 0.273); t(3) = 14.05, p = 0.00078, (t
Critical = 3.18 < t = 14.05). Statistically, with a significance of .05, there was more
than a 95% probability that there will be significant gaps between the importance of
these competencies and what is taught in library schools; therefore, the null
hypothesis is rejected.

Emotional
Intelligence

WebJunction

Leading People
Emotional intelligence is the capacity and readiness to
understand, express and regulate emotions in one-self and in
others.

Feedback

Feedback to employees is information regarding their
performance that they can also act on. Feedback must be
shared in a manner that is understandable and perceived by
them as being provided in a highly respectful manner. As an
organization seeks to improve its performance, feedback
helps it to make the required adjustments. Feedback is
immediate. It is difficult for people to stay absorbed in an
activity unless they get timely, "online" information about
how well they are doing. The sense of total involvement of
the flow experience derives in large part from knowing that
what one does matter and has consequences. Feedback may
come from colleagues or supervisors who comment on
performance, but preferably it is the activity itself that will
provide this information.

Conflict
Management

Motivation

Motivational skills are those that enable a person to become
motivated and work toward achieving goals. This is the
readiness to understand what causes a person to become
motivated and stay that way. It helps with making sure
people are the most productive that they can be.

Empowerment

Applying
Personal
Strengths

Applying personal strengths is the readiness to realize your
own or others' strengths, which are personal attributes that
someone may have been born with and cultivated over the
course of many years and life experiences. It is the
realization that these strengths can be potentially used to the
benefit of the company.

importance between things, considering them in the same
way. Effective leadership is about balance. A balance
between challenges and skills is necessary for Flow. It is
easier to become completely involved in a task if we believe
it is doable. If it appears to be beyond our capacity we tend
to respond to it by feeling anxious; if the task is too easy we
get bored. In either case attention shifts from what needs to
be accomplished--the anxious person is distracted by worries
about the outcome, while the bored one starts searching for
other things to do. The ideal condition can be expressed by
the simple formula: Flow occurs when both challenges and
skills are high and equal to each other.

WebJunction

Teamwork

Teamwork management is the readiness to form, facilitate,
and control the teamwork. In case of effective teamwork
management each person on the team puts aside his or her
individual needs to work towards the larger group objective.

Teamwork

Active
Listening

Active listening is a way of responding to another person that
improves mutual understanding. This is a method of
listening that involves understanding the content of a
message as well as the intent of the sender and the
circumstances under which the message is given. Active
listening is a structured form of listening and responding that
focuses the attention on the speaker. The listener does not
have to agree with the speaker. He or she must simply state
what he or she thinks the speaker said.

Listening
Skills &
Customer
Service

The ability to identify and resolve conflicts has been cited as one of the roles
of an effective leader. Prerequisites to this are excellent communication skills, to
hold a proper demeanor, and be able to evaluate the facts fairly and objectively. This
in turn develops trust and loyalty by staff, which leads us to another important aspect,
which is team building. This research found the existence of a large gap between the

125

expected level of training and education on this topic. Previous studies also confirm
the importance of team building and teamwork. Interestingly enough, most
participants felt that conflict management was taught the least (2.16), yet team
building was taught the most (2.73). Team building enables leaders to become
effective, build relationships/network within and outside of the organization, promote
strategic collaboration for the attainment of the company goals and foster a good
organization culture, all of which is a good a recipe for continued growth of the
library institutions (Jordan, 2011). According to Chartered Institute of Personnel and
Development (CIPD, 2009), team building/networking is one of the most important
aspects of modern management and leadership. It results to collaboration,
connectedness between different teams and removes barriers to communication. It is
important, therefore, that 21st Century leaders are trained on the necessary team
building competencies.

Results Driven Competencies
One of the abilities of an effective leader is producing results. The response
rate for this category was 83% of the total population surveyed (n = 59). This
competency is what in the end gives credibility to a leader and builds momentum for
growth and performance excellence. Under this construct, the main disciplines
considered vital for 21st Century leaders are:


Accountability: Holds self and others accountable for measurable highquality, timely, and cost-effective results. Determines objectives, sets

126

priorities, and delegates work. Accepts responsibility for mistakes.
Complies with established control systems and rules.


Customer Service: Anticipates and meets the needs of both internal and
external customers. Delivers high-quality products and services and is
committed to continuous improvement.



Decisiveness: Makes well-informed, effective, and timely decisions, even
when data are limited or solutions produce unpleasant consequences, and
perceives the impact and implications of decisions.



Entrepreneurship: Positions the organization for future success by
identifying new opportunities, and builds the organization by developing
or improving products or services. Takes calculated risks to accomplish
organizational objectives.



Problem Solving: Identifies and analyzes problems; weighs relevance and
accuracy of information; generates and evaluates alternative solutions; and
makes recommendations.



Technical Credibility: Understands and appropriately applies principles,
procedures, requirements, regulations, and policies. (U.S. Office of
Personnel Management, 2016, “EQC 3: Results Driven”)

In this study, these factors were evaluated to determine how well these skills
are inculcated in the core curricula of library schools. The results are tabulated in
Tables 14 and 15 below.

Figure 10. Delivering results. Gap in importance and level of teaching for
competencies in driving results. Response rate 83.0% (n = 59).
Problem solving skills were rated as having the most important influence on
the ability of a leader to solve problem in a complex environment (4.76). These were
followed by customer service (4.75), accountability (4.66), ability to make wellinformed decisions (4.56), technical credibility (4.41), and entrepreneurship
respectively (4.34). As far as being offered in the curriculum, although problem

128

solving skills, technical credibility, and customer service received a much higher
rating, aspects, such as proper decisions making, entrepreneurship, and accountability
scored the lowest. A reason why problem solving, technical abilities, and customer
service received higher scores (in how well these are taught in library schools) may
be due to the fact that they are, for the most part, well-grounded in the traditional
curriculum where librarians have to specialize on technical information issues.
To test the statistical significance of these gaps with a null hypothesis of zero
(H0), a paired two sample for means t-test was conducted. The results suggest the
difference was significant between essential competencies (M = 4.58, SD = 0.176)
and what libraries are teaching (M = 2.96, SD = 0.417); t(5) = 10.93, p = 0.000111, (t
Critical = 2.57 < t = 10.93). Statistically, with a significance of .05, there was more
than a 95% probability that there will be significant gaps between the importance of
these competencies and what is taught in library schools; therefore, the null
hypothesis is rejected.

Ammons-Stephens et al. (2009) documented that problem-solving skills are
required for all library leaders. The main problem solving tactics include: a leader’s
ability to solve problems, ability to solve problems within the stipulated timelines,
ability to examine and analyze a problem before developing a solution, and the
creation of a good environment where others can participate in the problem solving.
These same authors documented the importance of accountability as one of the key
traits (4.66). However, this skill is ranked below interpersonal skills. The main
accountability attributes that Ammons-Stephens et al. (2009) suggested are,
trustworthiness, leading others by example (the leader should participate in the
organization activity and not merely give orders) and being responsible for all the
decisions that he has made.

Business Acumen
Under this class, the managerial roles and responsibilities of leadership were
evaluated. The response rate for this category was 83% of the total population
surveyed (n = 59). To determine the knowledge gap that exists between the skills
needed and the level of training, these aspects were considered:


Financial Management: Understands the organization's financial
processes. Prepares, justifies, and administers program budgets. Oversees
procurement and contracting to achieve desired results. Monitors
expenditures and uses cost-benefit thinking to set priorities.



Human Capital Management: Builds and manages workforce based on
organizational goals, budget considerations, and staffing needs. Ensures
that employees are appropriately recruited, selected, appraised, and

131

rewarded; takes action to address performance problems. Manages a
multi-sector workforce and a variety or work situations.


Technology Management: Keeps up-to-date on technological
development. Makes effective use of technology to achieve results.
Ensures access to and security of technology systems. (U.S. Office of
Personnel Management, 2016, “ECQ 4: Business Acumen”)

The results indicate that there exists a large gap between human capital
management (importance rating of 4.78 or 96% vs. taught rating of 2.12 or 42%) and
financial management (importance rating of 4.71 or 94% vs. taught rating of 2.15 or
43%), but the gap is smaller in technology management (importance rating of 4.49 or
90% vs. 3.15 or 63%), as expected since most library institutions focus on the
technological/informational aspect of library science as opposed to providing
managerial and leadership courses. Also that the main focus is specialization and not
generalization.
Tables 18 and 19 indicate the level of importance of these skills in the modern
library environment and the respondent’s perception on level of offering such courses
at library schools.

From Figure 11, technology management was rated as not being very

curriculum and library school curriculum emphasize on.

133

To test the statistical significance of these gaps with a null hypothesis of zero

This is the ability to create throughout the organization
a network of people who can help solve
implementation problems as they occur. Good
implementers customize this network to include
individuals who can handle the special types of

The results obtained verify the lack of these subjects in the core curricula of
library schools. Findings by other studies have suggested the incorporation of both
leadership and managerial skills to the curriculum and further encouraging library
school teachers to inculcate these skills to their students is essential. Proper
managerial skills are required not only in Information Science training, but also in all

135

disciplines of higher learning. Ammons-Stephens et al. (2009) listed a list of core
competencies that individuals should be trained on. Among these competencies are
managerial skills, financial management, and human resource management,
interpersonal effectiveness, personal mastery, and system thinking. AmmonsStephens et al. (2009) listed the main meta-competencies, which are “cognitive
ability, vision, interpersonal effectiveness, and managerial effectiveness” (p. 68) that
are crucial in the managerial role of leaders.

Building Coalitions
Last but not least, the competencies that help foster collaborations and
partnering were examined. The response rate was 81.7% of the total population
surveyed (n = 58). Under this construct, the main skills that were evaluated were:


Partnering: Develops networks and builds alliances, and collaborates
across boundaries to build strategic relationships and achieve common
goals.



Political Savvy: Identifies the internal and external politics that impact the
work of the organization. Perceives organizational and political reality
and acts accordingly.



Influencing/Negotiating: Persuades others; builds consensus through give
and take; and gains cooperation from others to obtain information and
accomplish goals. (U.S. Office of Personnel Management, 2016, “ECQ 5:
Building Coalitions”)

The results obtained are tabulated in Tables 22 and 23, respectively.

core course, it ranked really low at 1.97 or 39%.

Anecdotal Data
As a final section of the survey instrument, participants were asked to
recommend core competencies needed based on their experience as leaders in the
field. Interestingly enough, many responses reflected the same kind of leadership and
management competencies outlined in the survey:
“A stronger emphasis on fiscal responsibility and emphasizing the ways that
the library’s budget ties into almost everything else.”
“Knowing when to lead and when to follow; identifying/growing leaders.
“Basic level: Records Management, Disaster Planning, Grant Writing, and
Human Resources.”
“Library schools do not generally include many management courses and
most of what I have learned is from my MPA and on the job training. It
would be good to offer more management and public library classes to MLS
students, (many library schools focus more on academic librarianship which
also poses another problem).”
“There should be a practical aspect to the competencies mentioned. Library
school students learn theories of how things should be done or ways
something could be done, but graduate with no practical experience to show if
they can demonstrate this. More internships under good leaders that count for
a grade should be included.”
“Listen and consider all ideas presented by employees.”

“Should know the difference between management (daily operations) and
leadership. Little if any human relations courses at my library school.”

141

“Listening and communication skills, and non-theoretical team building (real
applications).”
“Understanding of the library as part of a greater whole, whether it be a city,
town, government, or private sector.”
“Advocacy training and ability to thrive within the funding mechanism of the
particular library.”
“Ability to listen.”
“Impartially in dealing with personnel issues.”
“Design principles (broadly defined).”
“Library Directors should be aware of the consequences of their decisions on
the workload of their library staff.”
“Strategic Planning.”
“Financial management.”
“Ability to market the value and services of the library. Ability to develop
statistics for advocacy purposes. Ability to develop outcomes based goals and
to make evidenced based decisions.”
“Bookkeeping/financial management.”
“What state libraries are and how they relate to the libraries of the state.”

142

“Rationalizing of services, programs, and personnel—not always eliminating
these, but recognizing well in advance when they will have to change and
what is the best way to accomplish that.”
“Being able to quickly adapt to change.”
“Ethical behavior for HR and Financial accountability.”
“To be able to understand and know the needs of the patrons and front line
staff. Time management.”
“A well-functioning library is a true reflection of its Director.”
“Supervision skills, administration skills such as accounting, presentation
skills, and identification of professional attributes.”
“Emotional intelligence.”
“Resilience.”
“Actual ‘leadership’ training, not just management.”
“They shouldn’t be just “library schools” any more than doctors go to hospital
schools. Having a broader worldview—the information perspective—that one
gets in an INFORMATION School is essential.”
“Contract negotiation, advocacy.”
“Grants writing and studying organizational cultures(s).”
“Real-Life experience/internships, etc.”

143

“Leadership and management are not skills that everyone develops, although
they may learn about the importance of these skills in their graduate LIS
programs. Many of the competencies you asked about in this survey are
developed over the years, and can only be learned through experience.
Professors cannot give students supervisory experience, cannot give students
responsibility for managing a real budget (and have the sleepless nights that
come with that responsibility), and being a project leader on an assignment in
one course is not the same as having responsibility for a department for five
years. Not many library schools actually teach ‘library leadership,’ but rather
teach only ‘library management’. Leadership should at least be added to
library management courses.”
“How to develop a vision and strategic plan; How to facilitate group meetings;
How to advocate.”
“Library Directors need some basic introduction to facilities management,
including maintenance, procurement, and building/expansion planning.”
“Community leadership, working closely with others outside of the
profession.”
“Just a comment—some of the things you listed, like political savvy, are
difficulty to teach and often are the result of experience more than study.”
“I included all above. I applaud you on this effort and look forward to your
results.”
Ex-Post-Facto Analysis
The next area of study was based on stage two of the research methodology.
This entailed collecting ex-post facto data obtained from a respectable source, the

144

U.S. News and World Report website which ranks graduate schools. The latest
ranking available was based solely on a 2012 survey, which was conducted by Ipsos
Public Affairs. It was distributed to 51 master’s degree programs in library
information around the nation, Canada and Puerto Rico that were accredited by the
American Library Association, asking the opinion of the dean, program director, and
senior faculty member of each of those schools. The participants were asked to rate
the academic quality of up to 10 programs offered by other institutions on a Likerttype scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being marginal and 5 being outstanding. If the
participants were not familiar with a particular institution, they were asked to select
‘don't know.’
All scores were totaled for each school and divided by the number of
respondents who rated that school. Each ALA accredited program received three
surveys and the respondents were asked to return all three to U.S. News. The
response rate was 59 percent.
For the purposes of this Executive Position Paper, a sample of the 5 highest
ranked library schools, the 5 middle, and the 5 lowest ranked were selected. The
curricula of these universities were examined to document and validate the results
obtained from the research questions. The principal aim for this study was:


To validate the existence of a knowledge gap on core leadership
competencies as per the researcher’s survey;



To check if the syllabi offered managerial and leadership courses in the
core curriculum; and

145



To determine whether there is a notable difference between the highest
and lowest ranked institutions in terms of offering core leadership
competency courses.

Discussions on Ex-Post Facto Data
An overview of the core curricula courses from the first to the last ranked
library school reveals the general lack of management and leadership courses as
applied in business. The majority of the courses emphasize information versus
organizational management. Commonalities across these universities are information
organization, information management, information systems, and research methods.
Most of these curricula offer a core set of courses which are then usually followed by
courses of specialization of the student. The most common specialties across the
board are in Archives and Preservation; Digital Librarianship; Health Librarianship;
Information Systems; School Library Media; and Services for Children and Youth.
All the reviewed curricula were accredited by ALA which is said to possess the
golden standards in terms of accreditation.
Tying back to the main objectives of looking into the core curricula of these
library schools, the knowledge gap on core leadership competencies is clearly
validated. As for the offering of managerial and leadership courses in the core
curriculum, although we do see some, the majority refer to the management of
information and not of an organization. The business-related core courses that we
occasionally see are only a one-time 3-credit course, not making the subject of
leadership and management intertwined throughout the curriculum. Organizationaltype management and leadership courses are offered mostly as electives. Programs in
universities that offered a combined master’s in information science and business
administration were not accredited by ALA. There were no combined master’s in

151

library science and business administration programs observed across the board. As
for a notable difference between the context of the core courses of the highest ranked
universities and the lowest ranked, there were no fundamental differences.

Conclusion
This study explored the degree by which library school students aspiring to
hold leadership positions are exposed to leadership competency skill courses as part
of their core curriculum and how well they are ultimately prepared to hold library
leadership positions.
Leadership ability is one of the core competencies the 21st Century leaders
should possess. It entails the ability to lead and influence others so as to realize the
organizational goals and vision. This entails a good understanding of core business
principles such as marketing (knowing your customers and meeting their needs);
money (knowing the principles of budgeting short and long-term and aligning the
funding with the programming); numbers (knowing basic statistical principles to
identify trends in library usage which will drive type of programming and reference
materials; public policy (knowing how to network with key policy makers to drive the
funding and support); and strategic planning (knowing how to navigate the
organization to keep on track with the mission, objectives and measures which will
ultimately lead towards and steward the vision). Leadership training, in its true
meaning, among the library profession has been subject to numerous discussions and
controversy. Despite the large number of studies detailing the importance of
leadership competencies in the library profession, the accreditation standards of

152

library schools still ignore these facts (as per latest accreditation standards of the
American Library Association, 2009). As a result, professional librarians find
themselves scrambling to gain on-the-job training of the business-type fundamentals
needed to run a library institution effectively, efficiently, and purposefully in order to
stay relevant and to actively compete in the 21st Century. This has resulted in
tensions between proponents for change and the traditionalists of the library
philosophy. Among the main tensions are:
1. Generalization versus specialization: Proponents for change argue that
generalization is better as the individual is trained on new skills and
abilities outside his/her field of specialization. Proponents of
specialization argue that the master in library science is a specialized
discipline dealing with information management only and those in
business management should take care of that side of the administration;
2. Practice versus theory: In practice, leadership skills are more important as
compared to information management. The rapidly changing information
environment requires sound and visionary leadership which is currently
lacking in the modern day libraries;
3. 1 year versus 2 year graduate degree;
4. Education in Information Science (the I word) versus Education for
Library Science (the L word);
5. Cataloging education versus Knowledge organization (or organization of
information) approaches;
6. Distance learning versus classroom delivery and Crisis Criers - According
to many in the literature, LIS education has been in crisis now for over a
hundred years in the US (since inception in fact).

153

The main objectives of this study were coined against the main problems
identified through the literature study. This was to evaluate the gaps between what
core competencies are deemed essential to lead and administer a library, and how
much of this is matched by the core curricula for the Masters of Library Science
degree of the nation’s top Library Schools. This formed the basis for which the
research takes a position on the necessity to change library education curriculum at
the university level, as well as the accreditation standards of ALA. The main change
advocated for is the introduction of and additional specialization (track) in business
and public administration courses as core curriculum items for students seeking to
become future leaders of these library institutions.

Recommendations
Going back to the subject of business acumen, the lack of it within the library
culture does not help either. Change cannot happen on its own. Library leaders, as
practitioners, can ultimately take a strong position in bridging this gap by changing
the thinking paradigms of library schools, library associations, and the federal library
funding institutions by shaking their core die-hard attitudes and beliefs of
librarianship, making the case for substantial change going beyond anecdotal data.
Librarians need hard core data and analysis to tell their story. Parallel to that,
libraries need to place and promote themselves strategically in the market to make
themselves relevant amidst information superpowers like Google and Amazon.
On a smaller scale, libraries must demonstrate economic impact to their
Legislators, Representatives and Senators (and Congress on the federal level) and

154

positive program outcomes to the community if they want to compete for dollars with
the local fire departments, homeland security, and social service state agencies. This
requires a healthy understanding of the dynamics of the marketplace and
demographic forecasting by library leaders. In times of not only economic
downturns, but also in healthier economic environments, libraries need to be aware of
and know the principles of grant-writing. This will enhance their programs and
services by ensuring sufficient resources for sustainability. Libraries also need to
know how to navigate the often murky and agenda-riddled political waters through
powerful and thought-out strategic plans that promote partnerships that achieve
economies of scale. Systems work best if they are set up to allow the provision of
seamless customer service, no matter where the library is located (ALA, 2015b,
Standard II.6: The curriculum, regardless of forms or locations of delivery selected by
the school, conforms to the requirements of these Standards). So far, the tools in the
toolbox of change, all stem from critical thinking skills and particularly as a leader
and public administrator which are not intertwined or incorporated in the Library
School curricula.
As Mulvaney and O’Connor (2006) wrote in their article “The Crux of Our
Crises”…“Why are LIS schools not held accountable for the state of the nation's
libraries, just as policymakers view schools of education as being responsible for the
nation's schools” (para.16)?
This researcher tends to agree with this statement. It’s like the butterfly
effect: Preparing and providing future library leaders with the right tools and

155

knowledge where it counts the most, right from the get-go instead of on-the-job
training will create an exponential ripple effect of competitiveness and relevance of
the library field in the ever-changing market and economic conditions right out of
graduate school.
This researcher’s vision is that this study will shed light on the fact that
libraries need to be run like a business, because they are a business. The accreditation
board needs to realize that librarianship may be a dying profession unless the degree
is made to be more competitive in the market. The recommendation is that library
schools add a Public/Business Administration track (to include sociology, political
science, administrative law, and public finance) to their curriculum for those students
pursuing leadership positions on the Federal, State, or Local levels. As a parallel
comparison, the researcher points to the study tracks of those students studying in the
education arena. There is a special track for those aspiring to be a district
superintendent (which includes business acumen and organizational leadership core
courses) and then, there are other numerous teacher specialization tracks for those
students aspiring to be teachers. Same way then with the library profession; those
aspiring to be library leaders, follow a leadership track and those aspiring to major in
the various other specializations follow their specialization track.
Furthermore, it is proposed that the Master’s leadership degree in library
science be a three-year program with a requirement of the final year being a paid
hybrid internship, similar to a practicum.

156

The hybrid internship, although throughout its entirety would involve realtime decision-making and real-time exercising of leadership competencies, would
consist of two types. One type would be a simulated, online exercise (FLIGBY® or
similar), and the other, an actual hands-on experience in a real library organization.
Each would last for six months with the simulated on-line internship coming first.
The hands-on experience would consist of working out in the field, side by side with
the leadership of the library organization they have been assigned to and having
material participation in planning and everyday demands of the job. At the
conclusion of the internship, the student would be able to meet with the leader they
worked with and key staff of the organization, to summarize and provide constructive
feedback of the experience from both sides and to also discuss the organizational
challenges and solutions going forward based on the strengths, weaknesses,
opportunities, and threats of the organization. The meeting report would go to the
student’s library school as a way to document the conclusion of the internship. This
internship would also lay the grounds for creating a more expedited path to
employment post-graduation of the library students.
As a final recommendation, once the graduate has gained employment as a
professional Librarian, the requirement would be to make it mandatory to obtain
Continuing Professional Education (CPE) every two years to maintain their
professional status. Excellent venues for CPE would be the core competencies
training offered by OCLC’s WebJunction, the ALA Leadership Institute, or the
Certified Public Library Administrator® Program sponsored by ALA.

Appendix A
WebJunction Competency Index for the Library Field
Introduction
The WebJunction Competency Index has been a valuable resource for libraries
since its introduction in 2009, helping staff identify and obtain the knowledge, skills,
and support needed to power relevant and vibrant libraries. However, with everincreasing economic, social, and educational demands, libraries have experienced
dramatic changes in community needs and the tools available to serve those needs.
Community members have grown to expect personalized experiences, and they want
services and resources that are easy to access and simple to share and build upon.
They expect higher levels of interactivity and accountability. Accordingly, the 2009
Competency Index has been updated to address the range of skills and abilities
required to meet evolving community needs and expectations. To update the Index,
the original competency sections were revisited and revised, informed by review of
recent competency sets from various library organizations and by input from subject
matter experts across the field. Three elements in particular have been emphasized
throughout: 21st century skills, accountability, and community.

21st Century Skills
One of the critical new directions emphasized in the updated Competency
Index is the need to foster 21st century skills in our communities. In order to do this,
library staff must be equipped with the right skill sets themselves. The competencies
have been edited in many places to reflect increased emphasis on communication,

180

collaboration, critical thinking, and creativity. Technology is ubiquitous. Selfdirected learning and innovation are highlighted throughout. The updated Index
opens with the Essential Library Competencies section, which combines the core
technology competencies with the personal/interpersonal competencies to emphasize
the body of skills and knowledge that are fundamental for everyone who works in a
library in any position.

Accountability
Libraries are experiencing an increased need to measure and demonstrate
impact. The Competency Index updates reflect the heightened expectations of
accountability, with statements about ongoing data collection and evaluation.

Community Engagement
Libraries have long been committed to building healthy, thriving
communities, but they are now seeing an increased need to create and build strategic
partnerships and expand relationships with the larger community. Community
engagement has been emphasized in many sections of the updated Competency Index,
from building awareness of current needs and identifying resources, to continuously
focusing and prioritizing efforts according to changing needs. With purposeful staff
development, libraries can embrace opportunities, build on past successes, and
proceed in promising new directions. The updated Competency Index is intended to
support staff in discovering and enhancing the skills that are most important for them
in serving communities effectively.

181

Essential Library Competencies
These competencies are the underpinning of all the other sections of the
Competency Index. Core technology skills and strong interpersonal skills are
fundamental for everyone who works in a library in any position. Librarians and
library staff who possess all of these qualities will build a vibrant and relevant library.

Core Technology Competencies
Now that technology has permeated all levels of the library’s operations and
services, every position requires some level of comfort with computers. This section
defines core technology competencies that all staff need in order to contribute to the
overall effectiveness of the organization. Success in this area, however, depends less
upon what you know right now and more upon ongoing learning. (Note: Beyond the
core, each position in the library requires varying levels of technology skill,
depending on which tasks need to be accomplished. See the Systems and IT category
for comprehensive technology competencies.)
