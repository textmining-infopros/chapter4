ABSTRACT
Community Perspectives and Public Policy Implications of Privatizing
Public Libraries in Southern California
By Vicki R. Calhoun, EdD
Purpose. This study had 3 purposes: to determine the type and degree of services
taxpayers want from public libraries and private-public libraries, to determine whether or
not a significant difference exists in levels of satisfaction between patrons of traditionally
operated libraries and patrons of privatized libraries, and to gain a greater understanding
of public policy issues related to privatization of public libraries.
Methodology. This mixed-methods study surveyed library patrons and interviewed
library employees to collect quantitative and qualitative data to identify and understand
different preferences and levels of satisfaction among public and privatized libraries in
Southern California.
Findings. Statistically significant differences were identified between various groups:
Patrons of privately operated libraries ranked technology and magazines as more
important than patrons of publicly operated libraries. Females ranked popular books,
children’s sections, and programming as more important than male patrons. More than
92% of patrons at each of the 4 libraries sampled were extremely satisfied or very
satisfied with library services. Employees of public libraries expressed different
perceptions of privatization and outsourcing than their counterparts at privatized libraries.
Employees at publicly operated libraries stressed threats to intellectual freedom,
community involvement, local control, and levels of service, whereas employees at
privatized libraries described benefits including a decrease in bureaucracy, an increase in
employee autonomy, and improved efficiencies. They preferred privatization to closing
their doors.
Conclusions. While minor service preferences varied, patrons generally seemed satisfied
with library services, regardless of whether those services were provided by public or
private employees. The public policy debate is of a philosophical or political nature, not
a practical question about meeting customer demands.
Recommendations. As economic pressures continue to affect local government budgets,
pressures will force local leaders to privatize library services. However, further research
needs to be done on the regional and long-term effects of such cost-saving measures.
Additional research also should be conducted to determine if library patrons in other
areas are as pleased with library services as those in the current study, to determine if
levels of satisfaction remain high over time, and to identify what steps can be taken to
remedy community budget crises to limit pressures to privatize.

CHAPTER I
INTRODUCTION
Background
Libraries have historically been a culturally and politically important element of
communities in North America (American Library Association [ALA], 2011). John
Winthrop, anticipating a potentially barbarous existence in the Americas as the colonists
sailed from England on March 29, 1630, carried with him a set of books that, “through
their instruction in piety, civility, and learning, would enable him to maintain the only
form of life he thought worth living” (Cremin, 1972, p. 27). Other colonists shared his
view. According to Cremin (1972),
North America was colonized during the first phase of Europe’s age of print, the
initial two-hundred-year period after Gutenberg, when a reading public gradually
came into being that for the first time in history was not confined to the clerisy or
the aristocracy. (pp. 27-28)
Though libraries tended to be small, early colonists brought with them a broad
variety of books, including ancient classics and “contemporary works of religion”; “there
were manuals of law, medicine, politics, surveying, agriculture, and conduct” as well as
“works of poetry, drama, history, and even fiction that for some made the difference
between cultivated living and mere existence; and, finally, there were the textbooks that
would ensure the continuity of civilization in the new world” (Cremin, 1972, pp. 28-29).
The widespread ownership of books “played a fundamental role in articulating the
1

2
common aspirations of” the colonial inhabitants and served as an essential cultural
resource, “inasmuch as many of them patently set forth standards of character and
conduct” (Cremin, 1972, pp. 29-30). Two particularly popular books of the day, the
Enchiridion militus Christiani of 1501 and the Paraclesis of 1516, both written by
Desiderius Erasmus (as cited in Cremin, 1972), argued that true Christian piety can best
be achieved from a manner of living based on prayer and on knowledge gained from the
personal study of divine scripture. Sympathy with Erasmus’s claim led the New England
Puritans to pursue a doctrine of universal education in which each citizen could seek his
or her own knowledge from the study of scripture (Cremin, 1972).
In 1696, Thomas Bray, an Anglican priest assigned to train members of the
colonial clergy, raised funds to establish the earliest lending library in the Englishspeaking colonies in Annapolis, Maryland (Cremin, 1972). During the next 3 years, he
established 30 additional libraries “in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Charleston, and
the parishes of provincial Maryland” (Cremin, 1972, p. 340). Town, parish, and
institutional libraries also developed during the 18th century, often stocked by
philanthropic efforts or from personal donations or bequests. For example, the collection
of books held at Harvard grew from the original 329 books donated by John Harvard in
1638 to approximately 3,000 different books by 1723. Personal and institutional libraries
remained important sources of written material through the 18th century as books
published in the Americas were limited (Cremin, 1972).
Cremin (1972) claimed, “Perhaps the most interesting innovation in the library
field, however, was the subscription library, a form which was initially imported from

3
England but which proved peculiarly appropriate to the American environment” (p. 398).
The first of these subscription libraries was established in 1731, when Benjamin Franklin
suggested to members of a mutual improvement club to which he belonged that each
member contribute books to a common pool, which could be efficiently organized and
from which each could draw (Cremin, 1972, 1980; Isaacson, 2003). Thomas Jefferson
recommended, in 1809, the establishment of circulating libraries for each county in the
state of Virginia. Cremin (1980) reported that “such organizations sprang up by the score
during the last decades of the eighteenth century and first decades of the nineteenth,
principally in the towns and cities,” and that in many cases, these local libraries tended to
include “a room or building that joined a library to the opportunity for systematic
discussion among” members of the society (p. 311).
Citizens of Peterborough, New Hampshire, started a movement to initiate a
statewide tax in 1852 and became the first community in the United States to generate
funds in support of public libraries (Nix, 2008). By the 1850s, citizens of New
Hampshire voted to support libraries as a public good, which helped to fund libraries in
local communities. Held (1973) argued that “federal legislation from 1872 to 1880 laid a
foundation for structures of public libraries, and by 1885, the older and larger cities had
built public libraries for their community” (p. 23). As various strategies developed across
the country, approximately 4,000 public libraries were in operation in the 29 states that
existed in 1896. Cremin (1988) noted that these institutions “were marked by a wide
range of institutional missions” (p. 445). He added,
Some saw themselves as “people’s colleges” committed to the widest possible
diffusion of knowledge; others, as “workshops” committed to placing their

4
collections at the disposal of scholars and legislators; and still others, as
“storehouses” committed to the preservation of the world’s knowledge. (Cremin,
1988, p. 445)
During the period from 1898 to 1909, Andrew Carnegie donated more than $39
million to construct public libraries in more than 1,400 different communities (Cremin,
1988). Further philanthropic donations continued in later years through the Carnegie
Corporation of New York. Cremin (1988) noted, “Carnegie insisted that the libraries
established with his gifts be community libraries, the property of all, open to all, and
maintained by taxes,” and offered an opinion that a community unwilling “to maintain a
library” was not worthy to possess one (p. 446). “It is only the feeling,” Carnegie argued,
“that the Library belongs to every citizen richest and poorest alike, that gives it a soul, as
it were” (as cited in Cremin, 1988, p. 446). Carnegie’s philanthropic donations were a
major force in the early 20th century that contributed to the spread of public libraries to
communities, particularly in the South, where libraries had previously not existed. The
Carnegie library donations contributed to the expansion across the nation and added to
efforts already in place in California. The Rogers Act of 1878 established taxes as a
funding source to establish and maintain free public libraries and reading rooms in
California, and it was at the end of the 19th century that libraries particularly flourished
in California (Held, 1973). By 1880, California had cultivated municipal libraries in 12
cities.
Funding of Public Libraries
A free public library may be “free” in theory, but funds must be generated from
some source in order to keep the doors open. The American Library Association (ALA)

5
took steps to normalize funding when it held a conference in 1934 to determine how
funding of public libraries might best be provided across the United States (McCook,
2002). The ALA developed a plan, later endorsed by state legislatures, in which local
communities were expected to provide financial support for library operations. The
Library Services and Construction Act (LSCA) of 1964 supplemented earlier funding
standards and ensured that libraries were made accessible and available for people with
disabilities, elderly people, homebound individuals, poor individuals, and others with
special needs (Held, 1973).
While public libraries once operated as profit centers, most libraries by the mid20th century were publicly funded, and few libraries operate primarily to generate profits
(McCook, 2011; Schuman, 1998). Ordinary public libraries are now generally
established, funded, and operated by local, regional, or state governments for the benefit
and use of constituent citizens, each of whom provides financial support through taxes
(McCook, 2011; Schuman, 1998).
In 2007, the United States experienced a financial crisis from which the country
has not yet recovered to historical standards of normalcy (Borbely, 2009; UCLA
Anderson Forecast, 2013). Public libraries are funded directly from property taxes that
result from economic activity. When the economy thrives, local, regional, and state
government taxes expand and the funds are disbursed into public goods, such as fire,
police, and libraries. However, when the economy weakens, local taxes diminish, and
publicly funded services like libraries are impacted and are sometimes required to seek
alternative funding (“Recession,” n.d.).

6
According to the ALA (2012),
California’s 2011-2012 budgets contained a 50% cut to the $30.4 million statelevel support for public library programs, providing per capita allocations, support
for interlibrary loan, and funding for literacy instruction. In December 2011,
Governor Jerry Brown announced a mid-year adjustment that eliminates all
remaining funding for these programs. His first budget for 2012-2013 continues
to eliminate all funding for public library programs and makes a $1.1 million cut
to the State Library administration budget to reflect a decrease in anticipated
administrative workload resulting from the previous year’s cuts. (“Libraries
Persevere,” para. 4)
As local governments responded to impacts of the recession, some civic leaders
began to question the assumption that libraries and other public services are all essential
elements of the public good. As local tax revenues decreased, many local governments
responded by reducing or eliminating funding to libraries (City of Moorpark, 2013; City
of Moreno Valley, 2009; Gilroy & Moore, 2010; Library Systems and Services Inc.
[LSSI], n.d.b; Yorba Linda Public Library, n.d.).
An economic recession is defined as a “downward trend in the business cycle
characterized by a decline in production and employment, which in turn lowers
household income and spending” (“Recession,” n.d., entry 4). When household incomes
and spending decrease and homes become less affordable sales decline. In that regard,
the 2008 recession led to home foreclosures (UCLA Anderson Forecast, 2007), credit
defaults (Arora, Gandhi, & Longstaff, 2011), bank failures (Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation, 2014), and, in some cases, even bank bailouts. With reduced economic
consumption and reduced access to credit, production and employment decrease,
resulting in reduced levels of taxable income and reduced levels of tax revenue at the city
and county level (Lee, Willhide, & Pome, 2014).

7
Local governments, forced to prioritize the use of available funds between public
safety programs and socially desirable programs, such as libraries, have elected to reduce
funding to libraries. According to the ALA (2012), up to 65% of public libraries reported
flat or decreasing operating budgets from 2009 to 2012. As late as February 6, 2014,
budget reductions were being proposed for public libraries (Barack, 2014). In March of
2014, the ALA (n.d.a) reported that, in general, dramatic reductions in library budgets
had decreased, but public libraries were still being asked to provide services to a
population of patrons that increased during the economic downturn, still with funding
significantly below levels of 2009.
Privatization as a
Cost-Saving Strategy
According to Feigenbaum and Henig (1997), there are two reasons a community
may benefit from privatization: (a) improved levels of service or quality of life for the
citizenry, and (b) maintaining constancy in services or quality of life while reducing
costs. Libraries in the 1980s were one of many services traditionally provided by
government that were suddenly shifted to private vendors (Feigenbaum & Henig, 1997).
The current argument, consistent with Feigenbaum and Henig’s second rationale, is that
for-profit and nonprofit organizations can provide quality service equal to or better than
public agencies and can also reduce the cost of labor. Demands for library services, some
argue, can still be met but with the application of competitive market-oriented business
strategies. One source explained that “the rationale continues to be that many public
service jobs can be done more cheaply by private business” (Thompson & Miller, 2003,

8
p. 328), thus protecting residents from the disruption generally associated with closures
or reduced hours (Oder, 2004).
In the summer of 1997, the 25 libraries affiliated with the Riverside County
Library System were the first of four library systems to be privatized in California
(Goldberg, 2011). Since that time, Library Systems and Services Inc. (LSSI) has been
assigned operational management of all private partnership libraries in the state of
California, including six community public libraries in the Los Angeles area: Moorpark,
which transitioned to LSSI management in 2007; Camarillo and Santa Clarita, which
transitioned in 2011; and Moreno Valley, Simi Valley, and Palmdale, which transitioned
in 2013 (LSSI, 2013). On September 5, 2013, LSSI formed a private-public partnership
with Moreno Valley Public Library (LSSI, 2013). The proposal to form this partnership
received unanimous approval from the Moreno Valley City Council. LSSI projected that
its management of the library facility would result in $1.4 million in savings over 5 years.
Hours of service also expanded, and the library was slated to be open 7 days a week
(LSSI, 2013).
Schuman (1998) pronounced that privatization of public libraries threatens the
core values of a community because the selected vendor is not subject to direct control by
elected officials and is thus removed from traditional accountability measures.
“Privatization,” which he noted had begun with public libraries in California in the early
1990s, “often brings with it the appearance of change—at the ultimate expense of the
public,” and community members must take action to stop privatization (Schuman, 1998,
p. 51).

9
Libraries, Communities,
and Public Opinion
Feather (2003) argued that laws exist to ensure open meetings and public
participation in decisions made by local government officials. The Brown Act,
established in California Government Code section 54953.7, requires elected officials to
post an agenda, conduct business in the open, work for the public good, empower citizens
to participate in community decision making, include citizens in setting priorities, and
streamline agreements with their communities (as cited in Feather, 2003). This gives
citizens more say in providing local services to the community and keeps citizens
involved in decision making, which builds trust with their local government to have an
informal exchange of information at public meetings. In contrast to the goals of the
Brown Act, Thompson and Miller (2003) argued that decisions to outsource library
services lead to “a clear sense of policy direction and clarity of mission” and ultimately
undercut “efficiency and public confidence” and lead to public skepticism and “corrosive
cynicism” (p. 342).
A survey by Goldberg (2011) revealed that three out of four respondents opposed
private-public libraries, and of 2,509 respondents, 58% indicated that libraries should stay
public and remain under publicly supervised library management and qualified staff.
Community engagement results from empowering citizens to become involved in
community decision making. It also ensures that library administrators hear the voices of
citizens so that libraries can meet their needs, which then helps the community set
priorities. Goulding (2009) noted that librarians should consider two distinct measures:
The libraries must “try to overcome citizens’ growing sense of disconnection, cynicism

10
and distrust of government and” they must “encourage community involvement in policy
development and service delivery” (p. 38). Thus, giving citizens more say in determining
the appropriate level of services provided to the community and keeping them involved
in decision making will allow patrons to build trust with their local government through
library use. By doing so, the library can help to justify the legitimacy of local
government.
In many localities across the United States, libraries are a vital part of the social
fabric of a community. Hildreth (2012) offered that “many community libraries invest in
different programs that support civic engagement goals that contribute to stronger
communities” (p. 44). Young (2012) asserted that libraries “are key facilitators of
community advancement which helps with community conversation in many ways”
because they can

(p. 30)

Libraries also help the community connect and interact with government and
community decision makers. Libraries are available to most community residents, which
helps with civic education. According to Young (2012), libraries across the country “are
helping to build neighborhoods, facilitate civic and community engagement and improve
residents’ lives” (p. 32).

11
Competition and
Customer Satisfaction
As financial challenges continue to impact public libraries, library administrators
and staff members have been forced to develop the types and levels of services
consumers most demand and to identify and implement a set of best practices allowing
them to compete in a global information marketplace. Leonicio (2001) focused on the
need for libraries to develop cultures based on values shared between the library and
potential local patrons. It is important for patrons and librarians to share a common
vision. The development in recent years of readily available online literary and research
information resources has led to higher standards of accountability for public service.
Therefore, public libraries can no longer maintain outdated attitudes and traditional levels
of service. Libraries are great equalizers with regard to literature and research, situating
themselves in communities to bring together people of diverse ages and cultural
backgrounds in support of lifelong learning.
In 2006, Fernandez and Smith identified four ordinal measures by which to gauge
support for privatization. They administered a survey to two different groups of
respondents: those identified as public employees and those identified as nonpublic
employees. Table 1 summarizes the results of the comparison. When responses from the
two groups were compared, the differences were statistically significant. Public
employees consistently judged privatization more negatively than did employees
identified as nonpublic employees. While only 46.4% of public employees supported
privatization (either somewhat or strongly), 53.7% of nonpublic respondents indicated
that they supported privatization (either somewhat or strongly). Likewise, fewer than

12
half of the public employees believed privatization reduces costs, while more than 50%
of nonpublic employees believed privatization would reduce costs. The majority of
respondents in both groups believed privatization would improve services and would lead
to greater responsiveness to citizens (Fernandez & Smith, 2006).

Note. Adapted from “Looking for Evidence of Public Employee Opposition to Privatization,” by
S. Fernandez and C. Smith, 2006, Review of Public Personnel Administration, 26(4), p. 364.

While the research conducted by Fernandez and Smith (2006) concluded that the
majority of nonpublic employees believed privatization would result in improved services

13
and responsiveness with reduced costs, the ALA (2013) adopted a revision to the ALA
Policy Manual in 2001, addressing trends toward privatization of publicly funded
libraries. Section B.8.8 of the policy manual now states,
ALA affirms that publicly funded libraries should remain directly accountable to
the public they serve. Therefore, the American Library Association opposes the
shifting of policy making and management oversight of library services from the
public to the private for-profit sector. (ALA, 2013, p. 36)
Associated with this policy statement, the ALA (2011) produced a document
entitled Keeping Public Libraries Public, in which the association questioned whether a
private company can “maintain the level of public trust” libraries have earned over the
past 2 centuries; whether leaders of privatized libraries can or will make decisions in the
best interests of the community, “even if those decisions reduce or do not contribute to
the private company’s profit”; whether privatization of public libraries may change the
relationship of citizens to their library; and whether the management shift will change
“the role of the library as a public good” (p. 3).
Another concern with outsourcing is that little is known about the long-term
impact on the quality of services, on the continued control of costs, and on the quality of
decisions and their impact on the common good. Decisions based on short-term savings
may not consider long-term costs and benefits. Oder (2004) noted that in the long-term,
“Fully outsourced libraries no longer control compensation—and LSSI saves money on
staff. Also, the library may be less publicly accountable” (p. 36). In effect, outsourcing
management of the common good is an experiment in local government requiring “a new
form of citizen engagement for buy in, community engagement, and effective delivery”
of social services deemed to be essential (Warner & Hefetz, 2008, p. 157).

14
Governor Brown of California signed Assembly Bill 438 into effect on October 8,
2011. The bill was intended to restrict and better manage privatization, and it requires
that vendors clearly demonstrate that their services will be cost effective and will enhance
the common good (AB 438, 2011).
Statement of the Problem
Libraries have been a building block of American values since the New England
colonies were founded in the 17th century and brought with them a fundamental Puritan
belief in the importance of reading (Cremin, 1972). The widespread ownership of books
and the dependence on written documents was essential to establishing, transmitting, and
maintaining cultural values and standards of conduct. Ultimately, books became a source
for transforming those initial values and standards over the centuries. Those early settlers
depended on books for practical knowledge related to law, medicine, land, and
agricultural management, but also to guide the development of proper social and religious
conduct. In addition to practical and religious goals expressed by the colonial
inhabitants, McCook (2011) added that public libraries have contributed to “life-long
learning, support democracy, and intellectual freedom” and have been a foundational
force for the development of human communities (p. 49). The ALA (1996), an
organization developed in 1876 to provide leadership and development of libraries in
America, established a broader set of goals that have evolved from those formative years:
1. Books and other library resources should be provided for the interest,
information, and enlightenment of all people of the community the library
serves. Materials should not be excluded because of the origin, background,
or views of those contributing to their creation.

15
2. Libraries should provide materials and information presenting all points of
view on current and historical issues. Materials should not be proscribed or
removed because of partisan or doctrinal disapproval.
3. Libraries should challenge censorship in the fulfillment of their responsibility
to provide information and enlightenment.
4. Libraries should cooperate with all persons and groups concerned with
resisting abridgment of free access to ideas.
5. A person’s right to use a library should not be denied or abridged because of
origin, age, background, or views.
6. Libraries that make exhibit spaces and meeting rooms available to the public
they serve should make such facilities available on an equitable basis,
regardless of the beliefs or affiliations of individuals or groups requesting
their use. (p. 1)
The idea of libraries developed in England, but various types of libraries
developed quickly in New England and spread across the country over 2 centuries. The
evolution of libraries in California started from modest beginnings when citizens first
established libraries by privately sponsoring and funding business, creating reading
rooms, and requiring payment either through library fees or membership. Private
organizations created these so-called social libraries, or companies sponsored them for
employees and their families. Without this initiative, there would not have been any form
of libraries in these early California communities. California libraries represent the long
and continuing struggle to maximize the availability, cost, and effectiveness of a readily
active archive of information (Held, 1973). California libraries, like those in so many
other states, were established as a result of private enterprises dedicated to sharing
information. Libraries provided a vast assortment of information and an environment
supportive of social assembly. Furthermore, libraries served as a reservoir of the culture
and knowledge generated by the communities they served. Public libraries are now
recognized by many citizens as an essential function of state, county, or local

16
governments in support of the common good (ALA, 2012; Cremin, 1972, 1980, 1988;
Held, 1973; McCook, 2011; Schuman, 1998).
Though in the past century, funds in support of libraries have generally come
from state or local taxes, many governments tasked with providing library services have
experienced reduced revenues. Despite the label, free public libraries are not free. Some
local governments are responding by closing or consolidating libraries. Others are
responding by outsourcing or privatizing library services (ALA, 2012; Gilroy & Moore,
2010; Oder, 2004).
Clearly, some communities have outsourced with the goal of providing quality
services more efficiently, in essence saving libraries from a financial and political crisis.
The Riverside County Library System made such a move in 1997. The Moorpark Public
Library, Camarillo Library, and Moreno Valley Public Library followed. In all cases,
services are reported to have improved, while costs are reported to have decreased
(Goldberg, 2011; LSSI, 2013). Miller summarized the viewpoint of those who support
privatization by claiming that “all business should run as business for the good of
democracy” (Thompson & Miller, 2003, p. 328).
Some experts argue that the public good provided by libraries is threatened by
privatized libraries. Thompson questioned claims that private business could do local
jobs cheaper and more efficiently due to market-driven government reform (Thompson &
Miller, 2003). The ALA (2011) has expressed opposition to outsourcing because the
long-term impacts are unknown. The association argues that outsourcing may diminish
public trust and community engagement, harm current employees, and that the short-term

17
benefits to the citizenry will diminish over time and will eventually lead to a decrease in
the common good. The privatization trend has the potential to impact generations of
readers, young and old alike. Thompson and Miller (2003) promoted the use of the
government model and stated that it is important that private businesses be compelled to
continue the quality of service without too many changes when it comes to working in
the public sector while delivering a public service.
Taxpayers and consumers have a stake in public policy, as do special interest
groups who push for public policy at the state level. State intervention is requested where
failure to the marketplace exists. Many studies have been conducted on public libraries.
However, there has been very little research on privatization of public libraries and the
perceived impacts on local government policy. Gathering information from community
residents can help leaders make an informed decision on how they can improve library
services in their community.
Purpose Statement
This study had three purposes. The first purpose was to determine the type and
degree of services taxpayers want from public libraries and private-public libraries. The
second purpose of the study was to determine whether or not a significant difference
exists in levels of satisfaction between patrons of traditionally operated libraries and
patrons of privatized libraries. The third purpose of the study was to gain a greater
understanding of public policy issues related to privatization of public libraries.

18
Research Questions
Three research questions were posed to support the purposes of this study:
1. What services do patrons want from public libraries and private-public libraries?
2. Is there a significant difference in levels of satisfaction between patrons of
traditionally operated libraries and patrons of privatized libraries?
3. What insights from library employees add to an understanding of public policy issues
related to privatization of public libraries?
Hypothesis
There is a significant difference in levels of satisfaction between patrons of
traditionally operated libraries and patrons of privatized libraries.
Significance of the Study
Public agencies are being scrutinized in the belief that for-profit organizations can
provide equal or better services. This study was intended to isolate a select set of
situations where privatized public libraries are operating in a similar environment with
nearby publicly operated libraries, serving as a set of natural experiments in which the
benefits and weaknesses of each system may be compared and contrasted with those of
an alternately operating system. Local government officials may benefit from findings
and conclusions resulting from such a study. This study identified measures by which
local officials may assess the opportunities and threats of alternate methods of funding
local public library services, and it provides guidance on how best to use scarce resources
to provide for the public good. This study provides information on the use of public tax

19
revenues for the privatization of libraries, the effects of privatization on public
engagement with the community, and what services patrons want from libraries.
Assumptions
The following assumptions were made for the purpose of the study:
1. All participants answered all questions honestly.
2. The identities of all participants who completed the interview process and completed
the questionnaire were kept confidential.
3. The participants had experience using library services and had formed an opinion
about what services were important for them.
Definitions of Terms
The following definitions are used in this study:
Community. Social groups of any size whose members reside in a specific
locality, share government, and often have a common cultural and historical heritage.
Customer service. The assistance and advice provided by a company to those
people who buy or use its products or services.
Leadership. The position or function of a leader; a person who guides or directs a
group.
Librarian. A person trained and engaged in library services. A person in charge
of a library, especially the chief administrative officer of a library, or a person who is in
charge of any specialized body of literature.

20
Municipality. An administrative division composed of a defined territory and
population.
Outsourcing. To contract out jobs or services; for example, a small business that
outsources bookkeeping to an accounting firm.
Patron. A person who is a customer, client, or paying guest, especially a regular
one, of a store, hotel, or library.
Privatizing. To transfer from public or government control or ownership to
private enterprise.
Public good. A good or service provided without profit for society collectively.
Public policy. Manifests the common sense and conscience of the citizenry as a
whole that extends throughout the communities and is applied to matters of public health,
safety, and welfare.
Public service. A service provided (directly or indirectly) by a government to its
citizens.
Organization of the Study
This study is organized into five chapters. Chapter I entailed the background,
purpose, and research questions. Chapter II reviews the literature on municipal
perspectives, privatization of public libraries, public libraries, customer satisfaction, and
community engagement. Chapter III explains the methodologies used to gather pertinent
information on the privatization of libraries and patron satisfaction. A mixed-methods
approach was used, including interviews and questionnaires from samples of library
patrons and employees. Chapter IV presents a complete analysis of the collected data

21
and limitations to the study. Finally, Chapter V explores the results, findings, limitations,
conclusions, and recommendations.
Summary
A review of the literature provides a context for explaining the significance of the
nationwide trend in establishing privately funded public libraries, a trend of notable
increase in future years due to substantial economic cutbacks that directly impacted local,
regional, and state budgets. However, researchers have yet to examine the potential longterm effects privatization could and will have on the quality and quantity of service
delivery to patrons. Despite the fact that little research has been conducted about the
long-term effects of such a trend, in response to budget constraints, city councils and
leaders of other public institutions are being asked to make decisions about privatizing
public libraries that may have long-lasting impacts on communities. This study
compared patron satisfaction levels between publicly and privately funded libraries.

CHAPTER II
LITERATURE REVIEW
Over hundreds of years, communities in the United States have developed a
tradition of publicly funding and operating libraries for the common good. However,
decreased revenue available to local governments in recent years has led to decisions to
privatize management of libraries to prevent their closure. While some literature has
focused on the financial problems of public libraries and the history of privatization as a
potential solution, little scholarly information is available about the consequences of
library privatization. This literature review includes a review of funding of public
libraries, the evolution of libraries in California, privatization as a cost-saving strategy,
the role libraries have historically served in communities, customer satisfaction regarding
public library services, and a summary.
Funding of Public Libraries
The idea of libraries developed in England, but various types of libraries
developed quickly in New England and spread across the country over 2 centuries. The
development of libraries in California closely matched the development in other western
states of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The evolution of libraries started from
modest beginnings in California, where citizens first established libraries by privately
sponsoring and funding business, creating reading rooms, and requiring payment either
22

23
through library fees or membership. Private organizations created these so-called social
libraries, or companies sponsored them for employees and their families. Without this
initiative, there would not have been any form of libraries in these early California
communities. California libraries represent the long and continuing struggle to maximize
the availability, cost, and effectiveness of a readily active archive of information (Held,
1973). California libraries, like those in so many other states, were established as a result
of private enterprises dedicated to sharing information.
When the Rogers Act passed in 1878, “California became the 17th state to adopt a
general public law” (Held, 1973, p. 3). The law authorized any city or town in the
Golden State to establish a free public library. Each city’s board of trustees had the
authority to make its own rules, regulations, and decisions. Eureka, California, was the
first city to operate social libraries in the state, but San Francisco was the first public
library to open “under the general law” (Held, 1973, p. 5). However, Held (1973) stated
that the law changed in 1880, and subsequently boards consisted of five members, each
one specified as an “elected official” (p. 12). Additionally,
before 1880, the trustee had limited power; conversely, after 1880, the law
changed, and the governing body had control over the library, as well as the
authority to buy books; and the city council had control over the real estate and
the building expenditures. (Held, 1973, p. 13)
A free public library may be “free” in theory, but in reality it must gather funds
from some source in order to remain in operation. McCook (2011) identified two types
of libraries: “a) ordinary libraries established by local government and b) township
libraries establish by state government, but intended for at least partial support and
control by local officials” (p. 17). However, one report cited “the impact of a weak

24
economy on the decisions to curtail library hours, shutter service either for partial or even
for entire days each week, or potentially or actually closing down library services
completely” (Massis, 2011, p. 566).
Libraries rely on cities’ operating budgets from property taxes. Library funding
has been reduced as a result of forced funding choices between different forms of public
goods: fire and police protection on one hand, compared to the community benefits
gained from public libraries. Holcombe (1997) stated,
A public good, as defined by economic theory, is a good that, once produced, can
be consumed by an additional consumer at no additional cost. A second
characteristic is sometimes added, specifying that consumers cannot be excluded
from consuming the public good once it is produced. Goods with these
characteristics will be under produced in the private sector, or may not be
produced at all, following conventional wisdom, so economic efficiency requires
that the government force people to contribute to the production of public goods,
and then allow all citizens to consume them. Simple observation of the real world
suggests two problems with the application of public goods theory as a
justification for government production. First, many public goods are
successfully produced in the private sector, so government production is not
necessary. Second, many of the goods government actually does produce do not
correspond to the economist’s definition of public goods, so the theory does a
poor job of explaining the government’s actual role in the economy. (p. 1)
Libraries have changed over the course of the 20th century. According to
Goldberg (2011), the Riverside County Library was the first to be privatized in the state
of California in 1997 and also the first private library to use the services of a company
called Library Systems and Services Inc. (LSSI). LSSI was the first organization to
privatize a public library in Southern California, and, as of March of 2013, LSSI operated
the eight California library systems displayed in Table 2. Each transition was justified as
a response to budget constraints and the inability of local government agencies to provide

25
adequate services, given those constraints. At that time, LSSI was the sole vendor
providing privatized public library services in California (LSSI, n.d.a).

While transitions from public to private operation of libraries have resulted from
budget considerations, any attempts at establishing public-private partnerships must be
authorized by the local officials of municipalities where such measures are being
considered. According to Feather (2003), the Brown Act, codified in California
Government Code section 54953.7, exists to ensure open government. The Brown Act,
also known as the Sunshine Law (ordinance), provides “the right for government to
conduct business in the open” (Feather, 2003, p. 2). Local governments set out agendas
for communities and city council members to streamline agreements with local
communities. Community engagement empowers citizens to become involved in
community decision making and ensures that local governments act as citizens’ voices,

26
meeting their needs and helping the community set priorities. Giving citizens more say
in providing local services to the community and keeping citizens involved in decision
making will allow them to build trust with their local governments and will lead to an
informal exchange of information at public meetings.
Gilroy and Moore (2010) suggested that “many local governments are in
desperate straits due in part to declining property tax revenues. ‘Creative budgeting’ is
no longer sufficient to hide the need to cut spending” (p. 2). The authors also wrote that
“contracting allows governments to obtain additional help when it is most needed so that
services are uninterrupted for residents” (Gilroy & Moore, 2010, p. 2).
According to Wishner’s (2013) budget report for the City of Walnut, when it
comes to library funding, “most of the money comes from property tax. In the state of
California, the economy appears to be improving, slightly; however, there appears to be
little room for additional funding of areas such as libraries” (p. 12). Wishner added,
According to the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corporation
(LAEDC), the decision to leave tax cuts intact will enable the economy to grow
modestly in the year ahead, which will slowly decrease the high unemployment
rate. The private sector of the economy will continue to grow in 2013, however
job loss and fiscal woes will gradually recede the public sector of the economy.
(p. 12)
Across the United States, the economy appears to be steadily improving, but with only
modest growth:
The annual growth rate of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), which is the output of
goods and services produced by labor and property in the United States, has held
steady in the 2% range over the past three years; this trend is likely to continue
into the next year. Consumer spending improved with growth in the economic
and financial well-being of the households contributing to gains in the broader
economy. (Wishner, 2013, p. 12)

27
LSSI was granted permission unanimously by the Moreno Valley City Council to
establish a partnership with Moreno Valley Public Library in 2013 (Price, 2013). The
Moreno Valley City Library is open 7 days a week, and patrons can access the library
collection 24 hours a day. The library budget was approved for the year at $2.045
million, and the money derived from property taxes, library fines, library fees, donations,
community services district (CSD) zone subsidy, city general fund subsidy, personnel,
internal services, and materials. Over a series of meetings with the council to justify the
budget, LSSI proposed that it would save the city $1.4 million over the course of 5 years
(LSSI, 2013).
The Evolution of Libraries in California
While California has a large public library system today, early libraries existed in
one form or another for millennia, and they operated much differently. On the private
enterprise side, commercial lending libraries existed, “functioning with either rental
charges or subscription rates as an adjacent to a retail business” (Held, 1973, p. xii).
These were usually the only places from which to borrow books in small communities.
In larger, more established areas, readers had more options. The first option was
to use lodge or society collections. These collections allowed readers in societal
organizations, such as fraternal lodges or religious organizations, to borrow books (Held,
1973). Another type of library was the so-called “social libraries,” “which were very
prominent in western nations in the 1870s” (Held, 1973, p. xiii). These consisted of two
primary types: subscription libraries and libraries founded by “groups of citizens
concerned for the welfare of the community, primarily a reading room society” (Held,

28
1973, p. xiii). With subscription libraries, the borrowing of books and the use of a
reading room were “privileges enjoyed only by subscribing members and others who paid
a fee” (Held, 1973, p. xiii). According to Held (1973), “This type of library first came
into prominence on the east coast and then moved west” (p. xiii). Held (1973) noted, “A
group of citizens concerned for the welfare of the community, primarily a reading room
society,” supported social libraries (p. xiii). Reading rooms “had to be free to serve their
chief purpose, that of a counter-attraction to less wholesome places of entertainment”
(Held, 1973, p. xiii). Reading rooms were started by temperance and religious
organizations as well as new organizations formed especially to start a reading room in
their community.
Social libraries received funding from private sources: subscribers, fee payers,
and donors. The problem with this sort of system was that “the threat of inadequate
financial support hovered over every social library, and whenever community interest in
an enterprise waned, the threat became a reality” (Held, 1973, p. xiii). While social
libraries gained some stability by the 1870s, because of past failures it began to be
apparent in California that there was a need for public libraries that rely on a dependable
source of public funds (Held, 1973). The earliest known library of this type in California
was in Marysville. Members of the town, flush with money from the gold rush,
established a library society in 1855, which eventually became the Marysville Library
Association. The group deeded its resources to the town in 1858, and the municipal
council “consented to assume responsibility for the library that same year” (Held, 1973,
p. 1).

29
The public library movement in Marysville, California, was further spurred by the
Rogers Act in 1878, which “authorized public support by incorporated municipalities to
allow for the creation and maintenance of free libraries and reading rooms” (Held, 1973,
p. 1). The Rogers Act did not mandate that municipalities start public libraries, but “its
provisions soon elicited a favorable response from several cities and towns” (Held, 1973,
p. 1). California, in its infancy, had very few libraries, which were formed mostly in the
cities with the largest populations, due mainly to the availability of finances to remain in
business.
By 1917, Los Angeles possessed the largest public library collection in the state.
In 1926, Los Angeles opened a new library building that, at the time, was the “largest
institution of its kind west of Chicago” (Dickson, 1986, p. 79). Many library advances
occurred nationally in the late 1890s and early 1900s. Among them was the
establishment of branch libraries since, as the editors of Public Libraries noted in 1901,
nothing seems more certain than that the future will see, in every city of any
considerable size, a system of public libraries installed in numerous buildings in
various parts of the town, in much the same manner as the public school system is
managed today. (as cited in Dickson, 1986, p. 41)
Other innovations of this time included the right to check out more than one book at a
time, open shelves, and more of an effort to reach out to children.
Dewey wrote in 1903, “The library must be differentiated by subjects, for the
demands of the public are so exacting that no human being could even pretend to be
thoroughly familiar with the whole range of literature on a great variety of topics” (as
cited in Dickson, 1986, p. 43). The Dewey Decimal System was developed between
1873 and 1876, allowing for library books to be organized in an orderly manner, making

30
it easier for patrons and librarians to find books. According to Mortimer (2000), “At the
time libraries used ‘fixed locations’ to classify books. The books were kept in a fixed
physical space in the library and numbered according to their room, tier and shelf” (p. 1).
Using the Dewey invention helped libraries classify content in the same way as it is done
today.
After World War II ended, an increased amount of federal and state money was
available, and the librarians “reached out” to the community so that the community
members would utilize the services that were provided at the library (McCook, 2002).
Libraries offered different programs, including
 vocational counseling,
 job information,
 homework assistance,
 special exhibits,
 storytelling, and
 adult education courses.
However, during the 1970s and 1980s, adult education courses were being offered at the
workplace, and classes where hosted by local schools and colleges (Schuman, 1998).
Privatization as a Cost-Saving Strategy
In the mid-1980s, libraries became vulnerable to the wholesale system,
contracting out to the lowest bidder among private entities. The encroachment of
privatization threatens the core value of a community library, perhaps even its very

31
“soul” as a public service. The private sector is subject to vastly different types of
accountability. Schuman (1998) stated, “Privatization often brings with it the appearance
of change—at the ultimate expense of the public” (p. 51).
Many communities are seriously concerned about the recent budget cuts, the 2008
budget restructuring, and how these factors negatively affect California’s public libraries.
These concerns have caused some cities and counties to move toward contracting with
private library management entities. As cited in Review of Public Personnel
Administration, “The rationale continues to be that many public service jobs can be done
better and more cheaply by private businesses” (Thompson & Miller, 2003, p. 328).
Thompson “rejects the notion that the public sector has the responsibility to make itself
more like a business” (Thompson & Miller, 2003, p. 328). Schuman (1998) asserted that
communities must speak up before sacred institutions are privatized by legislatures.
Schuman also stated that the first library in California to become privatized did so over
30 years ago and that protests against this system have fallen on deaf ears. Important
issues surround privatizing libraries, and there has been a campaign to dismantle
government services and privatize them. However, current libraries, as the heart of their
communities, have come to face financial struggles.
In 2008, the United States experienced a financial crisis and is still recovering.
As a consequence, due to the economic downturn, libraries were affected by shrinking
budgets. Schuman (1998) revealed that, at one time, the federal government labeled
libraries as “commercial activities” (p. 22). Deregulation and contracting out public
services became a practice in many cities due to budget cuts, making the implicit explicit.

32
From 1997 to the present, California has been privatizing libraries. The recession has
caused municipal budget constraints across the state, which has negatively impacted city
library budgets; resources were reduced drastically due to severe cuts by their city
councils.
However, Feigenbaum and Henig (1997) wrote that two different perspectives on
the privatization of public services exist: the systemic privatization approach, used in
communist countries for social classes, which transformed the land for aesthetic values
suggesting “a better quality of life,” and pragmatic privatization, which entails “moneysaving schemes” (p. 341). Thompson quoted the Volker Commission as saying that “a
clear sense of policy direction and clarity of mission is too often lacking, undercutting
efficiency and public confidence” (Thompson & Miller, 2003, p. 328). As a result, a
“real danger of healthy public skepticism giving way to corrosive cynicism” exists
(Thompson & Miller, 2003, p. 342). The privatization experience of American
municipalities shows a decline in libraries and reveals a dramatic rise in mixed publicprivate delivery contracting of city services.
Stein (1990) used the first 1982 International City/County Management
Association (ICMA) survey on alternative local service delivery to explain the
appearance of mixed delivery as an approach to contracting out public services, which
they called joint contracting. According to Warner and Hefetz (2008), governments have
begun to substitute mixed public-private partnership delivery for other forms of market
management, such as competitive bidding, and have attempted to increase attention to
citizen recognition that market delivery alone cannot ensure greater customer satisfaction.

33
On October 8, 2011, California Governor Jerry Brown signed the Public Libraries
Measure (AB 438); this act placed more restrictions on companies. This law will remain
in effect until January 1, 2019. The law states that any company that desires to take on
the challenge of managing a public library must clearly show how this transition would
be cost effective. Assembly Bill 438 (2011) imposes certain requirements that if any
cities want to privatize their public city library in the state of California, the county
boards of supervisors shall uphold the law in their respective counties. The library
official is required to notify the board of supervisors by January 1 of any year if the
public library wants to privatize its services and no longer wants to be “part of the county
free library system” (AB 438, 2011, para. 1). According to Assembly Bill 438, the bill
imposes certain “requirements if the board of trustees, common council, or other
legislative body of a city . . . intends to withdraw” (para. 2). However, if the city decides
to move forward with privatization, the contract will keep all employed staff, and the city
must achieve cost-saving measures for the duration of the contract. The contract must
clearly demonstrate that by privatizing the library, a cost savings will occur.
Assembly Bill 438 (2011) prohibits “the contract from causing existing city or
library district employees to incur a loss of employment . . . or an involuntary transfer,
and imposing specified requirements on contracts for library services in excess of
$100,000 annually” (para. 2). If cities decide to privatize their libraries, the board of
supervisors’ clerk will be notified that the library will withdraw from the county free
system and section. The modified section 19104.5 of the California Education Code,
which governs the operation of public libraries by trustees, councils, or other legislative

34
bodies of a city or library district, includes nine requirements that must be followed if a
public library is to be separated from the county free library system. The agency must do
the following:
1. Send a statement, which the board of trustees or legislature shall publish once a week
for 4 weeks, that the action of privatization of the library has been taken; the statement
would be distributed throughout the city.
2. The contract will clearly show cost savings and will provide the same services for the
duration of the contract.
3. The city’s indirect overhead shall be included only if there is a cost in question;
however, an indirect prorated share of existing overhead will continue to cover
administrative costs, salaries and benefits, rent, equipment, utilities, material, and any
city contracts that are in existence.
4. The contract shall not be approved for cost savings but has to show that the contract
wages are at industry levels.
5. All contracts will be awarded through publicized competitive bidding.
6. Hiring practices will include specific provisions for qualified candidates, and the
hiring practices will meet the employment antidiscrimination guidelines.
7. The contract can be terminated at any time, and if there is a material breach, the
contract will be terminated within 30 days.
8. A disclosure of contract information as a part of the bid will include (a) any complaint
filed against the contractor by any state, federal, or local administration in the last 10
years; (b) any civil complaint in the last 10 year by a state or federal court;

35
(c) complaints or indictments by federal or state court in the last 10 years;
(d) disbarment by any public or licensing body at any time; (e) measurable
performance standards and an independent audit by a city or library district to make
sure that the contractor meets city performance standards; and (f) an independent audit
to be completed to make sure that cost-saving measures have been realized.
9. The contract will not exceed 5 years, and the city board of trustees and other
legislative bodies will approve the contract, but the local government can adopt more
rules regarding the contracting of public services (AB 438, 2011).
The law also requires that a city that wants to break away from its county library system
“remain a member of the county free library system until July 1 of the base year or the
date on which the property is transferred pursuant to subdivision (c), whichever date is
later” (AB 438, sec. 3, para. 3). In order to maintain the new library system, an amount
of property tax revenue equal to the property tax revenues previously allocated to the
county free library is allocated to the new library system. The exception to this is
“property tax revenues that have been pledged to repay bonded indebtedness of the
county free library system” (AB 438, sec. 3, para. 3).
According to the American Library Association (ALA, 2012), “Overall, funding
for public libraries continues to be suppressed in 2011-2012 budgets, with 5% more states
reporting decreased state funding for public libraries than in 2010-2011 [budgets]”
(“Libraries Persevere,” para. 1). Librarians are skilled in their profession, and they are
not classified as “informational specialists.” Librarians are constantly evolving, learning,
maintaining ethical standards, disseminating information, and are very savvy when it

36
comes to gathering information for patrons. The ALA added, “The private sector could
be considered the bottom line and is primarily influenced by raising money for profit”
(p. 53).
Privatization impacts other sectors of the community as well. Additionally, not
only are dollars being redirected toward privatizing libraries, but similar trends are also
evident in the criminal justice system. Gray (2010) explained that during a 2009 scheme
at the highest level of the Pennsylvania court system, privatization of a juvenile detention
center caused dysfunction among the court’s “elite judges” (p. 255). Whether because of
“intimidation, incompetence, inexperience, indifference, or corruption, the checks and
balances of power can fail without oversight” (Gray, 2010, p. 255). Because there was
no oversight of privatization, these particular judges had destroyed many lives. The socalled “Kids for Cash” scandal was a call to action for governmental systems. If there is
no one overseeing private facilities for which taxpayers are paying, “it can result in
destruction of lives and palpable injustice, given the high stakes of who’s involved”
(Gray, 2010, p. 260). Gray indicated that without strong oversight of government
privatization efforts, a government can easily stray off-course.
Additionally, in 2000, policymakers began to turn prisons over to private
companies. Corrections Corporation of America (CCA) manages 65 facilities in 21
states, with a total of over 61,000 inmates (Perrone & Pratt, 2003). Perrone and Pratt
(2003) stated that according to CCA, the company profited “U.S. $238.3 million in
consolidated revenues for fiscal year 2000” (p. 302). Approximately 4% of inmates are
held in privately operated prisons. The cost of caring for these prisoners reached $43

37
billion a year in 2000. As a result, policymakers have chosen to use private industry to
help cut costs with the assumption that the private industry could “construct and run
prisons at a higher—or at least comparable—level of quality and at a cheaper cost than
can the state” (Perrone & Pratt, 2003, p. 302).
Warner and Hefetz (2008) indicated that recent literature has challenged citizens’
viewpoints on new public management; it has been argued that the citizen is at the core of
“public service delivery” (p. 157). According to Warner and Hefetz, “Local officials
have been experimenting with a new form of citizen engagement for buy in, community
engagement, and effective delivery service for democracy” (p. 157).
Thompson and Miller (2003) promoted the use of the government model and
stated that it is important that private businesses be compelled to maintain the quality of
service without instituting too many changes while delivering a public service in the
public sector. However, Miller objected to Thompson’s view of working in the public
sector, stating that “all business should run as business for the good of democracy”
(Thompson & Miller, 2003, p. 328).
Thompson discussed private industries’ claims that private businesses could
complete local jobs cheaper and more efficiently due to market-driven government
reform (Thompson & Miller, 2003). According to this rationale, these private-sector
employers also state that such a hiring trend would boost the economy of private
businesses.

38
Feigenbaum and Henig (1997) wrote that theorists are divided concerning
privatization “since all explanations have underlying implicit and explicit assumptions,
[when there are] variations in . . . contrasting approaches” (p. 339).
Taxpayers have a stake in public policy, as do special interest groups who push
for public policy at the state level. State intervention is requested where failure to the
marketplace exists. In the early 1980s, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
introduced the concept of turning public services over to private markets (Feigenbaum &
Henig, 1997). The trend spread to North America in the beginning of the 21st century.
According to Fernandez and Smith (2006), “In the United States, the most pervasive form
of privatization is contracting out” (p. 356). The “government continues to finance
services through taxes and other services” (Fernandez & Smith, 2006, p. 357). The
argument is that for-profit and nonprofit companies can provide quality services equal to
or better than public agencies and can also reduce the cost of labor. However, in the
United States, there has been a decline in outsourcing since 1997.
In a study conducted to see which library system, public or private, would be
more effective to manage, three out of four respondents outright opposed private
management of public libraries (Goldberg, 2011). The author also discussed that, out of
2,509 respondents, 58% indicated that the library should stay public and under library
management and qualified staff (Goldberg, 2011).
Libraries, Communities, and Public Opinion
The library is a valued resource in the community, strategically located as a
community focal point serving as a civic stage for various community activities.

39
According to Meek (2012), “In a very real and practical sense, the library is an amazing
versatile utility devoted to public goods as well as nourished community life and
wellbeing and support powerful and multi-model community buildings” (p. 41). The
American Library Association formed in 1876 to develop the library as a community
asset (McCook, 2011). After the establishment of the ALA, there was a movement in the
growth of library science professionals trained and specialized in large numbers.
McCook (2011) discussed that control over libraries used to be exercised at the federal
level. The ALA’s 1934 annual conference was held with the purpose of revising how
funding was going to be implemented at the state and local levels (McCook, 2002). The
decision was made that local support would be implanted for a source of revenue. The
plan was approved, and funding was sent to states and local libraries.
In 1935, the same year that the plan was implemented, the ALA entered the
political arena and became a “public policy actor” (McCook, 2002, “A Federal Role,”
para. 2). By 1949, most of the public libraries were used by a minority of the
community. Cremin (1988) noted, “The libraries were used primarily by children and
young people and a small group of educated adults” (p. 447). Orange and Osborne (2004)
stated that the ALA put a “Library Bill of Rights” in place in 1964 so that all patrons
have the right to use the library.
McCook (2011) claimed that libraries have been places for patrons to read, study,
and seek information. Libraries are designed to facilitate change and serve as places for
citizens to meet and plan or conduct cultural activities that contribute to the quality of life
and economic vitality of the community. In addition, libraries serve as information

40
distribution centers at which residents and community leaders can meet to disseminate
and receive information vital to public policy decisions, including decisions concerning
improved library services to the community. Public libraries are designed to drive
change, and they are transformational agents for change to help patrons and communities
grow and be what they aspire to be.
Hildreth (2012) explained that libraries are trusted, valued, and safe community
resources that are available to all community residents. Hildreth added, “Many
community libraries invest in different programs that support civic engagement goals that
contribute to a stronger community” (p. 44). The outreach of libraries enables them to
inform members of the community of important public services that are available to
residents. Young (2012) described libraries as “key facilitators of community
advancement which helps with community conversation in many ways” because they can





Provide classes in English for second language learners;
Serve as voting centers;
Form partnerships with local businesses; and
Hold workshops for information exchange and organize green initiatives.
(p. 30)

Libraries also help the community connect and interact with government and
community decision makers. Libraries are accessible to all residents in the community,
which helps with civic education. According to Young (2012), across the country,
libraries “are helping to build neighborhoods, facilitate civic and community engagement
and improve residents’ lives” (p. 32). Libraries are also known to be a lifeline for all
communities, especially rural and low-income communities. In 1990, the World Wide
Web was in its infancy, and public libraries were just beginning to introduce computer

41
technologies into the public library system. According to Bertot (2009), “Public libraries
were early adopters of Internet-based technologies and have provided public access to the
Internet and computers since the early 1990s” (p. 81). Public libraries had to deal with
challenges revolving around cost as technology became a part of the library
infrastructure. For example, the Internet connections have elevated from dial-up to highspeed connections. By 1994, 20% of public libraries used the Internet, and by 1998,
public libraries offering computer services grew to almost 84% and 73% of public
libraries provided Internet services. The Internet-based service is available to all library
patrons from around the community. Bertot also stated that 82.5% of public libraries do
not have adequate computers and that some libraries have put time restrictions on patrons
and have added wireless features to help meet demands for the World Wide Web.
By 2007, according to Bertot (2009), public access to computers in public
libraries expanded, prompting the need to provide a range of publicly available services
and resources. These include the following:






87.7 percent of public libraries provide access to licensed databases
83.4 percent of public libraries offer technology training
74.1 percent of public libraries provide e-government services (e.g., locating
government information and helping patrons complete online applications)
62.5 percent of public libraries provide digital reference services
51.8 percent of public libraries offer access to e-books. (Bertot, 2009, p. 82)

In December 2000, Congress enacted the Children’s Internet Protection Act
(CIPA) to protect children under the age of 18 from obscene and harmful content at
libraries. The CIPA and the Neighborhood Children’s Internet Protection Act (NCIPA)
went into effect on April 20, 2001. According to the ALA (n.d.c),

42
Congress passed the Children’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA) and the
Neighborhood Internet Protection Act. . . . The Acts place restrictions on the use
of funding that is available through the Library Services and Technology Act,
Title III of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, and on the Universal
Service discount program known as the E-rate. These restrictions take the form of
requirements for Internet safety policies and technology which blocks or filters
certain material from being accessed through the internet. (“Overview of CIPA,”
para. 1)
The deadline for complying with NCIPA was July 1, 2002, for libraries receiving 2002
E-rate (Public Law 106-554) discounts for Internet access or internal connections. The
deadline for compliance with CIPA was July 1, 2004, following a Supreme Court ruling
in 2003 (ALA, n.d.c).
Most libraries have a hard time keeping up with technology because of a lack of
financial resources available to institutions that serve 25,000 to 100,000 constituents.
McKendrick (2012) claimed that no library has yet reached the point where a majority of
its acquisitions dollars go to electronic resources. According to Fidishun (2007), it is
important for libraries to “understand how patrons use the library for information”
(p. 329). It is also important for libraries to deliver quality services to all patrons. Public
service library administrators are interested in predicting “why and how patrons will use
the library service to better serve patrons” (Fidishun, 2007, p. 332).
Despite perceived notions of more egalitarian gender roles, women continue to
disproportionately use libraries. Fidishun (2007) administered a survey to library
patrons. According to Fidishun, “Four hundred and sixty-five surveys were distributed
and 329 were returned. Of [those] responses, 184 came from female patrons, [and] 127
came from male patrons” (p. 331). Women between the ages of 18 and 79 responded.
Additionally, 71% of respondents had a bachelor’s degree or higher. The study was

43
quantitative in nature. As the surveyor stated, “The data was . . . analyzed using a
thematic content analysis to find themes and patterns that emerged to create grounded
theory” (Fidishun, 2007, p. 331). The author found that 71% of women used technology
for work purposes, 74% for hobbies and recreational purposes, and 81% to access
medical information (Fidishun, 2007). One respondent commented to “‘keep up the good
work! Libraries are one of the best uses of our tax dollars,’ and . . . the women who
entered this library found it to be an institution that was highly valued” (Fidishun, 2007,
p. 340). Ultimately, in Fidishun’s study, one comment summed up the entire experience:
“The library is my sanctuary—place of calm—knowledge—imagination. It’s the source
of all info—so, all good” (p. 342). This article related how women take advantage of
technology at the library as a valuable family resource. By exploring how women use the
library in this manner, library leaders could learn about how a community as a whole
could better make use of this valuable treasure.
Customer Satisfaction
Today libraries have tailored their services to accommodate their patron’s needs
with quality customer satisfaction. Hernon and Altman (1998) stated, “The word
satisfaction is derived from the Latin satis (enough). . . . [I]n the late 1980s and the
1990s [libraries] ‘have moved away from the literal meaning of . . . satisfaction and
[many organizations have moved toward] consumer experiences’” (p. 182). It is
important for libraries to find a model that reviews satisfaction among patrons.
According to Hernon and Altman, Applegate’s “Model of Users Satisfaction . . . reviews
satisfaction models and satisfaction” (p. 187). Applegate suggests that staffers ask

44
meaningful questions, which will open up clear communication with patrons (as cited in
Hernon & Altman, 1998). Applegate’s model also calls for in-person open-ended
questions when interviewing and suggests that in-person surveys for a specific population
will help with clarifying questions (Hernon & Altman, 1998).
According to Jackson (2002), the “older paradigm portrays the library as a public
good” (p. 209). As a public good, the library receives public support. Due to declining
resources, libraries have to compete for support with fire, police, recreation, and other
local public services for funding. If library personnel do not recognize what their
patrons’ needs are, customers may vote against allocating funds to the library and find
other ways to receive information. However, since the library is not a product-driven
organization, there has been a shift in how complaints are addressed. The Technical
Assistance Research Program found that “96% of the customers who do have a problem
with the business do not complain” (as cited in Jackson, 2002, p. 206). The upside of
complaints is that if the issue is addressed right away, the customers become loyal to that
organization. When a customer is dissatisfied, it is important to address the issue
immediately. Studies have shown that a disgruntled customer will tell 10 to 12 people
about a negative experience, which can cause a ripple effect (Jackson, 2002). However,
customers who have had a satisfying experience will only tell three to five customers.
Similarly, complaints should be handled at the highest level to sustain loyalty
with the customers. Staff, particularly those who are on the front lines, play a critical role
in making sure that customers are satisfied. It is vital for all employees to follow policies
and procedures, be carefully trained so that they can handle any complaints, and know

45
procedures for documenting those complaints for careful review. Follow-up is a critical
piece to ensure that the issue was directly handled by the organization. It is important
that customers are satisfied with public service delivery. According to Hernon and
Altman (1998), there are depressing predictions about the future of libraries due to
changing technology, shrinking budgets, massive reorganization, and downsizing. It is
also important to note that over time those perceptions of stakeholders and the patrons
who make decisions can affect funding in their cities. When library personnel distribute
patron satisfaction surveys, they get a snapshot of a particular situation when they are not
compared to previous surveys. It gives them a glimpse of patron views of the library
service quality. User satisfaction questionnaires have been used primarily to describe
levels of satisfaction and evaluate libraries’ quality of service (Erickson, 2010).
In 1989, the Redding Library in Shasta County, California, had reopened and was
still managed under the county system. The Shasta public-private partnership began in
spring of 2007 with LSSI after closure of the county libraries from 1987-1989 due to a
lack of funding (Erickson, 2010). Consequently, the Redding public-private partnership
library is one of the three public-private partnership libraries that are managed by LSSI.
Recently, LSSI designed a questionnaire to measure and evaluate the degree of customer
satisfaction, and the questionnaire was made available to residents of the Redding
community; an in-house questionnaire was available electronically on the library’s
website (Erickson, 2010). The timeline made available to the patrons for the satisfaction
questionnaire was from October 17 through October 29, 2010. Redding community has

46
90,000 residents and a median income of $40,000. The results of the questionnaire were
as follows:
1. “What were the main reasons for your visit today?” Responses to this question were
as follows: 62% return books, 61% find books, 17% look for DVDs, 16% use
computers, 16% explore the library, 15% find audiobooks, 14% visit bookstore, 26%
get a new library card, and 25% gather information for self.
2. “Which library services have you used in the last six months?” Responses to this
question were as follows: 84% found books, 37% used the library website, 36%
looked for DVDs, 35% used library computers, 26% found audiobooks, 26% visited
the bookstore, 25% got a new library card, and 25% gathered information for self.
3. “How often have you visited the Library in the last year?” Responses to this question
were as follows: 87% once a month and 42% once a week.
4. “Degree of satisfaction with the library:” It was also noted that 99% of survey
participants were very satisfied or satisfied with the library facility and the library in
general. Similarly, 99.5% responded that they were very satisfied or satisfied with the
staff (Erickson, 2010, p. 3).
Out of the 1,278 patrons who answered questions, those who were satisfied with
particular aspects of the library responded as follows:
1. Noise level: “96% were very satisfied or satisfied.”
2. Computer access: “94% were very satisfied or satisfied.”
3. Safe environment: 96% “were very satisfied or satisfied.”
4. Programs: “90% . . . were very satisfied or satisfied.”

47
5. Materials: “98% to 75% [were] very satisfied or satisfied,” depending on the material.
6. Children’s books, newspapers, books, online databases, books in other languages,
audiobooks, electronic media, music CDs and DVDs were materials with which 89%
to 75% were very satisfied or satisfied (Erickson, 2010, p. 4).
The overall result of the satisfaction questionnaire for the Redding private-public
partnership library was very successful in the fall of 2010. The primary purpose of the
survey was to find out if customers were satisfied with the quality of service; the outcome
and the overall results were very positive (Erickson, 2010). The residents rated staff and
volunteers highly in terms of quality services the library provided. Moreover, in 2010 the
city council voted unanimously for LSSI to renew its contract with the library for 3 more
years (Erickson, 2010).
Summary
Free city libraries have been considered a standard public resource in the United
States since late in the 19th century, and in California since the passage of the Rogers Act
in 1878 (Held, 1973). However, as financial pressures have forced municipal leaders to
make difficult choices regarding whether to fund public libraries or essential public safety
programs, communities have struggled to maintain high-quality, free public libraries as
the heart of communities. A number of communities have dealt with this challenge by
contracting with LSSI to provide the services previously delivered by municipal
employees. As of March of 2014, eight such privatized public libraries were operating in
California (see Table 2).

48
The literature review examined the history of the development and funding of
public libraries; the evolution of libraries; the trend toward privatization of public
libraries as a cost-saving strategy in the United States and, in particular, in California; and
introduced LSSI, the vendor contracted to provide services to all of the privatized
libraries in California as of March of 2013.

CHAPTER III
METHODOLOGY
Little research has been conducted comparing patron satisfaction levels between
publicly and privately funded libraries, and systematic assessments have not been
performed to determine the types and levels of services customers want from their
modern community libraries, private-public libraries, and private traditional libraries.
This study was conducted to determine answers to those questions.
Chapter III presents the methodology of the study, beginning with a restatement
of the purpose of the study and the research questions, followed by a description of the
type and design of the research, the population considered, the sample of respondents
selected, and the procedures used to collect and analyze data, including a description of
the data collection instrument and the methods used to make conclusions from the results.
In addition, Chapter III describes steps taken to protect the rights and welfare of human
participants and describes known limitations of the study. Finally, the chapter concludes
with a brief summary.
Purpose Statement
This study had three purposes. The first purpose was to determine the type and
degree of services taxpayers want from public libraries and private-public libraries. The
second purpose of the study was to determine whether or not a significant difference
49

50
exists in levels of satisfaction between patrons of traditionally operated libraries and
patrons of privatized libraries. The third purpose of the study was to gain a greater
understanding of public policy issues related to privatization of public libraries.
Research Questions
Three research questions were posed to support the purposes of this study:
1. What services do patrons want from public libraries and private-public libraries?
2. Is there a significant difference in levels of satisfaction between patrons of
traditionally operated libraries and patrons of privatized libraries?
3. What insights from library employees add to an understanding of public policy issues
related to privatization of public libraries?
Hypothesis
There is a significant difference in levels of satisfaction between patrons of
traditionally operated libraries and patrons of privatized libraries.
Research Method and Design
This study utilized a mixed-methods research design. Creswell (2008) defined a
mixed-methods research design as a set of “procedures for collecting both quantitative
and qualitative data in a single study, and for analyzing and reporting the data based on a
priority and sequence of the information” (p. 642). Quantitative data are distinguished
from qualitative data by the method by which the data are collected, how they are
represented, and how they are analyzed. In this study, quantitative data were collected
from a formalized data collection instrument that comprised set questions. The results

51
were represented numerically and were analyzed using statistics (Creswell, 2008).
Alternatively, qualitative research is an inquiry approach to explore and understand a
phenomenon. In this study, qualitative data were collected by asking participants “broad,
general questions” (Creswell, 2008, p. 645). The results were represented “in the form of
words or images” and analyzed by identifying descriptions or themes by which the
“researcher interprets the meaning of the information, drawing on personal reflections
and past research” (Creswell, 2008, p. 645).
This study was designed to use mixed methods to provide a more comprehensive
analysis than would be possible by adopting a single method. Quantitative data were
collected using a formalized questionnaire designed to solicit information pertinent to all
three research questions. Qualitative data were collected from interviews of library
personnel and patrons to provide information pertinent to Research Questions 1 and 3.
Research Design Elements
As mentioned, Creswell (2008) summarized all research into two primary
methods: quantitative and qualitative. In addition, Creswell classified a number of
specific research designs within each of the primary methods. Notably, he categorized
survey research as a research design belonging to the quantitative method. Qualitative
designs include ethnographic research, which explores the “shared culture of a group of
people,” and narrative research, which explores “individual stories to describe the lives of
people” (Creswell, 2008, p. 60). Mixed-methods studies combine elements of
“quantitative and qualitative data to best understand and explain a research problem”
(Creswell, 2008, p. 60). Creswell recommended selecting and combining elements from

52
both of the primary methods when doing so “provides a better understanding of a
research problem than either quantitative or qualitative data by itself” (p. 62). This
mixed-methods study used quantitative survey design elements as well as qualitative
interview design elements common to ethnographic or narrative approaches.
Population and Sample
Population
The population for this study included all current and potential patrons of public
library services in Southern California: those who currently use the system, those who do
not use the system because they find it inadequate, and those who do not wish to use a
library under any circumstance. In short, the population for this study was “every citizen
richest and poorest alike” (Carnegie, as cited in Cremin, 1988, p. 446). Creswell (2008)
defined a population as simply “a group of individuals who comprise the same
characteristics” (p. 664). Researchers who conduct quantitative or mixed-methods
studies identify a population containing all of the individuals or organizations “with some
common defining characteristic that the researcher can identify and study” (Creswell,
2008, p. 644). This study was premised on the claim made by Andrew Carnegie “that the
Library belongs to every citizen richest and poorest alike, that gives it a soul, as it were”
(as cited in Cremin, 1988, p. 446).
Sample
While it would be ideal to “gather information about” every member of “an entire
population,” Roberts (2004) explained that “this is usually not feasible as most groups of

53
interest are either too large or are scattered geographically” (p. 134). Creswell (2008)
defined a sample as “a subgroup of the target population that the researcher intends to
study for generalizing about the entire population” (p. 152). He explained, “In an ideal
situation, you can select a sample of individuals who are representative of the entire
population” (Creswell, 2008, p. 152).
However, this study focused on understanding the different perceptions of citizens
who live in Southern California communities served by public libraries operated by
government employees compared to the perceptions of those served by privatized public
libraries. Therefore, participants were limited to citizens of communities in Southern
California. As displayed in Table 3, two pairs of libraries were originally selected as
comparison samples. Libraries in Moorpark and Camarillo were selected because they
are privatized, while libraries in Yorba Linda and Beverly Hills were selected because
they are publicly operated but represent communities with populations comparable to
those of the selected privatized libraries. The first pair, Moorpark and Beverly Hills, was
chosen because those cities have similar population sizes. Although Beverly Hills is
more affluent, with a median household income of $85,918, Moorpark residents have a
median income of over $80,000 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2014). The Moorpark library is
privately operated, while the Beverly Hills library is operated by city employees.
Additionally, Yorba Linda, with a median income of $116,881, and Camarillo, with a
median income of $83,892, have similar populations of approximately 65,968 residents
(U.S. Census Bureau, 2014). Camarillo’s library is privately operated, and Yorba
Linda’s is operated by public employees. Though each of the four libraries originally

54
authorized research to be conducted with their employees and patrons, Beverly Hills and
Camarillo subsequently rescinded permission. Therefore, Fullerton, with a median
income of $67,617 and a population of 138,000, was substituted for Beverly Hills.
Moreno Valley, with a median income of $50,393 and a population of 199,551, was
substituted for Camarillo.

Library patrons were selected to participate in the survey using convenience
sampling, which Creswell (2008) described as “a quantitative sampling procedure in
which the researcher selects participants because they are willing and available to be
studied” (p. 638). Quantitative data were collected using a formalized questionnaire
designed to solicit information pertinent to all three research questions. The instrument
was displayed on a table near the entrance of the facility during peak operating hours.
The researcher was present and solicited participation from all willing patrons as they
entered or exited the facility. Twenty male and 20 female patrons from each of the four
selected libraries were asked to complete and return the formalized 13-question
instrument included in Appendix A. Creswell also noted, however, that convenience

55
sampling lacks the statistical rigor required to “say with confidence that the individuals
are representative of the population” (p. 155). This sampling procedure was determined
to be acceptable for this study because the purpose of the study was to focus on a small
number of libraries to identify policy themes rather than to generalize the results to all
libraries in California or the United States.
In addition to surveying patrons from each of the four communities, four
librarians and four staff members from each location were interviewed. The criteria for
librarians to be considered for the interview included that they had worked as a librarian
for at least 3 years, that they had conducted at least one survey of patrons at the library at
which they were currently employed, and that they had a master’s degree in library
science. The criteria for library staff members to be considered for the interview
included that they had worked with library patrons for at least 3 years, that they were at
least 18 years of age, and that they were identified by other library staff as being familiar
with the population of patrons served by the library and knowledgeable of the library
culture of that community.
Instrumentation
Creswell (2008) described data collection instruments as tools identified or
developed in advance “for measuring, observing, or documenting quantitative data”
(p. 641). Such instruments “may include a test, a questionnaire, a tally sheet, a log, an
observational checklist, an inventory, or an assessment instrument” (Creswell, 2008,
p. 641). In addition, interviews, which are composed of open-ended questions, allow

56
respondents to express a broad range of observations and opinions “unconstrained by any
perspectives of the researcher or past research findings” (Creswell, 2008, p. 641).
This study utilized two different data collection instruments. A formal survey
questionnaire was administered to patrons selected to provide quantitative responses.
Interviews were used to collect qualitative responses from the four librarians and four
library employees. Both data collection methods were selected because they are proven
to result in cost-effective and high-quality responses (Creswell, 2008).
The standardized 13-item quantitative survey instrument (Appendix A) was
distributed to each respondent with the same set of instructions, as instructed by Creswell
(2008). Each respondent was asked to indicate his or her own perceptions of the quality
of services provided by the private or publicly operated library in his or her community.
To gauge overall satisfaction, the questions were constructed using a 5-point Likert-type
scale that ranged from a positive score of 5 to a negative score of 1 (Hernon & Altman,
1998) and asked respondents to rate services of their public library. The instrument was
developed such that it could be completed by a participant in approximately 15 minutes.
Each of the respondents was asked to complete all of the 13 questions.
A t test was conducted to compare differences between two sample groups—in
this case differences of perceptions between patrons of public and private libraries—to
determine whether the mean results of those two groups were “significantly different at a
selected probability level” (Gay, 2000, p. 483). Data were retrieved using the completed
questionnaire in Appendix A. The results were entered into a Microsoft Excel
spreadsheet, transferred into the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), and

57
coded so that each variable (gender, age, income, and private or public library) was
identified by a letter. In addition to a t test to determine if differences existed in opinions
of patrons at private and publicly operated libraries, additional tests were conducted to
determine if differences existed by gender, by income level, and by age.
Interviews
Folz (1996) stated that “questions that help to inform policy choices often
measure the preference, popularity, or acceptability of singular or competing ideas,
action, choices, or services” (p. 4). Interviews, if conducted properly, are not just
conversations. The “purpose in conducting interviews is to collect information about a
clear topic” (Folz, 1996, p. 1). Interviews can yield rich and valid data. Advantageously,
interviewers can obtain clarification of responses when they feel like answers are
imprecise, and they can clarify ambiguous questions for respondents. In this study,
interviews provided qualitative data about performance, the strengths and weaknesses of
libraries, and how service delivery is aligned with customer needs. Qualitative measures
such as interviews are well-suited for assessing this type of patron satisfaction
information.
The interviewees were not randomly selected. Rather, each interview participant
was selected because he or she had specific experience delivering services to patrons of
the library. The interview participants were notified either by telephone or e-mail and
were asked to schedule a 20-minute face-to-face interview. The interviews took place at
Moorpark’s public-private partnership library, Moreno Valley’s public-private

58
partnership library, Fullerton’s public library, and Yorba Linda’s public library. Each
librarian and library staff member was asked the following six questions:
1. What types of resources do you consider most useful to younger patrons?
2. What electronic resources are patrons most likely to use?
3. When patrons come to the library, what are the subject of question do they ask
for?
4. What type of programming do library patrons attend?
5. How do you think innovation in technology has changed the role of library
patrons?
6. What insight can you provide to add an understanding of public policy issues
related to privatization of public libraries?
Interrater Reliability
Interrater reliability is a process by which “two or more individuals observe an
individual’s behavior and record scores, and then the scores of the observers are
compared to determine whether they are similar” (Creswell, 2008, p. 641). The objective
of this process is to “negate any bias that any one individual might bring to scoring”
(Creswell, 2008, p. 641) while attempting to identify key themes that emerge from
qualitative data. To achieve interrater reliability in this study, a skilled graduate student
from the University of La Verne served as a second rater of the qualitative data solicited
from librarians and library staff members. In addition, the Dedoose software application
was used to achieve another level of interrater reliability and to independently and
automatically code themes, compare the results, and confirm the themes identified by the
researcher and the second rater.

59
Quantitative Data Collection
Data were collected from Fullerton and Yorba Linda public libraries and
Moorpark and Moreno Valley public-private libraries. Because of their geographic
proximity to each other, data were first collected from the Fullerton and Yorba Linda
public libraries. Data were subsequently collected from the Moorpark and Moreno
Valley libraries.
The survey instruments were placed on a table surrounded by chairs so that the
respondents could sit and fill out the survey. The instrument was made available until
responses from 20 respondents of each gender were completed and returned.
Protection of Human Subjects
This study required interaction with human subjects. Therefore, training required
by the University of La Verne’s (n.d.) Institutional Review Board (IRB) was completed
to obtain certification to safeguard the rights and welfare of human participants while
conducting research. The methods for collecting data, including the purpose of the study,
the research questions, the interview questions, and the survey questions, were submitted
to and approved by the University of La Verne’s IRB.
Prior to participating, subjects were provided background information about the
study and were asked to sign a consent form. A meeting took place with each participant
in a private setting to review this information prior to any data being collected. Each
participant was instructed that all identities and materials would be kept confidential and
that he or she had the right to refuse to participate. The identity of each participant was
protected from other participants by use of numerical identifiers.

60
Each participant was e-mailed a consent form and a letter of introduction,
approved by the University of La Verne’s IRB. The e-mail (Appendix B) stated the
purpose of the study with a letter of invitation to participate in the study. Once the
participants agreed to do so, they were asked to circle “I agree to participate” on the
consent form. A representative at each of the participating libraries helped to arrange
dates and times at which the interviews would be conducted. However, interview times
were also confirmed and agreed upon by the participants. The criteria for librarians to be
considered for the interview included that they had worked as a librarian for at least 3
years, that they had conducted at least one survey of patrons at the library at which they
were currently employed, and that they had a master’s degree in library science. The
criteria for library staff members to be considered for the interview included that they had
worked with library patrons for at least 3 years, that they were at least 18 years of age,
and that they were identified by other library staff as being familiar with the population
of patrons served by the library and knowledgeable of the community’s library culture.
Each participant was interviewed face-to-face at his or her home library. Before
being interviewed, each participant was assured the interview would be considered
anonymous, that the participant had the right to refuse to answer any questions, and that
the participant’s identity would be kept confidential, as required by the IRB for the
University of La Verne. Interviews began with an explanation of the purpose of the
research. All participants agreed to complete the study, and all participants gave verbal
consent in the audio recorder and written consent on the consent form.

61
Six specific, preplanned interview questions (detailed in Appendix C) were asked
of three library staff members and four librarians. Verbal responses were recorded and
transcribed. From those transcripts, key words and phrases were identified to develop
and describe themes that emerged from the data in response to the major research
questions, and these themes were combined to form “an in-depth understanding of the
central phenomenon through description and thematic development” (Creswell, 2012,
p. 247).
Protection of Respondent Privacy
To protect the privacy of the respondents, each was assigned a code name,
displayed in Table 4. Each librarian and library staff member was asked the interview
questions listed in the Interviews section.

Libraries 1 and 2 were privately operated public libraries. Participants from those
libraries are identified with PP in the first two digits of the code name. Libraries 3 and 4
were publicly operated libraries. Participants from those libraries are identified with a
single P at the beginning of the code name. The library with which each employee was
affiliated is indicated in the second to the last digit of the code name. The last digit of the
code name indicates whether an employee was a librarian, indicated by an L in the final
digit, or a staff member, indicated by an S in the final digit.
Field-Testing
A field-test is conducted to help refine the data collection instruments and to
allow improvements based on feedback prior to collecting data from official participants.
For this study, a field-test was conducted with a small number of respondents (Creswell,
2012) in a setting where the participants were located and where their shared patterns
could be studied. The survey instrument was administered to four student library patrons
at the University of La Verne. The participants consisted of undergraduate sophomores
and juniors. After reviewing the survey that addressed each of the study’s research
questions, the participants then provided feedback about the clarity of each question.
Field-test participants were asked to respond to each question on the Likert-type scale in
Appendix A. The purpose of the field-test was to ensure that the respondents understood
the instrument and believed the scale adequately addressed the research questions. Minor
adjustments were made in response to feedback from the field-test participants.
Interviews were conducted with one librarian and one library employee working
in the University of La Verne library. The instructional research librarian at the

63
University of La Verne was selected based on her years of experience as a librarian in
public libraries and 22 years of experience at the University of La Verne’s Wilson
Library. Each interview was conducted face-to-face. Additional follow-up questions
were asked with the intent of improving the interview questions. The participants
provided feedback on each question and suggested modifications for clarity.
Instrument Reliability and Validity
Only a properly designed survey can yield accurate, helpful information. Surveys
can also help community leaders determine what residents want, need, and demand from
local government officials with tax dollars. Surveys provide the benefit of allowing
researchers to measure responses among both small and large populations. Moreover,
since the survey technique uses a scientific process, the outcome can effectively yield
results with high levels of reliability and validity (Creswell, 2012).
Reliability
According to Creswell (2012), reliability means that “scores from an instrument
are stable and constant” (p. 159). The more reliable the score from the instrument is, the
more valid the score may be (Creswell, 2012). Reliability of an instrument is the best
indicator of consistency and repeatability of the measurement. Reliability will provide
confidence that the scores on an instrument will be the same every time it is administered.
Also, reliability demonstrates that a subject will consistently answer closely related
questions the same way every time. Because this study was primarily an exploration of a
new phenomenon, reliability was not a significant goal.

64
Validity
In addition to reliability, validity allows a researcher to make compelling
conclusions from the data. Researchers look for “themes in wording and how the
participants performed while taking the test” to link evidence from the current study to
evidence available from prior studies (Creswell, 2012, p. 163). Validity is the
development of sound evidence to demonstrate that the interpretation of test scores about
the concept or construct that the test is assumed to measure matches its proposed use. A
valid study is one that demonstrates to consumers of the research that the interpretation of
the test matches its intended use. Validity in this study was ensured by use of a field-test
conducted prior to the instruments being administered to any of the official participants
(Creswell, 2012).
Limitations
This study was limited to 160 participants from four libraries in Southern
California. Quantitative data were collected using convenience sampling and were
consistently collected between 3:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m. Therefore, those sampled may
not have been representative of other patrons of the four libraries, of patrons of other
libraries in California or the United States, or of patrons who use the library at different
times of the day. Furthermore, no tests of reliability were conducted with the instruments
used in this study. Results were collected more for a holistic sense of the results rather
than for rigorous statistical reliability. Therefore, the results of this study cannot be
statistically generalized to the larger population or to areas outside of Southern

65
California. The results were based on the perceptions of the librarians and staff members,
as well as those of library patrons.
Summary of Chapter III
Chapter III described the research design and methodology of the study. The
study explored perceptions of library patrons and employees at four libraries in Southern
California regarding services offered at those libraries. The intent was to determine what
services patrons want from public libraries, to determine if there were significant
differences in the levels of satisfaction of patrons of traditionally operated libraries and
patrons of privatized libraries, and to elicit insights concerning public policy issues
related to privatization of libraries.

CHAPTER IV
ANALYSIS OF DATA
Chapter IV reviews the purpose of the study, the research questions, and the
procedures for collecting and analyzing the data. In addition, this chapter presents an
analysis of the data collected and compiled during the study of perspectives regarding
privatizing public libraries in Southern California.
Purpose Statement
This study had three purposes. The first purpose was to determine the type and
degree of services taxpayers want from public libraries and private-public libraries. The
second purpose of the study was to determine whether or not a significant difference
exists in levels of satisfaction between patrons of traditionally operated libraries and
patrons of privatized libraries. The third purpose of the study was to gain a greater
understanding of public policy issues related to privatization of public libraries.
Research Questions
Three research questions were designed to support this study:
1. What services do patrons want from public libraries and private-public libraries?
2. Is there a significant difference in levels of satisfaction between patrons of
traditionally operated libraries and patrons of privatized libraries?

66

67
3. What insights from library employees add to an understanding of public policy issues
related to the privatization of public libraries?
Process for Collecting and Analyzing the Data
As described in Chapter III, the study was designed to use mixed methods.
Written surveys were administered to library patrons to collect quantitative data on
desired services. Quantitative data were collected and analyzed to investigate whether a
significant difference existed between perceptions of patrons at public and private-public
libraries. The qualitative analysis included interviews with eight public library
employees.
Written Survey Data Collected
From Library Patrons
Data were collected from four libraries: Fullerton and Yorba Linda, each of which
is served by a public library operated by government employees, and Moorpark and
Moreno Valley, both served by public libraries operated by employees of Library
Systems and Services Inc. (LSSI), a private company. Patrons of each of the four
libraries were asked to complete the formalized 13-question instrument included in
Appendix A. Forty surveys were collected from each library, 20 from male patrons and
20 from female participants. In total, 160 survey instruments were collected. The intent
of the written surveys was to understand the different perceptions of citizens who live in
communities served by public libraries operated by government employees compared to
the perceptions of those served by privatized public libraries. Demographic details of the
communities served by the selected libraries appear in Table 5.

The four communities included in the study have populations that consist of
different household sizes and varying income levels. Quantitative data were collected
using a formalized questionnaire designed to solicit information pertinent to all three
research questions. Table 6 displays details about the quantitative data collection
process, including dates, times, and numbers of quantitative instruments collected. Data
were collected over 3 days. The 3:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. data collection time was selected
to coincide with peak hours of library usage.

Quantitative data were compiled into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, which, once
completed, was imported into the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) for
analysis. Descriptive statistics were used to describe, analyze, and understand the
quantitative data.
A t test analysis of variance is most commonly used in inferential statistics in the
behavioral sciences. Researchers use the t test to make judgments about whether
perspectives, opinions, or values differ significantly between and among different
subpopulations. According to Creswell (2012), inferential statistics allow researchers to
identify, understand, and summarize characteristics, variations, trends, and tendencies
evident in quantitative data, and facilitate comparisons to descriptive statistics of
compared groups. In this study, inferential statistics were applied to the data to determine
if, based on the analysis of a small sample, significant differences existed between
compared populations (Creswell, 2012) and to support conclusions required to answer the
research questions. Neither the study design nor the statistical analyses attempted to
determine a cause-and-effect relationship among variables. Subpopulations of interest
for the study, or niches, included library employees versus library patrons, female library
patrons versus male patrons, patrons of different ages, and patrons at various income
levels, and differences were explored between employees and patrons of publicly
operated libraries versus employees and patrons of privatized public libraries.

70
Interview Data Collected
From Library Employees
Qualitative data were collected from interviews with library personnel to provide
information pertinent to Research Questions 1 and 3. Research participants were notified
either by telephone or e-mail and were asked to schedule a 20-minute face-to-face
interview. Table 7 displays details about the qualitative data collection process.

The present study gathered qualitative data at four libraries, based on interview
responses received from four librarians and four staff members. These respondents were
selected for interviews because of their consent to participate, which was established by
telephone calls prior to the initiation of the study.
The Moorpark library came under the private management of LSSI in 2007. At
the time of this study, the staff consisted of six librarians and 12 staff members. The
library is open 7 days a week, Monday-Thursday from 10:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m., Friday
and Saturday from 10:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., and Sunday from 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. (City

71
of Moorpark, n.d.). The librarian who participated in the study had worked at the library
for 6 years, and the staff member had worked there for 7 years.
The Fullerton library operates as a traditional public library, a department of the
city of Fullerton. This library opened its doors to the public in 1906 and hosts over half a
million patrons annually. At the time of this study, the staff consisted of 13 librarians and
17 staff members (Fullerton Public Library, n.d.). The librarian who participated in the
study had worked there over 30 years, and the staff member had worked there 10 years.
The Moreno Valley library came under the private management of LSSI in June
2013. At the time of this study, the staff consisted of three librarians, one library director,
and 19 full- and part-time staff personnel (City of Moreno Valley, n.d.). The librarian
who participated in the study had worked at the library for 12 years, and the staff member
had been employed there for 11 years.
The Yorba Linda library is a traditionally run library and is a department of the
City of Yorba Linda. The library receives 86% of its revenues from the city’s property
tax. On average, 1,100 patrons visit the Yorba Linda library each day. The library is
closed on Sunday. At the time of this study, the staff consisted of nine librarians and 40
staff personnel (Yorba Linda Public Library, n.d.). The librarian who participated in the
study had worked at the library for 7 years, and the staff member had been employed
there for 10 years.

Income varied from a low of approximately $20,000 up to approximately
$175,000, with income levels generally lower in Moreno Valley than in other areas and

73
higher in Fullerton and Yorba Linda, with income levels at Moorpark generally in
between. Moreover, the differences between male and female participants were also
analyzed, and participants were asked to place themselves into one of five distinct age
groups (20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, or greater than or equal to 60). The average age was
between 40 and 49.

Eight private face-to-face interviews were completed on January 7, January 8,
January 9, January 21, and March 25, 2014. Interviews were conducted with pairs of
employees from each of the participating libraries listed in Table 7. One staff member
and one librarian were interviewed separately at all four of the participating libraries.
Presentation of the Data by Research Question
Research Question 1
Research Question 1 asked, “What services do patrons want from public libraries
and private-public libraries?” Table 11 presents the mean response, standard deviation,
and rank describing the quantitative response data collected from patrons of public
libraries in Fullerton and Yorba Linda, both of which are government-operated public
libraries, and privatized public libraries in Moorpark and Moreno Valley.

Significant differences were identified between patrons of public and private
libraries in two areas of service. Patrons of privately operated libraries indicated a
statistically significant preference for technology, with a mean score of 4.18, greater than
that of patrons of publicly operated libraries, with a mean score of 4.13. However,
patrons of publicly operated libraries ranked technology as the most preferred of all
services, while patrons of privately operated libraries ranked it second. In addition,
patrons of publicly operated libraries indicated a significant preference for magazines,
with a mean response of 2.16, greater than that of their counterparts in privately operated
libraries, with a mean response of only 1.64, the lowest response of all services identified
for the study. However, both groups ranked magazines near the bottom of services they
preferred.
While the two groups differed in the services ranked most important, the rankings
of both lists were similar, differing only in the first and second ranked items and the sixth
and seventh ranked items. Technology and hours of availability were ranked highest,
with the average respondent from each group identifying those services as often desired.
Use of library databases was sometimes desired by the average respondent of each group.
Access to popular books and access to library computers were sometimes desired by
patrons of publicly operated libraries, while those services were rarely desired by patrons
of privately operated libraries. The average respondents from both groups rarely desired
access to library DVDs. The average respondents from both groups agreed that library
programs were never desired.

76
An independent t test was conducted to identify if responses from the two groups
were statistically different. The calculated t score was compared to a value identified in a
t table with n1 + n2 – 2 degrees of freedom. Therefore, with 80 participants in each of the
two groups, there were 80 + 80 – 2, or 158 degrees of freedom. For a sample of this size,
the t table indicated that any calculated t score with an absolute value greater than 2.02
was considered statistically significant at the .05 level, which indicated that there was a
5% chance that, given the sample size, the difference observed between the two groups
occurred by chance (Field, 2009). Significant differences were observed between the
perceptions of patrons of publicly operated libraries and patrons of privately operated
libraries in the relative importance of two types of service: technology and magazines.
In addition to analyses conducted to identify potential differences between patrons
of publicly operated libraries and patrons of privately operated libraries, a comparison
was made of responses from female and male patrons. The results are displayed in Table
12.
A second t test for independent samples was performed to determine if
statistically significant differences existed in the perceptions of female library patrons
compared to male patrons. Significant differences were identified between male and
female patrons in three areas of service. Female patrons indicated a statistically
significant preference for popular books, with a mean response of 3.19, greater than that
of their male counterparts, with a mean response of 2.59. However, both genders ranked
popular books fifth of nine services identified for the study. In addition, female patrons
indicated statistically significant preferences for the children’s section, with a mean

response of 3.24, and programming, with a mean response of 2.45, greater than those of
their male counterparts, with mean responses of 2.31 and 1.96, respectively. It is of
particular note that female patrons ranked the children’s section as the fourth most
important service, while males ranked that service eighth of nine services. Female
respondents ranked programming eighth, while males ranked it ninth.
Again, the ranked mean scores in Table 12 indicated the three services most
preferred included technology, hours of availability, and access to databases, the same
dominant services identified in Table 11. While the two groups differed slightly in the
ranking of services deemed most important, the rankings of both lists were similar,
differing only marginally in the first, second, eighth, and ninth ranked items. The
rankings differed more dramatically for library computers, magazines, and the children’s
section. Technology, hours of availability, and databases were ranked highest for both

78
groups, with the average respondent from each group identifying those services as often
desired. Use of the children’s section was a service sometimes desired by the average
female respondent and ranked fourth, but it was ranked eighth and was rarely desired by
male patrons. Access to popular books was sometimes desired, and access to DVDs and
magazines was rarely desired by both groups of patrons. Library programming was
rarely desired by female respondents and never desired by male respondents.
Finally, to identify potential differences between patrons of different income
levels, a comparison was made of responses from patrons with relatively low incomes
compared to those with relatively high incomes. Responses were separated into two
groups by income: those respondents with incomes less than the mean income, and those
with incomes greater than the mean income. The results are displayed in Table 13.

A t test for independent samples was performed to determine if statistically
significant differences existed in the perceptions of relatively low-income library patrons
compared to relatively high-income patron. Thus, 97 of the respondents were classified
as low-income patrons, having incomes at or below $59,999, and those with incomes
greater than $59,999, 63 respondents, were in the relatively high-income group. There
were no significant differences between the levels of satisfaction among the relatively
high-income group and the relatively low-income group.
Research Question 2
Research Question 2 asked, “Is there a significant difference in levels of
satisfaction between patrons of traditionally operated libraries and patrons of privatized
libraries?” To address Research Question 2, patrons were asked to respond to the written
survey question, “To what degree are you satisfied with the services offered by this
public library?” Response options included 5 (extremely satisfied), 4 (very satisfied),
3 (somewhat satisfied), 2 (slightly satisfied), and 1 (not at all satisfied). A total of 160
participants completed the survey from all four communities. Table 14 displays the
frequency of selection for each of the response options.
In response to Interview Question 13, 152 of the 160 respondents, or 95%,
described themselves as very satisfied or extremely satisfied with the services offered by
the public library located in their community; 5% described themselves as slightly
satisfied or somewhat satisfied, and none of the participants described themselves as not
at all satisfied. The descriptive analysis showed a very satisfied population.

Table 14 displays the distribution of all responses to quantitative Question 13,
“To what degree are you satisfied with the services offered by this public library?” Of
160 respondents, 63, or 39.4%, indicated they were extremely satisfied; 89, or 55.6%,
indicated they were very satisfied; seven, or 4.4%, indicated they were somewhat
satisfied; and one respondent indicated he or she was slightly satisfied. None of the
respondents indicated they were not at all satisfied. The same data are represented in
Table 15, organized by respondents at each of the four libraries.
Table 15 displays the distribution of responses of patrons at each of the four
libraries. Forty responses were solicited from each of the four libraries. As shown in
Table 14, 63 respondents indicated they were extremely satisfied. Of those, 14 were
from Moorpark, 13 from Moreno Valley, 20 from Yorba Linda, and 16 from Fullerton.
Of the 89 respondents who were very satisfied, 25 were from Moorpark, 26 from Moreno
Valley, 17 from Yorba Linda, and 21 from Fullerton. Of the seven who were somewhat
satisfied, one was from Moorpark, one from Moreno Valley, two from Yorba Linda, and

81
three from Fullerton. The single respondent who was slightly satisfied was from
Fullerton.

Just as Table 14 reported that 95% of all respondents described themselves as
very satisfied or extremely satisfied, Table 15 indicates that patrons at each of the four
sites reported similar high levels of satisfaction: Moorpark, 97.5%; Moreno Valley,
97.5%; Yorba Linda, 92.5%; and Fullerton, 92.5%. Likewise, 97.5% of patrons of
privately operated libraries and 92.5% of patrons of publicly operated libraries indicated
they were extremely satisfied or very satisfied. Therefore, at an intuitive level, it is clear
that a very large proportion of the patrons of each of the libraries were satisfied with the
services offered by their public library and that no significant differences existed in levels
of satisfaction between the two groups. However, hypothesis testing in general, and the t
test for independence in particular, depends on an assumption that data are normally
distributed (Field, 2009). The high levels of satisfaction indicated in Tables 14 and 15

82
suggest that the response data violate this fundamental assumption. Therefore, a t test to
determine differences in perceptions of satisfaction could not be accurately conducted.
There was evidence to support the hypothesis that there was a significant difference in
levels of satisfaction between patrons of traditionally operated libraries and patrons of
privatized libraries.
Research Question 3
Research Question 3 asked, “What insights from library employees add to an
understanding of public policy issues related to privatization of public libraries?”
Potential interview participants were notified either by telephone or e-mail and
were asked to schedule a 20-minute face-to-face interview. Table 7 displays details about
the qualitative data collection process. The six interview questions presented in
Appendix C were developed to solicit qualitative responses from employees at each of
the four libraries. Responses were collected using a digital voice and audio recorder. All
data were entered into a Microsoft Word document and analyzed using a six-step
approach recommended by Creswell (2008):
1. Carefully conduct a broad preliminary review of the transcript, read the entire
transcript, take notes of preliminary thoughts, and get “a sense of the whole” (p. 251).
2. Select one document from the set of transcripts, and begin by “asking the question
‘What is this person talking about?’ Consider the underlying meaning and write it
down in the margin in two or three words, drawing a box around it” (p. 251).
3. Begin coding the narrative by identifying and marking short segments of the text that
seem to capture important concepts recognized from the initial exploration in Step 1.

83
Label each segment by “assigning a code word or phrase that accurately describes the
meaning of the text segment” (p. 251). Complete this process for each transcript
document.
4. Once each of the transcripts has been coded as described in Steps 2 and 3, “make a list
of all code words. Group similar codes and look for redundant codes” with an initial
goal of coalescing the list into 25 to 30 main themes, keeping in mind that, “in the end,
you will need to reduce the codes to a small number of themes” (p. 252). Creswell
defined a theme as a set of “similar codes aggregated together to form a major idea in
the database” (p. 252).
5. Using the list of themes developed in Step 4, review the entire transcript “to see if new
codes emerge. Circle specific quotes from participants that support the codes”
(p. 252).
6. Finally, “reduce the list of codes to five to seven themes” associated with the most
interesting, surprising, or most frequently discussed ideas expressed by the
participants (p. 252).
After an initial codebook was developed, the data were entered into a software
application called Dedoose and reviewed for potential additional codes and themes.
Primary themes and subthemes. Six primary themes and 22 subthemes emerged
from the six-step qualitative analysis: books, programs, resources, technology,
privatization, and public libraries. These themes are presented in Table 16.

As indicated in Tables 8, 9, and 10, and corroborated by interviews with the
library employees, the services demanded by patrons of public versus privatized libraries
differ very little. According to interviewees from both types of institutions, patrons will
continue to rely on books, even in an increasingly digital age. On the other hand, patrons
of public and private libraries rely more and more on digital distributions of information,
whether in the form of e-books, Nook books, college preparation resources, or even
simple Internet uses. Visitors rely on librarians at public and privatized institutions to

85
navigate resources such as scholarly databases and articles in print at the library.
Additionally, community members patronize public and privatized libraries for the
programs that they offer, such as story times for children and author visits. The only area
in which library professionals from public and privatized institutions differed in opinion
was whether or not these vital institutions should be publicly or privately operated. As
one might expect, employees of public institutions preferred public control for fear of
losing intellectual freedom under the control of a for-profit entity. Their private
counterparts preferred private control because they had greater control and decisionmaking abilities, as well as a smaller bureaucratic structure with which to deal.
Ultimately, while librarians and library assistants had similar opinions on the services
their libraries should offer, they differed substantially in their views on who should
control these vital community resources.
Discussion of themes and subthemes.
Books, e-books, popular books, and Nook books. Library employees explained
that books are the lifeblood of any library. Books continue to draw patrons to the library.
PP1S observed that young patrons access the library to obtain books and popular
magazines or to spend time browsing the Internet. PP1L and P3L both commented that
patrons are demanding ever more digital resources. However, different types of patrons
request different types of books, in different formats. For example, PP1L explained that
“kids need to have a lot of books that are engaging and accessible to them” and
concluded that a good collection of fiction is essential to encourage young patrons to
read. But other materials are essential to attract older patrons; for example, nonfiction

86
reference resources are necessary to help students complete their homework. P4S noted
that access to Internet services is the most popular service for adult patrons, but this
interviewee also noted the demand for catalogues, databases, e-books, and audiobooks.
P3S noted an increase in tablet usage, particularly in support of the large e-book selection
available at Library 3. Adult patrons also benefit from language resources, such as
Rosetta Stone.
Programs. Interviewees indicated that children, teen, adult, and author programs
represented the clearest manifestation of community involvement at public libraries. For
example, P4S indicated that Library 4 had “tons of programming” that patrons found
attractive, explaining that programs included learning how to use technology, such as
e-readers, or how to garden, and reading programs. Other respondents listed student
storytelling, book clubs and discussions, poetry and video-game programs, art
presentations, computer classes, seed lending, afternoon programs for grade-school
students, movies, and speakers, including such popular authors as Dean Koontz and
Susan Orlean. Opinions of interviewees varied about what types of patrons most heavily
attended library programs. P3L stated that children’s programs were the most heavily
attended. P4S indicated that author visits and other adult programs were most popular.
PP1S indicated that the library had many programs for teens throughout the year. These
included story time, teen movies, and playing video games on the Nintendo Wii. The
interviewee also mentioned a teen book club held throughout the year.
Resources. Library patrons recognized the expertise librarians could offer as
information specialists. In addition to checking out books and seeking assistance from a

87
skilled library staff member, patrons also depended on the public library for other
resources. For example, responses from all interviewees indicated children accessed a
broad variety of library resources: fiction aimed at a broad range of age and interest
groups, reference materials, and digital resources. P3L and P4S indicated that patrons
routinely depended on the public library to track down books. PP1L explained that one
expanding function of the library was to “show patrons how to navigate the information,
how to be a critical thinker when it comes to information on how to do research online.”
Patrons depended on librarians and library staff to answer countless questions: “What
should I read next?” “Is this movie worth watching?” “How do you use this software?”
P3L explained that a patron might have a research question or may require
assistance in finding something as simple as a local post office or a hospital. PP1S
identified several other topics that patrons inquired about during their library visits.
These topics included historical information and bibliographies. PP2S offered several
examples of customer questions concerning topics such as current events, cooking,
automobiles, computers, languages, and audiobooks. The library has been, and continues
to be, a source of information. The respondents described an eagerness to continue that
role in the community.
Technology. All interviewees agreed that innovation had significantly changed
the demands made by library users as well as the services essential to keeping public
libraries successful, yet they also acknowledged that technological changes had not
diminished the value of public libraries. PP2L said,
People tend to turn to the Internet for their answers and forget that librarians are
here to help them. I kind of see that transaction happening. I have noticed also

88
that they are bringing their own laptops into the library and using our wireless
connection, instead of using our computers in the computer lab, which they still
do. They are going online and reading our e-books as well, because we are
starting to expand our e-book collection, so a lot of people are kind of becoming
more self-sufficient, and hopefully in a good way, at least in obtaining their
relevant information, but at least we are still here.
P4S noted that younger patrons already knew how to use technology but came to
the library for “help with finding this or looking this up.” They needed a skilled library
employee “to guide them, help them, and keep them on track.” Even further, PP2S noted
that patrons had begun to bring smartphones when looking for books in the library. The
smartphone itself contained “a catalog in there, and Amazon” to help them find what they
needed. However, the library had also become a source of training to facilitate the use of
new technologies for older patrons. P4S explained,
The older generation comes to the library to learn how to use technology or to
find someone who can help them. Luckily, we have all sorts of materials
available to them. Our particular library does check out e-readers. That has
helped a lot of the older communities who are thinking about purchasing an
e-reader but are unsure as to how to use it. We allow them to take it home and
play around with it. They can use that.
Perhaps most importantly, the librarians interviewed recognized the importance of
training themselves to use emerging technology. The library is often an outlet in which
technologies can be explored and adopted. Respondent P4S explained that libraries had
to stay on top of trends, including trending technology, such as the transition from
“cassette tapes to CDs to MP3 players to downloadable audiobooks from home.”
Despite all of the changes in libraries caused by information technology, P3L
explained that the mission of libraries had not at all been diminished, stating, “I really
think, you know, we’re just again continuing to offer the public what they need and what

89
they want. So it just means that our services are going to change.” Despite the changing
face of the public library, library staff members said it still operated in the same spirit as
it has historically. According to PP1S, online tutoring options offered patrons access to
“real-time tutors” whom they could contact from their home computer. In addition, when
patrons visited the library, they could use laptops, smartphones, and the library’s Wi-Fi
system.
Privatization. The study as a whole revolved around the paramount issue of the
privatization of public libraries. The research design and the final interview question
were intended to gather librarian and staff information on this important phenomenon.
There was a clear distinction in attitudes about privatization between those employed in
privatized libraries and those employed in publicly operated libraries. Those respondents
who spoke in favor of privatization described benefits that included a decrease in
bureaucracy, an increase in employee autonomy, and improved efficiencies. For
example, PP2S explained that in publicly operated libraries, “there are a lot of different
rules that you have to follow,” whereas in privately operated libraries, “the staff can
spread their wings a little bit and seem to have more input on things versus the city where
you have to follow all the rules, where this is this and that is that.” Respondents who
spoke against privatization expressed concerns about threats to intellectual freedom,
community involvement, local control, and levels of service. For example, P3L
expressed concerns that privatization might threaten intellectual freedom, stating,
“Private companies can do what they want with their funds and their money, and if that

90
means losing the ability to provide an intellectual freedom to the public, then that can be
lost as well.”
P4L, P4S, and P3L, all employees of publicly operated libraries, each expressed
concerns about the impact of privatization on the community. P4S expressed an opinion
that the public library “should be run by the community.” P4L expressed concerns that
privatization might lead to loss of local control as the interests of investor-owned
corporations could supersede the interests of the community. For example, P4L stated,
If you are really focused on having the public library be truly integrated into the
community, I think that privatization is probably problematic in many ways. If
you do not really care about that, and you want more of a generic public library
that just provides a very basic level of service and does not really offer a lot of
extra things to the community or is not closely related to the community, the
privatization might be more attractive for a community in that case.
According to PP1S, his privatized library expanded its book holdings and DVD
collections, as well as offering new computer equipment. Lastly, PP2S thought that
employees in publicly operated libraries were usually paid more than employees in
privatized libraries, while the level of work was comparable.
Summary
This chapter analyzed both quantitative and qualitative data with three purposes in
mind. The first purpose was to determine the type and degree of services taxpayers want
from public libraries and private-public libraries. The second purpose of the study was to
determine whether or not a significant difference exists in levels of satisfaction between
patrons of traditionally operated libraries and patrons of privatized libraries. The third
purpose of the study was to gain a greater understanding of public policy issues related to

91
privatization of public libraries. A standard quantitative survey instrument was
distributed and collected from 160 patrons of four different libraries located in Southern
California. Each instrument contained the same set of questions, and each instrument
was administered with the same set of instructions. Analysis of the data collected from
those quantitative instruments showed that, while minor differences existed in the priority
assigned to particular library services, overall satisfaction was high at all four libraries
sampled.
Interviews were conducted to collect qualitative data to add additional
information to that gained from the survey instruments. The interviewees were selected
because they had specific experiences delivering services to the library-using public.
Each of the interview participants was asked six questions. Responses to five of the six
questions were similar. Different opinions were expressed by library employees about
the threats and benefits associated with privatizing the operation of public libraries.
Employees at privately operated libraries tended to be supportive of privatization.
Employees at publicly operated libraries tended to express concerns about privatization.
Chapter V summarizes findings, conclusions, and recommendations for future
research.
Summary of Findings for
Research Question 1
Patrons of the four subject libraries described the frequency with which they
accessed a variety of library services offered by their public library. Table 17 reflects

92
those preferences and answers Research Question 1: “What services do patrons want
from public libraries and private-public libraries.”

Patrons from both groups reported that they valued accessible hours of operation
and often accessed technology and databases. In addition, patrons from both groups
reported that they sometimes accessed computers, the children’s section, and popular
books. Patrons from privately operated libraries reported that they sometimes accessed
DVDs. Both groups reported that they rarely accessed magazines or library programs.
Patrons of publicly operated libraries rarely accessed DVDs.
When compared with patrons of two privately operated libraries, patrons of the
two publicly operated libraries expressed a statistically significant preference for
technology and magazines. In addition, there were statistically significant differences

93
between male and females patrons: females expressed a preference for access to the
children’s section, to popular books, and to library programming. There were no
statistically significant differences in preferences of patrons of relatively high- or
relatively low-income groups. Library staff members reported that the ability to provide
services to their patrons did not appear to be influenced by the trend of privatization.
Summary of Findings for
Research Question 2
Research Question 2 asked, “Is there a significant difference in levels of
satisfaction between patrons of traditionally operated libraries and patrons of privatized
libraries?” Patrons from both groups reported that they were generally satisfied with
library services. Ninety-five percent of all respondents described themselves as very
satisfied or extremely satisfied.
Summary of Findings for
Research Question 3
Research Question 3 asked, “What insights from library employees add to an
understanding of public policy issues related to the privatization of public libraries?”
While employees from each of the four libraries expressed opinions about preferences
their patrons had for various library services, essentially corroborating evidence from
patrons in response to Research Question 1, employees offered no concrete insights other
than personal opinion about policy issues related to the privatization of public libraries.
Employees of publicly operated libraries expressed concerns that privatization may have
negative consequences for the public, such as threats to intellectual freedom, community

94
involvement, local control, and levels of service. Employees of privately operated
libraries described benefits related to decreased bureaucracy, increased employee
autonomy, and improved efficiency.
An interviewee identified a difference between public and private library pay
scales, a line of inquiry that was subsequently pursued. LSSI (2010) offered a starting
salary of $40,000 per year in 2010 for librarians, which, depending on professional
advancement and degrees earned, could rise to $55,000 per year. The organization has
not offered more recent data. However, the ALA Allied Professional Association (n.d.)
passed a resolution in 2008 declaring that librarians should have a minimum salary of
$41,680. Moreover, the ALA (n.d.b) found that in 2008 American librarians earned a
mean salary of $58,960. In brief, data from governmental and professional sources
support the assertion that private libraries pay their employees lower salaries.

CHAPTER V
SUMMARY, IMPLICATIONS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS
This chapter presents a summary of the study, including a restatement of the
purpose and research questions, a review of the problem, a brief description of the
methodology, and a description of the population and sample. Major findings of the
study are reported, followed by a discussion of implications and suggestions for future
research.
Summary of the Study
Purpose Statement
This study had three purposes. The first purpose was to determine the type and
degree of services taxpayers want from public libraries and private-public libraries. The
second purpose of the study was to determine whether or not a significant difference
exists in levels of satisfaction between patrons of traditionally operated libraries and
patrons of privatized libraries. The third purpose of the study was to gain a greater
understanding of public policy issues related to privatization of public libraries.
Research Questions
Three research questions were posed to support the purposes of this study:
1. What services do patrons want from public libraries and private-public libraries?

95

96
2. Is there a significant difference in levels of satisfaction between patrons of
traditionally operated libraries and patrons of privatized libraries?
3. What insights from library employees add to an understanding of public policy issues
related to privatization of public libraries?
Overview of the Problem
Libraries have been a building block of American values since the New England
colonies were founded in the 17th century and brought with them a fundamental Puritan
belief in the importance of reading (Cremin, 1972). The widespread ownership of books
and the dependence on written documents was essential to establishing, transmitting, and
maintaining cultural values and standards of conduct. Ultimately, books became a source
for transforming those initial values and standards over the centuries. Those early settlers
depended on books for practical knowledge related to law, medicine, land, and
agricultural management, but also to guide the development of proper social and religious
conduct. In addition to practical and religious goals expressed by the colonial
inhabitants, McCook (2011) added that public libraries have contributed to “life-long
learning, support, democracy, and intellectual freedom” and have been a foundational
force for the development of human communities (p. 49).
Though in the past century, funds in support of libraries have generally come
from state or local taxes, many governments tasked with providing library services have
experienced reduced revenues. Despite the label, free public libraries are not free. Some
local governments are responding by closing or consolidating libraries. Others are

97
responding by outsourcing or privatizing library services (ALA, 2012; Gilroy & Moore,
2010; Oder, 2004).
Clearly, some communities have outsourced with the goal of providing quality
services more efficiently, in essence saving libraries from a financial and political crisis.
The Riverside County Library System made such a move in 1997. The Moorpark Public
Library, Camarillo Library, and Moreno Valley Public Library followed. In all cases,
services are reported to have improved, while costs are reported to have decreased
(Goldberg, 2011; LSSI, 2013). Miller summarized the viewpoint of those who support
privatization by claiming that “all business should run as business for the good of
democracy” (Thompson & Miller, 2003, p. 328).
Some experts argue that the public good provided by libraries is threatened by
privatized libraries. Thompson questioned claims that private business could do local
jobs cheaper and more efficiently due to market-driven government reform (Thompson &
Miller, 2003). The American Library Association (ALA, 2011) has expressed opposition
to outsourcing because the long-term impacts are unknown. The association argues that
outsourcing may diminish public trust and community engagement, harm current
employees, and that the short-term benefits to the citizenry will diminish over time and
will eventually lead to a decrease in the common good. The privatization trend has the
potential to impact generations of readers, young and old alike.
Taxpayers and consumers have a stake in public policy, as do special interest
groups who push for public policy at the state level. State intervention is requested where
failure to the marketplace exists. Many studies have been conducted on public libraries.

98
However, there has been very little research on privatization of public libraries and the
perceived impacts on local government policy. Gathering information from community
residents can help leaders make an informed decision on how they can improve library
services in their community.
Research Method and Design
This study employed a mixed-methods design to integrate both quantitative and
qualitative approaches to collect and analyze data in a single study (Creswell, 2008).
Quantitative data were collected using a formalized data collection instrument comprised
of set questions, and the results were represented numerically and analyzed using
statistics. Alternatively, qualitative data were collected by asking participants “broad,
general questions” (Creswell, 2008, p. 645). The results were represented “in the form of
words or images”; responses were analyzed by identifying descriptions or themes by
which to interpret “the meaning of the information, drawing on personal reflections and
past research” (Creswell, 2008, p. 645). Inferences were gained by triangulating from all
of the available sources of information to “enhance the accuracy of a study” (Creswell,
2012, p. 259).
Population and Sample
This study focused on understanding the different perceptions of citizens who live
in Southern California communities served by public libraries operated by government
employees compared to the perceptions of those served by privatized public libraries.
Therefore, the population for this study included all current and potential patrons of

99
public library services in Southern California: those who currently use the system, those
who do not use the system because they find it inadequate, and those who do not wish to
use a library under any circumstance. In short, the population for this study was “every
citizen richest and poorest alike” (Carnegie, as cited in Cremin, 1988, p. 446). However,
because it is usually not feasible to include every member of such a large and scattered
population, a sample was selected of individuals who were thought to be “representative
of the entire population” (Creswell, 2008, p. 152). The data collected from this
representative sample were analyzed with the intent to generalize, as much as is
reasonable, the conclusions to the entire population. In this study, a representative set of
patron and employee participants was sampled from libraries in Fullerton and Yorba
Linda, California, which are served by publicly operated public libraries, and Moorpark
and Moreno Valley, California, which are served by libraries managed by Library
Systems and Services Inc. (LSSI). All of the communities are located in Southern
California.
Quantitative data were collected from 160 library patrons, 40 from each of the
four communities. In addition, qualitative data were collected from interviews with four
librarians, one from each library, and three library staff personnel from the four locations.
To be included in the sample, each of the four librarians was required to have worked as a
librarian at that location for at least 3 years, to have conducted at least one survey of
patrons at the library at which he or she was currently employed, and to have earned a
master’s degree in library science. Alternately, to be included in the sample, the library
staff members were required to have worked with library patrons for at least 3 years, be

100
at least 18 years of age, and be identified by other library staff as being familiar with the
population of patrons served by the sampled library and knowledgeable of the library
culture of that community.
Major Findings
This study identified and described the perceptions of library patrons and
employees regarding the types and degree of services desired by taxpayers from public
libraries. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to determine if significant
differences existed in levels of satisfaction between patrons of traditionally operated
libraries and patrons of privatized libraries.
Findings Related to
the Literature
Theme 1 from the literature: Preservation of community values. Libraries
have been a building block of American values since the New England colonies were
founded in the 17th century (Cremin, 1972), and they have come to symbolize the
establishment, transmission, and maintenance of cultural values and standards of conduct.
Research Question 3 asked, “What insights from library employees add to an
understanding of public policy issues related to privatization of public libraries?”
Jonathan Haidt (2012) formulated a model consisting of what he described as six
foundations of politics, two of which are most strongly aligned with the moral
preferences of persons who identify themselves as liberal: (a) concerns for harm and
caring, and (b) concerns about fairness and cheating. Haidt’s model also included four
additional foundations, which, while they are also concerned about harm/care and

101
fairness/cheating, are more strongly aligned with the moral preferences of persons who
identify themselves as conservative: (c) loyalty/betrayal, (d) authority/subversion,
(e) sanctity/degradation, and (f) liberty/oppression. Haidt’s moral foundations theory
offers insights into the comments made by library employees in response to questions
about library privatization. Opinions expressed by employees of publicly operated
libraries about the privatization of public libraries were grounded on all six of these moral
foundations.
Related to the harm/care foundation, public institutions, which are so much a part
of a community, may seem to be threatened by the decision to, essentially, transfer
ownership of information from the community to distant stockholders more interested in
profit than in fostering the community. Related to the fairness/cheating foundation, from
the time of Benjamin Franklin, the public library has been a symbol of access to
information. Shifting ownership of this information from the community to a privately
owned company may be seen as an unfair threat to, and a betrayal of, traditional
American values—a degradation of a sacred community institution. Related to the
liberty/oppression foundation, Haidt (2012) wrote of fears that some hold of a future in
which corporations “have turned national governments into their lackeys” (p. 297). He
offered further that “if the past is any guide, corporations will grow ever more powerful
as they evolve, and as they change the legal and political systems of their host countries
to become ever more hospitable” (Haidt, 2012, p. 297). Indeed, the conservative
economist Friedrich Hayek (1944/2007) warned of the dangers of monopolies formed
from “collusive agreements and promoted by public policies” instituted by government

102
protectionism (pp. 92-93). His view of history was that similar governmental policies
and decisions since 1878 had systematically fostered “the growth of cartels and
syndicates” (Hayek, 1944/2007, p. 93) in which large, favored corporations underbid and
drove out smaller corporations. A decision by an elected official to transfer his or her
sacred stewardship of the public library to a for-profit corporation may seem to some as a
subversion of the authority given by public leaders in the election process.
Theme 2 from the literature: Financial stability. Despite the label, free public
libraries are not free. Funds in support of libraries have generally come from state or
local taxes, yet many governments experiencing reduced revenues have responded by
closing or consolidating libraries. Others are responding by outsourcing or privatizing
library services (ALA, 2012; Gilroy & Moore, 2010; Oder, 2004).
Since budget constraints impact the level of service and patronage at most
libraries, privatization appears to offer a partial solution. Patrons appeared to be equally
satisfied with services from traditional libraries, directly supported by the public, as with
services offered by privatized libraries. While acknowledging the success of both
systems, no new concrete information was offered by respondents to resolve this
question. While one staff member employed at a privatized library expressed an opinion
that employees in publicly operated libraries were usually paid more than employees in
privatized libraries, even though the level of work was comparable, the consensus from
those employed in privatized libraries was that privatized libraries were generally more
efficient, less bureaucratic, and offered employees greater autonomy.

103
According to the U.S. Bureau Labor of Statistics (2011),
Private industry employers spent an average of $27.75 per hour worked for total
employee compensation in December 2010, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics
reported today. . . . Total employer compensation costs for civilian workers,
which include private industry and state and local government workers, averaged
$29.72 per hour worked. (p. 1)
Theme 3 from the literature: Threatened services. Claims have been made that
privatized libraries achieve savings by ignoring the preferences of library patrons and
decreasing the quality of services. Thompson questioned claims that private business
could do local jobs cheaper and more efficiently due to market-driven government reform
(Thompson & Miller, 2003). The ALA (2011) has expressed opposition to outsourcing
because the long-term impacts are unknown. The association argues that outsourcing
may diminish public trust and community engagement, harm current employees, and that
the short-term benefits to the citizenry will diminish over time and will eventually lead to
a decrease in the common good. The privatization trend has the potential to impact
generations of readers, young and old alike.
These claims were refuted by participants in this study in two different ways.
Library employees interviewed at all four sample libraries spoke with great interest and
pride of the efforts they made to discover the interests and demands of library patrons and
ensure services were offered to meet the needs of patrons of different ages and interest
groups. Similarly, quantitative data collected from patrons of all four libraries indicated
that, while their particular interests might differ from those of other patrons, over 90% of
all respondents were extremely satisfied or very satisfied with the services offered by
their public library.

104
Findings Related to the
Research Questions
Findings for Research Question 1. Research Question 1 asked, “What services
do patrons want from public libraries and private-public libraries?” There were six
primary themes and 22 subthemes identified from the qualitative data collected from
library employee interviews in the study. Table 16, reprinted from Chapter IV, displays
those key themes.

Findings for Research Question 2. Research Question 2 asked, “Is there a
significant difference in levels of satisfaction between patrons of traditionally operated
libraries and patrons of privatized libraries?” While statistically significant differences
existed between groups about which services were most desired by patrons, there were no
significant differences between groups in levels of satisfaction. Over 90% of all patrons
in both groups were extremely satisfied or very satisfied with the services offered by their
public library.
Findings for Research Question 3. Research Question 3 asked, “What insights
from library employees add to an understanding of public policy issues related to
privatization of public libraries?” There was a clear distinction in attitudes about
privatization between those employed in privatized libraries and those employed in

106
publicly operated libraries. Those respondents who spoke in favor of privatization
described benefits that included a decrease in bureaucracy, an increase in employee
autonomy, and improved efficiencies. Respondents who spoke against privatization
expressed concerns about threats to intellectual freedom, community involvement, local
control, and levels of service. One employee expressed an opinion that employees in
publicly operated libraries were usually paid more than employees in privatized libraries,
while the level of work was comparable. Personnel employed at privately operated
libraries stated that they were pleased that LSSI was now a part of their library, because,
as a librarian said, it was better than closing the doors of such a city treasure.
One clear theme throughout the study was that the primary benefit of privatization
was that it was a response to budget reductions or possible closure of public libraries
during times of financial stress to municipal budgets. Therefore, subsequent to collection
and analysis of data from patrons and employees of the four subject libraries, actual
budget data were collected. Table 19 reflects the changes in actual expenditures over a 5year period.
While no clear expenditure trend was evident at any of the four subject libraries,
expenditures at the publicly operated libraries increased or essentially remained the same
from 2006 through 2010. Expenditures at Yorba Linda increased during the years of the
recession. Although expenditures at Moorpark increased from 2006 through 2008, the
expenditures at the privately operated libraries have generally shown a downward trend.
Looking at the data another way, Table 20 displays library expenditures per citizen in
each of the subject communities.

consistently expends more funds on library services per resident, Fullerton and Moorpark
expend approximately the same per resident. Moreno Valley has consistently expended

109
fewer dollars per resident than any of the other participant libraries. One might conclude,
therefore, based on weak evidence, that privately operated libraries may result in reduced
expenditures, but certainly greater research is required before a definitive claim can be
made.
Implications for Future Action
Implications for
Library Operations
Two related purposes of this study were to identify the type and degree of services
demanded by library patrons and to determine levels of satisfaction among patrons of
traditional public libraries and patrons of public-private libraries. The study was intended
to gain an understanding of how libraries service patrons, to determine where there are
significant differences in levels of satisfaction between patrons of traditionally operated
libraries and patrons of privatized libraries, and to gain insight about the impacts of
privatization on patrons and library personnel. The primary implication that results from
the findings of this study is that because there was no significant difference in levels of
satisfaction with public libraries and private-public libraries, and because levels of
satisfaction were high at each of the four libraries, no action is warranted. Librarians and
other staff members at each of the four libraries should continue to make efforts to
discern the needs of their patrons and creatively meet those needs. Personnel at each
library had already identified different interest groups within their marketplace, offered
services to meet the specialized needs of those patrons, and communicated the
availability of those services to potential patrons.

110
Implications for
Public Policy Makers
A third purpose of this study was to gain a greater understanding of public policy
issues related to privatization of public libraries and offer insights to community leaders
faced with the prospect of privatizing library services in their own communities. The
primary related implication that results from the findings of this study is that, while
privatized libraries appear to be more efficient and potentially protect communities from
losing valuable library services, opinions expressed by respondents about whether
libraries should or should not be privatized were more of a philosophical or political
nature than a practical nature. Opposition to privatization was generally expressed by
employees of publicly operated libraries and tended to be based on perceptions that
privatization (a) is a threat to important American values and (b) achieves savings at the
expense of library employees. Employees at privatized libraries supported the change
and acknowledged that without privatization, library services to their community might
very well have been lost.
Likewise, community leaders faced with the prospect of privatizing library
services in their own communities must consider the question from two different
perspectives: from a philosophical or political perspective in which their own values will
be reflected in their decision, and from a practical perspective in which the outcome will
have very real effects on the community, the library, library staff, and patrons of the
public library.

111
Recommendations
This study investigated traditional public libraries and private-public library
partnerships, and the types and degree of services demanded by patrons of each. In
addition, this study identified and described the degree to which library patrons were
satisfied with the services available from their public library. Finally, this study sought to
gain a greater understanding of public policy issues related to privatization of public
libraries.
Recommendations for
Public Policy Makers
1. While the goal of this study was to better understand the implications of privatizing
public libraries, the fact is that privatization is relatively rare. Examples were hard to
find. Clearly, the majority of community libraries in California are operated by public
employees. Therefore, there may be something for community leaders to learn from
each other. One recommendation is for public policy makers to develop an
accountability oversight team and a set of best practices by which community leaders
can monitor their own performance against that of communities that have not been
forced to make such difficult decisions as closing libraries or transitioning to
privatized services. Such best practices might include a book of spending norms and
guidelines for setting priorities among the wants and needs of their constituents.
2. Community leaders and policy makers can learn from each other. It would be in the
best interest of the public for trustees, city council members, and other public policy
makers to routinely work together, perhaps once a month, to jointly develop and refine

112
policies and procedures to ensure all public services, including public libraries, operate
efficiently and satisfactorily without depending on privatized companies to do that
difficult work for them. The researcher is convinced that public libraries can operate
identically to privatized libraries so long as decision makers make it so.
3. Based on the present research study, it is also recommended that before the city
council and the board decide to privatize the library, trustees should work
collaboratively with an outside consulting firm for a year before they outsource a
public service that the community supports with tax funds.
Recommendations for
Future Studies
While this study found answers to the questions regarding the types and degree of
services demanded by patrons of public libraries and private-public library partnerships,
the degree to which library patrons were satisfied with the services those libraries
provided, and the public policy issues related to privatization of public libraries, there is
more to learn. Therefore, additional studies should be conducted. The findings and
conclusions from this study indicate the following recommendations for further study:
1. Replicate this study in an area outside Southern California to determine if the findings
and conclusions can be generalized to other states and regions.
2. Replicate this study for other community services that are routinely outsourced, such
as trash removal.
3. Replicate the quantitative survey, or one with similar questions, but collect data from a
broader set of patrons. Such a study could confirm the breadth of the conclusion made

113
in this study that patrons of public libraries are very satisfied with services made
available from their public library. Significant differences between patron groups
should be further developed to better understand the needs of different socioeconomic
groups, different age groups, and different genders.
4. An in-depth financial study should be conducted with the goal of identifying important
financial differences between publicly operated and privately operated public libraries.
One goal of such a study would be to determine if privately operated libraries truly do
operate more efficiently, how they do so, and what the consequences of those
differences are. One particular area of concern expressed in the literature is that
savings may occur primarily due to lower pay to employees. If this is true, the study
should determine the public policy implications of such a difference.
5. Future studies should examine the management component of the library to make
certain that institutions follow Assembly Bill 438 (AB 438). Such a study would
determine methods by which community leaders solicit information from constituents
before making decisions critical to public services in their community.
6. Further research should also consider the long-term implications of public-private
libraries. Can the savings and services evident in this study be maintained over time?
What are the long-term implications of privatization on the availability of high-quality
librarians and library staff?
7. Another recommendation for a future study would include an analysis of satisfaction
surveys distributed to various ethnic and cultural groups who patronize public
libraries.

114
8. A future study should use a larger population and quantitative measures to determine
if there is a significant difference between traditional public libraries and publicprivate libraries.
Personal Reflection of the Researcher
As a former library trustee member appointed by a city council member, it was
with pleasure that the researcher had the opportunity to serve her community in this
capacity. In the 21st century and with the worst recession since the great depression, the
researcher is very passionate and concerned about our cities’ beloved treasure, the city
libraries. Completely aware of all the budget issues that are facing our cities, and
recognizing that the bulk of the revenues are generated from property tax and that the
library and other public services depend on those revenues, the researcher acknowledges
that libraries are likely to suffer most during an economic downturn, when public tax
dollars are so scarce. Loving public libraries as she does, it was difficult for the
researcher to keep an open mind while conducting this study.
The city library is a city treasure governed by community members who
guarantee that all people of the community can enjoy it. The city library collaborates
with the city council and the community as partners. The researcher began the study with
the presumption that decisions to privatize the operation of libraries were evidence of a
lack of executive leadership and poor decision making, and would ultimately result in
undesirable services for library patrons. At the beginning of the study, the researcher was
persuaded that cities should publicly manage their community library at all costs.
However, through the utilization of a mixed-methods approach, the data were clear:

115
Customers were generally very satisfied with the services at their public library,
regardless of the method by which those library services were managed. It was valuable
to focus on the three research questions that proved to be relevant for the study.
Summary
Chapter V provided an overview of the research study of traditional libraries and
public-private partnership libraries. This included the purpose of the study, problem
statement, three research questions, sample of the population, methodology, and analysis
of the data. The objective of this study was to find out if there was a significant
difference in satisfaction between public traditional libraries and public-private library
partnerships.
The first purpose of the study was to determine the type and degree of services
taxpayers want from public libraries and private-public libraries. In that regard, the
survey results indicated that there was a significant difference between male and female
patrons who utilized children’s sections and accessed popular books. The males utilized
programming more often, but their use of programming at public and private libraries
differed slightly. There were no statistically significant differences in preferences of
patrons of relatively high- or relatively low-income groups.
The second purpose of the study was to determine whether or not a significant
difference exists in levels of satisfaction between patrons of traditionally operated
libraries and patrons of privatized libraries. According to the survey findings, 95% of the
patrons were satisfied with services, and none of the respondents described not being
satisfied at all.

116
The third purpose of the survey was to gain a greater understanding of public
policy issues related to privatization of public libraries. In contrast to what the researcher
expected, the answers to this question did not appear to be related to the types of services
demanded by patrons (Research Question 1), nor were they related to levels of
satisfaction (Research Question 2). Rather, responses to questions regarding public
policy perspectives appeared to be related to the following:
1. extant political perspectives of each participant about the essential role of government;
2. fears of how privatization may
a. result in financial harm to individual employees or result in high levels of service
in the short term,
b. gradually force publicly operated libraries out of the marketplace, or
c. create a dependence on privatized services, at which time services would
diminish, costs would increase, or services would be limited to a social elect; and
3. a lack of a clear understanding of the relationship between costs and services, resulting
in an inability to clearly substantiate expected cost savings. While a very broad
measure indicated that the mean salary of employees at publicly operated libraries was
higher than the salary for employees at privately operated public libraries, it was not
clear how health benefits, pensions, and other types of compensation influenced the
comparison. It was also not clear whether the mean salary was a measure of a
structural difference in pay or merely a difference in experience levels, years of
service, and so forth.

117
Therefore, this study concluded that an in-depth study should be conducted with
the goal of identifying important financial differences between publicly operated and
privately operated libraries. One goal of such a study would be to develop clear measures
and determine if privately operated libraries truly do operate more efficiently, how they
do so, and what the consequences of those differences are. Another goal of such a study
would be to measure compliance with Assembly Bill 438, with particular emphasis on the
requirement that savings not be achieved by paying employees less than industry levels.
A third goal of such a study would be to include longitudinal measures to determine if
savings and levels of satisfaction are sustainable over a period of time.
Concluding Remarks
This study examined the impact of Assembly Bill 438, a law passed by the state
legislature of California in 2011, which mandated the restructuring of public libraries.
Research focused on a corresponding trend in privatization of libraries in Southern
California. Through this study and the review of the literature, opposing perspectives
were uncovered about outsourcing library services to private institutions.
Using mixed methods, the hypothesis that there is a significant difference in
levels of satisfaction between patrons of traditionally operated libraries and patrons of
privatized libraries was rejected. Quantitative and qualitative measures supported this
conclusion, with corroborative findings. However, long-term effects of such a costsaving measure have not been adequately reported in the literature to date. Additionally,
while changes in satisfaction may be statistically insignificant, differences may develop
over time or may exist only at an aesthetic level. Due to the economic downturn in 2008,

118
some public libraries have had to privatize their services, but this seemingly has not
affected the quality of their services. This study also showed that traditionally operated
and privatized libraries achieved the same quality of patron satisfaction, showing that
privatization is a viable option for communities. While the researcher originally believed
that privatization would not satisfy patrons’ needs, with respect to the delivery of library
services, she has since identified the value of preserving these irreplaceable public goods.
Finally, while the changes noted within the content of this study may be incremental, the
trend of privatization of public libraries has not been thoroughly examined. However,
this study found that both private and public libraries’ methods of delivery provided
benefits.
