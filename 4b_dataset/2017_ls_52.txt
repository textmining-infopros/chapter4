Ammarukleart, Sujira. Factors Affecting Faculty Acceptance and Use of Institutional
Repositories in Thailand. Doctor of Philosophy (Information Science), May 2017, 282 pp., 85
tables, 12 figures, references, 148 titles.
Institutional repositories have been introduced as an innovative and alternative
technology for scholarly communication and have received considerable attention from scholars
across disciplines and around the globe. While some universities in Thailand have developed and
implemented institutional repositories for nearly a decade, knowledge of the acceptance and use
of institutional repositories on the individual level in the country remains limited. As an
insufficient knowledge of technology acceptance and adoption at the individual level is
considered partially responsible for the underutilization of innovation or of information system
implementation, this study seeks to uncover knowledge regarding the level of institutional
repository acceptance and use. This study applied the unified theory of acceptance and use of
technology (UTAUT) model and the model of faculty members' self-archiving behavior to
investigate factors affecting faculty acceptance and use of university-based institutional
repositories. The study employed a mixed methods approach involving a survey followed by
semi-structured, one-to-one interview. This study confirms that the success of university-based
institutional repositories depends not on a single factor but on multiple factors. The results of the
study show that performance expectancy, social influence, and resistance to change were direct
determinants of faculty members' intention to use institutional repositories. Additionally,
behavioral intention and altruism were found to be the main determinants of actual usage
behavior.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION
This chapter presents a discussion of the research background, the problem statement, the
purpose of the study, the research questions, the terminology, and the significance of the study.
1.1

Research Background
The term scholarly communication is a broad term reflecting various processes in the

creation of knowledge. According to the Association of College & Research Libraries (2003),
scholarly communication refers to “the system through which research and other scholarly
writings are created, evaluated for quality, disseminated to the scholarly community, and
preserved for future use” (pp. 1).
The process of scholarly communication consists of three different stages. The first is the
conducting of research; during this process, the scholar will communicate informally with other
scholars and scientists to develop ideas and create new knowledge or scholarly content. The
second step in the process is to prepare and shape the work and to communicate with peers or
colleagues in order to make a decision regarding what will become the formal research results.
The final step in the process is the creation of the ultimate formal product that will be distributed
to the broader community through one or more of the various scholarly communication forums,
including both print and electronic forums. The complete process of scholarly communication
starts with content creation and ends with dissemination (Thorin, 2003). According to Thorin
(2003), academic libraries and librarians perform functions at the end of the assembly line on
which the problem emerges. Academic libraries are responsible for holding the scholarly content
in order to satisfy the needs of their user communities; however, a growing number of cases
show that academic libraries are becoming less and less able to afford to purchase the journals

1

needed for their communities due to the dramatic increase in subscription costs, particularly in
the fields of science, technology, and medicine (STM), along with the declining of academic
library budgets. This phenomenon has been termed the serial crisis. According to Atkinson
(2003), the serial crisis is not just a library problem; rather, it is a broader crisis in scholarly
communications.
The serial crisis started in the late 1980s and has become a more serious issue as
commercial publishers have gained complete control over traditional scholarly publishing and, at
the same time, dominated the users’ space. Many researchers agree that the introduction of
electronic publishing has made this issue more complicated. Journal articles are made available
as licensed materials, and this model has become the norm for scholarly publishing (Thorin,
2003). The negotiation of licensing contracts has become a challenging issue that university
librarians and administers must face.
The situation is no different for academic libraries in developing countries, including
Thailand. Indeed, the problem might be even more evident in those countries. The journal crisis
has been reported as a widespread issue affecting scholarly communication in Thailand. In
Thailand, the journal crisis was at its worst in 1997 after the Thai government decided to float
the local currency. Prior to that time, 25 Thai Baht equaled 1 US Dollar; the currency exchange
reached its peak at 50 Baht to the Dollar, entailing a one hundred percent increase in journal
subscription rates and other purchasing prices of foreign material. As a result, many academic
libraries and special libraries, particularly in science, technology, and medicine, decided to
cancel their research journal subscriptions and to pull back on full-text database licenses. Access
to scientific information and technical materials at that time was extremely limited. It was
difficult for scholars to keep up with scholarly output (Stueart, 2000). Other issues facing

2

universities included funding for research and higher education, low staff morale due to low
salaries and an unrewarding research system, brain drain, overloading of researchers with
teaching and administrative duties, and lack of technological sophistication.
While the growth of digital technologies and electronic publishing appears to have made
scholarly publishing more complicated, it has also helped scholars and academic librarians to
explore a new direction for scholarly communication. Björk (2007) correctly sees “technology
developments as a trigger for changes in scientific communication” (p. 1). Prior to the time of the
Internet and information technology, scholarly communication was very slow. The advent of
information technology has brought about effective ways to create, store, and disseminate
scientific knowledge. The open access movement and institutional repositories have emerged as
a new strategy that allows universities and academic libraries to deal with the challenges of
scholarly communication in the digital age, such as declining library budgets and rising
subscription fees.
Due to the increasing adoption of open access technology, scientific and scholarly
information is freely available via the Internet through open access forums such as personal
websites, departmental websites, open access journals, discipline repositories, and institutional
repositories (IRs). Among them, IRs and discipline repositories are preferable forums for
scholars and scientists since they offer features and services that enhance access to scholarly
content (Kim, 2008). According to Lynch (2003), IRs are “a set of services that a university
offers to the members of its community for the management and dissemination of digital
materials created by the institution and its community members” (p. 2).
Since the idea of open access and IR services was introduced in many scholarly forums
such as the Budapest Open Access Initiative (BOAI) and the Scholarly Publishing and Academic

3

Resources Coalition (SPARC), there have been increasing numbers of open access and
institutional repository projects worldwide. Recently, OpenDOAR, an authoritative directory of
academic open access repositories, listed 2800 academic open access repositories. Lynch and
Lippincott (2005) reported that in the United States, 40% of doctoral universities were already
operating IRs. There were only 100 repositories registered in OpenDOAR in 2006; however, the
numbers of IRs in the United States has increased during the past ten years. Currently, there are
463 open access repositories operated by 348 organizations in the United States listed in
OpenDOAR. An example of a repository listed by OpenDOAR is ArXiv, a disciplinary
repository operated by Cornell University Library, with a total of 1,245,393 documents
(OpenDOAR, 2017).
While the numbers of open access services and IRs have increased during the past ten
years, research areas related to open access services and IRs have also received considerable
attention from many researchers. Initially, research centered on how IRs should be developed
and implemented. Many researchers have attempted to identify the success factors for IR
implementation and management (Yakel, Rieh, Markey, St. Jean, & Yao, 2009; Westell, 2006),
and case studies of the development of specific projects have also been published (Chan, 2004).
However, many researchers have found that the success of IRs depends mainly on faculty
participation and on the numbers of items contained by the IRs (Shearer, 2003; Tribodeau, 2007;
Yakel et al. 2009; Xia & Sun, 2007).
Several qualitative and quantitative empirical studies have been conducted to examine the
self-archiving behavior and experience of academic authors (Allen, 2005; Davis & Connolly,
2007; Dulle, 2010; Foster & Gibbons, 2005; Kim, 2008, 2010; Park & Qin, 2007; Swan &
Brown, 2005) Among them, Kim’s (2008, 2010) studies focused on faculty members’ motivation

4

to self-archive and the factors affecting their decisions to do so. Dulle (2010) studied factors
affecting the adoption of open access scholarly communication by researchers in Tanzania, using
the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model. However, these studies
focused on faculty members’ self-archiving behavior in all open access forums. The present
study has a narrower focus on faculty members’ acceptance and use of IRs in the Thai higher
education context, particularly in research universities. Different from the previous studies,
which were conducted during the early stage of IR development, the present study was
conducted within a distinct context and addresses the utilization of IRs at a different stage.
Therefore, it is interesting to determine whether factors identified in previous studies can be
shown to be relevant to the acceptance and use of IRs in a different context. In addition, it is also
interesting to investigate why some faculty members make the decision to deposit their work and
what factors contribute to their decision whether or not to deposit work.
1.2

Problem Statement
Institutional repositories (IRs) have been introduced as an innovative and alternative

technology for scholarly communication and have received considerable attention from scholars
across disciplines and on a global level. However, in Thailand, while some universities have
developed and implemented IRs for nearly a decade, knowledge of the acceptance and use of IRs
on the individual level remains limited. Empirical study in this area has rarely been conducted.
Among such studies, Yoowang (2012) focused on studying institutional repositories’ operations
from the viewpoint of academic library directors and found that some directors mentioned issues
related to personnel related problems, content recruitment, and faculty involvement in IRs as
problems they have faced in the management of IRs. Klungthanaboon (2013) studied the current
status and the impact of Open Access and Institutional Repositories developed within three

5

research universities from the viewpoints of institutional repository stakeholders, including
academic library directors, journal editors, and authors, employing a grounded theoretical and a
qualitative approach. However, there have been no studies seeking to identify the factors
affecting faculty members’ acceptance and use of IRs in the Thai context. Knowledge in this area
has generally been neglected by previous studies. This study seeks to fill this gap. Since an
insufficiency of knowledge of technology acceptance and adoption at the individual level is
considered to be in part responsible for the underutilization of innovations and of information
system implementation.
In addition, an analysis of factors affecting faculty members’ acceptance and use of
institutional repositories may provide insight into effective ways to develop, implement, and
improve IRs in Thailand. Therefore, this study seeks to uncover knowledge regarding the level of
IR acceptance and use by individuals by applying different theoretical models from different but
related disciplines. The first model is the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology
(UTAUT) model (Venkatesh et al., 2003) from the information systems field, particularly
relevant to the area of technology acceptance and adoption in an organizational setting. The other
model is the model of faculty’s self-archiving behavior (Kim, 2008, 2010) from the field of
information science. These two models are used together as a theoretical framework for the
study.
Although there are some studies utilizing the UTAUT model to study the acceptance and
adoption of information technology, there has been limited research utilizing the UTAUT model
to investigate issues regarding the adoption and use of institutional repositories in higher
education. Most of the studies in this area are devoted to the study of factors affecting authors’
self-archiving practices in various open access venues (Kim, 2010; Dulle, 2010; Mann, Walter,

6

Hess, & Wigand, 2009; Singeh, Abrizah, & Karim, 2013a, b; Xia, 2007, 2008). The study by
Mann et al. (2009) employed the UTAUT model to study researchers from the information
systems, German literature, and medical science disciplines and confirmed that attitude is a
significant predictor of behavioral intention to use open access publishing. In addition, Dulle
(2010) used the UTAUT model in investigating factors affecting the adoption of open access
scholarly communication in research activities at the Tanzanian Public University. Similar to
Mann et al. (2009), Dulle (2010) found that besides performance expectancy, effort expectancy,
and social influence, attitude is also one of the key determinants and predictors of Tanzanian
researchers’ behavioral intention to use open access scholarly communication. Findings from
both studies contradict what might be expected based on the original UTAUT model, which
theorized that attitude is not a direct determinant of behavioral intention. This gives rise to
interesting questions, since attitude has been confirmed to be significant and to have a direct
effect on behavioral intention across studies related to open access scholarly communication
conducted in different contexts (Mann et al., 2009; Dulle, 2010). This study seeks to fill a gap by
investigating whether attitude has significant direct effects on behavioral intention, particularly
in the area of the acceptance and use of IRs, which is considered as an alternative forum for
scholarly communication.
The other relevant issue in the area of technology acceptance and use is resistance to
change (RTC). Resistance to change (RTC) is an aspect of personality that is highly critical for
technology adoption (Venkatesh, Morris, & Ackerman, 2000). Oreg (2003) found that people
who exhibited higher levels of resistance to change were less likely to try using new technology.
In the library and information science field, Nov and Ye (2008, 2009) found that users with
higher RTC had higher effort expectancy regarding new technology, particularly in the digital

7

libraries adoption context. While many researchers have found that RTC is a direct antecedent of
effort expectancy (Nov & Ye, 2008, 2009; Thong, Hong, & Tam, 2002), rarely has research been
conducted to determine whether RTC has a direct effect on an individual’s behavioral intention
to use a technology. RTC should not be disregarded as a predictor of behavioral intention, since
some researchers have cited cultural inertia, a resistance to change or reluctance to adopt new
culture or technology, as one of the reasons for the slow adoption of self-archiving (Chen, 2004;
Kim, 2008). Therefore, resistance to change should not be ignored and should be considered as
one factor that might affect faculty members’ acceptance and use of IRs. Clearly, it should be
tested to determine whether it should be confirmed or disregarded as a determinant of behavioral
intention to use institutional repositories.
1.3

Purpose of the Study
The primary propose of this study is to determine the factors affecting faculty acceptance

and use of university-based institutional repositories in the Thai research university context. This
study explores the relationship and relative importance of factors that influence a user’s
behavioral intention and usage behavior in relation to the use of institutional repositories. This
study contributes to the existing body of knowledge regarding the acceptance and use of
institutional repositories and scholarly communication in the Thai higher educational context.
Factors identified in this study are expected to be of use to IR managers and developers in
developing and improving more user-centric IRs, which may help to increase and improve the
adoption and use of IRs.

Research Questions
To determine the factors affecting faculty acceptance and use of university-based

institutional repositories in the Thai research university context, this study attempts to answer the
following research questions:
RQ1: To what extent do faculty members in Thai research universities accept and use
institutional repositories?
RQ2: What are the factors that affect faculty members’ acceptance and use of
institutional repositories in the Thai research university context?
RQ3: To what extent do these factors affect faculty members’ acceptance and use of
institutional repositories (IRs) in the Thai research university context?
Based on the theoretical framework of the present study, derived from two research
models, the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model (Venkatesh et
al., 2003) and the model of faculty’s self-archiving behavior (Kim, 2008, 2010), the proposed
research model for this study is presented in Figure 1.1.

Figure 1.1. The proposed research model of faculty members’ acceptance and use of IRs.

9

The proposed research model consists of ten main constructs (factors): attitude toward
IRs (ATT), performance expectancies (PEs), effort expectancies (EEs), social influence (SO),
resistance to change (RTC), altruism (ALT), copyright concerns (CCs), trust toward IRs
(TTIRs), facilitating conditions (FCs), and behavioral intention (BI). While ATT, PEs, EEs, SO,
and RTC are expected to be direct determinants of faculty members’ behavioral intention to use
IRs, ALT, CCs, TTIRs, FCs and BI are expected to be direct determinants of faculty members’
actual usage of IRs. The relationships of the independent variables and the dependent variables
presented in Figure 1 reflect the following hypotheses.
H1: Faculty members’ attitude toward IRs will have a significant direct effect on
behavioral intention.
H2: Performance expectancy will have a significant direct effect on behavioral intention.
H3: Effort expectancy will have a significant direct effect on behavioral intention.
H4: Social influence will have a significant direct effect on behavioral intention.
H5: Resistance to change will have a significant direct effect on behavioral intention.
H6: Altruism will have a significant direct effect on actual usage of IRs.
H7: Copyright concerns will have a significant direct effect on actual usage of IRs.
H8: Faculty members’ trust toward IRs will have a significant direct effect on actual
usage of IRs.
H9: Facilitating conditions will have a significant direct effect on actual usage of IRs.
H10: Faculty members’ behavioral intention will have a significant direct effect on actual
usage of IRs.
The two major theoretical models, the UTAUT model and the model of faculty’s selfarchiving behavior, are discussed in a greater detail in Chapter 3. In addition, Chapter 3 also
explains how the proposed research model was formulated.

Research Design
This study employed a mixed methods design to understand faculty members’ acceptance

and use of Institutional Repositories in the Thai research university context. A QUAN + QUAL
approach was employed, in which more weight was given to quantitative data. A mixed methods
design allows the researcher to collect different but complementing data using both quantitative
and qualitative approaches. A quantitative method was used to determine the factors affecting
faculty acceptance and use of IRs along with the relationships among the factors that affect the
faculty members’ behavioral intention and usage behavior. A qualitative method of content
analysis of semi-structured interview results was used to extend the findings from the
quantitative part of the study. This method helped the researcher gain an in-depth understanding
of the phenomena identified in the quantitative part of the study. Also, it allowed for capturing
the participants’ views on institutional repositories in depth. Additionally, the participants’
suggestions and comments about institutional repositories were gathered through this method.
While the quantitative method allowed for generalization about acceptance and usage
patterns, the follow up interviews with some participants which comprise the quantitative part of
the study allowed the researcher to study the participants’ acceptance and use of IRs and reasons
related to that acceptance and use in greater detail.
Research universities in Thailand were targeted in this study. This study was conducted
on research universities that have implemented IRs for their communities. While six of the nine
research universities have implemented and operated IRs, findings from the preliminary study
showed that only four research universities qualified for this study. The inclusion of only public
universities facilitated the study of the acceptance and usage of IRs by faculty in nearly identical
organizational contexts.

11

The population of this study was thus limited to faculty members in four research
universities. Altogether, a total of 8,399 faculty members currently teach in the four research
universities, which are located in different geographic areas. According to Krejcie and Morgan
(1970), the sample size representative of the population of 8,399 faculty members in this study
would be 367.
The survey questionnaire employed here was developed for this study; it includes a set of
questions addressing faculty members’ awareness and usage of IRs, their self-archiving
experience, and factors affecting their intention and usage behavior of IRs. Factors that might
affect faculty members’ acceptance and use of IRs were presented as statements based on a
Likert scale with a range of options across five points: strongly disagree, disagree, neither agree
nor disagree, agree, and strongly agree.
The interview protocol was developed, validated, and revised immediately after the
preliminary study. Semi-structured interviews through Skype and email were conducted with the
participants who agreed to be interviewed. These methods are discussed in greater detail in
Chapter 4.
1.6

Significance of the Study
Since this study addresses the acceptance and use of institutional repositories among the

faculty in research universities in Thailand, it is significant for several reasons.
This study was the first to investigate faculty members’ acceptance and use of
institutional repositories in Thailand after the development and implementation of the first
institutional repository in 2005 by Chulalongkorn University. Some studies regarding
institutional repositories in Thailand had been conducted previously; however, those studies
emphasized the development and management of IRs from managers’ or developers’ viewpoints

12

(Klangthanaboon, 2013; Yoowang, 2012). This study was the first to focus primarily on
understanding faculty members, who are considered as key stakeholders who can make or break
IRs, particularly in the Thai research university context.
In addition, the current study focused on faculty members as both content depositors and
users of IRs. This study aimed to provide a holistic picture of IR acceptance and usage by faculty
members in the university setting. Understanding the factors influencing individuals’ intention to
utilize IRs can assist IR developers to implement strategies, derived from the users’ perspectives,
to increase and improve the uptake of IRs, particularly for universities in Thailand and other
higher educational institutions in similar contexts. This may lead to a more user-centered
approach in developing and implementing IRs, which may in turn lead faculty, who are both
contributors to and users of IRs, to deposit more materials in the repositories and to increase their
rate of use of the repositories. Growth in the collection and usage rates of IRs will contribute to
the success of IRs. IRs not only help scholars to disseminate and share scholarly content but also
help them to access and use contents that they may not otherwise be able to access and use. IRs
are also viewed as tools for preserving and ensuring long-term accessibility of scholarly content.
If this mode of scholarly communication is widely accepted and used, it can in turn help to
enhance the effectiveness of scholarly communication on both local and global levels.
This study will contribute to the existing body of knowledge in the area of library and
information science, particularly in the area of open access and institutional repository
acceptance and use. In addition, it is expected to shed light on the ongoing debate in technology
acceptance research regarding an individual’s attitude toward technology and resistance to
change, particularly in the area of IRs, as it provides evidence for whether to confirm or to

13

disregard both factors as determinants of behavioral intention toward the acceptance and use of
IRs as a new scholarly communication tool.
1.7

Definitions of Terms
An institutional repository (IR) is a set of services and technologies that a university

provides for its community members to collect, store, disseminate, and preserve digital materials
created by its community members. The digital material may include, but is not limited to
journal articles (pre-print and post-print), theses and dissertations, book chapters, research
reports, data sets, conference papers, teaching materials, lecture notes, and other multimedia
objects. Although the community members in the context of a repository are faculty, research
staff, and students, this study focused solely on faculty members. The term university-based IRs
is used interchangeably with institutional repositories (IRs) in the current study to refer to
institutional repositories operated by research universities.
The term research university refers to the nine universities in Thailand’s National
Research University (NRU) initiative. The NRU initiative project was launched in 2009 by The
Ministry of Education (Thailand) through the Office of the Higher Education Commission. The
nine universities are Chiang Mai University, Chulalongkorn University, Kasetsart University,
King Mongkut University of Technology Thonburi, Khon Kaen University, Mahidol University,
Prince of Songkhla University, Suranaree University of Technology, and Thammasat University.
The national research universities have received a large proportion of the research funding from
the Thai government (Sombatsompop, Markpin, Ratchatahirun, Yochai, Wongkaew, &
Premkamolnetr, 2010). Although there are nine research universities in Thailand, not all of them
have operated institutional repositories. The exclusion of universities that have not operated
institutional repositories left six universities as targeted universities for this study. However,

14

findings from the preliminary study showed that only four research universities qualified for this
study: Chulalongkorn University, Mahidol University, Prince of Songkhla University, and
Suranaree University of Technology.
Faculty members in the Thai higher education context include professors (full
professors), associate professors, assistant professors, and instructors or lecturers (Office of
Higher Education Commission, 2016; Tamronglak, 2013). Members of all of these groups have
four major roles: teaching, advising, service, and scholarly and professional activities. Some of
them may have administrative duties not required of all faculty members. Instructors and
lecturers were considered as faculty members in Thai higher education context; therefore, this
group of faculty was considered as part of the population and included in the current study.
User acceptance is “the demonstrable willingness within a user group to employ
information technology for the tasks it is designed to support” (Dillon & Morris, 1996, para. 4).
This study focused on faculty members’ acceptance and use of university-based institutional
repositories in the Thai research university context. Acceptance and use of a particular repository
means depositing as well as accessing and using digital materials stored in the repository.

CHAPTER 2
LITERATURE REVIEW
2.1

Institutional Repositories
Institutional repositories (IR) have been developed, implemented, and used as an

alternative channel for scholarly communication. Not only do faculty benefit from IRs, but other
members of scholarly communities benefit as well.
This chapter reviews the development of institutional repositories and the definitions of
the term. It then addresses the current stage of institutional repositories both on the global level
and in the Asian region. Previous studies on IRs and other related topics will be discussed.
Factors that might affect faculty acceptance and usage of IRs will be identified.
The knowledge presented in this chapter serves as the literature foundation for this study
and is intended to expose the limitations and identify gaps in the literature.
2.1.1

Emergence and Evolution of IRs
Over the past three decades, the advance of information and communication technology

(ICT), along with the Internet and the Web, has altered the patterns of communication and
brought about a transition in scholarly communication. Open access and institutional repositories
have emerged as new strategies for scholarly communication. According to the Budapest Open
Access Initiative (BOAI) (2002), open access literature means:
its free availability on the public Internet, permitting any users to read, download, copy,
distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of these articles, crawl them for indexing,
pass them as data to software, or use them for any other lawful purpose, without
financial, legal, or technical barriers other than those inseparable from gaining access to
the Internet itself. The only constraint on reproduction and distribution, and the only role
for copyright in this domain, should be to give authors control over the integrity of their
work and the right to be properly acknowledged and cited. (para. 3)
In short, open access means free and online access to all digital content which authors
willingly make freely available for all users without financial, legal, or technical barriers. The
16

open access movement is viewed as an alternative form of scholarly communication that differs
from the traditional one in which scientists and scholars publish in subscription-based journals,
which have restricted access.
Public declaration of the Budapest Open Access Initiative urged scholars to publish their
research outputs in institutional archives and encouraged the creation of new open access
journals. The BOAI’s declarations gained more attention from academia as well as from national
and international funding agencies. Many national funding agencies such as the National
Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) in the U.S. and the
Research Councils in the UK have declared their support for and commitment to open access
(Research Councils, n.d.). According to Hargermann (2012), over 300 research institutions,
including the HIH, the NSF, and the Research Councils, have implemented open-access mandate
policy. This policy requires “scholars to self-archive their research outcomes in a repository or a
website, to promote free access to and wide sharing of information” (Xia et al., 2012, p. 85). As
a result, scientists, scholars, and students around the world can benefit from scholarly materials
published in both open access journals and open access repositories. The statistics show that to
date approximately 9,325 academic journals have been published in the Directory of Open
Access Journals (DOAJ) (2017), and more than 3,200 open access repositories are listed in the
Directory of Open Access Repositories (OpenDOAR, 2017). Statistics from both DOAJ and
OpenDOAR show that the total number of open access journals and open access repositories has
increased continuously since the technology was introduced.
The definitions of the term institutional repository (IR) are diverse. Analysis of IR
literature shows that the definition of the term IR is fluid; IR may mean different things to
different people from a variety of disciplines which are involved in the creating and developing

17

of IRs (Allard, Mack, & Feltner-Reichert, 2005). Generally, an IR is understood as a digital
archive of scholarly outputs created by the members of a particular scholarly institution. The
definitions of institutional repositories contributed by Clifford Lynch and Raym Crow are the
two most frequently cited (Allard et al., 2005). For Crow (2002), an institutional repository is “a
digital archive of the intellectual product created by the faculty, research staff, and students of an
institution and accessible to end users both within and outside of the institution, with few if any
barriers to access” (p.15), while Lynch (2003) defines the IR as follows:
a university-based institutional repository is a set of services that a university offers to the
members of its community for the management and dissemination of digital materials
created by the institution and its community members. It is most essentially an
organizational commitment to the stewardship of these digital materials, including longterm preservation where appropriate, as well as organization and access or distribution.
(p. 328)
In the above definitions, both authors emphasize the collections of IRs, the community
being served, services, the access issue, and the long-term preservation of scholarly material. All
of these are essential components that contribute to the success of an IR.
Crow (2002) explains that the content of an IR is institutionally defined, scholarly,
cumulative and perpetual, and open and interoperable. In other words, the content of an IR is
institutionally defined; it is developed within a particular institution or group of institutions.
Therefore, “institutional repositories represent an historical and tangible embodiment of the
intellectual life and output of an institution” (p 18). Secondly, an IR collects, contains, preserves,
and disseminates a variety of scholarly content of the institution or community. The collections
may include classroom teaching materials, peer-reviewed articles, conference papers, electronic
theses and dissertations, pre-prints and works-in-progress, and other types of gray literature. In
addition, the content within an IR should be cumulative and must be preserved to ensure longterm access to digital objects. Finally, IRs should be interoperable and open access, since the

18

motivating factor that leads to the development of an institutional repository is to provide free
access to intellectual scholarly outputs generated by a variety of research communities. The
interoperability characteristic of IRs enables scholars and researchers from a variety of
disciplines to access and benefit from those digital assets. This helps to encourage the creation of
open access scholarly communication. Even though the last-mentioned characteristics of IR
support open access, some circumstances such as copyright restriction, policies established by a
particular research group, the conditions of sponsor contracts, and monetary access fees allow an
institution to limit access to some specific content published in an IR. All of these elements are
essential and pertain to the development and implementation of IRs.
Besides institutional repositories, there are many other types of repositories currently
being developed. According to Armbruster & Romary (2010), there are four different types of
repositories, including subject-based repositories (discipline-specific or subject-oriented
repositories such as arXiv, RePEc, and PubMed), research repositories, and national repositories
(a national repository is generally designed for capturing and preserving scholarly outputs in the
higher education of the nation such as the Japanese Institution Repositories Online [JAIRO]).
Each type of repository has been developed by different communities, has different
characteristics, serves different user groups, and varies from the others in terms of service
quality. While institutional repositories may not offer dedicated services as do other types of
repositories, they play a role in assisting scholars to deposit their work, compile publication lists,
track their own impact as IRs, and support scholars in teaching and learning (Armbruster &
Romary, 2010). Due to their availability, the collections of IRs serve as important information
resources for community members, ranging from faculty, researchers and their colleagues,
students, and alumni of the institution. Through the open access agreement, researchers and

19

individuals around the world can also benefit from those open access scholarly works, to which
they may not normally have access.
2.1.2

Current State of IRs on a Global Level and in Asia
OpenDOAR is an authoritative directory of academic open access repositories developed

by the University of Nottingham, UK. As of January 2017, OpenDOAR listed more than 3,200
open access repositories categorized into four major types: institutional, discipline, aggregating,
and governmental repositories. The majority of open access repositories were institutional
repositories. The largest number of repositories was in the European countries (45%), followed
by Asia (20%), and North America (18%); the remaining were in Africa, Australia, the
Caribbean, Central America, and other areas. According to the OpenDOAR, the United States,
the United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, and Spain are the leading contributors on a global level.
DSpace and Eprints are the two most popular software applications used to develop and
implement IRs, while Digital Commons and other unknown software are also being used by
some institutions. The content types in OpenDOAR repositories vary in the purpose of the
repository organization. The content of a repository may include, but is not limited to journal
articles, theses and dissertations, book chapters, unpublished reports and working papers,
conference and workshop papers, multimedia and audio-visual materials, learning objects,
bibliographic references, datasets, patents, software, and other types of materials. Even though
the statistics from OpenDOAR show a continuous growth of IRs around the world since 2005, it
should be noted that the directory might not represent the real world statistics of IRs. Since
OpenDOAR aims to enhance and support academic and research activities, it accepts only the
repositories that embrace the concept of open access to full text resources that are of use to
academic researchers. As a result, any repositories that do not support open access are excluded.

20

In addition, the sites that contain only metadata records are also excluded. As a result of these
criteria, some IRs may not be listed in the directory. This leads to an underestimation of the
number of IRs presented in the statistics.
The literature reflects the continuous growth of IRs on the global level, including in Asia.
In 2006, there were only 40 repositories registered in OpenDOAR, but the number of IRs rose to
138 in 2008 and 296 in December 2010 (Nazim and Mukherjee, 2011; Wani, Gul, & Rah, 2009).
To date (January 2017), Asia is ranked the second contributor on the global level. Statistics from
OpenDOAR show that Asia contributes 624 repositories, and the majority of them are
maintained by organizations from major contributing countries such as Japan (211 repositories,
32%), India (76 repositories, 12%), Turkey (75 repositories, 11%), Taiwan (60 repositories, 9%),
and Indonesia (58 repositories, 9%). While all of these countries are ranked as leading
contributors in this continent, the rate of the adoption of IRs in each country is still low. In spite
of the continuous growth of the collections and the fact that Japan ranks as the third contributor
on a global level and the first contributor in this region, the number of IRs registered in
OpenDOAR is still low, compared with the current number of institutional repositories listed in
the National Institute of Informatics Institutional Repositories Program (NII), Japan (National
Institute of Informatics, 2011, 2014). Similarly, although there are signs of a positive movement
in India regarding the development of open access repositories, the growth rate of Indian IRs is
still low compared with the growth rates of IRs in other developed countries. In addition,
statistics show that few of the IRs in India have strong collections; many contain only a
minimum number of records (Roy, Mukhopadhyay, & Biswas, 2012). According to the previous
studies, issues related to the quality and quantity of contents, metadata standards, technical

21

infrastructure, copyrights, and policy are some of the challenges facing the development of
institutional repositories in some countries (Roy et al., 2012; Shukla and Khan, 2014).
Since this study focuses on faculty acceptance of IRs in Thailand, located in the
Southeast Asian Region, the following section discusses the current stage of IRs and presents
findings from studies focusing on institutional repositories in that area, aiming to present a clear
picture of institutional repositories and to address the current awareness and usage of IRs in this
region.
2.1.3

Current Stage of IRs in Southeast Asian and Thailand
Although statistics from OpenDOAR show a continuous growth of IRs in some leading

countries such as Japan and India, this growth is not everywhere in Southeast Asia. In this
region, there are 104 repositories distributed among seven countries (January 26, 2017). While
Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand are the top three contributors in this region, with 58, 21, and
12 repositories respectively, some countries, such as Cambodia, Brunei, Burma, and East Timor,
have not yet instituted any repositories. Eprint and DSpace are the two most popular repository
platforms, used by 88% of the repositories listed in OpenDOAR. Most repositories in this region
hold several content types. Although content in IRs may vary depending on the content
recruitment policy of each country and institution, the main focus of the holdings is on journal
articles and theses and dissertations, while other types of content such as multimedia and audiovisual materials, learning objects, and other special item types seem to be rare.
According to Farida, Tjakraatmadja, Rudito, and Basuki (2013), there were 32
Indonesian open access repositories registered in OpenDOAR in 2013. Although, the number of
Indonesian IRs registered in the OpenDOAR had increased to 55 by August 2016 and reached 58
in January 2017, the open access movement in Indonesia may be considered slow. Because the

22

number of IRs registered in OpenDOAR is very low when this number is compared to the total
number of higher education institutions in the country (Priyanto, 2015). Among those whose
have registered, some have already attained a large content size, while others are still in the
developing process. Indonesian open access repositories are viewed as an alternative type of
scholarly communication that is able to enhance the visibility of the scholarship of Indonesian
higher education. Researchers have found that not only are open access institutional repository
(OAIR) processes (i.e., content recruitment strategy) and technological functions essential for
developing open access repositories in higher education in Indonesia, but people are essential,
too (Farida et al., 2013; Farida, Tjakraatmadja, Firman, & Basuki, 2015; Priyanto, 2015).
According to Priyanto (2015), although the librarians in Indonesia are somewhat familiar with
open access, their understanding of OA is still limited. As a result, they have implemented and
operated OA repositories using limited knowledge and skills.
Malaysia, the second-largest contributor in the Southeast Asian region, also faces a
similar situation. Open access and institutional repositories have become topics of interest in the
Malaysian scholarly community. While some research universities in Malaysia have developed
institutional repositories aiming to enhance the availability and visibility of the research outputs
and to increase the impact of the research generated within those universities (Abrizah, 2010), a
number of studies have found that faculty in some of the research-intensive universities have
little awareness of IRs. Additionally, faculty who were aware of the existence of IRs did not
want to get involved in the creation of IRs, resulting in a slow rate of adoption and use of IRs
(Abrizah, 2010; Singeh et al., 2013a, b). Since the value of repositories depends on authors’
acceptance and use of the IRs, further studies in this area would be of great benefit for content
recruitment and the development of institutional repositories.

Thailand is the third-largest contributor in this area. In the years since DSpace software
was first adopted and used by Chulalongkorn University to develop the first institutional
repository in 2005, some public and private universities in Thailand have started developing and
implementing institutional repository projects (Klungthanaboon, Leelanupab, & Moss, 2012;
Yoowang, 2012). According to OpenDOAR (2017), twelve repositories are listed in
OpenDOAR. While the majority of them (10) are institutional repositories, the others are a
disciplinary repository and a governmental repository. Eleven IRs use DSpace software for
content management, while the other remaining repository uses IR+. According to Wipawin and
Wanna (2014), intellectual repositories and knowledge banks are the two most common terms
used to refer to institutional repositories, as reflected in the name of some repositories such as the
Prince of Songkla University Knowledge Bank (PSU Knowledge Bank). Most repositories hold
several content types. However, journal articles, conference and workshop papers, and theses and
dissertations are most common content types in IRs. It should be noted that the number of
repositories listed in OpenDOAR might not reflect the current number of IRs in Thailand, since
any repositories that do not fully embrace the notion of open access are excluded from the
OpenDOAR directory. Currently, many universities and other organizations have developed and
implemented IRs. A study in 2012 found that eleven universities had implemented IRs, including
nine public universities: 1) Chulalongkorn University, 2) Khonkhan University, 3) Mahidol
Univerity, 4) Prince of Songkla University, 5) Rajamangala University of Technology Phra
Nakhon, 6) Rajamangala University of Technology Thanyaburi, 7) Suranaree University of
Technology, 8) Thaksin University, and 9) Thammasart University) and two private universities:
1) Shinawatra University and 2) Sripatum University (Yoowang, 2012). A survey of university
library websites in Thailand in 2014 reported that there were 22 accessible IRs being operated at

24

the time. In addition, 23 institutional repositories are currently registered in DSpace User
Registry. Similar to Indonesia, most of IRs in Thailand were developed for the purpose of
making electronic theses and dissertations accessible (Wipawin & Wanna, 2014).
Klungthanaboon (2013) employed a qualitative and grounded theory approach to study
the current status and impact of Open Access and IRs developed within three research
universities based on IR stakeholders’ viewpoints, including those of academic library directors,
journal editors, and authors (faculty), university executives, a research funder (National Research
Council of Thailand), the National Library of Thailand, and the Thai National Research
Repository Committee. Content recruitment, a low rate of awareness, sustainable support from
senior administrators, the copyright issue, and faculty’s reluctance to participate in IRs due to
their misconceptions regarding IRs are the major issues related to the development and
implementation of IRs in Thailand. Similarly, Wipawin and Wanna (2014) also found that issues
related to policies, quality and technical standards, and legal aspects are important issues
pertaining to the success of the development of IRs in Thailand.
The literature reviewed in this section shows that even though the researchers studying
the Asian region have conducted research on IRs within different contexts (e.g., in different
communities, stages of development, and geographical areas, etc.), they all touch on similar
issues related to content, standards and technology, and people, which are essential for
developing and implementing institutional repositories. The studies highlight that issues related
to people, particularly authors, seem to be the most important issues that affect the growth of
IRs.
In relation to Thailand, we can see that only a few studies have been conducted although
IRs have been developed and implemented by many institutions in Thailand for a considerable

25

period of time, particularly in the university setting. Among them, two studies have focused on
the managerial aspects of the development of IRs and on technological issues, while one study
addressed issues related to all groups of stakeholders. However, none of the studies in Thailand
were focused solely on the users, whom many researchers agree are the major stakeholders who
can make—or break—an IR. Knowledge in this area is important not only for the initial stages of
planning but also for the implementation stages of institutional repositories, since any knowledge
regarding the users may provide information useful for designing, developing, and improving
IRs that are tailored to those users’ needs.
2.2

Research Studies about Institutional Repositories
The role of IRs is to store and to make accessible digital materials. There is a simple

equation by which IRs can become a successful innovation: “Input of documents + Access/Use
of documents = Success of the IR” (Dorner & Revell, 2012, p. 262). Therefore, any evaluation
and analysis of IRs should be done taking into account both of the elements on the left side of the
equation. This section presents previous studies regarding IRs in three different areas: IR
development/implementation and content deposition, authors’ behavior and their self-archiving
practices, and factors affecting authors’ participation. Since this study focuses on factors
affecting faculty acceptance and usage of IRs, the emphasis in this section is on the studies
related to this area; however, it also covers other related topics such as open-access and selfarchiving.
2.2.1

IR Development/Implementation and Content Deposition
Content is an essential component pertaining to the success of IRs. Researchers have

agreed that the success of IRs can be predicted by the contents or the growth of contents that
involve faculty contribution (Westell, 2006; Thibodeau, 2007; Yakel et al. 2009). Despite the

26

fast growth of IRs, the quantity of the contents deposited in IRs remains quite low. This is
indicated by many studies conducted in the early stage of institutional repository development
and implementation.
The survey of 45 IRs in April 2004 found that the number of documents per IR was too
small in light of the huge amount of financial resources and staff hour spent. In fact, the average
number of documents per repository was 1,250 (Ware, 2004). Additionally, Ware (2004) also
found that issues surrounding faculty participation and difficulty persuading faculty to use
institutional repositories were major challenges for IR development and implementation.
Similarly, Chan (2004) conducted a case study of the University of Toronto’s institutional
repository—Tspace—during the implementation period of the repository, when faculty
participation was entirely voluntary. It was found that the submission rate was low and that the
reasons for the slow adoption of self-archiving include cultural inertia (a resistance to change or
reluctance to adopt new culture or technology—self-archiving in this case), lack of trust in the
repository, and uncertainty about intellectual property rights.
Additionally, results from a nationwide census of IRs in the U.S. academic institutions
showed that the content sizes of both pilot-test IRs and operational IRs were very small. The
majority of respondents in this study agreed that the success of IRs was connected to IR
contributors and their contributions and stated that recruiting content for IRs was difficult. Issues
related to faculty contributions were on the top-ranked factors that inhibited the deployment of
IRs (Markey et al., 2007).
Studies from the early stage of institutional repositories show that many institutional
repository projects have faced similar issues related to low submission rate, resulting from low
rates of faculty participation. These are critical issues that challenge the development and

27

implementation of institutional repositories. It seems clear that an understanding of academic
authors’ perceptions regarding open access and IRs is vital, since the results of studies on this
topic can be used to plan repositories that are tailored to the authors’ needs. In turn, this can
encourage more adoption. Emphasis should be put on academic authors, since they are the ones
who will make or break IRs. Therefore, some researchers have tried to study authors’ behavior
and self-archiving practices.
2.2.2

Authors’ Behavior and Self-archiving Practice
Foster and Gibbons (2005) observed how 25 faculty members at the University of

Rochester across a variety of disciplines, including Economics, Physics, Political Science,
Linguistics, and Visual and Cultural Studies, interacted with digital tools and how they organized
work in both virtual and physical workspaces. They identified the specific needs of the faculty.
For instance, the faculty needed to work with co-authors, preferred complete control over their
work, wanted to be safe with regard to copyright issues, and wanted to make sure that
participating in an IR would not increase their workload. This means that faculty members were
not eager to participate in an IR and deposit their work if the process required additional time
and effort. Understanding the faculty behavior gave the research team a fuller perspective on the
faculty’s lack of intention to participate in the IR. Personalizing the digital repository to meet the
needs of the faculty and enhancing DSpace to make it much easier for faculty members to
deposit their work are two possible strategies to increase faculty participation. A faculty-centric
approach might make the IR become more useful and more appealing to the faculty, which may
lead them to deposit more work into the IR (Foster & Gibbons, 2005). This work is the pilot
work considering the importance of understanding users’ behavior and their preference in regard
to institutional repository design.

28

Allen (2005) examined the content of twenty-five repositories operated in the UK and
employed a survey and follow-up interviews to study the attitudes and behavior of academics in
the humanities, including lecturers or professors and Ph.D. and post-doctoral students. The
results of the study were compared with findings from previous studies focusing on scientific,
technical, and medical (STM) fields. Since the population of the study was all academics in the
humanities, it was difficult to calculate the size and take a sample from the whole population.
Therefore, the researchers decided to distribute questionnaires through the JISCmail service.
There were only 75 academics, including lecturers or professors and PhD and post-doctoral
students, who participated in the study. The majority of respondents were from the UK (60%),
North America (15%), and Europe (15%), with the remaining (5%) from India, China, Australia,
and New Zealand. The majority of the respondents, about 49 out of 75 (65%), considered
themselves as IRs contributors, while the others considered themselves as non-contributors.
While the users of the institutional repositories perceived increased accessibility, increased
research impact, and the permanence of the archive as the most common advantages of IRs,
other groups cited fear of plagiarism, the quality of content of the repositories, and the copyright
agreement issue as the top three perceived disadvantages. However, Allen (2005) found that both
groups shared concerns over two similar issues: “plagiarism and breaking copyright agreement”
(p. 43). It was concluded that despite the low level of awareness about and low usage or IRs,
academics in the humanities saw the benefit of depositing materials. This benefit was not only
for themselves but also for other users (readers). Although this study was the first empirical
study emphasizing academics in the humanities, its findings cannot be generalized to other
contexts and used to explain attitudes and behavior of academics in the humanities toward IRs in
general due to the sampling method, which raised issues regarding external validity.

29

During the same period of time, Swan and Brown (2005) carried out a large-scale study,
involving 1,296 respondents from the arts and humanities, the social sciences, and the scientific
disciplines across different geographic locations, including the United Kingdom, Western
Europe, North America, Japan, Asia, Central/South America, Africa, and Australia and New
Zealand. The researchers explored authors’ experiences and opinions on publishing in open
access journals and self-archiving. The majority of the respondents (66%) reported that they had
never published any work in open access journals. Those who had published in open access
journals cited accessibility as the major reason for publishing, followed by the larger readership
and faster publication time than was possible with subscription-based journals. The majority of
respondents had self-archived at least one article during the previous three years, through at least
one of the following media: an institutional (departmental) repository, a discipline-based
repository, or a personal/institutional website. Some authors who had not self-archived cited the
perceived time required for self-archiving and technical difficulties as major reasons for
reluctance to self-archive, while some expressed concern about copyright infringement and
viewed it as “a stumbling block for self-archiving” (Swan & Brown, 2005, p. 3).
Wust (2006) explored the attitudes of researchers in the field of education towards
publishing in open access and institutional repositories. The participants in that study expressed
their interest toward open access publishing, and they considered publishing in open access
venues as a viable alternative to the traditional system. Importantly, most of the participants in
that study neither had experience with depositing work in IRs nor knew about IRs. However,
they had discussed the advantages and disadvantages and the types of documents that they would
willing to share through IRs based on the researcher’s brief explanation of the concept of the eprint server. While some scholars felt that IRs might help to foster a growing number of

30

interdisciplinary projects as they housed and showcased a variety of work produced by
researchers in many departments in an institution, some of them feared that they might lose
control over their work and expressed concern about the copyright issue. Some also mentioned
that IRs might suffer from the lack of a search function that could facilitate cross-discipline
searching and cross-institutional searching. The participants also indicated that the usability of
the system and the ease of use might affect their willingness to participate and deposit their
materials. One participant mentioned that she might not be willing to deposit work if the user
interface was too complicated. Therefore, providing support to assist faculty members in
overcoming this problem would be an appropriate solution to this issue.
Different from previous studies, Pickton and McKnight (2006) focused on studying 34
research students, from the Faculty of Engineering, the Faculty of Sciences, and the Faculty of
Social Sciences and Humanities, rather than on faculty members. The research students were
viewed as important potential users of an institutional repository, since this group of researchers
was considered as both academic authors (IR contributors) and users (readers) of the
Loughborough University Institutional Repositories (LUIR). The structured interview was used
to gather background information (e.g. search behavior, publication history, and reasons for
publishing), as well as information on students’ current understanding of open access publishing,
practical issues surrounding their use of the LUIR, and students’ motivations and deterrents from
depositing work in the LUIR. The majority of students stated that they were influenced by
supervisors or colleagues, research funders, and co-author to make their work publicly available.
Fewer students agreed with the deterrent statements and expressed concern that if they published
their works in the LUIR, they might not be able to publish those works elsewhere later. In
addition, some of them feared that others might use and copy their work without permission or

31

were worried about the copyright issue, plagiarism, and confidentiality of their work. These
reasons were cited as deterrents to depositing work in the LUIR.
In the following year, Davis & Connolly (2007) conducted an evaluative study of
Cornell’s DSpace in order to discover the reasons for faculty members’ non-use of Cornell’s
DSpace. The researchers conducted in-depth interviews with eleven faculty members from
various disciplines, including the sciences, social sciences, and humanities. The purposes of the
study were to explore the faculty’s attitudes, motivations, and behaviors regarding the use of IRs.
The findings indicated that Cornell’s Dspace was underpopulated and underused by the faculty
and found that the faculty had little knowledge of it and little motivation to use it. Nine out of
eleven participants stated that they used personal or research group Web pages for disseminating
their scholarly work, since these two types of media were easier to use and control. Some faculty
members used both personal/group Web pages and other digital repositories and cited
permanence (data migration), policy required by granting agencies and publishers, timeliness for
disseminating scholarly work, and the registration of new ideas as reasons for using digital
repositories, particularly for a discipline specific repository such as arXiv. On the other hand,
faculty members cited several reasons such as the learning curve, copyright concerns, publishing
of original work (redundancy with other modes of dissemination), fear of plagiarism, and
concern about the quality of other work published in IRs as reasons for not using or participating
in any IRs. Regarding the specific questions on Cornell’s DSpace, only four faculty members
knew about the repository, while only one faculty member (the historian) had deposited work
there. The reasons for non-use were the use of subject repositories and the lack of functionality
on DSpace, and some faculty viewed institutional repository as a separate entity isolated from
other university information sources. Moreover, the researchers concluded that the faculty’s

32

behavior and perception of IRs might be shaped by the disciplinary norms and their reward
structure. Thus, understanding these considerations may provide an effective strategy for
encouraging faculty to participate in and contribute to IRs.
Faculty and researchers’ concerns about the quality of work published in IRs are reflected
in other studies. Theodorou (2010) sought to determine the reasons why the acceptance and
growth of open access repositories had been slow by analyzing researchers’ opinions about the
open access IRs of 20 social and natural science academic institutions in Europe and North
America. While 532 e-mail questionnaires were sent out, only192 answered questionnaires were
returned. Although the majority of researchers considered themselves as experienced users of
OA journal and IRs, fewer of them had published in OA journals and deposited works in OA
IRs. The majority of them indicated that they would willing to publish in those OA IRs if they
used the same selection criteria as high-reputation subscription-based journals. Some participants
(six percent) in the study expressed concern about the quality of work in open access IRs and did
not consider an open access repository as a prestigious place to publish. This group of
researchers indicated unwillingness to participate in IRs. Clearly, the selection procedure is
essential for open access institutional repository development, since it helps to establish not only
researchers’ (contributors’) but also readers’ trust toward repositories.
It is clear that studies focusing on authors’ behavior and attitude toward open access and
IRs and their self-archiving practice help researchers to gain a greater understanding of this
important group of institutional repository stakeholders. Their reasons for and against depositing
work in institutional repositories found in these studies have been used in many later studies
focusing on understanding the factors affecting authors’ participation.

33

2.2.3

Factors Affecting Authors’ Participation
Since understanding academic authors’ behavior and the factors surrounding their

contribution may provide guidelines and criteria for content recruitment, researchers are
attempting to study this major group of IRs stakeholders. Many empirical studies in this area
have been conducted in different contexts. While some researchers attempt to understand authors
in a variety of disciplines and the factors affecting their contribution, others focus on studying
authors in a certain discipline and are interested in more specific factors.
From a review of the literature, Shearer (2003) identified critical success factors affecting
the growth and use of IRs. Those factors include input activity (e.g. the number of documents
deposited into an IR), disciplines, activities, archiving policies, copyright policies, content types,
staff support, quality control policies, software, and the use of the repository. It should be noted
that there are other factors or characteristics such as organizational culture that might affect the
growth of IRs and their use. Some factors in this study, particularly disciplinary differences,
copyright, and quality control, have been used widely in many studies in an attempt to
understand the reasons underlying faculty contribution.
Park and Qin (2007) employed grounded theory to explore factors affecting the decisions
of scholars in the social sciences and information-related field to publish and use articles in
open-access journals. They identified seven factors, perceived journal reputation, perceived
topical relevance, perceived availability, perceived career benefit, perceived cost, perceived
content quality, and perceived ease of use, pertaining to the scholars’ willingness to publish in
open-access journals. The first three factors are common factors affecting scholars’ willingness
to publish and use open-access journals. The researchers concluded that perceived content
quality was an essential factor that affected scholars’ willingness to publish. They also found an

34

interrelationship between factors affecting scholars’ willingness to publish and use of OA
journals. The perceived availability positively affected perceived career benefit and perceived
ease of use. The availability of the OA journals can enhance accessibility and bring about wider
recognition. The model also showed a negative relationship between perceived availability and
perceived content quality. The authors explain that the negative relationship happens because
“scholars tend to perceive high availability as low rarity, resulting in the less embedded value”
(p. 78). Since the participants in this study were scholars from social sciences and informationrelated fields, their behavior, attitudes, needs, and acceptance of OA might differ from those of
scholars from hard sciences, such as mathematicians, physicists, and biomedical scientists. The
authors acknowledge that their findings might not be applicable to other academic disciplines,
due to the differences in idiosyncrasies of communication within their disciplines. Thus,
understanding discipline differences is essential. Further research focusing on scholars in a single
discipline or covering multiple disciplines would be of great benefit to this area. The researchers
confirm that understanding the factors influencing user acceptance would provide criteria for
content recruitment for OA journals and IRs. Park and Qin’s study was the first study to focus on
scholars seen as both authors and content creators, as well as users of open access journals. Their
study provides a research framework for studying scholars as both authors and users of not only
open access journals but also other venues considered as alternative ways of scholarly
communication.
In another empirical study, Kim (2008) investigated the motivational factors affecting
faculty members’ decisions to participate in various forms of self-archiving practices based on a
socio-technical network framework proposed by Kling et al. (2003). Based on this framework,
self-archiving behavior is viewed as a type of socio-technical activity that takes place in

35

electronic scholarly communication forums. Kim (2008) focused on six out of eight features of
the model: 1) system interactors, 2) core interactor groups (faculty members who performed
self-archiving), 3) excluded actors/undesired interactions, 4) existing communications, 5)
resource flows, and 6) incentive structure. Authors (faculty members) were viewed as core
interactors, and IRs were considered as one of the existing communication systems. The
incentive for self-archiving consisted of both extrinsic and intrinsic benefits, which were
considered as motivating and impeding factors for self-archiving.
A survey and follow-up interviews were employed to study faculty members from 17
Carnegie Research Universities with DSpace-based IRs. The participants were 684 faculty
members. The researcher identified four motivators and three barriers that had a significant
impact on faculty self-archiving in various media, including IRs, and proposed a model for
factors affecting faculty self-archiving, shown in Figure 2.1.

Figure 2.1. Factors affecting faculty self-archiving. Adapted Kim (2010).
According to Kim’s model, altruism is the most powerful motivator for self-archiving.
Altruism is operationalized as “satisfaction in helping others through knowledge sharing” (Kim,

36

2008, p. 20). It is driven by the authors’ interest in making their work easily accessible and the
expectation that other researchers, particularly ones who have limited access, will benefit from
their work. The second and third most powerful motivators were self-archiving culture and the
required technical skills. These two motivators are related to academic discipline or discipline
differences, which have been identified as an important factor in studies on authors’ acceptance
of and contribution to IRs (Creaser et al., 2010; Davis & Connonlly, 2007; Dulle, 2010; Park &
Qin, 2007; Yakel et al., 2013). The last motivator was academic reward, the belief that selfarchiving has a positive impact on promotion, tenure, and funding. In essence, if the faculty
members believe that self-archiving enhances, rather than impedes, academic rewards, then they
will be willing to self-archive and contribute to IRs.
Kim (2010) also found that copyright, age, and time and effort required for self-archiving
were negatively associated with self-archiving. The copyright issue has also been identified in
previous studies as an important factor for IR contribution. Age is the second most significant
barrier to self-archiving. Kim found that younger faculty members tended to self-archive a
greater percentage of their work than did older faculty, since they were more familiar with
publishing and disseminating their work on the Internet. The third most significant barrier, time
and effort, is also seen as a barrier for IR deposition (Chan, 2004; Foster & Gibbons, 2005).
Kim’s (2008) study was the first large scale study focusing on motivational factors
affecting faculty members’ decisions to self-archive in not only IRs and disciplinary repositories
but also other forums, such as personal websites. Her study provides the theoretical framework
for the present study. She suggests, and confirms, that altruism (an intrinsic benefit) and
academic reward (an extrinsic benefit) are powerful motivators for self-archiving. In addition,

37

other factors found in her study can be used to study faculty participation and contribution in
other contexts.
Following previous studies, Creaser et al. (2010) found from a large-scale quantitative
study of European researchers (a questionnaire returned by 3,139 respondents) that accessibility
and availability of the scholarly outputs was a key factor influencing authors to contribute to
open access repositories. The increased accessibility of the scholarly information and expanded
readership helped to increase the impact of the scholarly works. On the other hand, the copyright
issue and infringement of publishers’ copyright were the two most important concerns expressed
by the majority of European research authors. Even though, recently many publishers have
begun to support open access and allow authors to deposit their work, particularly stage-two
manuscripts (authors’ final peer-reviewed manuscripts), in open access repositories. Similar to
other researchers, Creaser et al. (2010) also reported findings on disciplinary differences in
European scholarly authors’ awareness and attitudes toward open access repositories.
Researchers in different disciplines, including the Medical Sciences, Life Sciences, Physical
Sciences and Mathematics, Social Sciences and Humanities and Arts, and Interdisciplinary
Sciences, had different understanding and awareness of open access repositories and distinct
motivations for depositing scholarly work. For instance, authors in the fields of Physics and
Economics have a long tradition of experience in self-archiving pre-print work in subject-based
repositories. The results also show that authors from Physics and Mathematics were more likely
to deposit their work into a repository than were authors from any other disciplines, since selfarchiving to them is viewed as the norm and a part of routine work. The study identified many
factors such as accessibility and availability of the scholarly outputs which in turn are related to

38

academic reward, disciplinary differences, and copyright issues that should be considered as
important factors in the present study.
Yakel, Faniel, Kriesberg, and Yoon (2013) employed a qualitative approach to study trust
in digital repositories among archaeologists and quantitative social scientists. Disciplinary
similarities and differences associated with trust in digital repositories were discovered. Even
though researchers in both disciplines focused on structural assurance guarantees (i.e., factors
affecting one’s sense of security) associated with trust in digital repositories, they emphasized
different aspects. While almost half of the archaeologists viewed the guarantee of preservation
and sustainability as a major factor, the social scientists mentioned institutional reputation more
frequently when discussing trust. They also found a distinction between novice and expert social
scientists. The novice social scientists were more likely to discuss institutional reputation as a
trust factor than were the experts. In addition, among the social scientists, novices mentioned
colleagues as a social factor influencing their decisions to trust a repository more than they
mentioned experts. Long-term preservation is considered as a motivating factor for IR
contribution. Both archaeologists and quantitative social scientists cited preservation and
sustainability guarantees when discussing trust in digital repositories. They noted that the
guarantees of preservation and sustainability were important factors to all IR stakeholders,
particularly for faculty members, as reflected in the interviewees’ dialog:
Long-term preservation is important so to know that it’s kind of a sustainable practice
and it’s going to be there in the long run…what happens when the NEH or the NSF
funding runs out? Who’s going to take care of the collection, who’s going to run it? So
for using a repository, I’d want to know that there was a long-term plan for it. That’s
really important. (Yakel et al., 2013, p. 151)
It is essential for academic libraries and other IR developers to explicitly communicate
the strategy for long-term preservation and sustainability of the IRs to the users or designated

39

communities, as this can help to establish trust in IRs. This in turn will lead to more deposition
and use. On the other hand, uncertainty regarding the long-term preservation and sustainability
of scholarly content and of IRs themselves might make some authors reluctant to deposit their
work into IRs.
Different from previous studies, Dulle (2010) employed the Unified Theory of
Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT model) to study factors contributing to the
acceptance and usage of open access by academic researchers in six public universities in
Tanzania. The UTAUT model has rarely been used in open access and IR related study. As in
prior empirical studies, questionnaires and interviews were used as data collecting methods. The
questionnaires were used to study academic researchers in six public universities in Tanzania. In
addition, sixty-nine policy makers in those universities were interviewed. The UTAUT model is
suitable for studying the adoption of open access in the context of the public university in
Tanzania (Dulle, 2010; Dulle & Minishi-Majanja, 2011). Attitudes toward open access,
awareness, effort expectancy (EE), and performance expectancy (PE) were key determinants of
the researchers’ intention to use open access outlets, while awareness, behavioral intention (BI),
facilitating conditions (FC), and social influence (SI) significantly affected their actual usage of
open access outlets, including IRs. While EE, PE, BI, FC, and SI are major factors in the original
UTAUT model, attitude toward open access and awareness were added to test whether they had
an effect on faculty members’ behavioral intention and usage behavior. The findings also
indicated that both researchers and policy makers were aware of open access. The majority of
researchers (62%) indicated that they accessed and used open access outlets, while only 20% of
them disseminated their scholarly contents through open access venues. As this study was
conducted in a developing region, issues related to technology were cited as important factors in

40

relation to both depositing and access. For instance, low Internet self-efficacy such as inadequate
information search skills was cited as the main hindrance for many researchers to access and use
open access outlets. In addition, slow network connectivity and inadequate online publishing
skills were major factors deterring the researchers from disseminating their scholarly work
through open outlets (Dulle, 2010; Dulle, Minishi-Majanja, & Cloete, 2010).
In Dulle’s 2010 study, open access publication was viewed as technology, and open
access outlets were considered as technological tools that scientists or researchers coul use to
distribute their scholarly work as well as to access and use scholarly content distributed by
others. Thus, the UTAUT was used to study factors contributing to the acceptance and usage of
this technology in this context. Some constructs (factors) in the UTAUT are similar to the
constructs in Kim’s proposed model. For instance, effort expectancy (EE) in the UTAUT model
refers to “the degree of ease associated with the use of the system” (Venkatesh et al., 2003,
p.450). This construct is similar to “additional time and effort” in Kim’s (2008, 2010) studies. In
addition, one of the independent variables among the contextual factors in Kim’s (2008) study,
influence of external actors, refers to as “the extent to which professors perceive the influence of
co-authors, grant-awarding bodies, and universities on the decision to self-archive” (p. 76). This
factor is similar to social influence (SI) in the UTAUT model, the notion that an individual’s
intention to use a new technology is influenced by other individuals who are important to her or
him such as peers and superiors. However, the influence of external factors was found not
significant in Kim’s (2008) study. Therefore, this independent variable was disregarded and
excluded from Kim’s model of factors affecting faculty members’ self-archiving. The integration
of these two models provides a better framework for this present study, which will focus on

41

factors that might affect faculty members’ use of IRs in the Thai higher education context. (The
UTAUT model is discussed in detail in Chapter 3).
Similar to Dulle (2010), Singeh et al. (2013a) also employed the UTAUT model to study
Malaysian authors’ acceptance of self-archiving in institutional repositories and found that
performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions did not
influence Malaysian authors’ behavioral intention to self-archive in IRs. It is interesting to note
that even though the four constructs of the UTAUT model, performance expectancy, effort
expectancy, social influence, and facilitating condition, were not significant and did not
influence behavioral intention, they were significant relative to each other. For instance, there
was a positive significant relationship of effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating
condition with performance expectancy. Performance expectancy is “the degree to which an
individual believes that using the system will help him or her to attain gains in job performance”
(Venkatesh et al., 2003, p. 447). This relationship can be explained by saying that the faculty
would consider effort expectancy (i.e., the degree of ease associated with self-archiving), social
influence (i.e., the degree to which a faculty member perceived that important others believed
he/she should self-archive), and facilitating condition (i.e., the degree to which technical
infrastructure existed to support self-archiving) as the conditions that helped them to selfarchive. These factors were significantly positive related to performance expectancy, which
means for example that faculty members believed that self-archiving in open access repositories
was useful for disseminating their research, increasing their benefit, and making their work more
visible. From this study, we can see that authors’ contributions still remain a major challenge for
IRs and self-archiving. Future studies are needed to make possible a better understanding of

42

authors and to determine the factors affecting their adoption of self-archiving and use of
institutional repositories.
Most of the research has studied faculty members as IR authors, content depositors, and
contributors, while few studies have been done from the perspective of the access side, which
views faculty members as users of IRs. Among those studies, Park and Qin (2007) employed a
qualitative approach to study factors affecting scholars’ decisions to publish and use articles in
open-access journals. In addition, Dulle (2010) studied the factors influencing the adoption of
open access scholarly communication by researchers both as users and as contributors to open
access outlets. Yakel et al. (2013) studied trust in digital repositories among archaeologists and
quantitative social scientists and found that trust is important for both authors and users of
institutional repositories.
The literature shows that since the early stage of IR development, many researchers have
attempted to understand IR users, particularly faculty members, who are considered the major
contributors to IRs. Many factors that might affect their decision to participate and contribute to
IRs have been identified and tested. Some factors may be considered as facilitating factors, while
others are impeding factors. Those factors might affect users’ acceptance and usage of IRs
differently, particularly in different situations and contexts. The present study investigates
faculty members as both IR contributors and users and to fill the gap in our knowledge about the
individual level of acceptance and use of IRs and the factors affecting faculty members’
acceptance and use of IRs in the Thai Research University context. The results will deepen our
understanding not only in the institutional repository field but also in the area of technology
acceptance and adoption.

CHAPTER 3
THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK
This chapter discusses two theories as a basis for formulating a suitable research model
for the present study. The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) and
Kim’s model of factors affecting faculty self-archiving are discussed, as they serve together as
the theoretical framework for this study. The integration of the two models is presented.
3.1

The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology
Information technology acceptance and adoption has become a research area that has

received considerable attention as part of the process of information system implementation.
According to Dillon and Morris (1996), user acceptance is “the demonstrable willingness within
a user group to employ information technology for the tasks it is designed to support” (para. 4).
More importantly, lack of user acceptance is a significant impediment to the success of new
information systems.
A number of theories/models have been proposed to study factors affecting the
acceptance and use of technologies. Some well-known technology acceptance models have
emerged from different approaches, such as the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA), the
Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), the Motivational Model (MM), the Theory of Planned
Behavior (TPB), the Combined TAM and TPB (C-TAM-TPB), the Model of PC Utilization
(MPCU), the Innovation Diffusion Theory (IDT), and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use
of Technology (UTAUT). A comparison of the proposed theories/models and their main
constructs can be seen in Table 3.1.
From Table 3.1, it is clear that among the competing models, the UTAUT model
contributes to a better understanding of user acceptance and use of technology than other

44

competing models, due to its high rate of prediction (Venkatesh et al., 2003). In fact, the UTAUT
model is able to explain almost 70 percent of variance (R2= 0.69) in user intentions to use
information technology, compared with other competing models that explain only less than 53
percent of variance (Venkatesh et al., 2003).

The UTAUT was developed based on an empirical comparison of eight technology
acceptance models and longitudinal studies. First Venkatesh et al. (2003) conduced a
comprehensive comparison of eight technology acceptance models. They identified limitations
of those models and found that technologies that had been studied in some studies were
relatively simple and individual-oriented rather than complex and sophisticated organizational
technologies. In addition, the participants were mainly from academic settings, and were often
students, rather than employees in organizations. Moreover, the proponents of most of the eight
models conducted studies after their participants had decided to accept or reject the technologies
rather than in the active adoption decision-making process. The last limitation in those models is
the voluntary vs. mandatory context. Some models were tested in a voluntary usage context;
therefore, it is difficult to generalize those results to mandatory settings. After identifying the
limitations from the previous models, Venkatesh et al. (2003) conducted a longitudinal study in
four different organizational contexts—entertainment, telecom services, banking, and public
administration—where a new technology was introduced in real workplace settings. The
questionnaires, which contained items used to measure constructs from all eight models, were
administered at three different points of time (at one month, three months, and six months). Then
findings from all of the studies were compared. Constructs found not significant were deleted.
The final model, consisting of four major determinant factors (main constructs) and four major
key moderators, was developed and cross-validated using data from two new organizations.
The major determinant factors are performance expectancy (PE), effort expectancy (EE),
social influence (SI), and facilitating conditions (FC). All four determinants “play a significant
role as direct determinants of user acceptance and usage behavior” (Venkatesh et al., 2003, p.
447). The model has four moderating factors, which are gender, age, experience, and

46

voluntariness of use. According to the model, the performance expectancy, effort expectancy,
and social influence factors have a positive direct effect on behavioral intention, while both
behavioral intention and facilitating conditions factors have a direct effect on use behavior, as
can be seen in Figure 3.1. The following section discusses each construct in detail.

Figure 3.1. The UTAUT model. Adapted from Venkatesh et al. (2003).
3.1.1

Performance Expectancy (PE)
According to Venkatesh et al. (2003), performance expectancy (PE) is “the degree to

which an individual believes that using the system will help him or her attain gains in job
performance” (p. 447). This construct is similar to perceived usefulness in the technology
acceptance model, extrinsic motivation in the motivational model, job-fit in the model of PC
utilization, relative advantage in the innovation diffusion theory, and outcome expectations in the
social cognitive theory. The authors suggested that performance expectancy was the strongest
predictor of individual usage intention. They also found that the effect of performance
expectancy on usage intention was moderated by age and gender.
3.1.2

Effort Expectancy (EE)
Venkatesh et al. (2003) explain that effort expectancy is “the degree of ease associated

47

with the use of the system” (p. 450). The model postulates that effort expectancy (EE) has a
significant positive direct effect on intention to use a technology. According to the model, the
effect of effort expectancy on behavioral intention to use a particular system is moderated by
experience, age, and gender. The authors found that the effect of EE is greater for women, older
workers, and those who have limited experience with a particular information system.
3.1.3

Social Influence (SI)
Social influence is “the degree to which an individual perceives that others whose

opinions are important to them believe he or she should use the new system” (Venkatesh et al.,
2003, p. 451). This can be understood as meaning that an individual’s intention to use a new
technology is influenced by other important individuals’ opinions that he/she should use the new
technology. The important individuals can be either peers or superiors. Venkatesh et al. (2003)
also state that the social influence factor is significant in mandatory environments, but it is not
significant in voluntary environments. In addition, the effect of social influence on acceptance
and adoption of technology is complex and depends upon a wide variety of group influences.
3.1.4

Facilitating Conditions (FC)
According to Venkatesh et al. (2003), the term facilitating conditions (FC) refers to “the

degree to which an individual believes that an organizational and technical infrastructure exists
to support use of the system” (p. 453). This construct is conceptualized similarly to constructs in
other models such as perceived behavioral control in the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB),
facilitating conditions in the Model of PC Utilization (MPCU); and compatibility in the
Innovation Diffusion Theory (IDT). Venkatesh et al. (2003) also suggest that the facilitating
conditions will become insignificant in predicting usage intention when both effort expectancy
and performance expectancy are present. According to the model, facilitating conditions have a

48

significant direct effect on usage behavior. It has been postulated that the usage of technology
depends on the availability of an enabling environment for its application.
Effort expectancy (EE), performance expectancy (PE), and social influence (SO) are
direct determinants of behavioral intention (BI), while behavioral intention (BI) and facilitating
conditions (FC) are significant direct determinants of use behavior (US). It has been theorized
that some determinants, such as self-efficacy, anxiety, and attitude toward technology, are not
direct determinants of usage intention, although these determinants were found significant in
other models. Among these three determinants, attitude presents an interesting case. Attitude was
found to be significant across models (TRA, TPB/DTPB, and MM) and was theorized to be the
strongest predictor of behavioral intention in those models, while this construct was not
significant in other models, including C-TAM-TPB, MPCU, and SCT (Venkatesh et al., 2003).
Since any knowledge in this area can contribute to a better understanding of behavioral intention
and usage of a particular technology, it is interesting to study the role of attitude in explaining
faculty members’ behavioral intention and use of IRs.
The UTAUT model was developed based on an empirical study of the other existing
technology acceptance models. This model contributes to a better explanation of behavioral
intention and use of technology over the other existing technology acceptance models. Therefore,
the UTAUT has been widely adopted and used as a theoretical framework for technology
acceptance research conducted in different contexts.
3.2

Studies Using the UTAUT Model
Due to its effectiveness, the UTAUT model has been applied to study users’ acceptance

and use of various technologies in different contexts and cultures within various disciplines. The
model has also been used in the library and information science field. This section presents some

49

of the technology acceptance studies that have utilized the UTAUT model as their theoretical
framework.
Tibenderanna and Ogao (2008) applied the UTAUT model to study end-users’
acceptance and use of e-library services in eight universities in Uganda. Self-administered
questionnaires were developed based on a pre-existing tool employed by Venkatesh et al. (2003)
and were used to collect data from participants, including undergraduate students, postgraduate
students, faculty, and staff. Expected benefit (perceived benefit) was added to the model, and it
was postulated that usage behavior would account for a significant percentage of variation on
expected benefit. Results from the study indicated that all dependent constructs, including
behavioral intention (R2= 0.30), use behavior (R2= 0.09), and expected benefit (R2= 0.18), had a
significant positive inclination to end-users’ acceptant and usage of e-library services. However,
effort expectancy (PE) and voluntariness, found not relevant in the e-library context, were
eliminated and replaced with relevance and awareness. The robustness and efficiency of the
UTAUT model helps to determine end-users’ acceptance and use of e-library services,
particularly the context of less developed countries.
In a large-scale study of 1,433 scientists from 49 countries, Mann, Walter, Hess, and

Wigand (2009) focused on 481 researchers from three different disciplines: information systems,
German literature, and medical science. The researchers defined Open Access publication media
as “technology that provides scientists with a tool to reach their goals of distributing research
results and documenting copyright” (p.138). They sought to uncover the reasons for the
relatively low-level use of Open Access publishing. Based on the UTAUT model, they
hypothesized performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and social influence to be predictors of
behavioral intention to use Open Access publishing. Attitude was added to the research model

50

based on the theory of Planned Behavior. Significant predictors of the scientists’ behavior
intention to use Open Access publishing were identified. However, the researchers found that
among the original UTAUT constructs, performance expectancy (PE) not only was a construct
that could be verified as a significant predictor of behavioral intention but also had the largest
predictive power in comparison to other factors, including peer use and attitude. In contrast with
the original model, the researchers identified attitude as a significant predictor of behavioral
intention. However, it should be noted that this study was conducted when the Open Access
model was already at a developed stage. The web-based questionnaires were distributed between
July and August 2006, when the attitude toward Open Access publishing was extremely positive.
This might have affected the participants’ behavior intention as shown in the result that attitude
was one of the significant predictors of behavioral intention along with other predictors.
Dulle (2010) studied the extent to which researchers in Tanzanian public universities
believed that open access facilitated the accessibility and dissemination of scholarly content,
utilizing the UTAUT model. They modified the UTAUT model by adding attitude toward open
access and Internet self-efficacy to the main constructs and academic position and awareness as
moderators in the research model, since these were considered as just as important as other
factors in the research environment regarding open access. They found that not only were effort
expectancy and performance expectancy key determinants and predictors of Tanzanian
researchers’ behavioral intention to use open access, but attitude and awareness were as well. On
the other hand, Internet-self efficacy was not significant. In addition, behavioral intention, social
influence, and facilitating conditions were found to be significant and had direct effects on
researchers’ actual usage of open access outlets. By testing the direct effects of moderators
including age, gender, awareness, experience, and position (rank), the researcher found that

51

participants’ awareness was the only factor that had a direct effect on behavioral intention. This
implies that researchers who were not aware of open access were less likely to use this mode of
scholarly communication in the future. The finalized version of the open access scholarly
communication model consists of five key constructs: attitude, performance expectancy, effort
expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions. It is evident that the findings from this
study contradict those of Venkatesh et al. (2003), who postulated that attitude would not have a
significant effect on behavioral intention. Thus, it will be interesting to study and include this
factor in the present study.
Orji, Cetin, and Ozkan (2010) extended the UTAUT model in a multicultural context.
They developed the Nationality based UTAUT model (NUTAUT), adapted from the UTAUT
model. Nationality was introduced based on the assumption that the independent variables in the
UTAUT model would have an impact on behavioral intention and use behavior differently when
moderated by nationality, which was then added as a new modulating variable. The NUTAUT
was tested and used to study critical factors in electronic library system acceptance by national
and international students in the Middle East Technical University (METU) in Turkey. The
results from 116 (58 national and 58 international student) participants showed that the
NUTAUT was robust in predicting acceptance by both National and International students (91%
and 98%, respectively). The researchers also found that each independent variable (construct)
affected each group differently. While effort expectancy and facilitating conditions were
significant factors for both groups, performance expectancy and social influence were significant
factors for International student participants. The findings also showed that facilitating
conditions had the highest contribution to acceptance and use. This construct remained the most
important factor across groups (Orji, 2010; Orji et al., 2010). It is evident from this study that

52

different groups of users of a particular technology have different usage behavior. In addition,
the constructs in the UTAUT model affected users of a particular technology differently.
Identifying the most influential factors for acceptance and usage of a particular technology will
facilitate well-informed decision making in the design and improvement of that technology.
The UTAUT model has also been used to study technology acceptance and use in the
Thai context. Kripanont (2007) examined the extent to which academics used and intended to
use the Internet in their work and investigated the extent to which using the Internet helped
academics in improving their professional practice, professional development, and quality of
working life. The author formulated a research model of technology acceptance in relation to
Internet usage by Thai academics with five core determinants: performance expectancy, effort
expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, and self-efficacy. Self-efficacy was added as
a direct determinant. The questionnaire survey was used to gather data from 920 academics in 20
business schools at 20 public universities. The response rate was 49% with 455 completed
questionnaires. The model was tested and modified. The final model successfully explained
academics’ use and intention to use the Internet in teaching. Perceived usefulness (PU),
perceived ease of use (PEOU), and self-efficacy played important roles in determining usage
behavior in teaching, while only perceived usefulness (PU), and self-efficacy (SE) played
important roles in determining usage behavior in other tasks. Kripanont also found that some
moderators, age, research university plan, and level of reading and writing, impacted the
influence of key determinants toward usage behavior and behavior intention. The majority of
moderators, including gender, education level, academic position, experience, and Thai language
usage did not impact the key determinants. Therefore, all of the moderators were eliminated from
the final model.

53

Boonsong (2013) studied instructors’ adoption of a web-based learning system at
Rajabhat universities in Thailand by testing whether the four main constructs of the UTAUT
model would have a positive effect on usage intention and adoption of web-based learning
systems and whether experience of use, age, and gender would have moderating effects on the
adoption of the system. A self-administered paper questionnaire was used to collect data from
participants. A total of 725 surveys were sent out, and 454 questionnaires were returned,
representing a 62.62% response rate. After 14 questionnaires were eliminated as outliers, a total
of 440 samples were retained for the analysis. Findings from this study revealed several factors
that can affect instructors’ adoption of a web-based learning system. Performance expectancy,
effort expectancy, and social influence had significant positive direct effects on usage intention,
while facilitating conditions and usage intention had direct positive effects on usage behavior.
Gender, age, and experience were confirmed as essential attributes of the UTAUT model.
Among the key determinants, facilitating conditions had the strongest direct effect on usage
behavior, and social influence had the highest effect on the usage intention for a web-based
learning system on the part of instructors.
The literature clearly shows that various researchers have validated the UTAUT model
(Boonsong, 2013; Oye et al., 2014), while others have extended it in different contexts
(Kripanont, 2007; Dulle, 2010; Orji, 2010; Orji et al., 2010). The flexibility of the model allows
researchers to modify and introduce new variables into it. Those variables can be both direct
determinants and moderators. For instance, self-efficacy and Internet self-efficacy were
integrated into the research model as direct determinants (Kripanont, 2007; Dulle, 2010). In
addition, attitude toward technology, found to be non-significant by Venkatesh et al. (2003), was

54

added and confirmed to be significant and to have direct effects on behavioral intention in
studies by Mann et al. (2009) and Dulle (2010).
Due to the effectiveness of the UTAUT model, the present study adopted this model as a
theoretical framework. In addition to its effectiveness, the flexibility of the model allowed for the
inclusion of more determinants in the model, as derived from the literature review and
particularly in regard to open access and institutional repositories. The integration of direct
determinants is discussed in Section 3.4, The Conceptual Model.
3.3

Model of Factors Affecting Faculty Self-Archiving
In Kim (2008), the model of factors affecting faculty self-archiving was developed based

on an empirical study of 684 professors from 17 universities classified as Carnegie Doctorategranting Universities. The self-archiving behavior was measured as two dependent variables.
One variable was concerned with general self-archiving of research work on any publicly
accessible web sites; the other focused on self-archiving in university IRs, which was considered
as the only type of general self-archiving venue. Two methodologies, including a large scale
survey and follow up interviews, were used to gather data from the participants. The researcher
found that although the population of the study was limited to faculty members in universities
having DSpace-based IRs, the majority of participants, 400 (out of 684 (58.5%) were not aware
of the IRs in their universities, while only 274 (40.1%) had some awareness of IRs, and 10
(1.5%) did not answer. Kim also found that 109 (15.9%) respondents had contributed to their
university IR.
Four factors with eleven independent variables were included in the proposed research
model: the costs factor (copyright concern and additional time and effort), extrinsic benefits
(accessibility, publicity, trustworthiness, academic reward, and professional recognition),

55

intrinsic benefits (altruism), and contextual factors (trust, self-archiving culture, and influence of
external actors). However, four motivating factors and three impeding factors were retained in
the final updated model, presented in Figure 3.2. The + and - signs represent the positive and
negative relationships between the factors and faculty self-archiving behavior. The four
motivating factors of self-archiving behavior were altruism, self-archiving culture, technical
skills, and academic reward, while the three impeding factors were copyright concerns, age, and
additional time and effort (Kim, 2010).

Figure 3.2. Factors affecting faculty self-archiving (Updated model). Adapted from Kim (2010).
After factors affecting the extent of self-archiving in general had been identified, logistic
regression analysis was conducted to provide an understanding of the factors that influenced
whether or not respondents deposited their research work in IRs. Four factors, 1) copyright
concerns, 2) accessibility, 3) altruism, and 4) trust, were found to positively associate with IR
contribution.

56

3.3.1

Copyright Concerns
Kim (2008) explained that the term copyright concerns refers to “the extent to which

professors perceive requirements to ask permission from publishers, possibilities of copyright
infringement, and frictions among co-authors in self-archiving researcher works” (p. 75). This
factor was measured based on faculty members’ perception of the copyright concerns.
3.3.2

Accessibility
Accessibility is “the extent to which professors perceived self-archiving materials to be

available in a stable manner, over time” (Kim, 2008). This factor was measured by the extent to
which the participants agreed with statements regarding ease of access to self-archived research
work and increasing possibility of communicating research findings to peers (Kim, 2011).
3.3.3

Altruism
Altruism refers to professors’ altruistic motivation to self-archive. This factor was

measured based on the extent to which faculty reported having clear perception of the principle
of Open Access and having notions about helping others to access and build on research work,
particularly for those who had difficulty in accessing scholarly work.
3.3.4

Trust
The definition of trust is “the extent to which professors perceive readers’ good intentions

and competence in using self-archived materials” (Kim, 2008, p. 76). This factor was examined
from two aspects, 1) participants’ attitudes toward the end-users of their self-archived materials
and 2) the extent of the participants’ trust in how their institutions maintained the publicly
accessible IRs.
Among these four factors, accessibility had the highest odds ratio (1.30), followed by
altruism (1.16), trust (1.14), and copyright concerns (1.10). The odds ratio can be used to explain

57

the size of the factors’ effects on IR contribution. For instance, accessibility had the greatest odds
ratio. This means the respondents who agreed more strongly with the idea of accessibility of selfarchived materials in IRs were more likely to contribute or publish their research work to their
universities’ IRs.
Among the four factors, copyright concerns presented a particularly interesting issue.
This factor was found to be negatively associated with general self-archiving; however, it was
positively related to IR contribution. Thus, it is crucial to study this factor in depth and determine
if it can be used to explain faculty contribution to IRs in other contexts.
Kim’s study was conducted in research universities in the US context. However, the
patterns of self-archiving and faculty contribution to IRs may not be generalizable to the entire
population in research universities (Kim, 2008, p. 222). It may or may not be possible to use
these patterns to explain faculty members’ self-archiving behavior and their contribution to IRs
in other settings. Thus, using the factors identified in this study to study self-archiving in general
or in the use of specific venues may be of benefit as IRs in different contexts may provide a
deeper understanding that can lead to practical implications for the improvement of the functions
and services of IRs on a global level.
3.4

The Conceptual Model
The previous discussion shows that although the UTAUT can help researchers to gain a

better understanding of technology acceptance and use and may help them to determine factors
affecting behavioral intention and usage behavior in relation to those technologies, the model
still needs modification to suit specific research settings as suggested by Venkatesh et al. (2003)
and other researchers (Boonsong, 2013; Dulle, 2010; Kripanont, 2007; Orji et al., 2010). In
addition, Kripanont (2007) mentioned that instruments that have been developed and repeatedly

58

tested in the business context may not be equally valid and useful to explain technology
acceptance and usage in other settings, particularly professional and academic settings.
The flexibility of the UTAUT model offers the opportunity for the integration of direct
determinants (factors) that might affect behavioral intention and usage behavior. Additionally,
results from the citation analysis and systematic review of 450 articles citing the UTAUT model
show that various external variables have been added to the model. In fact, 22 out of the 43
articles that made use of the UTAUT model included external variables, while the remaining
employed the original constructs (Williams, Rana, Dwivedi, & Lal, 2011).
The basic concept underlining the research model for the current study was adapted from
Venkatesh et al.’s (2003) basic concept underlying their user acceptance model (p. 427). The
researcher postulated that faculty members’ reaction toward IRs may influence their actual usage
of them. It is also postulated that the faculty members’ actual usage of IRs will determine their
stance toward the continuing use of IRs. Figure 3.3 presents the basic concept underlining the
proposed research model.

For this study, more determinants (factors) identified in the literature regarding Open
Access and IRs will be included in the proposed model. Although some of the determinants were
introduced, studied, and found significant in Kim’s (2008, 2010, 2011) studies, they have never
been tested in other contexts outside the US. Also, other determinants such as attitude and
resistance to change will be included in the model. The proposed research model is shown in

59

Figure 3.4. As shown in Figure 3.4, the proposed research model of this study consists of 9
factors. Each factor is discussed in detail in the following sections.

Figure 3.4. A path diagram of the proposed theoretical research model.
3.4.1

Attitude (ATT)
Attitude toward technology is defined as “an individual’s overall affective reaction to

using a system” (Venkatesh et al., 2003, 455). Because Venkatesh et al. (2003) found that
attitude does not have a direct influence on behavioral intention due to its interaction effects with
performance expectancy (PE) and effort expectancy (EE), this determinant was not included as a
direct determinant in the original UTAUT model. However, this determinant was found
significant in other technology acceptance studies utilizing other technology acceptance models
such as the Theory of Planned Behavior, the Theory of Reasoned Action, and the Motivational
Model. Attitude is one of the most common external variables employed by researchers to study
users’ acceptance of a various technologies such as a web-based learning system in Taiwan (Jong
& Wang, 2009), Internet banking services in Malaysia (YenYuen & Yeow, 2009), and online
banking services in Australia (Yeow et al., 2008). In addition, this determinant was included in
two studies related to Open Access conducted in different contexts and was found to be
60

significant and to have direct effects on behavioral intention in both studies (Mann et al., 2009;
Dulle, 2010). However, Dulle (2010) found that it did not have a direct effect on actual usage.
Since individual attitude has been proven to have a significant and direct effect on users’
behavior intention toward technology, the first hypothesis (H1) states that the faculty members’
attitudes toward IRs are expected to influence their behavioral intention.
3.4.2

Performance Expectancy (PE)
Performance expectancy (PE) is “the degree to which an individual believes that using

the system will help him or her attain gains in job performance” (Venkatesh et al., 2003, p. 447).
The authors verified that performance expectancy is the strongest construct for predicting
individual usage intention. It is expected that IR users will find that IRs are useful since they
allow users to deposit and disseminate their scholarly content in trusted repositories. At the same
time, users will gain benefits from accessing and using those contents for their scholarly
activities, which in turn will help to enhance the effectiveness of teaching and learning.
Many studies, including studies related to Open Access and IRs, have confirmed that PE
has a significant direct effect on behavioral intention (Dulle, 2010; Dulle, Minishi-Majanja, &
Cloete, 2010). Dulle, (2010) and Dulle et al. (2010) confirmed that performance expectancy is a
predictor of usage intention. This implies that the future adoption of OA is highly dependent on
the expected benefits of OA in improving accessibility. This construct was found to be strong for
predicting behavioral intention (Mann et al., 2009; Van Schaik, 2009; Wang, Wu, & Wang,
2009). In contrast, Singeh et al. (2013a) found that none of the factors in the UTAUT model,
including performance expectancy, influenced Malaysian authors’ behavioral intention to selfarchive in IRs. However, this might have happened because their study had a small sample size

61

(108 participants) as compared to the 215 participants in Venkatesh et al.’s (2003) study and the
398 participants in Dulle’s (2010) study.
Academic reward and accessibility factors are categorized with PE since these two
factors in Kim’s study present characteristics similar to other factors that are categorized in PE.
Accessibility is the main benefit that many scholars have cited as an important reason for
contributing to IRs and open access outlets (Parker, 2007; Swan & Brown, 2005; Kim, 2008;
Kim, 2010; Watson, 2007), and academic rewards have also been cited as a factor associated
with scholars’ willingness to publish in open access media (Park & Qin, 2007). This suggests
that if users think that they can gain career benefits through depositing their work into IRs, they
will be willing to do so. Following the original model, the second hypothesis (H2) states that PE
will have a significant direct effect on behavioral intention.
3.4.3

Effort Expectancy (EE)
Venkatesh et al. (2003) define effort expectancy as “the degree of ease associated with

the use of the system” (p. 450). The model postulates that effort expectancy (EE) has a
significant positive direct effect on behavioral intention. According to the model, in the
application of the concept of effort expectancy to the context of IRs, it is expected that individual
adoption of IRs will depend on the level of ease of use of the IRs.
The concept of effort expectancy or ease of use or usability has been mentioned in the
review of literature related to IRs and open access. For instance, Park and Qin (2007) found that
perceived ease of use was one of the factors influencing scholars’ willingness to use open access
journals. In addition, time consumption in the content depositing process has been cited as a
major barrier to IR contributions by researchers practicing self-archiving as well as researchers
who do not practice self-archiving (Foster & Gibbons, 2005; Singeh et al., 2013b). Various

62

studies have also confirmed that the effort expectancy (EE) has a significant positive direct effect
on technology usage intention. Dulle (2010) found that EE was one of the key determinants for
researcher behavioral intention to use open access outlets. Many respondents in that study also
mentioned that they were unlikely to face difficulties when using open access outlets to publish
and access scholarly work. Similar to the empirical evidence found in the literature, the current
study expects that EE will have a positive direct effect on faculty members’ behavioral intention
to use IRs. Thus, the third hypothesis (H3) states that Effort Expectancy will have a significant
direct effect on faculty members’ behavioral intention to use IRs.
3.4.4

Social Influence (SI)
Social influence is the degree to which an individual perceives that other people who are

important to him/her believe that he or she should use the new system. An individual’s intention
to use a new technology may be influenced by other important individuals’ opinions that he/she
should use the new technology. The important individuals can be either peers or superiors. This
factor has characteristics similar to those of “peer pressure” in the self-archiving context. Kim
(2008) defined peer pressure as the influence of external actors whose opinions the faculty
members thought might affect their decision of whether or not to self-archive. Peers, grantawarding bodies, and universities or departments are some examples of those external actors.
Although findings from the survey data of this study indicate that peer pressure did not have a
direct relationship to faculty decisions to self-archive, seven interviewees from a variety of
disciplines reported some degree of peer pressure was involved in their decision making process
to self-archive (Kim, 2010). Similarly to Kim (2010), Yoon’s (2014) study of end users’ trust
toward data repositories found that social influence was an important factor that the participants
cited as associated with trust. Yoon (2014) concluded that “If users hear about a repository from

63

sources with more authority, they tend to trust it more” (p. 27). In essence, social influence not
only affects authors’ intention to publish in IRs but also affects end users’ use of IRs.
Venkatesh et al. (2003) state that the social influence factor is significant in mandatory
environments, but it is not significant in voluntary environments. In addition, the effect of social
influence on acceptance and adoption of technology is complex and depends upon a wide variety
of group influences. Since the deposit of scholarly works in IRs by faculty members in Thailand
is mostly voluntary, it would be of interest to determine whether or not this factor can be used to
explain behavioral intention to use IRs in the Thai higher education context. Thus, the fourth
hypothesis (H4) states that social influence will have a significant direct effect on behavioral
intention to use IRs.
3.4.5

Resistance to Change (RTC)
Resistance to change (RTC) is “an individual’s dispositional inclination to resist

changes” (Oreg, 2003, p. 680). It is one aspect of the personality that is highly critical for
technology adoption (Venkatesh, Morris, & Ackerman, 2000). Oreg (2003) found that people
who exhibited higher levels of resistance to change were less likely to try to use a new
technology. The author concluded, “the resistance to change scale can be successful at predicting
such disinclination to adopt new products” (Oreg, 2003, p. 691). Oreg tested whether or not the
RTC scale could predict the resistance of faculty members at Cornell University to try
CourseInfo, a template for creating course Web sites. Professors who exhibited a higher level of
resistance to change were less likely to try out the CourseInfo system. In addition, Nov and Ye
(2008, 2009) confirmed that users with higher RTC have higher effort expectancy toward new
technology, particularly in the digital libraries adoption context. Resistance to change has also
been mentioned in some studies conducted at the early stage of Open Access and IR

64

development. For instance, Chan (2004) found that many faculty members cited cultural inertia,
which refers to a resistance to change or reluctance to adopt new culture or technology, as a
reason for the slow adoption of self-archiving (Chan, 2004; Kim, 2008).
A review of literature in the area of technology acceptance indicates that although many
researchers have found that RTC is a direct antecedent of effort expectancy (Nov & Ye, 2008,
2009; Thong, Hong, & Tam, 2002), rarely has research been conducted to determine whether
RTC has a direct effect on individuals’ behavioral intention to use a technology. Sargent,
Hyland, and Sawang (2012) extended the UTAUT construct by adding RTC to study factors
affecting the behavioral intention to adopt a document control system. However, while they
found that RTC did not play a role in document control system adoption, this factor should not
be ignored. RTC should be tested to determine whether to confirm or to disregard it as a
determinant of behavioral intention. Thus, the fifth hypothesis (H5) states that resistance to
change will have a significant direct effect on behavioral intention.
3.4.6

Altruism (ALT)
Altruism refers to “satisfaction in helping others through knowledge sharing” (Kim,

2008, p. 20). An individual’s altruism is driven by his interest in making his work easily
accessible and the expectation that other researchers, particularly ones who have limited access,
will benefit from that work. This factor was identified as one of the motivating factors in selfarchiving behavior in general open access venues and as one of the factors influencing faculty to
contribute their work to their university IRs. However, Kim’s (2008) study was conducted only
within the American research university context; this factor also has never been tested in other
studies. Using this factor to study faculty members in different situations and contexts might give
different results that may help to expand knowledge in this area. For the present study, altruism

65

will be studied to determine whether it has a direct effect usage behavior. Based on the findings
from the previous study, the sixth hypothesis (H6) states that altruism will have a significant
direct effect on actual usage of IRs.
3.4.7

Copyright Concerns (CCs)
From the literature, we can see that copyright concerns (CCs) are frequently cited as a

major barrier to self-archiving and to IR contribution (Casey, 2012; Creaser et al., 2010; Kim,
2007, 2008, 2010, 2011; Singeh et al., 2013b; Swan & Brown, 2005; Xia et al., 2012). Copyright
concerns have been mentioned by both researchers practicing self-archiving and those who do
not practice self-archiving (Singeh et al., 2013b). In addition, Kim (2008, 2010, 2011) found that
IR contributors were more concerned about this issue than were those considered IR noncontributors in her studies. However, CCs present a contradictory issue in Kim’s (2008, 2010)
studies. Kim found that CCs had a negative effect on the faculty members’ self-archiving
behavior in general publicly accessible sources, while CCs were found to have a positive effect
on faculty members’ contribution to their university IRs. Also, the odds ratio in her study
indicates that “professors who have greater concerns about copyright issues are more likely to
contribute to IRs” (Kim, 2010, p. 252). It is of interest to study this factor and determine if it can
be used to explain faculty members’ behavioral intention to use IRs and their usage behavior of
IRs in the Thai context. Thus, the seventh hypothesis (H7) states that copyright concerns will
have a significant direct effect on actual usage of IRs.
3.4.8

Trust toward IRs (TTIRs)
Trust is viewed as a critical element of the digital repository infrastructure (Prieto, 2009).

Kim (2008, 2011) viewed trust as a contextual factor associated with faculty self-archiving in
IRs and defined it as “the extent to which professors perceive readers’ good intentions and

66

competence in using self-archived materials” (Kim, 2008, p. 76). There are two aspects related to
studying trust: 1) the participants’ attitudes toward the end-users of their self-archived materials
and 2) the participants’ trust regarding the way in which their institutions have maintained the
publicly accessible IRs. Professors who have stronger trust in users and institutions are more
inclined to self-archive in IRs. The interview data from Kim’s study make possible a more indepth understanding of trust toward IRs. On one hand, trust is related to the professors’ concerns
about the improper use of their self-archived materials. For example, issues such as fear of
plagiarism and users’ misinterpretation of research work were mentioned. On the other hand,
long-term preservation is another issue related to trust. Yoon (2014) found that repository
processes or data curation processes (documentation, data cleaning, and quality checking) are
one of the factors influencing users’ trust in digital repositories.
These curating processes ensure the quality of work and long-term preservation of work
deposited in the depositories. The quality of work deposited in IRs has been cited as a major
concern by participants in many studies and is considered a major factor related to users’
contribution (Dulle, 2010; Park & Qin, 2007; Singeh et al., 2013a,b; van Westrienen & Lynch,
2005). For instance, Dulle (2010) found that some authors in IR and OA studies mentioned that
they did not use articles published in IRs and open access journals due to the lack of quality
control of the content. In addition, some scholars in other studies have expressed concern that the
low quality of some material in a repository could somehow taint their own research (Casey,
2012; Davis & Connolly, 2007). This issue affects those scholars’ decisions to publish or not to
publish their work in IRs. Thus, the repository processes and quality of work were taken into
account in the present study through the addition of more survey items regarding repository

67

processes in the TTIR factors. Based on the literature, the eighth hypothesis (H8) in this study
states that TTIRs will have a significant direct effect on actual usage of IRs.
3.4.9

Facilitating Conditions (FCs)
According to Venkatesh et al. (2003), the term facilitating conditions (FCs) refers to “the

degree to which an individual believes that an organizational and technical infrastructure exists
to support use of the system” (p. 453). This factor is conceptualized as “perceived behavioral
control (Theory of Planned Behavior); facilitating condition (Model of PC Utilization); and
compatibility (Innovation Diffusion Theory)” (Venkatesh et al., 2003, p. 453). The authors also
suggest that the facilitating conditions will become insignificant in predicting usage intention
when both effort expectancy and performance expectancy are present. According to the model,
facilitating conditions have a significant direct effect on usage behavior. It has been postulated
that the usage of technology depends on the availability of an enabling environment for its
application. The availability of technology and other issues related to technology have been
considered as facilitating conditions for IR and open access adoption (Ambruster, 2011; Dulle,
2010; Duranceau & Kriegsman, 2013). In some geographical areas, such as Africa and Asia,
technological issues contribute to the slow adoption of IRs and open access (Dulle, 2010;
Hirwade & Rajyalakshmi, 2006).
Previous studies in a variety of contexts support the UTAUT expectation that facilitating
conditions will have a significant positive direct effect on usage behavior (Dulle, 2010; Dulle &
Minishi-Majanja, 2011). Dulle (2010) and Dulle and Minishi-Majanja (2011) found that
facilitating conditions were a factor influencing Tanzanian researchers’ usage behavior of open
access outlets. According to the UTAUT model, it is expected that facilitating conditions are a
significant key determinant of individual usage behavior with regard to institutional repositories.

68

For this study, the ninth (H9) hypothesis states that facilitating conditions will have a significant
direct effect on IR usage behavior.
3.4.10 Behavioral Intention (BI)
Based on the UTAUT model, Venkatesh et al. (2003) suggested that behavioral intention
or usage intention has a significant positive effect on an individual usage of a particular
technology. This statement has been confirmed in many empirical studies regarding technology
acceptance in many contexts (Boonsong, 2013; Dulle, 2010; Dulle & Minishi-Majanja, 2011). In
the context of the Web-based learning system, Boonsong (2013) found that usage intention had a
positive effect on the usage behavior of instructors in the Department of Education at the
Rajabhat Universities in Thailand. Dulle and Minishi-Majanja (2011) also confirmed that usage
intention was the strongest factor affecting Tanzanian researchers’ usage behavior of open access
outlets. Thus, the tenth hypothesis (H10) states that faculty members’ behavioral intention will
have a positive direct effect on their usage behavior.
The summary of the main constructs (factors) of the proposed research model and a
summary of the hypotheses are presented in Table 3.2. Each construct (factor) in the proposed
research model can be measured by the use of three to seven items presented as statements,
followed by 5-point Likert scales in the questionnaire. Items corresponding to each factor were
adapted from previous studies, mainly from Vankatest et al. (2003), Dulle (2010), and Kim
(2008, 2011). Each factor and its corresponding items are presented in Chapter 4.

CHAPTER 4
RESEARCH DESIGN
4.1

Introduction
This chapter explains the ways in which the theoretical models have been broken down

into concepts and how the research instrument was developed. This chapter includes an overview
of the research design, as well as a description of the faculty members who participated in the
study, the instrument items, the data collection and analysis procedures, and the statistical
analysis methods.
The primary propose of this study was to determine the factors affecting faculty
acceptance and use of university-based institutional repositories in Thailand. The study aimed to
explore the relationships among and the relative importance of factors that influence a user’s
behavioral intention to accept and use IRs. It attempts to answer the following research
questions:
RQ1: To what extent do faculty members in Thai research universities accept and use
institutional repositories?
RQ2: What are the factors that affect faculty members’ acceptance and use of
institutional repositories in the Thai research university context?
RQ3: To what extent do these factors affect faculty members’ acceptance and use of
institutional repositories (IRs) in the Thai research university context?
4.2

Research Design
This study employed a mixed methods design to understand faculty members’ acceptance

and use of Institutional Repositories in the Thai research university context. My intent was to
explore the relationships among and the relative important of factors that influence a user’s
behavioral intention to accept and use IRs by using a combination of quantitative and qualitative
methods.

71

The mixed methods design included the following components:
1) A quantitative method was used to determine the factors affecting faculty acceptance
and use of IRs and the relation of each factor that affected the faculty members’ behavioral
intention and use behavior. The quantitative method allowed for generalization.
2) A qualitative method of content analysis was used to extend the findings from the
quantitative methods. That method helped the researchers gain in-depth understanding of the
phenomena identified in the quantitative part. Also, it allowed the researcher to study the
participants’ views of institutional repositories and open access in depth. It also allowed for
gathering the participants’ suggestions and comments about institutional repositories.
The mixed methods research design used in this study was “validating the quantitative
data model triangulation” (Creswell & Clark, 2010, p.65). This research design is a
methodological triangulation research design. According to Teddlie & Tashakkori (2009),
researchers employ more than one research method and data collection technique in this form of
triangulation research design. For this study, the researcher employed a QUAN+QUAL, in which
more weight was placed on quantitative data, and tried to collect different but complementing
data using both quantitative and qualitative methods. A quantitative method was used to
determine the factors affecting faculty acceptance and use of IRs and the relation of each factor
that affected the faculty members’ behavioral intention and usage behavior. While the
quantitative method allowed for generalization, the follow up semi-structured interview with
some participants allowed the researcher to study faculty members’ acceptance and use of IRs
and the reasons behind those factors in more detail.

72

4.3

Population and Sample

4.3.1

Population
The target population for this study included all of the faculty members of selected

research universities in Thailand. While IRs have been accepted and implemented by many
universities around the world, particularly in North America, Europe, and some Asian countries,
not all universities in Thailand provide IRs, and this includes some of the research universities.
There are 144 higher education institutions in Thailand. Among those higher education
institutions, there are nine research universities, six of which have operated IRs, and among
those only a few are open-access. Research universities were selected since some of them have
institutional repositories in place. The other criterion for selection was the approximate year that
an IR became operational, since the year of operation can be used to determine the stage of
institutional repository development and deployment, which is important in any evaluation of
IRs (Thibodeau, 2007). Although it has been stated that there were six research universities
operating IRs, the number of participating repositories for the present study were four
institutions. These institutions were considered as early adopters of IRs.
Two university-based IRs, Khon Kaen University Institutional Repository (KKUIR) and
Thammasat University Publications Knowledge-Based, did not meet the selection criteria.
Responding to the email question, the reference librarian of the KKU library stated that the KKU
library did not officially and fully implement the KKUIR. Therefore, the faculty members might
not have known about the existence of KKUIR and would not have been able to participate in
this study (KKU Librarian, personal communication, February, 2016). In the other case,
Thammasat University library had developed the TU Publications Knowledge-Based using
DSpace in 2008. The purpose of TU Publication Knowledge-Based was for knowledge

73

management and the collection of data on faculty members’ scholarly publications, and amost of
the works had been done by librarians. The TU library did not promote Thammasat University
Publications Knowledge-Based, nor did they allow self-archiving. By the end of 2015, the library
had stopped adding content to the TU Publication Knowledge-Based and moved all content
collected before 2015 to new knowledge management system (Thammasat University Reference
librarian, personal communication, February 3, 2016). As of August 2016, the Thammasat
University Publications Knowledge-Based was used only for knowledge management for
Thammasat University Research and Consultancy Institute, the primary agency providing
research management and research consulting services on the behalf of the university. At the
time of this study, the content size had decreased from a total of 7,245 to 264 records
(Thammasat Univeristy Publications, 2016).
Based on the selection criteria, the population for this study was limited to faculty
members in four research universities located in different regions. Altogether, 8,399 faculty
members were currently teaching in the four research universities. This information was gathered
from a recent annual report or from the website of each university. Table 4.1 shows the
participating repositories and their relevant characteristics.

Samples
The target population for this study included all faculty members in research universities

in Thailand that had developed and implemented IRs, which was a total of 8,399 faculty
members across four universities located in three different regions. According to Krejcie and
Morgan (1970), the sample size representative of the population of 8,399 faculty members in this
study is 367. Table 4.2 shows the total number of faculty members broken down by universities
and the total numbers of the responses. Researchers suggest that an acceptable and adequate
response rate in social science research is approximately 50-60 % or larger (Nutly, 2008;
Richardson, 2005). Therefore, oversample surveys were sent out to obtain a larger response rate.

Instrumentation
The survey questions were developed based on the literature regarding institutional

repositories, self-archiving practices, and technology acceptance theories and were modified
based on the particular focus of this study. Specific questions were adapted from studies related

75

to technology acceptance (Venkatesh et al., 2003) and institutional repositories and selfarchiving behavior (Dulle, 2010; Dulle, Minish-Majanja, & Cloete, 2010; Kim, 2008).
4.4.1

Translation
To maintain equivalence between the English and Thai versions of the questionnaire, this

study adopted a back-translation procedure, which is the most common and highly recommended
procedure for translation of a questionnaire (Brislin, Lonnerand, Thorndike, 1973; Chapman &
Carter, 1979). Brislin et al. (1973) recommend that an instrument be back-translated at least three
times, each time by a different translator. To translate the questionnaire instrument, three
bilingual experts—myself (interdisciplinary information science Ph.D. candidate), one Assistant
Professor (in Library and Information Science) who was Director of the Center of Academic
Resources at Chulalongkorn University, and one Ph.D. candidate from the University of
Glasgow—were involved in the forward and backward translation process. First, the English
version of the questionnaire was independently translated into the Thai language by each
translator, and then the translations were combined together to create the initial Thai version.
Second, the questionnaire was translated backward from Thai into English. Then the experts
compared the two versions of the questionnaire for concept equivalence, semantic equivalence,
and normative equivalence (Brislin et al., 1973). If an error was found, the item was retranslated.
This process was continued until the team of bilingual experts agreed that the questionnaires
were identical between the two versions and that there were no errors in meaning.
4.4.2

Questionnaire
The questionnaire consisted of three sections as follow:
Section 1 addressed faculty members’ awareness and usage of university-based IRs and

their self-archiving experience. Multiple-choice questions and open-ended questions were

76

employed.
Section 2 focused on factors affecting faculty members’ acceptance and use of
institutional repositories that could not be observed directly. The scales (questionnaire items)
used in this study were adopted from previous studies. The items in each construct were based on
items developed and validated in previous studies relating to technology acceptance, institutional
repositories, and self-archiving. For instance, some items in the questionnaires were from Oreg
(2003), Oreg et al. (2008), Nov and Ye (2009), Venkatesh et al. (2003), Kim (2008), Dulle
(2010), Dulle et al. (2010), and Boonsong (2014). Each item was phrased to suit the current
study context. In addition, some items were developed based on empirical studies in related
fields. Items (survey questions) in this section were grouped by constructs, following the main
constructs of the theoretical models.
This section consisted of a series of items using a 5-point Likert-scale, ranging from (1)
strongly disagree to (5) strongly agree. The items corresponding to each factor are presented in
Table 4.3 to Table 4.13.

After appropriate attributes and their represented items had been derived to suit the
research context, the final research instrument in Section 2 reflected 11 factors. Four factors,
effort expectancy (EE), performance expectancy (PE), social influence (SI), and facilitating
conditions (FCs), were derived from the integration of the UTAUT model (Venkatesh et al.,
2003) and the faculty’s self-archiving model (Kim, 2008; Kim, 2010). Altruism (ALT), trust
toward IRs (TTIRs), and copyright concerns (CCs) were derived from the Faculty’s SelfArchiving Model (Kim, 2008; Kim, 2010) and the literature on that model. The other two
factors, attitude (ATT) and resistance to change (RTC), were derived from the literature
regarding other technology acceptance theories. ATT was derived from the theory of reasoned
action (Davis, 1989; Devis et al., 1989) and the open access scholarly communication research
model (Dulle, 2010), and RTC was derived from resistance to adopt the innovation (Oreg, 2003;
Oreg et al., 2008) and digital library acceptance (Nov & Ye, 2008, 2009). The questionnaire in
Section 2 consisted of 48 items, including ATT (4 items), PE (6 items), EE (6 items), SI (6
items), RTC (4 items), ALT (3 items), CCs (4 items), TTIRs (4 items), FC (4 items), BI (3
items), and UB (4 items). Several items corresponding to certain factors were reverse coded.

82

Those were two items from effort expectancy (EE5 and EE6), one item from resistance to change
(RTC2), and three items from trust toward IRs (TTIRs1, TTIRs2, and TTIRs3).
Each of these factors was treated as a separate factor. ATT, PE, EE, SI, RTC were treated
as independent variables (or exogenous variables) of behavioral intention (BI). BI was treated as
an independent variable of behavioral intention (UB) along with other independent variables
including ALT, CCs, TTIRs, and FC.
The survey questions were grouped by the main constructs of the UTAUT model and the
faculty’s self-archiving model. Grouping questionnaire questions by constructs helps to reflect
the true picture. On the other hand, intermixing them may cause confusion and frustration and
may result in the introduction of more error into all of the questions. In addition, if the
respondents confuse the intermixed questions, it is likely that there will be lower reliability and
weaker relationships between constructs (Davis & Venkatesh, 1996). To prevent this, the
researcher decided to follow the procedure of grouping survey questions by constructs.
Section 3 was the demographic section of the questionnaire. This section consisted of 10
questions, regarding personal information such as gender, age, education, research discipline,
academic position, scholarly activity, number of articles published per year, and Internet usage
skills. At the end of the self-completion questionnaire, the participants were asked whether they
would be willing to participate in the follow-up semi-structured interview.
4.4.3

The Semi-Structured Interview
This phase of the study aimed to gain deeper understanding of the participants’ view of

institutional repository acceptance and use, as well as the reasons behind their contribution and
non-contribution. Also, their suggestions and comments on IRs were gathered. Some of the
questions were borrowed from Kim’s study (Kim, 2008) and were modified to suite the recent

83

study context. The interview protocol for participants who consider themselves as IR
contributors was slightly different from that for non-contributors. A draft of interview protocol
can be seen in Appendix C. Each participant was interviewed individually, and all interviews
were digitally recorded, transcribed, and translated into English. The interview script was
reviewed immediately after each interview section was finished. To ensure confidentiality,
neither the participants nor their institutions have been identified in the report on the study.
Member checking was employed by sharing interview transcripts with the participants and
having them read their interview transcripts to ensure that their thoughts were interpreted
accurately.
4.5

Pilot Study
The pilot study was conducted in November-December, 2015 for the purpose of ensuring

that the measurements were reliable in the target population and to improve the research process
by testing the survey instrument on a similar but smaller group of participants. Although items
corresponding to each factor had been tested in previous studies, there was a need to confirm the
instrument internal validity by conducting a pilot study in the present study context. The pilot
study also allowed for testing an additional item (TTIRs4) which had never been tested. This
item had been newly developed based on a qualitative empirical study. A pilot study was
conducted with a sample of 20 faculty members in two Thai public universities that were not
considered to be research universities. These universities had also developed and implemented
IRs. Out of 20, only five faculty members who were lecturers completed the survey. However,
none of the respondents had contributed to their university-based IR. The respondents provided
feedback about the survey regarding survey completion time, the clarity of direction, and the
wording of the survey. Then the self-administered questionnaire and interview protocol were

84

edited based-on the participants’ comments to ensure the validity of the resulting data. For
instance, some questions were rephrased due to the presence of grammatical errors. Some
duplicate statements were also deleted. The definition of institutional repositories, open access,
and self-archiving in the Thai language were included in the final version of the questionnaire to
facilitate understanding of the concepts. Some respondents who were not in the LIS field asked
for the clarification of these concepts, while one of the respondents in the LIS field mentioned
that even though she was in LIS, she had a hard time understanding some concepts relating to
self-archiving and IRs. This respondent also mentioned that the questionnaire seemed to be
directed to those who had self-archiving experience and had prior knowledge of open access and
institutional repositories.
4.6

Data Collection
The self-administered questionnaire was used for data gathering in this study. According

to Bryman (2008), the major issue and limitation of the Internet-based questionnaire is that not
everyone is online or has the technical ability to handle a questionnaire online. Also, there is
growing evidence that the online survey typically generates lower response rates than the mailed
questionnaire (Bryman, 2008). Therefore, both traditional mailed questionnaires and Internetbased questionnaires were used as data gathering tools in order to obtain a high response rate and
to avoid the limitations of the Internet-based questionnaire.
The survey invitation letters with the enclosed online survey links were distributed by
mail and email to 600 faculty members at four research universities from February-July 2016.
Two weeks following each mailing date, the following up e-mails were sent out. This process
continued for six months before the online survey was closed on July 31, 2016. The number of
survey responses originally submitted was 214, including incomplete responses. The incomplete

85

responses were deleted, leaving a total of 176 survey responses to be used for analysis.

The questionnaire provided a question asking whether the respondents would be willing
to participate in the follow-up semi-structured interview. The participants who indicated they
would be willing to participate in the semi-structured interview were asked to provide contact
information. A total of 26 respondents indicated that they agreed to participate in the interview.
Among them, six participants did not provide contact information. Therefore, the recruiting
emails were sent to 20 participants, only five of whom responded to the email. Semi-structured
interviews were conducted using Skype (3) and email (2) with five participants during May 19 August 20, 2016. It took approximately one hour to conduct the semi-structured interview using
Skype. All interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed. Three interviews were conducted
in English, while the other two interviews were conducted in Thai. Then the two interview
transcripts were translated into English.
4.7

Data Analysis Procedure

4.7.1

Quantitative Data Analysis Procedure
Survey results for all items were coded and imported into SPSS version 23.0 for data

86

cleaning and subsequent analysis. The collected data were assessed to provide an overview of the
sample, to determine the reliability of the measurement tool (questionnaire), and to test the
assumptions underlying the statistical technique used.
Descriptive statistics and inferential statistics were used for data analysis. A Chi-square
test was used to test whether there was a relationship among the categorical variables. As the
assumption of univariate normality was not met, the Kruskal-Wallis H test, a nonparametric test,
was used to determine if there were statistically significant differences between two or more
groups of independent variables on ordinal dependent variables (a 5-point Likert scale).
Additionally, the Mann-Whitney U test was also used as a post hoc procedure to evaluate
pairwise differences between two independent groups.
4.7.1.1 Data Screening
The first step of the data analysis was to examine the data. In total, 214 survey responses
were returned, including incomplete responses. In a procedure of casewise deletion, the empty
and incomplete responses were deleted, leaving a total of 176 survey responses to be used for
descriptive statistics on the demographic data and IR usage.
The data were then examined for the outliers from the influential data points before path
analysis was processed. Schumacker and Lomax (2004) define outliers as “data values that are
extreme or atypical on either the independent (X variables) or dependent variables (Y variables).
Since outliers could affect the mean, the standard deviation, and correlation coefficient values,
they should be explained, accommodated, or deleted” (p. 32).
There are two type outliers, univariate outliers and multivariate outliers. According to
Tabachnick and Fidell (2007), the univariate outliers are cases in which there is a high value on
one variable, whereas multivariate outliers are cases with unusual combinations of extreme

87

scores on more than one variable. For this study, both univariate outliers and multivariate outliers
were examined.
Univariate outliers are cases with very large standardized scores (z scores) on one or
more variables that are disconnected from other z scores. If a particular case has a standardized
score greater than 3.29 (p < .001, two tailed test), it has potential to be an outlier (Tabachnick &
Fidell, 2007). Based on this assumption, two cases (ID037 and ID170) were excluded from
further analysis. Then the Mahalanobis distance (D2) for every case was computed to detect
multivariate outliers. The D2 is “the distance of a case from the centroid of the remaining cases
where centroid is the point created at the intersection of the means of all the variables”
(Tabachnick & Fidell, 2007, p. 74). A case with a D2 value that lies outside and at a distance
from the other cases can be considered as an outlier (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2007). One case
(ID036) had D2 value (D2 = 68.05) that distinctively stood apart from the other cases. This case
was deleted as a multivariate outlier. In total, three cases were deleted, leaving 173 cases for
further analysis.
4.7.1.2 Scale Assessment
Scale assessment was conducted by using principle factor analysis and reliability analysis
(Cronbach’s coefficient alpha).
4.7.1.3 Principle Factor Analysis
This study employed the exploratory factor analysis (EFA) approach. According to
Matsunaga (2010), EFA is used “to identify a set of unobserved variable factors that reconstruct
the complexity of the observed data” (p. 98). EFA was conducted using principle factor analysis
(PFA) or principle axis factoring (PAF in SPSS) as a factor extraction method, since the
underlying assumption of this study was that latent factor(s) drive the observed variables.

88

Additionally, PAF is recommended as an extraction method for factor analysis “when the data
violate the assumption of multivariate normality” (p. 84) as in the current study (Costello &
Osborn, 2005 as cited in Yong & Pearce, 2013). After factors were extracted, the numbers of
components (factors) were retained based on theory. Velicer and Jackson (1990) suggested that if
the PAF is used for factor extraction, the numbers of factors can be retained based on prior
theory. A factor analysis was conducted for each scale; in total, 11 factors were conducted.
Results from factor analysis are presented in Chapter 5. The factor scores for each factor were
retained for use in the subsequent path analysis.
4.7.1.4 Reliability Analysis
Scale reliability refers to the internal consistency of responses that are provided by the
participants. According to Case (2007), reliability is presented if “…measures are repeated under
the same conditions and yield highly similar measurement each time” (p. 182). It is necessary to
assess the items’ and constructs’ reliability in a model that contains many constructs and
variables, as can be seen in the proposed research model (Figure 4.1).
Cronbach’s alpha coefficient was used to measure the internal consistency of multiple
items (variables) for a construct (factor). Cronbach’s alpha coefficient is considered the most
common measure of scale reliability (Kline, 2005). It has been used as a guideline in the process
of determining internal consistency in many studies (Alajmi, 2011; Dulle, 2010; Kim, 2008;
Kripanont, 2007; Orji, 2010). A Cronbach’s alpha value above 0.70 is considered acceptable, and
over 0.80 is good (Field, 2009). The Cronbach’s alpha values were used as the main basis for
judging items for deletion or retention.
Additionally, the item-to-total correlations were also examined to assess internal
consistency. Items with low corrected item-total correlation (less than .3) were dropped, as this

89

means a particular item does not correlate very well with the scale overall (Field, 2009). Once
poor items were removed from the scales, the overall Cronbach’s alpha was computed for each
scale. Table 4.15 presents the Cronbach’s alpha coefficients and item-to-total correlations.
Several items were dropped, including EE5, EE6, RTC2, and TTIRs4, to increase the reliability.
As shown in the table, the Cronbach’s alpha value for each construct was greater than .70. They
ranged from .72 for resistance to change (RTC) and trust toward IRs (TTIRs) to .91 for social
influence (SI). Additionally, item-to-total correlations were used to determine whether each item
exhibited measurement issues or did not correlate very well with other items in the same
construct. After deleting some items, all items had item-to-total correlations ranging from .40
to .86. All of them had item-to-total correlations above the minimum recommendation value
of .30. Results from the reliability test showed that all constructs had satisfactory reliability
values.

4.7.1.5 Validity
The validity of the instrument is the extent to which the data collection instrument
actually measures what the researcher intends to assess. For the present study, content validity
and construct validity were employed.
According to Kline (2005), content validity concerns the extent to which the test items
are representative of the given construct. For this study, content validity was achieved by
borrowing validated items from previous studies for the measurement of the research models, as
presented in Tables 4.3 to 4.13. Additionally, two experts in information science were asked to
provide judgments on the questionnaire (in Thai), particularly on items corresponding to each
construct in the second part of the questionnaire, concerning factors affecting faculty members’
acceptance and use of IRs. The content validity was also assessed through examination of results
from the pilot study.
Construct validity can be determined through the assessment of convergent validity
(Kripanont, 2007). According to Teddlie and Tashakkori (2009), convergent validity is “the
degree to which the measurement outcomes representing a construct agree [are consistent] with
other indicators of the same construct” (p. 208). For the current study, the Pearson’s correlation
matrix approach was used to assess the convergent validity of the 44-item survey instrument, in
particular 11 factors.
Table 4.16 presents correlations between the measure of each construct and a number of
other measures that should, theoretically, be associated with it. Results showed that the
behavioral intention variable was positively correlated with seven predictor variables, with
magnitude of correlation coefficients of 0.16 to 0.63. The predictor variables with the highest
correlation with behavioral intention were performance expectancy (r = 0.63, p < .01), altruism

91

(r = 0.61, p < .01), effort expectancy (r = 0.52, p < .01), attitude (r = 0.49, p < .01), facilitating
conditions (r = 0.46, p < .01), social influence (r = 0.38, p < .01), and trust toward IRs (r = 0.16,
p < .05). Usage behavior was positively correlated with seven predictor variables. The
magnitude of the correlation coefficients was in the range of 0.33 to 0.62, indicating a medium to
high correlation. The predictor variables with the highest correlation with usage behavior were
behavioral intention (r = 0.62, p < .01), followed by performance expectancy (r = 0.54, p < .01),
altruism (r = 0.52, p < .01), effort expectancy (r = 0.50, p < .01), attitude (r = 0.49, p < .01),
social influence (r = 0.49, p < .01), and facilitation conditions (r = 0.33, p < .01). These
correlations evidenced good convergent validity.

4.7.1.6 Path Analysis
This study utilized a path analysis to address the second research question “What are the
factors that affect faculty members’ acceptance and use of institutional repositories in the Thai
research university context?” Path analysis is a method for studying the direct and indirect
effects of variables. It is not a method for discovering causes; rather, it can be used to test the

92

relationships among variables (Kline, 2005; Schumacker & Lomax, 2004). Path analysis is a
useful method for examining the web of relationships among observed variables (exogenous
variables) and unobserved variables (endogenous variables). According to Hackett (1985, as
cited in Sherven, 2016), path analysis consists of three stages. The first is the development of the
path model. Then the path coefficients are computed to identify and eliminate non-significant
paths in the original model. The final process is to specify a reduced path model and determine
whether the just-identified model fits the data.
For this study, a path analysis was used to evaluate the contribution of the combination of
paths to the overall fit of the structural model. Precisely, it was used to examine the explanatory
power of nine exogenous variables in relation to two endogenous variables, as presented in
Figure 4.1. The exogenous variables included 1) attitude toward IRs (ATT); 2) performance
expectancy (PE); 3) effort expectancy (EE); 4) social influence (SI); 5) resistance to change
(RTC); 6) altruism (ALT); 7) copyright concerns (CCs); 8) trust toward IRs (TTIRs); and 9)
facilitating condition (FC). Endogenous variables included behavioral intention (BI) and usage
behavior (UB). BI had dual roles; specifically, BI was accounted for by five factors (ATT, PE,
EE, SI, and RTC), and it also served as a predictor of the usage behavior (UB) along with other
independent variables including ALT, CCs, TTIRs, and FC. In the proposed research model,
there were five different indirect effects. For instance, one corresponded to the path ATT  BI
 UB, indicating that attitude toward IRs affected faculty behavioral intention to use IRs, which
in turn influenced their actual usage.

Qualitative Data Analysis Procedure
Once the data gathering process had been completed, qualitative data from the interview

scripts were transcribed, coded, and analyzed to identify themes. Basic content analysis was used
for analyzing the qualitative data. The goal of the analysis was to gain an in-depth understanding
of the faculty’s acceptance and use of IRs, their self-archiving practice, and barriers that affected
their use or non-use of IRs. Moreover, the analyzed data from the qualitative part was used to
support the analyzed data from the quantitative part to yield the results of the study.

CHAPTER 5
DATA ANALYSIS AND RESEARCH FINDINGS
The present study investigated the factors affecting faculty acceptance and use of
institutional repositories in Thailand. While the survey data captured statistical details about the
faculty acceptance and use of IRs, the interview data yielded more in-depth explanations of the
subjects’ behavior and the reasons behind their contributions or delays in contributing to IRs.
The results from the survey are reported first, followed by those from the semi-structured
interviews.

Quantitative Data Analysis

5.1.1

Demographic Information
The target population for this study was faculty members in four research universities in

Thailand. All of the institutions had implemented institutional repositories. The total population
for this study was 8,399, and the sample size representative of the total population was 367. A
total of 600 questionnaires were distributed to faculty members in four research universities in
Thailand. The number of survey responses originally returned was 214, including incomplete
responses. The overall response rate was 36% (214 out of 600 recipients). Using casewise
deletion, the empty and incomplete responses were deleted, leaving a total of 176 survey
responses to be used for analysis.
In this section, the descriptive statistics on the survey participants are presented. This
study included eight items relating to demographic information on the respondents: gender, age,
education, research discipline, academic position, scholarly activity, number of articles published
per year, and Internet usage skills.

95

Table 5.1 presents demographic information on the respondents. The total number of
respondents in this study was 176 faculty members from four research universities in Thailand,
including Chulalongkorn University (CU) (n = 48), Mahidol University (MU) (n = 68), Prince of
Songkla University (PSU) (n = 49), and Suranaree University of Technology (SUT) (n = 11).
The number of respondents from SUT was very small due to the small size of the university and
the small size of the total population of SUT, which was only 374 faculty members. The
participants included 99 (56.2%) females and 77 (43.8%) males. The demographic data show an
interesting range in the participants’ ages. The distribution of the respondents by age reveals that
the age of the respondents ranged from 25 to 66 years. The largest number of the respondents
(84, 47.7%) was aged 25-39 years, followed by 40-49 years (58, 33.0%) and 50 years and over
(24, 13.6%); the remaining ten participants (5.7%) did not report their age.
In terms of the participants’ highest academic qualifications, more than three-fourths
(138, 79.5%) had earned doctoral degrees, while the remainder had Master’s degrees (35,
19.9%). Only one respondent had a Bachelor degree (1, 0.6%).
With regard to academic position, more than half of the participants were instructors and
lecturers (101, 57.4%), followed by assistant professors (48, 27.3%), associate professors (21,
11.9%), professors (3, 1.7%), and researchers (3, 1.7%). For the current study, lecturers and
instructors were considered as faculty members in the Thai higher education context. This group
represents the largest group among the respondents. As in the current study, in a survey of a
technology acceptance model of Internet usage by academics at Thai business schools, Kripanont
(2007) also found that most of the respondents were instructors and lecturers.

The largest number of faculty members were from other sciences and technology (71, 40.3%),
including seven sub disciplines: engineering and computer science (n = 25), life sciences and
biological sciences (n = 14), agricultural sciences (n = 12), environmental science (n = 7),
physical science (n = 7), science and technology (n = 5) and renewable energy (n = 1). The
numbers of faculty members in the humanities and social sciences and in the medical and health
sciences were nearly the same at 50 (28.4%) and 49 (27.8%), respectively. The fifty faculty
members in the humanities and social sciences were from library and information science (n =
8), business and management (n = 7), jurisprudence (n = 7), fine art and architectural art (n = 5),
psychology and behavioral science (n = 5), economics (n = 3), linguistics (n = 3), political
science (n = 2), and social studies (n = 1). The forty-nine faculty members in the medical and
health sciences were from pharmacy (n = 14), nursing (n = 8), medical science (n = 7), health
science (n = 7), biomedical science and biomedical engineering (n = 3), veterinary medicine (n =
2), dentistry/oral biology (n = 2), physical therapy (n = 2), tropical medicine (n = 2),
epidemiology (n = 1), and immunology (n = 1). It should be noted that six (3.4%) participants
did not indicate their disciplines; therefore, they were excluded from future analysis and treated
as missing values in the discussion of research disciplines.
In the area of scholarly activities carried out by the respondents in the past year, the
majority of the respondents (97, 55%) reported having served as a referee or a reviewer of a
journal, followed by those who had been an author of a journal article (78, 44.3%) or had served
as an editorial board member for a journal (28, 15.9%), as presented in Table 5.3. Among the
participants who selected “other” (47, 26.7%), 40 stated that none of the scholarly activities
listed applied to them, whereas seven respondents did not provide additional information
regarding their current scholarly activities. Interestingly, more than three-fourths of the

99

respondents (136, 77.3%) indicated that they had published at least 1-2 articles per year, while
only 26 (14.8%) of the respondents stated that they had never published any papers. Only one
professor indicated that he had published more than five articles per year.

Regarding Internet usage skills in accessing and disseminating scholarly information, the
respondents were asked to self-rate their Internet usage skills. The scale represented the
respondent’s level of confidence, ranged from one to five. One (strongly disagree) represented
no confidence at all, and five (strongly agree) indicated high confidence. Table 5.4 presents
respondents’ Internet usage skills for accessing and disseminating scholarly information. Based
on the mean scores, it appears that all statements received responses of agreement, ranking from
“I feel confident in searching and accessing for scholarly information on the Internet” (M = 4.17,
SD = .67), followed by “I feel confident in publishing and disseminating scholarly information
on the Internet” (M = 3.77, SD = .83), “I feel confident in publishing on the Internet whether

100

there is no one around to show me how to do it” (M = 3.58, SD = .93), and “I feel confident in
creating and editing my personal website” (M = 3.52, SD = .93).

The Kruskal-Wallis H tests with the age, discipline, and academic position categories as
independent variables were conducted to see whether there were statistically significant
differences among group in-term of Internet usage skills. Ten participants who did not verify
their age and discipline were excluded from the analysis. Table 5.5 presents results from the
Kruskal-Wallis H test. Regarding age, the Kruskal-Wallis H test showed that there was a
significant difference across age groups in the first statement, “I feel confident in searching and
accessing for scholarly information on the Internet,” H(2) = 7.11, p = .029, with a mean rank of
86.25 for faculty members whose age 25-39 years, 88.42 for those who were 40-49 years, and
61.91 for respondents whose age 50 years and over. Mann-Whitney test were conducted to
evaluate pairwise differences among the three groups. The result of this test indicated that faculty
members aged 50 years and over expressed significantly lower agreement in-term of confidence
in searching and accessing scholarly information on the Internet than those who were 25-39
years (U = 711.50, p = .013, r = - 0.23) and 40-49 years (U = 476.00, p = .012, r = - 0.27). This

101

indicates that the level of confidence in searching for and accessing scholarly information on the
Internet varies by age. With regard to discipline and academic position, the Kruskal-Wallis H test
showed that there was no significant difference in terms of Internet usage skills across discipline
and academic position in all statements. It can be concluded that the respondents’ Internet usage
skills in the areas of accessing and disseminating scholarly information were not statistically
significantly different across disciplines and academic positions.

IR Awareness and Usage
This study also sought to determine whether faculty members in Thai research

universities accept and use institutional repositories, particularly university-based institutional
repositories. The respondents were asked whether they had been aware of institutional
102

repositories (or knowledge banks in the Thai research university context) developed by their
institutions before participating in this study, and how they had been informed about them.
Table 5.6 shows data on faculty members’ awareness of IRs by discipline. The Chi-square test
shows that there was no statistically significant relationship between research discipline and
whether faculty members were aware of IRs, χ2 (2, N = 170) = 3.16, p = .206. The larger
proportion of faculty members in all research disciplines indicated that they had been aware of
university-based IRs developed by their universities. Overall, 82% (n = 41) of faculty member
from the humanities and social sciences had been aware of university-based IRs, followed by
71.4% (n = 33) of faculty members from the medical and health sciences and 67.60% of faculty
members from other science and technology fields. By contrast, a smaller proportion of
respondents in all disciplines, including other science and technology fields (32.40%, n = 23),
the medical and health sciences (28.60%, n = 14), and the humanities and social sciences (18%, n
= 9) had not been aware of university-based IRs.

Table 5.7 presents data on faculty members’ awareness of IRs by academic position.
Among the 176 participants, 129 (73%) of the respondents stated that they had been aware of
institutional repositories; the remaining 47 (27%) participants had not been aware of them.
Fisher’s exact test yielded p = .075, indicating that there was no statistically significant
103

association between academic position and whether or not faculty members had been aware of
institutional repositories. It appears that while none of the full professors had been aware of IRs,
the greater proportion of respondents in other academic positions, including 100% (n = 3) of
researchers, 76.20% (n = 77) of instructors and lecturers, 71.40% (n = 15) of associate
professors, and 70.80% of assistant professors, indicated that they had been aware of the IRs
developed by their universities. A smaller proportion of faculty members in all academic
positions indicated that they had not been aware of them.

With regard to how the faculty members had heard about IRs, the majority of respondents
(93, 29.3%) indicated that they had heard about IRs from IR staff members and librarians,
followed by the library/university websites (91, 28.0%), and colleagues (45, 14.0%), as shown in
Table 5.8. Beside the ways presented in Table 5.8, 26 (8.0%) respondents also mentioned some
other ways through which they had heard about IRs. Three respondents mentioned that they had
accidentally found their university-based IRs while they were carrying out Google searches.
Three respondents had learned about IRs via personal contact by email. Two participants
indicated that they had learned about their university-based IRs while taking the survey for the

104

current study. One faculty member mentioned that she was a co-founder and served on the
committee for the university’s IR project. The remaining 17 participants stated that they had not
had any information about IRs before participating in the current study.

IR Contributors and Non-Contributors
The present study also aimed to investigate whether the faculty members had deposited

their work in IRs. Although nearly three-fourths of the respondents (129, 73%) indicated that
they had been aware of IRs, only one-fourth of the respondents (44, 25%) had deposited their
work into IRs. Interestingly, 132 (75%) respondents had never deposited any of their work in a
university-based IR. A Chi-square test with awareness of IRs, academic position, and discipline
category as independent variables was conducted to see whether there were any relationship
between these categorical variables and depositing of content.
Table 5.9 shows data on IR contributors and non-contributors by respondents’ awareness
of IRs. The Chi-square test showed that there was a statistically significant relationship between

105

the respondents’ awareness of IRs and whether they contributed to the university-based IRs, χ2
(1, N = 176) = 5.12, p = .024, ϕ = .17.
While only 29.5% (n = 38) of respondents who had been aware of IRs had contributed,
the greater portion of them (70.5%, n = 91) had never deposited any work and considered
themselves as non-contributors. About 87% (n = 41) of the respondents who had not been aware
of IRs had never deposited any work, compared to 12.8% (n = 6) of respondents who had not
been aware of university-based IRs, but had deposited their work. Interestingly, most of the
contributors (38 out of 44, 86.4%) were faculty members who had been aware of IRs, as
compared to six (13.6%) respondents who had not been aware of IRs but who considered
themselves as contributors. It can be implied from results of the Chi-square test that faculty
members who had been aware of IRs were more likely to contribute and deposit their work.

Table 5.10 presents data on IR contributors and non-contributors by discipline, a chisquare test indicates that there was no statistically significant relationship between discipline and
whether faculty members contributed to university-based IRs, χ2 (2, N = 170) = .27, p = .903. It
is clear that the greater proportion of faculty members in all academic disciplines considered
themselves as non-contributors. In total, 74.0% (n = 126) of the respondents were noncontributors, as compared to 26.0% (n = 44) contributors. Those who were non-contributors

106

included 76.0% (n = 54) of faculty members from other science and technology fields, followed
by 73.5% (n = 36) of faculty members from the medical and health sciences and 72.0% (n = 36)
from the humanities and social sciences. Those who considered themselves as IR contributors
included 28.0% (n = 14) faculty members from the humanities and social sciences, 26.5% (n =
13) faculty members from the medical and health sciences, and 24.0% (n = 17) faculty members
from other science and technology fields.
When IR contributors from other science and technology disciplines and those from the
medical and health sciences are combined, the results show that faculty members from science
disciplines make up the overwhelming majority of IR contributors (30 out of 44, 68%),
compared with faculty members from the humanities and social sciences (14 out of 44, 32%).

Table 5.11 presents data on IR contributors and non-contributors by academic position.
The Fisher’s exact test yields p = .401, indicating that there was no statistically significant
relationship between academic position and whether or not faculty members contributed to
university-based IRs. The greater proportion of faculty members in all academic positions
considered themselves as non-contributors, including 100% of professors (n = 3), followed by
77.2% (n = 78) of instructors and lecturers, 72.9% (n = 35) of assistant professors, 71.4% (n =
15) of associate professors, and 33.3% (n = 1) of researchers. Among those who considered
107

themselves as contributors were 66.7% (n = 2) of researchers, 28.6% (n = 6) of associate
professors, 27% (n = 13) of assistant professors, and 22.8% (n = 23) of instructors and lecturers.
It is interesting that none of the professors had contributed to university-based IRs although one
of them had published more than five papers a year.

5.1.3.1 Content Types
As shown in Figure 5.1, among the 44 respondents who considered themselves to be IR
contributors, the largest number had deposited theses and/or dissertations (21, 47.7%), followed
by journal articles (17, 38.6% (pre-refereed articles n = 15 and final versions of refereed articles
n = 2) and research reports and technical reports (15, 34.1%). It is noteworthy that only one
participant had made a conference presentation available. Three respondents also mentioned that
they had deposited other work in university-based IRs, including abstracts (2) and a senior
project (1). The choice of data set was also on the survey; however, none of the IR contributors
had made a data set available to a university-based IR. The respondents were allowed to choose
multiple answers.

Figure 5.1. Types of content that the IR contributors had made available in university-based IRs.
Table 5.12 shows that out of 44 IR contributors, the majority of them (22, 37.3%) had
self-archived their work. The participants also identified others who were currently involved in
the content deposition process. Those included department staff members (20, 33.9%), librarians
and library staff members (9, 15.3%), and assistants and teaching assistants (4, 6.8%). Only one
IR contributor indicated that a colleague had helped them to deposit work into the universitybased IR. In addition, three IR contributors (3, 5.1%) mentioned others who had helped them in
the content deposition process, including the graduate school staff (2) and the faculty member’s
research unit staff (1).

The participants were asked about the last time that they had deposited their work in a
university-based IR so that it would be possible to ascertain their most recent contribution; the
largest number (17, 38.6%) indicated that the last time they had deposited their work was
approximately 1-6 months previously, followed by 7-12 months previously (7, 15.9%) and 1-2
years previously (4, 9.1%). However, a number of IR contributors (14, 31.8%) could not
remember when the last time they had deposited their work into a university-based IR had been,
as shown in Table 5.13. To sum up, it is clear that while the majority of the respondents were
currently making their work available through university-based IRs, some respondents were not
making any new contributions, as indicated by the fact that the last time they had deposited work
into the university-based IRs had been more than one year previously, and many of them also
could not remember when the last time they had deposited their work had been. This finding
suggests the university-based IRs were quite popular among the contributors.

5.1.3.2 IR Non-Contributors
Among the 132 non-contributors, 56 (42.4%) indicated that they would be willing to
deposit their work in university-based IRs in the near future, while 23 (17.4%) said they would

110

not be willing to deposit their work. It is interesting that more than one third (53, 40.2%)
remained uncertain about whether to contribute to university-based IRs.
The chi-square test for independence was used to determine differences in responses
across three research disciplines. As shown in Table 5.14, the Chi-square test indicates that there
was no statistically significant relationship between discipline and whether IR non-contributors
were willing to contribute to university-based IRs, χ2 (4, N = 126) = .58, p = .965. A greater
proportion of respondents in the medical and health science (44.4%, n = 16) and other science
and technology field (42.6%, n = 23) reported that they had not made any decision about whether
to contribute to university-based IRs as compared to those who indicated that they would be
willing to contribute, including 15 (41.7%) from the medical and health sciences and 21 (38.9%)
from other science and technology fields. Different from other disciplines, a greater proportion
of respondents in the humanities and social sciences (44.4%, n = 16) reported that they would be
willing to contribute to university based IRs, as compared to 38.9% (n = 14) of those who had
not made any decision regarding whether to contribute. The other respondents who did not want
to contribute to university-based IRs included 18.5% (n = 10) of faculty members from other
science and technology fields, followed by 16.7% (n = 6) of faculty members from the
humanities and social sciences and 13.9% (n = 5) of faculty members from the medical and
health sciences. It is clear that the greatest portion of respondents 42.0% (53 out of 126) had not
decided whether to contribute to university-based IRs. If these groups of respondents had had a
clearer picture about IRs and seen the benefit of the contribution, they might have changed their
minds and made a contribution.

Regarding academic positions, among the 132 non-contributors, 42.40% (n = 56)
reported that they would be willing to contribute, as compared to 17.40% (n = 23) of noncontributors who did not want to contribute at all, as shown in Table 5.15. Approximately 40.2%
(n = 53) of non-contributors had not made any decision about whether to contribute to
university-based IRs. The result from the Fisher’s exact test, p = .326, indicates that there was no
statistically significant relationship between academic position and whether non-contributors
would be willing to contribute to university-based IRs. As shown in Table 5.16, the noncontributors who indicated that they would be willing to contribute to university-based IRs were
100% (n = 1) of researchers, followed by 46.0% (n = 36) of instructors and lecturers, 40.0% (n =
6) of associate professors, and 37.0% (n = 13) of assistant professors. It is interesting that none of
the full professors indicated they would be willing to contribute. Other non-contributors, who
answered that they did not want to contribute, were 20.0% (n = 2) of associate professors, 18.0%
(n = 14) of instructors and lecturers, and 11.0% (n = 4) of assistant professors. The others, who
remained uncertain, were 52.0% (n = 18) of assistant professors, 40.0% (n = 6) of associate
professors, 36.0% (n = 28) of instructors and lecturers, and 33.3% (n = 1) of professors.

Some respondents who were not willing to deposit their work and some who remained
uncertain indicated their reasons and concerns about university-based IRs. Those reasons were
translated, grouped, and presented as statements. Table 5.16 presents respondents’ reasons for
not contributing. Sixteen (out of 23, 7%) provided a variety of reasons to support why they did
not want to contribute to university-based IRs. The three most common reasons, mentioned by
equal numbers of respondents (3, 11%), were that they did not have any work to deposit in the
university-based IRs, that there were no submission guidelines, and that there was a lack of
information about the university-based IRs. A respondent from Bioinformatics stated, “I do not
have sufficient information about the deposition process. I think learning how to self-archive
takes additional time and effort” (ID009). The other reasons included concerns about their own
work (n = 2), perceived absence of benefit (n = 2), not being required to do it (n = 2), there being
no mandate policy (n = 1), preferring to publish only in prestigious journals (n = 1), preferring to
use other sources (n = 1), believing that self-archiving takes time and effort (n = 1), and
believing that other staff should be responsible for collecting faculty members’ work and
depositing it into the university-based IR (n = 1).

Note. Some participants provided more than one reason.
As shown in Table 5.17, only 32 of the respondents (out of 53) who were not sure
whether to contribute to the university-based IRs provided specific reasons and concerns. The
most common reason mentioned by respondents (12 out of 32, 19%) was that there were no
submission guidelines, followed by lack of information about the university-based IRs (6, 9.4%)
and the belief that other staff or units should responsible to collect and deposit the faculty’s work
(4, 6.3%). One respondent, who was a faculty member from Physical Therapy, stated “I don't
understand the importance of IRs. I do not have enough information regarding the depositing
process” (ID107). While other faculty members mentioned lack of information and did not know
whom they should contact if they wanted to deposit their work, one faculty member in Thai
Linguistics stated, “I don’t know how to deposit, particularly how to send the PDF file to the
library and whom should I contact” (ID151). Additionally, a faculty member from Chemistry,
who thought that other staff should be responsible for this work, said, “The faculty
administrative staff should be responsible for depositing the faculty’s work into the IR” (ID084).

114

Other reasons and concerns also mentioned by two to three respondents included that they
perceived no benefit (n = 3), depositing work into the university-based IRs was not a university
requirement (n = 3), they were concerned about the quality of their own work (n = 3), they were
concerned about plagiarism (n = 2), they were concerned about copyright (n = 2), there was no
mandate policy (n = 2), and deposition of work into the university-based IRs was not a highpriority task (n = 2).

Note. Some participants provided more than one reason.
Other reasons, mentioned by one respondent each, included that the respondent did not have any
work to deposit, the respondent did not know who the potential users would be, there was a lack
of technical support by the library, and the IR was redundant. A faculty member from Decision
sciences and engineering systems, who thought that the IR was redundant, stated “If I publish
something in a journal, the University should have it by default. I see no reason to do it. The IR

115

is redundant” (ID013). This finding is similar to that of Davis and Connolly’s (2007) study.
According to that study, the redundancy of Cornell’s DSpace with other modes of scholarly
communication as subject repositories led some faculty members to not deposit their work in it.
5.1.3.3 The Importance of IR Development
Table 5.18 presents the participants’ opinion on the importance of IR development by
their awareness of IRs. Result from the Chi-square test indicates were χ2 (1, N = 176) = 8.77, p
= .003, ϕ = -.22. This means that there was a statistically significant association between
respondents’ awareness of IRs and their opinions on the importance of IR development. Based
on results of the Chi-square test, respondents who had been aware of university-based IRs were
more likely to agree that the development of IRs is important, as compared to those who had not
been aware of IRs.

Clearly, the greater proportion of respondents who had been aware of IRs agreed that the
development of university-based IRs for archiving and disseminating scholarly work and
teaching materials was important. In total, 153 respondents agreed that the development of IRs
was important; they included 91.5% (n = 118) of respondents who had been aware of IRs and
74.5% (n = 35) of those who had not been aware of IRs. The smaller proportion of respondents
thought that the development of IRs was not important. Among this group, 25.5% (n = 12) had

116

not been aware of IRs, and 8.5% (n = 11) indicated that they had been aware of them but
disagreed that the development of IRs was important.
Taking research disciplines into consideration, Table 5.19 shows participants’ opinions
on the importance of the development of IRs for archiving and disseminating scholarly work and
teaching materials. The Chi-square test of independence shows that there was no statistically
significant association between disciplines and the participants’ opinions toward the importance
of IR development, χ2 (2, N = 170) = 2.85, p = .241. The findings show that a larger proportion
of the participants across all disciplines agreed that the development of IRs for archiving and
disseminating scholarly work and teaching materials is important. This group includes 94% (n =
46) of participants from the medical and health sciences, followed by 84.5% (n = 60) of faculty
members from other sciences and technology fields, and 84% (n = 42) of faculty members from
the humanities and social sciences. In contrast, the smaller proportion of respondents who
thought that the development of IRs was not important were 16% (n = 8) of respondents from the
humanities and social sciences, 15.5% (n = 11) of faculty members from other science and
technology fields, and 6% (n = 3) of respondents from the medical and health sciences.

Table 5.20 presents participants’ opinions on the importance of IR development by
academic position. In total, 87% (n = 153) of all respondents thought the development of IRs for
117

archiving and disseminating scholarly work and teaching materials was important, while only
13% (n = 23) of respondents thought that it was not important. A Fisher’s Exact Test was
conducted to examine the relationship between academic position and whether the faculty
members agreed with the importance of IR development. A Fisher’s exact test showed p = .001.
This means there was a statistically significant relationship between academic position and
whether the faculty members agreed with the importance of IR development.
As shown in Table 5.20, a higher proportion of faculty members across most academic
positions saw the importance of IR development; these included 100% (n = 3) of researchers,
followed by 96% (n = 46) of assistant professors, 87% (n = 88) of instructors and lecturers, and
76% (n = 16) of associate professors. By contrast, a smaller proportion of respondents in all
academic positions, with the exclusion of professors, thought that the development of IRs was
not important. It is interesting to note that none of the professors (100%, n = 3) thought that the
development of IRs was important. This may be the reason why this group of respondents
indicated that they did not want to contribute any of their work to university-based IRs. To be
precise, two of them indicated that they did not want to contribute, while the other did not know
whether to contribute to university-based IRs.

5.1.3.4 Review of Repository Content
The participants were asked whether they agreed or disagreed with the idea that all work
should undergo peer-review before being deposited into university-based IRs. Overall, two-thirds
of the respondents (118, 67%) agreed that all work should be peer reviewed before being
submitted to university-based IRs, while some respondents (58, 30%) disagreed with this idea.
Chi-square tests of independence were used to test the statistical significance of the relationships.
Table 5.21 shows the respondents’ agreement regarding the peer-review process for IR
content by their awareness of IRs. A Chi-square test revealed that there was no statistically
significant relationship between the respondents’ awareness of IRs and whether they agreed or
disagreed that any work should undergo peer-review before being deposited into the universitybased IRs, χ2 (1, N = 176) = .83, p = .363. This means the percentage of the respondents who
agreed with the peer-review process for IR content did not differ with respondents’ awareness of
IRs.

However, it is clear that the greater proportion of respondents who had been aware of IRs (69%,
n = 89) agreed that any work should undergo peer-review before being deposited into universitybased IRs, as compared to only 31% (n = 40) who reported that they did not agree with this idea.
The data also show that among those who disagreed that there should be a peer-review process

119

for IR content, the greater proportion was those who had not been aware of IRs (38.3%, n = 18),
as compared to 31% (n = 40) who had been aware of IRs.
Regarding disciplines, a Chi-square test of independence showed that there was no
statistically significant association between disciplines and whether the respondents agreed or
disagreed that there should be a peer-review process for IR content, χ2 (2, N = 170) = .75, p
= .687. It appears that percentage of the respondents’ agreement on the peer-reviewed process for
IR content did not vary by research discipline, as shown in Table 5.22. A greater proportion of
respondents across all disciplines agreed that any work should undergo peer-review before being
deposited into university-based IRs. Those who agreed on the need for peer-review process of IR
content were 70% (n = 35) of faculty members from the humanities and social sciences, followed
by 69.4% (n = 34) of respondents from the medical and health sciences and 63.4% (n = 45) of
faculty members from other sciences and technology fields. Among those who disagreed with
the need for a peer-review process for IR content, the greater proportion of respondents were
from other science and technology fields (36.6%, n = 26), as compared to 30.6% (n = 15) and
30% (n = 15) of respondents from the medical and health sciences and the humanities and social
sciences, respectively.

Table 5.23 presents the respondents’ agreement on the need for a peer-review process for
IR content by academic position. A Fisher’s Exact Test yielded p = .785, indicating that there
was no statistically significant relationship between academic position and whether the faculty
members agreed with the need for a peer-review process for IR content. It is clear that the greater
proportion of respondents across most academic positions, with the exception of researchers,
agreed that all work should undergo peer-review before being deposited into university-based
IRs. Approximately 71.4% (n = 15) of associate professors agreed with the need for a peerreview process, followed by 68.8% (n = 33) of assistant professors, 66.7% of both instructors
and lecturers (n = 67) and professors (n = 2), and 33.3% (n = 1) of researchers. Of those who
disagreed with the need for a peer-review process for IR content, the greater proportions of
respondents were from researchers (66.7%, n = 2), as compared to respondents in other academic
positions. Although the Fisher’s exact test showed that there was no statistically significant
association between academic position and whether the faculty members agreed with the need
for a peer-review process for IR content, the data indicate that the greater proportion of
respondents across academic positions agreed with the need for a peer-review process for IR
content.

Participants who agreed that all work should undergo a reviewing process before being
submitted were then asked to identify who should serve as reviewers for university-based IR
content. As shown in Table 5.24, the largest number of the respondents (52, 44%) agreed that a
faculty research committee should take this responsibility, followed by a university research
committee (26, 22%) and a departmental research committee (19, 16%). Five out of nine
participants who chose “others” also provided specific examples of particular groups that might
serve as reviewers of the content, including suggestions that experts from a professional
organization in a specific discipline should serve (n = 3), a departmental research committee
should work collaboratively with IR staff (n = 1), and the IR should accept materials that have
already been peer-reviewed by a journal or research grant (n = 1). The other four participants
simply stated that it depended on each submitted piece of work.

For the 42 participants who disagreed, 36 provided reasons to support their answers. The
reasons were translated, grouped, and presented as the statements found in Table 5.25. As shown
in Table 5.25, the most common reason that the participants mentioned was that the peer-review
was not necessary if the work had already been approved or peer-reviewed before being
deposited in the university-based IR. A faculty member from Accounting stated that “The peer

122

review is not necessary, since some pieces of work such as dissertations and theses have already
been approved by the dissertation committee and the graduate school” (ID041), while the other
faculty member, from Animal Nutrition and Reproduction, supported this idea by stating that “If
the main purpose of the university-based IR is to archive and disseminate intellectual work of
faculty members in the university community, the peer-review is not necessary” (ID042).
Table 5.25
Respondents’ Reasons for Disagreeing with the Need for Peer-Reviewing (N = 42)
Reason
Peer-review is not necessary
Peer-review is a time-consuming process
The peer-review process may demotivate faculty participation
IRs should be more open and accept a variety of works
IRs should accept only peer-reviewed works
Authors are responsible for the quality control over their works
Content recruitment policy is needed for quality control
It’s difficult to conduct peer-review process
Some work does not need to undergo peer-review process
Concern about the quality of peer review process of the university
Peer review may delay the depositing process
Peer-reviewed works should be kept separately from other works
No incentive for depositing works on the university-based IR.

Note. Some respondents provided more than one reason.
Eight respondents thought that the peer-review was a time-consuming process, while four
respondents agreed that the peer-review process might demotivate faculty participation. Among
these respondents, one faculty member from the Art History field said, “If the deposition process
required more work and conditions, I would not be willing to participate and deposit my work in
the university-based IR” (ID118), while another faculty member from Chemistry stated, “The
peer-review process may demotivate faculty participation” (ID173). Evidently, participants had

123

different opinions about the work that should be deposited in the university-based IRs. For
instance, while some (3, 5.7%) agreed that IRs should be more open and accept a variety of
work, the same number of participants (3, 5.7%) stated that IRs should accept only peerreviewed work. Additionally, three respondents agreed that a clear content recruitment policy
was needed for quality control. One faculty member from Chemical Engineering said, “Peerreviewed work should be kept separately from other work that has never been peer-reviewed,
and it is necessary that the university library develop a clear content recruitment policy for
quality control” (ID083).
5.1.4

IR Usage
Since the current study views faculty members as both authors and users of university-

based IRs, it is of interest to know whether the faculty members make use of the university-based
IRs. Slightly more than half of the respondents (97, 55%) indicated that they had used and
searched the university-based IRs, while the remaining 79 (45%) respondents had never used
them. Chi-square tests of independence were used to test if there were any statistically significant
relationships existing among categorical variables.
Table 5.26 shows the percentage of respondents who had used university-based IRs by
their awareness of IRs. A Chi-square test shows that there was a statistically significant
relationship between the respondents’ awareness of IRs and whether they made use of
university-based IRs, χ2 (1, N = 176) = 16.63, p = .000, ϕ = .31). The Phi is .31, indicating a
strong association and allowing for confirmation that respondents who had been aware of IRs
were more likely to use them. It can be seen in Table 5.26 that the greater proportion of
respondents (64.3%, n = 83) who had been aware of IRs indicated that they had used universitybased IRs, as compared to only 30% (n = 14) of those who had never been aware of IRs but

124

indicated that they had used them. By contrast, a higher proportion of respondents who had not
been aware of IRs (70%, n = 33) indicated that they had never used university-based IRs, as
compared to 35.7% (n = 46) of those who had been aware of IRs but indicated that they had
never made use of them.

Table 5.27 shows the percentage of respondents who had used university-based IRs
broken down by research discipline. A Chi-square tests of independence shows that there was no
statistically significant association between discipline and whether the respondents made use of
university-based IRs, χ2 (2, N = 170) = 1.77, p = .412. The proportion of respondents who had
used university-based IRs did not vary by research discipline.
A greater proportion of respondents across disciplines indicated that they had used
university-based IRs. In fact, the greatest proportion of respondents who had used universitybased IRs was 62% (n = 31) of faculty members from the humanities and social sciences,
followed by 51% (n = 25) from the medical and health sciences and 50.7% (n = 36) from other
science and technology fields. On the other hand, the smaller proportion of respondents who had
never used university-based IRs included an equal proportion of respondents from the medical
and health sciences (49%, n = 24) and other science and technology fields (49%, n = 35) and
38% (n = 19) of respondents from the humanities and social sciences.

Table 5.28 shows the percentage of respondents who indicated that they had used
university-based IRs broken down by academic position. The result of the Fishers’s exact test
shows p = .103. This means there was no statistically significant association between academic
position and whether the respondents had used university-based IRs.

In other words, the proportion of respondents who had used university-based IRs did not vary by
academic position. Table 5.28 shows that the larger proportion of respondents in three academic
positions indicated that they had used university-based IRs, including 100% (n = 3) of
researchers, followed by 58.3% (n = 28) of assistant professors, 57.4% (n = 58) of instructors
and lecturers, and a smaller equal proportion from professors (33.3%, n = 1) and associate

126

professors (33.3%, n = 7). Meanwhile, those who stated that they had never used universitybased IRs were professors (66.7%, n = 2) and associate professors (66.7%, n = 14), instructors
and lecturers (42.6%, n = 43) and assistant professors (41.7%, n = 20).
Table 5.29 presents the numbers of participants using the university-based IRs in specific
activities. Among the participants who reported using university-based IRs, 79 (81.4%) had used
them for research-related activities, 56 (57%) participants had used IRs for teaching-related
activities, 29 (30%) had used IRs for other scholarly productivity-related activities, and 11
(11.3%) participants indicated having used IRs in other activities. Of those eleven participants,
seven provided detailed reasons for using university-based IRs, including using them to search
for innovation (n = 1), to download administrative documents (n = 1), to find resources to
prepare for a presentation (n = 1), to download e-books (n = 1), to search for information (n =
1), to browse through the university-based IR, and to seek more information about the universitybased IR in order to inform others about it (n = 1).

Table 5.30 presents the number of participants who used the university-based IRs in
research-related activities. While some of the respondents (30, 40.5%) who answered this
question did not provide specific reasons, the other 49 respondents (62%) did state specific
reasons for using IRs. The three most common reasons for using the university-based IRs were to

127

conduct a literature review for a research project or dissertation (23, 29%), to search and use fulltext articles, theses, and dissertations (10, 12.7%), and to use content available in the universitybased IRs to develop or write a research proposal or a final research report (8, 10%).

The main purpose for IR development in Thailand’s research universities is to collect and
archive scholarly work. The majority of contents in all university-based IRs are research reports
and full-text theses and dissertations. These are the reasons why many respondents in this study
mentioned using the university-based IRs to search for and use full-text articles, theses, and
dissertations and to use resources available in the IRs to develop and write grant proposals and
research reports. A faculty member from Behavioral science (ID085) stated, “I use the contents
in my university-based IR as examples to prepare for a research proposal,” while a faculty
member from Pharmaceutical science (ID134) said, “I use the repository when I need to prepare
for writing a research project proposal.” One faculty member from Economics who used full-text
contents indicated, “I search for full-text articles and dissertations in the intellectual repository.”
Four respondents mentioned other reasons for using IRs, including “IRs are easy to use” (ID170
Education), “using research reports available in the university-based IRs as guidelines to review
other research works” (ID148 Plant Sciences), “to check my work available in the university-

128

based IR” (ID153 Soil Science), and “checking and using free online scholarly publications”
(ID044 Biochemistry).
As shown in Table 5.31, only 30 participants (out of 56) provided specific reasons why
they used IRs for teaching-related activities. Two most common reasons for using the universitybased IRs for teaching-related activities were to prepare for teaching and developing course
materials (9, 16%) and to use contents available in the IRs (9, 16%). One faculty member from
Physical Therapy stated, “I searched the university IR to see if I could use some available
resources for preparing my lessons and teaching materials” (ID107).

The other two reasons were to find materials to be used in classes (n = 6) and to use the
university-based IR contents as examples for students in classes (n = 4). The former reason was
mentioned by five respondents, and those who mentioned the latter reason were faculty members
from Medical Science and other science and technology fields, including Entomology (ID162),
Pharmaceutical Science (ID138), Health Sciences (ID137), Biomedical Engineering (ID114),
and Microbiology (ID111), and one faculty member from the humanities and social sciences
(Political Science-International Relations). A faculty member from Entomology stated, “I used
the IR to find some case studies in Thailand,” (ID162), while the Microbiology faculty member

129

indicated the purpose of “searching for current empirical studies conducted in the Thai context,
since I want to use them in my classes” (ID111). The latter reason was mentioned by four faculty
members from Humanities and Social Science fields (all of them from library and information
science) and one faculty member from the computer science field. Two respondents who
mentioned other reasons included a faculty member from nursing who gave the purpose “to keep
track of new knowledge and ideas” (ID060) and a biochemistry faculty member whose purpose
was “to find free e-books for students” (ID044).
Table 5.32 presents the number of participants who had used the university-based IRs in

Only 14 participants (48%) provided explanations about how they had used the university-based
IRs. The largest number of respondents (5, 17%) reported using IRs and the contents available in
them to prepare a manuscript for publication (textbooks = 3 and articles = 2). One faculty
member from social sciences (Law) stated, “I used content available in the university IR to
prepare a journal article manuscript and an analysis of a Supreme Court judgment” (ID125). The
other reasons were to use the university-based IRs for references (n = 4) and to use content in the
university-based IRs such as books, journals, and articles (n = 2). In addition, three respondents

130

mentioned other reasons, including to search for information (ID159), to conduct literature
reviews (ID051), and to track new knowledge in their field (ID060).
When asked how often they searched and used the university-based IRs, the largest
number of respondents (25, 25.8%) indicated that they used the university-based IR less
frequently than every month, followed by 2-3 times a week (19, 19.6%), and every month (18,
18.6%). More than a half of the participants who responded to this question indicated that they
often used and searched the university-based IR. In fact, altogether 54 (56%) reported that they
used the university-based IR every week or more than every week, while 43 (44%) used it every
month or less often than once a month, as shown in Table 5.33.

The 79 respondents who indicated that they had never used university-based IRs were
asked if they intended to use them in the near future. Of these, 33 (42.0%) indicated that they
were interested in using the university-based IRs in the near future, while 13 participants (16.0%)
did not have any plan to do so. It is interesting that an equal number of participants (33, 42.0 %)
also remained uncertain about whether to use to the university-based IRs. A Chi-square test of

131

independence was used to determine differences in response across research discipline and
academic position.
Table 5.34 shows data on the willingness of the respondents to use and access the
university based IRs in the near future broken down by discipline.

A Fisher’s exact test yielded p = .572. There was no statistically significant association between
discipline and whether the respondents intended to use university-based IRs. Table 5.35 shows
that a greater proportion of respondents in all disciplines, including 50.0% (n = 12) from the
medical and health sciences, 43.0% (n = 15) from other science and technology fields, and
31.6% (n = 6) from the humanities and social sciences, indicated that they were willing to use
university-based IRs in the near future, as compared to those who expressed no intention to use
university-based IRs in the near future. Among the 33 respondents who were uncertain whether
they would use university-based IRs in the future, the greatest proportion were from the
humanities and social sciences (57.9%, n = 11), followed by 37.5% (n = 9) from the medical and
health sciences, and 37% (n = 13) from other science and technology fields. Respondents from
the medical and health sciences and other science and technology fields were more likely to say
they would probably use university-based IRs in the near future as compared to respondents from

132

the humanities and social science fields. However, a greater proportion of respondents in the
humanities and social sciences than in any other disciplines expressed that they did know
whether they would use IRs in the future.
Table 5.35 presents data on the willingness of the participants to use and access
university based IRs in the near future broken down by academic position. A Fisher’s exact test
yielded p = .110, indicating that there was no statistically significant association between
academic position and whether the respondents intended to use university-based IRs in the near
future. This means that respondents’ intention to use university-based IRs did not vary by
academic position.

Those who expressed that they intended to use university-based IRs in the near future were 50%
(n = 10) of assistant professors, followed by 44.0% (n = 19) of instructors and lecturers and
28.7% (n = 4) of associate professors. Only a small proportion of respondents in all positions,
with the exception of professors, expressed no intention to use university-based IRs in the future.
It is interesting that all full professors (100%) were in this category. This might be explained by
the fact that none of them thought that the development of IRs was important, as discussed
previously (Table 5.21). Of the respondents who did not know whether to use IRs in the near
133

future, the greatest proportion were 57.0% (n = 8) of associate professors, followed by 45.0% (n
= 9) of assistant professors and 37.0% (n = 16) of instructors and lecturers. It is evident that
assistant professors and instructors and lecturers were more likely to use the university-based IRs
in the near future, as compared to associate professors and professors.
To make clear the reasons behind the respondents’ decisions, respondents who did not
intend to use university-based IRs (n = 13) and those who did not know whether they would use
them in the future (n = 33) were both asked to provide specific reasons.
Eight out of 13 respondents who stated that they did not intend to use university-based
IRs provided reasons. The reasons related to quality of content (n = 4), using other sources and
online databases (n =3), perceiving no benefit (n = 1), and the functionality of IRs, particularly as
search systems (n = 1). Among these reasons, the quality of content in IRs was the most common
reason for non-use, mentioned by four respondents. They stated:
•

I checked the university-based IR right after I had gotten the invitation email of this
survey. However, I found that the repository was not up-to-date and had a poor search
system (ID075).

•

Other repositories are far better than my university IR (ID128).

•

The university-based IR does not provide relevant information in my field (ID008).

•

The university-based IR is not updated (ID175).

Those who used other sources and online databases stated, “I prefer using other online
databases which provide more information” (ID045), “I’ve used other online databases and other
sources which provide more relevant information in my field (ID065),” and “I use online
databases to get research papers and journal articles. It would be more interesting if IRs
contained and provided access to work-in-progress” (ID166). One respondent who perceived no
benefit from using the university-based IRs stated, “I do not see any benefit of using the
university-based IR” (ID017).
134

The highest numbers of respondents were not sure if they would use the university-based
IRs in the near future. Fourteen participants out of 33 respondents in this group specified their
reasons. The most common reason, mentioned by five participants, was using other sources of
information or online databases. Some participants mentioned a specific database that they
normally consulted, such as PubMed, Scopus, and ScienceDirect, as shown in the following
statements:
•

I always use PubMed or Scopus (ID063).

•

Normally, I use other databases such as ScienceDirect (ID077).

•

I’ve used other online databases (ID068).

•

I use other information sources (ID072).

•

The IR is a source of information that I rarely consult as compared with other
information sources (ID011).

Quality of content was another reason mentioned by four (n = 4) respondents. Some
participants expressed doubts about the content available in the university-based IRs. They
mentioned:
•

I believe that contents available in the IR may be not relevant to my field (ID079).

•

I’ve tried using it, but I cannot find any content that is relevant to my interest
(ID066).

•

The university-based IR is not mature and up-to-date. It has a limited amount of
content. The content is too generic. I don’t really understand the purpose of the
repositories (ID022).

•

To date, the university-based IR contains a limited amount of content, particularly in
my field (ID129).

In addition, lack of information and incomplete understanding of the university based IRs
was another reason for uncertainty. Some respondents said, “I don’t have any information about

135

the university-based IR” (ID131) and “I want to learn more about the benefit of using the
university-based IR before using it” (ID032).
The user-interface design appeared to be an important issue. Two participants stated, “I
don’t want to use it due to the poor user interface design” (ID003) and “The IR was not built
based on user-oriented idea and has a poor user interface” (ID022). Additionally, two
participants simply stated, “I have never used it,” (ID078) and “Currently, I do not work in any
research project, so I don’t use it” (ID076).
Two groups of respondents (those with no plan to use the IRs and the uncertain group)
mentioned some similar issues that hindered them from using the university-based IRs. Those
reasons included quality of content, the possibility of using other sources, and the functionality
of IRs (the user interface and the search system). Different from those who did not plan to use
university-based IRs, respondents who did not know whether they would use them mentioned
that they lacked information on IRs and were concerned about the user interface design. Among
the reasons given, quality of content was the most common reason mentioned by both groups.
5.1.4.1 Respondents’ Opinions on the Usage of Contents Available in the University-based IRs
To study the participants’ opinions on the allowable use of contents available in the
university-based IRs, all participants were asked whether they agreed or disagreed with three
statements regarding this issue. The mean agreement could range from 1 to 5, where 1
represented strongly disagree and 5 represented strongly agree. Based on a ranking of mean
scores, the second and the third statements regarding the allowable use of contents available in
the university-based IRs received an agreeable response, while the mean score of the first
statement, that all users should be allowed to make any comments on work available in
university-based IRs, was 3.35, which indicates neither agree nor disagree, as is shown in Table 5.36.

The Kruskal-Wallis H test with age, discipline, and academic position categories as
independent variables were conducted to see whether the respondent’ opinions on the usage of
contents available in the university-based IRs differ among groups. Table 5.37 presents the
results from the Kruskal-Wallis H test. Regarding age, the Kruskal-Wallis H test indicated that
there was a significant differences across age group in the first statement, “All users should be
allowed to make any comments on work available in the university-based IRs,” H(2) = 8.73, p
= .013. A Man-Withney U test was conducted to evaluate pairwise differences among three
groups. The results indicated the significant difference between the respondents aged 25-39 and
the respondents aged 40-49 years (U = 1751.50, p = .003, and r = -0.24). This indicates that these
two groups have significant differences opinion on in the statement “All users should be allowed
to make any comments on work available in the university-based IRs.”
Regarding discipline, the Kruskal-Wallis H test indicated that there was no significant
difference in respondents’ opinions on the usage of contents available in university-based IRs
across disciplines in any statement.

137

When academic position was considered, the Kruskal-Wallis H test indicated that there
were significant differences in respondents’ opinions on the usage of contents available in
university-based IRs across academic position in all statement, including “All users should be
allowed to make any comments on work available in the university-based IRs,” H(4) = 16.66, p
= .002; “Any use of a work deposited in the university-based IRs is acceptable as long as it is
acknowledged and cited,” H(4) = 14.90, p = .005); and “Individual users should register before
using the university-based IRs, so that the usage statistics can be collected,” H(4) = 9.96, p
= .041). A Man-Whitney U test was then conducted for a post-hoc analysis to evaluate pairwise
differences among groups in each statement. For the first statements, a Man-Whitney U test
indicated that there were significant differences between associate professors and assistant
professors (U = 342.00, p = .029, and r = -0.26), associate professors and instructors and
lecturers (U = 566.00, p = .000, and r = -0.31), assistant professors and instructors and lecturers
(U = 1952.50, p = .045, and r = -0.16).
The second statement was that, “Any use of a work deposited in the university-based IRs
is acceptable as long as it is acknowledged and cited,” a Man-Whitney U test showed there were
significant differences in respondents’ opinions between full professors and assistant professors
(U = 17.00, p = .015, r = -0.34); full professors and instructors and lecturers (U = 39.50, p
= .015, r = -0.23); professors and researchers (U = 0.00, p = .037, r = -0.85); associate professors
and assistant professors (U = 343.50, p = .023, r = -0.27); associate professors and instructors
and lecturers (U = 717.00, p = .010, r = -0.23); and associate professors and researchers (U =
9.00, p = .038, r = -0.42).
Regarding the last statement, which was “Individual users should register before using
the university-based IRs, so that the usage statistics can be collected,” a Man-Whitney U test

138

showed there were significant differences in respondents’ opinions between full professors and
researchers (U = 0.00, p = .034, r = -0.86); assistant professors and instructors and lecturers (U =
1904.50, p = .025, r = -0.18); instructors and lecturers and researchers (U = 51.00, p = .040, r = 0.20). To sum up, the respondents’ opinion on the usage of contents available in university-based
IRs varies greatly based on academic positions.

Current Self-Archiving Practice in OA Repositories and Other Venues
The present study also explored the current self-archiving practices and experience of the

participants and their intention to self-archive in the near future. At the time, only 61 (34.7%)
respondents had made their scholarly work and/or teaching materials available in other open
access repositories and/or other publicly accessible web sites on the Internet, while a larger

139

proportion of respondents (115, 65.3%) reported that they had not made their work available in
such a venue during the previous two years.
Table 5.38 shows the number of participants who had made their work publicly available
in OA repositories and other venues by discipline. A Chi-square test showed that there was no
statistically significant association between discipline and whether faculty members had made
their work publicly available in OA repositories and other venues, χ2 (2, N = 170) = 1.25, p
= .490. As shown in Table 5.41, a larger proportion of faculty members in all disciplines had not
made their work publicly available through such a venue. The greatest proportion of faculty
members in this group were from the humanities and social sciences (72.0%, n = 36), followed
by those from the medical and health sciences (63.3%, n = 31) and faculty members from other
science and technology fields (62.0%, n = 44). Only a small proportion of respondents from each
discipline had made their work publicly available, including faculty members from other science
and technology fields (38.0%, n = 27), followed by faculty members from the medical and health
sciences (36.7%, n = 18) and the humanities and social sciences (28.0%, n = 14).

In relation to academic position, as presented in Table 5.39, the Fisher’s exact test
yielded p = .054, meaning that there was a statistically significant relationship between academic

140

position and whether the faculty members had made their work publicly available on OA
repositories and other venues. While all researchers (100%, n = 3) indicated that they had made
their work publicly available in OA repositories and other venues, larger proportions of
respondents in all other academic positions had not made their work publicly available in such a
venue, including instructors and lectures (71.3%, n = 72), associate professors (66.7%, n = 14)
and professors (66.7%, n = 2), and assistant professors (56.3%, n = 27). The smaller proportions
of respondents who indicated that they had made their work available were assistant professors
(43.8%, n = 21), followed by associate professors (33.3%, n = 7), one professor (33.3%, n =1),
and instructors and lecturers (28.7%, n = 29).

5.1.5.1 Current Self-Archiving Practice
Among the 61 respondents who indicated that they had made their work publicly
available in other OA repositories and web sites, only 40 (65.6%) were currently involved in
self-archiving, while the remaining 21 (34.4%) respondents did not self-archive their work. This
group of respondents indicated that other individuals made their work available on publicly
accessible sites on their behalf. A shown in Table 5.40, some respondents (14, 23%) indicated
that their departmental staff had helped them to post their work. Equal numbers of respondents
141

(5, 6.8%) reported that a) their colleagues, b) assistant/teaching assistant, and c) librarians or
library staff had helped to make their works publicly available. Four respondents specified
“others,” including a staff member of the Institute of Research and Development, a journal
editorial team, a publisher, and a web master, that had helped them to publish their works. The
respondents were allowed to choose multiple answers.

5.1.5.2 Venues for Self-Archiving
Figure 5.2 presents the distribution of venues that respondents had used for self-archiving
and posting their work. The respondents (n = 61) had made their work publicly available on the
Internet in a variety of venues. However, the two most commonly mentioned venues were
departmental/faculty websites (23, 37.7%) and open access journals (20, 32.8%), respectively.
Interestingly, a numbers of respondents reported that they had self-archived their works in social
media site (10, 16.4%). Other venues included personal web pages (8, 13.1 %) and research
group or laboratory websites (8, 13.1 %). The other venues, each represented by the same
number of respondents (6, 9.8%) included, discipline repositories, the Thailand National
Research Repository, the Thai Digital Collection, and eLibrary (the Thailand Research Fund).

Figure 5.2. Venues for self-archiving.
The most commonly used venues for publishing work for public access were the
departmental and faculty web sites. However, it is interesting to note that about one-third of
respondents (20 out of 61) had already published their work through open access journals. The
OA journals listed by the respondents were both international open access journals and open
access journals published by professional organizations in Thailand. Examples of international
OA journals included BMC Genomics, the Journal of the Association for Information Research
(JAIS, http://aisel.aisnet.org/jais/authorinfo.html), Oncology Reports, PeerJ (https://peerj.com),
PLOS One, Biomedical Research: An International Journal of Medical Sciences
(http://www.alliedacademies.org/biomedical-research), Veterinary Parasitology, and the
Southeast Asian Journal of Tropical Medicine and Public Health. Two open access journals
published in Thailand were mentioned: Thai Journal of Pharmacy Practice (n = 2) and Thai
Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences (n = 1). Most of the journals mentioned in the current study
were journals in medical and biomedical fields; the exceptions were the Journal of the
Association for Information Research, which is a journal in the field of information systems and

143

information technology, and PLOS One, a multidisciplinary open access journal. Both of the OA
journals in Thailand were from the pharmaceutical science field.
Respondents who had published their work through disciplinary repositories cited
PubMed Central (n = 2), BioMed Central (n = 1), and LSE Theses (London School of
Economics and Political Science) as venues for publishing. A number of social media sites were
also cited as publishing venues, including ResearchGate (n = 7), Facebook (n = 1),
Academia.edu (n = 1), and Google Scholar (n = 1).
5.1.5.3 Content Types
Figure 5.3 shows the distribution of content types that the 61 respondents had made
publicly available through open access repositories and other publicly accessible venues on the
Internet. The majority of respondents (42, 69%) had made journal articles publicly available,
followed by theses and dissertations (20, 23.8%) and research reports and technical reports (18,
29.5%). Despite the fact that many publishers do not allow authors to post the final versions of
their articles in other places, the majority of participants responding to this question (38, 90.5%)
had made final versions of their refereed articles available on the Internet. There were only four
respondents who indicated that they had posted pre-refereed versions of their articles in other
venues. Equal numbers of respondents (6, 9.8% for each content type) had published their
conference papers, posters, and presentations through publicly accessible sites. Course syllabi
and books or book chapters were less frequently made available on the Internet. Two
respondents who chose “others” did not clarify the content types. Although there is an increasing
demand for research data sharing at the global level, only one participant in the current study had
made a data set available. This participant was a faculty member from the field of computer
science. The participants were allowed to select multiple content types.

Sixty-one (61) respondents, who indicated that they had made their work available for
public access, were then asked about how often they had made their work available during the
previous two years. As shown in Table 5.41, slightly more than one-third of respondents had
made their work available only one time in the previous two years, and a similar number had
done so two or three times. The exact numbers were 23 (37.7%) and 21 (34.4%), respectively.
Only 17 (27.9%) respondents had made their work publicly available through other publicly
accessible web sites more than three times during the previous two years, and only four
respondents indicated that they had posted their work more than five times in the past two years.

5.1.5.4 Planning for Self-Archiving in the Future
One hundred fifteen participants who did not have any experience in posting work to
other publicly accessible venues (alternative scholarly communication channels) were asked
whether they planned to self-archive or publish their work through other OA repositories and
publicly accessible web sites in the near future. Findings showed that slightly more than onethird of the respondents (46, 40%) indicated they would be willing to publish their works through
the other publicly accessible web sites, while 27 (23.5%) respondents said they would not be
willing to do so. Interestingly, another slightly more than one third (42, 36.5%) did not indicate
whether they planned to publish through these alternative channels.
A chi-square test for independence was conducted to test differences in responses across
discipline. As shown in Table 5.42, a Chi-square test indicates that there was no statistically
significant association between discipline and whether the respondent planned to publish in OA
repositories or other publicly accessible venues on the Internet, χ2 (4, N = 111) = 8.63, p = .071.
Greater proportions of respondents in the humanities and social sciences (50.0%, n = 18) and the
medical and health sciences (38.7%, n = 12) showed a willingness to publish in OA repositories
and other public accessible venues on the Internet. Different from these two disciplines, a greater
proportion of respondents from other science and technology fields (36.4%, n = 16) did not want
to publish their work in these venues. Others who were in the same category were respondents
from the medical and health sciences (25.8%, n = 8) and the humanities and social sciences
(8.3%, n = 3). Those who remained uncertain included 41.7% (n = 15) of faculty members from
the humanities and social sciences, 35.5% (n = 11) from the medical and health sciences, and
31.8% (n = 14) from other science and technology fields. It is interesting that the proportion of
respondents who did not know whether to publish their work through these types of venues

146

(36.0%, n = 40) was nearly the same as the proportion of those who were interested in publishing
in OA repositories or other publicly accessible venues (40.0%, n = 44).

When the data were broken down by academic position, the result from Fisher’s exact
test indicated p = .002, meaning that there was a statistically significant relationship between
academic position and whether the respondents would be willing to publish in OA repositories or
other publicly accessible venues. In other words, the proportion of respondents who were willing
to publish in OA repositories or other publicly accessible venues varied by academic position. As
shown in Table 5.43, respondents who would be willing to publish their works were 53.0% (n =
38) of instructors and lecturers, followed by 21.4% (n = 3) of associate professors, and 19.0% (n
= 5) of assistant professors. As compared to other academic positions, a greater proportion of
instructors and lecturers were more likely to publish their work on OAIRs and other publicly
accessible venues than of those in others academic positions. By contrast, those who reported
uncertainty included 50.0% (n =1) of professors, 48.0% (n = 13) of assistant professors, 33.0%
(n = 24) of instructors and lecturers, and 28.6% (n = 4) of associate professors. Meanwhile,
respondents who did want to publish in these types of venues included 50.0% of professors (n =

147

1) and associate professors (n = 7), followed by 33.0% (n = 9) of assistant professors, and 14.0%
(n = 10) of instructors and lecturers.
Table 5.43 shows that among 115 participants, the greater proportion of respondents
(40.0%, n = 46) indicated they would be willing to publish their work, while nearly the same
proportion of respondents (37.0%, n = 42) did not know whether they would publish their work
in OA repositories or other publicly accessible venues in the future. The smallest proportion of
respondents (27.0%, n = 27) did not want to publish through these channels at all.

The participants who said they would not be willing to publish their work through OA
repositories and other publicly accessible web sites, along with some of those who were
uncertain, were asked to indicate the factors that might hinder or delay their decisions to do so.
Half of the participants from both groups, 13 and 21 respectively, provided reasons. Those
reasons were translated and analyzed by theme and are presented in Table 5.44. “I do not have
any work to be published” was the reason most commonly cited by both groups of respondents,
including four respondents who did not intend to publish and five respondents who were
uncertain. While many respondents from both groups simply stated that they did not have any

148

work, one respondent from the former group stated, “I am a novice researcher and have just
started working at this university as a lecturer. I don’t have any work to publish” (ID073).
Other reasons mentioned by respondents in both groups included lack of information
about OA publications, issues of trust toward OA repositories and the quality of content
available in publicly accessible web sites, copyright concerns, and concerns about the quality of
their own work. One participant (ID037) mentioned three reasons for his/her decision not to
publish in such venues: “I don’t understand the concept of open access and the benefit of open
access publishing. I have concerns about the quality of open access publication and the security
of the system.” Others who did not trust OA repositories and OA journals and expressed
concerns about the quality of the contents explicitly stated, “I do not trust the quality of open
access” (ID017) and “Some OA journals have not been approved by the Office of the Higher
Education Commission, Thailand” (ID014). In addition, those who addressed copyright concerns
simply stated “I am not sure about the copyright issue” (ID161) and “I worry about the copyright
issue. I think the publisher does not allow authors to publish their work in other sources”
(ID152).
Respondents who said they would not be willing to publish mentioned two other reasons,
preference for publishing in other sources and disciplinary norm. One respondent commented, “I
prefer to publish in only high quality journals in my field” (ID166). Similarly, another
respondent mentioned, “I published only in peer-reviewed journals and my works are not
difficult to find. They are already ‘out there.’ Publishing in other sources is not necessary”
(ID040). Another respondent who addressed the issue of disciplinary norms said, “Some scholars
in my field do not accept open access publishing” (ID003).

149

Other reasons addressed by respondents who had not made up their minds about whether
to publish their work in these alternative scholarly communication channels included depending
on funding agency requirements, not supporting OA publishing, having concerns about the
university policy on open access, perceiving a lack of technical support, and being in a decisionmaking process. The respondents mentioned:
•

It depends on the requirements of funding agencies and their policies (ID140).

•

I don’t completely understand the concept of open access. Personally, I don’t support
the concept of open access (ID131).

•

I’m not sure whether the university has an open access policy and supports open
access publishing (ID159).

•

I’m considering publishing my work in open access repositories, but I have not made
a decision yet (ID111).

•

There is lack of technical support from the department to publish in open access
repositories and other web sites (ID117).

Some of these reasons have been identified in previous studies as factors hindering selfarchiving. For instance, Kim (2008) found that copyright concerns were one of the factors that
impeded self-archiving. Other reasons identified in the narratives of respondents can also be
considered as factors that might have delayed the faculty members’ decisions to publish in such
venues. Some respondents (6 out of 69) in this study also indicated that they lacked information
regarding OA publication. This may also be why two respondents explicitly stated that they did
not support OA publishing. Therefore, there is a need to establish a greater understanding of OA
and OA publishing.

5.1.5.5 Usage of Scholarly Works in OA Repositories and Other Publicly Accessible Web Sites
As stated in the previous discussion, the current study views faculty members as both
authors and users of scholarly work available in various sources. In this context, it is interesting
to know whether the faculty members in Thai research universities make use of scholarly work
available in OA repositories and other publicly accessible web sites during the course of specific
activities. Findings showed that the majority of respondents (148, 84%) had already searched for
and used scholarly work available in OA repositories and other publicly accessible web sites,
while only 28 (16%) indicated that they had never searched for or used scholarly works from
these sources.

151

Table 5.45 presents the numbers of faculty members that had used and not used contents
available in OA repositories and other publicly accessible web sites broken down by discipline.
A Chi-square test of independence shows that there was no statistically significant association
between disciplines and whether the participants had searched for and used scholarly work
available in OA repositories and other publicly accessible web sites, χ2 (2, N = 170) = .85, p
= .652. The greater proportion of respondents across disciplines indicated that they had searched
for and used works available in OA repositories and other public access venues. In fact, greater
than or equal to eighty percent of respondents in all disciplines indicated they were in this
category. By contrast, a smaller proportion of respondents across disciplines had never searched
for and used scholarly works available in those venues. This group included 20% (n =10) of
faculty members from the medical and health sciences, 16% (n = 8) of respondents from the
humanities and social sciences, and 14% (n = 10) from other science and technology fields.

Table 5.46 illustrates the numbers of faculty members that had used and not used
contents available in OA repositories and other publicly accessible web sites broken down by
academic position. A Fisher’s exact test indicated that p = .248. This means there was no
statistically significant association between academic position and whether the respondents had

152

searched for and used contents available in OA repositories and other publicly accessible venues.
A larger proportion of respondents across all academic positions indicated that they had searched
for and used scholarly works available in OA repositories and other venues, including 100% of
professors (n = 3) and researchers (n =3), 88% (n = 89) of instructors and lecturers, 79% (n = 38)
of assistant professors, and 71% (n =15) of associate professors. Meanwhile, those who stated
that they had never used scholarly work available through those venues were 29.0% (n = 6) of
associate professors, followed by 21% (n = 10) of assistant professors, and 12.0% (n = 12) of
instructors and lecturers.

Table 5.47 presents the number of respondents that had made use of scholarly work
available in OA repositories and other publicly accessible web sites in a specific activity. Among
148 respondents, 121 (82%) had searched for and used scholarly work available in OA
repositories and other publicly accessible web sites for research-related activities, followed by
teaching-related activities (89, 60%), and scholarly productivity-related activities (46, 31%).
Some respondents indicated they had used that scholarly work for other activities (10, 6.8%).
Among those 10 respondents, four (40%) did not provide any reasons for using the sites, while

153

the other six (60%) mentioned using sites to update information (n = 2), to use articles in OA
journals (n = 1), to prepare for a new project (n =1), to get information for a student seminar, and
to prepare for a conference presentation (n =1). One respondent mentioned using scholarly work
available in OA repositories since “I cannot find enough current information from scholarly
journals and online databases about my project” (ID). The other, who mentioned using articles in
OA journals, gave as a reason “to use pirated articles in open access journals” (ID040).

The participants were then asked to specify their reasons for using the scholarly work
available in OA repositories and other publicly accessible web sites for specific activities.
Although the majority of respondents did not specify a reason for using it, some of them
provided explanations and reasons.
Table 5.48 presents reasons given by participants for using scholarly work available in
OA repositories and other publicly accessible web sites in research-related activities. Among the
121 respondents answering that they had searched for and used scholarly work available in OA
repositories and other public accessible web sites, half of them (61, 50.4%) did not provide
specific reasons. The top four most common reasons for using that scholarly work in researchrelated activities were 1) to conduct a literature review (22, 18.2%); 2) to find information for

154

references (15, 12.4%); 3) to cite scholarly work available in OA repositories and other publicly
accessible web sites (10, 8.3%); and 4) to develop and write a grant proposal or a research report
(7, 5.8%).
Other reasons mentioned by no more than two respondents each included that open
access repositories are easy to use (n =2), that they wanted to keep contact with other researchers
and experts in their field (n = 1), that OA repositories and OA journals provided relevant
information in their field (n = 1), that they wanted to use guidelines for writing a research paper
for publication (n = 1), and that they wanted to use work available in OA repositories as
guidelines to review other work (n = 1).

Table 5.49 shows the respondents’ reasons for using scholarly work available in OA
repositories and other publicly accessible web sites in teaching-related activities. Among the 37
respondents who provided reasons, the largest number (23, 25.8%) indicated that they used that
scholarly work to prepare for teaching and to develop and update teaching/course materials. For
instance, Respondent ID040 mentioned “finding some new materials for updating the reading list
and course syllabus.” Similarly, respondent ID133 stated as a reason “searching references,
supplements, and documents to develop course materials and prepare for teaching.” Other

155

reasons were mentioned including to search for information and scholarly publications (n = 5), to
keep track of information and knowledge (n = 4), to find some material to be used in classes (n =
3), and to find effective teaching strategies and methods (n = 2).

As can be seen in Table 5.50, 15 respondents (out of 46) who used scholarly work
available in OA repositories and other publicly accessible web sites in other scholarly
productivity related activities indicated their reasons, including 1) to prepare a manuscript (n =
5), to search for information (n = 4), to conduct a literature review (n = 3), to stay current in
knowledge (n = 2), and to cite work available in OA repositories (n = 1). While four out of five
respondents who used work available in OA repositories and other venues to prepare for a
manuscript stated that they were preparing manuscripts for journal articles (n =2) and textbook
manuscripts (n =2), one respondent simply indicated “preparing manuscripts for publication”
(ID056).

Table 5.51 shows how frequently participants searched for and used scholarly work
available in OA repositories and other venues; the largest number of respondents (34, 23%)
indicated that they used them at least once a week, followed by 2-3 times a week (28, 18.9%)
and 4-5 times a week (24, 16.2%). Altogether fewer than one-fourth of the respondents (31,
21%) used them every day or many times a day, and the same numbers of respondents (31, 21%)
reported that they rarely used scholarly work available in OA repositories and other venues.

5.1.5.6 Participants’ Willingness to Search and Use OA Repositories and Other Venues
Twenty-eight respondents who indicated that they had never searched for and used
contents available in OA repositories and other publicly accessible web sites were asked if they
intended to use them in the future. Overall, half of the respondents (14, 50%) said they would be
willing to use OA repositories and other open access venues in the near future, while five
respondents (18%) did not want to use them, and nine respondents (32%) had not made a
decision about whether to use those sources. It is interesting that the number of respondents
expressing their intention to search and use OA repositories in the near future was higher than
the number of respondents who said that they did not want to use them.
Table 5.52 presents the willingness of the respondents to use OA repositories and other
publicly accessible venues in the future broken down by discipline. A Fisher’s exact test yielded
p = .598. This means that there was no significant association between discipline and whether the
respondents intended to use contents available in OA repositories and other public accessible
venues in the future. According to the table, while a greater proportion of respondents from the
humanities and social sciences (62.5%, n = 5) and other science and technology fields (50.0%, n
= 5) reported they were willing to use content in OA repositories and other publicly accessible
venues in the near future, a greater proportion of respondents from the medical and health
sciences (50.0%, n = 5) felt uncertain and did not know whether they would use them in the
future.

Table 5.53 presents data on participants’ willingness to search and use OA repositories
and other publicly accessible web sites broken down by academic position. Based on Fisher’s
exact test, p = .904, meaning that there was no significant relationship between academic
positions and whether the respondents intended to use the contents available in OA repositories
and other public accessible venues in the future. The greater proportion of respondents in all
academic positions expressed their intentions to use contents available in these sources in the
future. This group included 60.0% (n = 6) of associate professors, 50.0% (n = 3) of associate
professors, and 42.0% (n = 4) of instructors and lecturers. Only a smaller proportion of
respondents in all academic positions expressed no intention to use them. Among those who did
not know whether they would use them, the greater proportion were 42.0% (n = 5) of instructors
and lecturers, followed by 33.3% (n = 2) of associate professors, and 20.0% (n = 2) of assistant
professors.

For the purpose of understanding the reasons behind the respondents’ decisions,
respondents who answered “No” and “Uncertain” were asked to specify their reasons.
Among the five respondents indicating that they did not intend to use OA repositories in
the near future, three respondents provided specific reasons to support their decisions. A faculty
member from the field of Nanotechnology stated, “I don’t understand the concept of open access
and am concerned about the quality open access repositories” (ID037). A respondent from
Electrical Engineering said, “I don’t want to search and use OA repositories” (ID076). In
addition, one respondent who was a faculty member from the library and information science
field stated, “OA repositories are not information sources that I have ever consulted” (ID011).
Two out of the seven respondents who had not decided whether to search and use OA
repositories and other venues provided specific reasons. While a faculty member in Biomedical
Engineering said, “I don’t trust OA repositories and their contents” (ID017), the other
respondent, from the field of Environmental Science, stated, “I need more detailed information
about open access repositories before making a decision to use them” (ID032). It is evident from
the reasons provided not only by respondents who did not want to use OA repositories but also
by those who did not know whether to use them that lack of information about OA and trust
160

toward OA repositories and the quality of contents were important reasons that hindered or
delayed the respondents’ willingness to use OA repositories in general. Similar reasons were also
mentioned when the respondents were asked to identify their stance on the use of the universitybased repositories in the previous sections.
5.1.6

Factors Affecting Faculty’s Acceptance and Use of University-based IRs
This study utilized path analysis to further address the second research question as a way

to identify the factors that contributed to faculty members’ behavioral intention to use universitybased IRs and their actual usage behavior. AMOS software was used to assess the overall model
fitness. In this section, the results from factor analysis are presented, followed by an assessment
of the structural model fit, hypotheses testing, and a proposal of the trimmed model.
5.1.6.1 Factor Analysis
Principle axis factoring (PAF) was performed using SPSS Version 23 to identify the
latent constructs behind the observed variables. The correlation matrix was used as a matrix of
association. The numbers of factors retained were based on theory. Each scale was believed to be
one factor; hence, there were no rotations used, and the pattern coefficients (analogous to Beta
weights) and the structure coefficients (the correlation between the individual item and the
component) were one and the same (Stevens, 2007, p. 331). Since the pattern and structure
coefficients are identical in cases where there is one factor, the coefficients are referred to as
factor loadings. The percentage of the variance for each factor is the eigenvalue (trace) divided
by number of items, times 100. Kieffer (1998) states that “trace” is the term for eigenvalues after
rotation. Since there was no rotation, this study used the term “eigenvalue.” The communality
coefficient (h2 = sum of squared factor loadings for the variable) is the proportion of each
variable’s variance that can be explained by the factors. “If a measured variable had a

161

communality coefficient close to 0%, this would mean that this variable is not being represented
within the factors” (Thompson, 2004, p.20).
Results of the PAF factor extraction are presented in the following tables. The retained
factor scores for each PAF were used as independent and dependent variables in a subsequent
path analysis.
5.1.6.1.1

Attitude Toward IRs (ATT)

A principle axis factoring analysis, requesting one factor, was conducted and is reported
in Table 5.54. In total, the four items explained about 73% of the variance. The factor loadings
were all above .80 and had high communality extraction (h2), above .70. Each of the four items
had a large correlation with the factor. All items were retained. The internal reliability for the
items in this factor was .89, indicating good internal reliability. The content of the four items was
related to attitude toward IRs; thus, the factor was named attitude.

expectancy scale. In total, the six items explained about 56% of the variance. The factor loadings

ranged from .44 to .87. The internal reliability coefficient for this factor was .84, indicating good
internal reliability. All items were retained for performance expectancy.

Effort Expectancy (EE)

A PAF, with one factor retained, was conducted for the EE scale. The six-item version of
EE accounted for 38% of variance. Table 5.56 reports the factor loadings for the six items of EE.
Item EE5r and EE6r (reverse coded) had low factor loadings (below .40), indicating they were
not consistent with the factor. To further assess the relationship of EE5r and EE6r with the other
four items, the internal reliability was examined. Both of them had a low correlation with the
other items. The six-item version of EE, including EE5r and EE6r, had relatively low reliability,
with Cronbach’s α = .65. These two items were removed one at a time. After deletion, the overall
reliability of the scale was improved, with Cronbach’s α = .82, indicating good internal
reliability. The four retained items of the EE construct were used in a subsequent PAF, and the
results are reported in Table 5.56. In total, the four items explained about 56.61% of the
variance. The factor loadings were all above |.40| and had communality extraction (h2) above .40.

scale (Table 5.57). The six-item version of SI accounted for 64.56% of variance. The factor
loadings were all above .60. Altogether, this factor had a relatively high internal reliability
coefficient, with the Cronbach’s α = .91, indicating the good internal reliability. All items were
retained, and the factor scores were saved for the next inquiry.

Item RTC2r had a low factor loading (below .40) and had low communality coefficients (h2 =
0.07); hence, it was not consistent with the factor. The internal reliability of this factor was
examined, and it was found that RTC had relatively low reliability, with Cronbach’s α = .49.
Item RTC2r was eliminated. Results showed that the overall reliability of the scale was
improved, with Cronbach’s α = .72, indicating acceptable internal reliability. The PAF was rerun
with the three remaining items, and the one-factor model was able to account for 47.38% of the
variance. The factor loadings were all above the cutoff point |.40|. The factor scores for RTC
were retained for use in the path analysis.

Altruism (ALT)

A principle axis factoring analysis, requesting one factor, was conducted for the ALT
scale. The results are presented in Table 5.59. The three-items of ALT accounted for 67.48% of
variance. The factor loadings were all above .70 and had a medium to high communality

extractions (h2), ranged from .51 to .82. With all three items, this factor had a relatively high
internal reliability coefficient, with Cronbach’s α = .84, indicating good internal reliability. All
items were retained, and the factor scores were saved for the path analysis.

variance. The factor loadings were all greater than the cut-off point |.40|. All four items were
consistent with one another, as indicated by a good internal reliability coefficient, with
Cronbach’s α = .80. The factor scores were retained for subsequent analyses.

Trust toward IRs (TTIRs)

A principle axis factoring analysis, with one factor retained, was conducted for the TTIRs
scale. As shown in Table 5.61, the four-item version of RTC accounted for a small percentage of
variance, about 36%. Item TTIRs4 had a low factor loading (below .40) and had low
communality coefficients (h2 = 0.01), indicating that it was not consistent with the factor. The
internal reliability of this factor was examined, and it was found that the overall TTIRs construct
had low reliability, with Cronbach’s α = .53. Item RTC2r was dropped. Results showed that the
overall reliability of the scale had improved, with Cronbach’s α = .72, indicating acceptable
internal reliability. A PAF was rerun. The results show that the three retained items of the TTIRs
construct accounted for 47.62% of the variance. The factor loadings were all above the cutoff
point |.40|, and the factor scores were retained

loadings were all greater than the cut-off point |.40|. The internal consistency of this factor

Behavioral Intention (BI)

A PAF, requesting one factor for BI, was conducted and is reported in Table 5.63.
Altogether, the three items explained 76.54% of the variance. The factor loadings were all
above .80 and had a medium to high communality extraction (h2), above .60. All four items had a
large correlation with the factor. All items were retained. The internal reliability of the overall
scales was excellent, and the Cronbach’s α was .90. The contents of the three items were related
to faculty members’ intention to use IRs; hence, the factor scores were saved and named
behavioral intention.

Table 5.64 presents a PAF analysis, requesting one factor for usage behavior. Altogether,
the four items explained about 60% of the variance. The factor loadings were all above .70, and
all had communality extraction (h2) above .50. Each of these four items had a large correlation
with the factor. All four items were retained. The Cronbach’s α value was .85, indicating that the
overall reliability of the scale was good. The contents of the four items were related to faculty
members’ actual usage of IRs; thus, the factor was named usage behavior.

5.1.6.1.12 Assessing Model Fit
Prior to the testing of the research hypotheses, the model was examined for its goodnessof-fit. The Asymptotically Distribution Free (ADF) method was used as the estimation method
since the factor scores in this study were continuous but not normal (Hox & Bechger, 1998).
Additionally, there were Heywood cases (negative variance estimates or estimated absolute
correlations greater than 1), and they were allowed into the model using an option in AMOS.
There are several fit indices to evaluate the model fit, such as model chi-square (χ2),
comparative fit index (CFI), root mean square error of approximations (RMSEA), and the
goodness-of-fit statistic (GFI) (Kline, 2005; Hooper, Coughlan, & Mullen, 2008). For this study,
169

the model chi-square and GFI were employed, since CFI and RMSEA were not applicable due to
the ADF estimation method. The model chi-square statistic was used to determine whether the
model fit the observed data. According to Kline (2005), if the value of model chi-square is equal
to zero, it indicates goodness of fit. The non-significant model chi-square (p > .050) indicates a
good model fit, suggesting that the model does not differ significantly from the observed data
(Park, Mills, & Edmondson, 2012). The χ2/df (analogous to CMIN) should be less than 3.0,
which indicates good fit. GFI evaluates the model fit by measuring the fit between an estimated
model and the observed covariance matrix (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2007). A GFI greater than .90
indicates good fit (Kline, 2005). Based on the fit indices, the proposed path model indicated poor
fit and showed that the path diagram of the proposed research model did not fit well with the
observed data, χ2 (9) = 35.65, p = .000, CMIN = 3.96, GFI = .98. This meant the proposed
research model could not be used to explain faculty members’ behavioral intention and usage
behavior with regard to university-based IRs.
After the structural model fit was assessed, resulting in an indication of poor fit, the study
hypotheses were then tested prior to the removal of non-significant paths. The results must be
interpreted with caution since there was poor model fit. Figure 5.4 shows the standardized path
coefficient (β) weights (analogous to standardized beta weights), the coefficient of determination
(R2), and their significance for the hypothesized model. The beta weight indicates the strengths
of the effects between the exogenous (independent) variables and endogenous (dependent)
variables. The coefficient of determination (R2), explained variance, demonstrates the proportion
of variance in the endogenous variables that is explained by exogenous variables (predictors).
Social influence (SI) and performance expectancy (PE) were found to have a significant direct
effect on usage intention of university-based IRs (β = 0.42, p < .001 and β = 0.31, p = .004

170

respectively), while resistance to change (RTC) was found to have a negative direct effect on
behavioral intention (β = -0.15, p = .023). Interestingly, both attitude (ATT) and effort
expectancy (EE) were found not significant and did not have a direct effect on behavioral
intention. Only behavioral intention (BI) and altruism (ALT) had a significant direct effect on
faculty members’ actual usage behavior regarding university-based IRs (UB) (β = 0.57 and 0.27,
p < .001 respectively). The other factors, including copyright concerns (CCs), trust toward IRs
(TTIRs), and facilitation condition (FC) were found to be not statistically significant. Altogether,
the model explained 61% of variance (R2 = .61) in both behavioral intention and usage behavior.

Figure 5.4. The hypotheses testing result of the proposed path model.
5.1.6.2 Hypotheses Testing
H1: Faculty members’ attitudes toward IRs were expected to have a significant direct
effect on behavioral intention. Hypothesis H1 was not supported, (β = 0.19, p = .056). As shown
in Figure 5.4, the findings demonstrated that attitude toward IRs did not have a direct effect on
behavioral intention to use university-based IRs on the part of faculty members in the research
universities in Thailand. This indicates that attitude toward IRs did not directly enhance usage

171

intention. This finding is similar to what has been found in Venkatesh et al.’s study (2003),
indicating that attitude does not have a direct influence on behavioral intention due to its
interaction effects with performance expectancy (PE) and effort expectancy (EE).
H2: Performance expectancy was expected to have significant direct effect on behavioral
intention. This hypothesis was supported. According to Figure 5.4, the findings indicated that
performance expectancy had a positive direct effect on faculty members’ behavioral intention to
use university-based IRs, with a standardized path coefficient of 0.31 and a significant p-value
less than .01. This indicates that performance expectancy enhanced usage intention and that
faculty members would use university-based IRs if they found that IRs were useful for their
work.
H3: Effort expectancy was expected to have a significant direct effect on behavioral
intention. H3 was not supported (β = 0.05, p = .510). As can be seen in Figure 5.4, the findings
showed that effort expectancy did not have a direct effect on behavioral intention to use
university-based IRs on the part of faculty members in the research universities in Thailand. This
indicates that effort expectancy did not directly enhance usage intention, and the faculty
members’ adoption of IRs would not depend on the level of ease of use of the system. This
finding is inconsistent with findings in previous studies, particularly studies confirming the
UTAUT model, which proposed that effort expectancy has direct effect on behavioral intention
(Venkatesh et al., 2003). Additionally, in the area of self-archiving, Kim (2008, 2010) found that
additional time and effort had negative direct effects on faculty self-archiving behavior.
H4: Social influence was expected to have a significant direct effect on behavioral
intention. Hypothesis 4 was supported. The findings demonstrated that social influence had a
positive direct effect on faculty members’ behavioral intention to use university-based IRs, with

172

the highest standardized path coefficient of 0.42 (moderate effect) and a significant p-value less
than .001. This indicates that social influence enhanced usage intention, and faculty members’
adoption of university-based IRs would increase if they recognized that other important people,
such as colleagues, leading researchers in their field, their university, and funding agencies,
believed that they should use IRs.
H5: Resistance to change was expected to have a significant direct effect on behavioral
intention. Hypothesis 5 was supported. The findings showed that resistance to change had a
negative direct effect on faculty members’ behavioral intention to use university-based IRs, with
a standardized path coefficient of -0.15 (a weak effect) and a significant p-value less than .05.
This means that faculty members who exhibited higher level of resistance to change were less
intent on trying to use university-based IRs. This finding is similar to that of Oreg (2003), who
found that resistance to change can be used to predict the inclination to adopt new technology or
product.
H6: Altruism was expected to have a significant direct effect on actual usage of IRs. This
hypotheses was supported. As seen in Figure 5.4, altruism had a positive direct effect on faculty
members’ actual usage of university-based IRs, with a standardized path coefficient of 0.27 (a
moderate effect) and a significant p-value less than .001. This indicates that altruism enhanced
usage behavior. The faculty members’ actual usage of IRs was expected to increase if they felt
that posting work on university-based IRs could help other researchers to benefit from their
work. This finding is in line with those of previous studies conducted in different contexts. Kim
(2008, 2010) also found that altruism had positive direct effect on faculty self-archiving
behavior.

173

H7: Copyright concerns were expected to have a significant direct effect on actual usage
of IRs. Hypothesis 7 was not supported (β = 0.01, p = .893). Findings indicated that copyright
concerns did not have a direct effect on faculty members’ actual usage of university-based IRs.
This finding presents a contradiction with the literature in which copyright concerns (CCs) are
frequently cited as a major barrier to self-archiving and to IR contribution (Casey, 2012; Creaser
et al., 2010; Kim, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2011; Singeh et al., 2013b; Swan & Brown, 2005; Xia et al.,
2012).
H8: Faculty members’ trust toward IRs was expected to have a significant direct effect on
their actual usage of IRs. Hypothesis 8 was not supported (β = -0.11, p = .096). The findings
showed that the faculty members’ trust toward university-based IRs did not directly enhance
their actual usage of university-based IRs. As trust in this study is related to issues such as fear of
plagiarism and long-term preservation, it could be concluded that these issues did not directly
contribute to faculty members’ actual usage of university-based IRs.
H9: Facilitating conditions were expected to have a significant direct effect on actual
usage of IRs. Hypothesis 9 was not supported (β = 0.05, p = .497). The findings demonstrated
that facilitation conditions did not have direct effect on faculty members’ actual usage of
university-based IRs. This means that the faculty members’ actual usage of university-based IRs
did not depend on the availability of facilitating conditions such as the Internet or guidance. This
finding stands in contrast to the UTAUT model (Venkatesh et al., 2003) and the findings of
previous studies that indicate that technology and other issues related to technology are
important factors contributing to IR and open access adoption (Ambruster, 2011; Dulle, 2010;
Duranceau & Kriegsman, 2013).

174

H10: The faculty members’ behavioral intention was expected to have a significant direct
effect on actual usage of IRs. Hypothesis 10 was supported. As shown in Figure 5.4, faculty
members’ behavioral intention had a positive direct effect on the actual usage of university-based
IRs, with a standardized path coefficient of 0.57 (a strong effect) and a significant p-value less
than .001. This indicates that the faculty members’ intention to use university-based IRs
enhanced actual usage behavior, and the faculty members’ adoption of university-based IRs
would increase if their intention to use IRs increased. Similarly, the UTAUT model suggests that
behavioral intention has a significant positive effect on an individual’s usage of a particular
technology (Venkatesh et al., 2003).

Three of the five exogenous (predictor) variables were found to have a direct effect on the first
endogenous (dependent) variable, faculty members’ behavioral intention to use university-based
IRs. Taken together, these three exogenous variables accounted for 61% of variance in
behavioral intention (R2 = .61). H2, H4, and H5 were supported, while H1 and H3 were found
not significant and were rejected. Only behavioral intention and altruism were found to have a

175

direct effect on the actual usage of university-based IRs. These two exogenous variables
explained 61% of variance (R2 = .61) in usage behavior. H6 and H10 were supported. Based on
the standardized beta (β) weight, social influence was the strongest predictor of behavioral
intention (β = 0.42, p < .001), while behavioral intention was the strongest predictor of the actual
usage of university-based IRs (β = 0.57, p < .001).
5.1.6.2.1

Model Trimming

According to Kline (2005), the path model can be trimmed based on either empirical or
theoretical re-specifications. For this study, empirical re-specification was employed, meaning
that paths were deleted according to statistical criteria. Briefly, if the path coefficients were not
statistically significant, they were trimmed. This process is continued to identify the final model
that fits the observed data (Kline, 2005, p. 146-147).
Since the proposed research model had poor fit (χ2 (9) = 35.65, p = .000, CMIN = 3.96,
GFI = .98), non-significant paths were eliminated to trim the model. Those paths included 1)
attitude toward IRs to behavioral intention (ATT BI), 2) effort expectancy to behavioral
intention (EE  BI), 3) copyright concerns to usage behavior (CCS  UB), 4) trust toward IRs
to usage behavior (TTIRS  UB), and facilitation condition to usage behavior (FC  UB).
Once each path was trimmed, the trimmed model was retested. This process was continued until
the final trimmed model was identified.
The final model, shown in Figure 5.5, exhibited a better fit to the observed data, χ2 (31) =
49.52, p = .020, CMIN = 1.60, GFI = 0.95, RMR = 0.12. Although the chi-square value of the
final model had increased, the other fit indices had improved. The new model had a ratio of chisquare to the degree of freedom (χ2/df or CMIN) of 1.60 and a goodness-of-fit index (GFI) of
0.95, suggesting that the model had good fit. Therefore, the final model fit the observed data

176

better than did the proposed research model. In addition, deleting non-significant paths also
improved the strengths of the standardized path coefficient (β) weights between the exogenous
(independent) variables and the endogenous (dependent) variables. Although the explained
variance (R2) had decreased throughout the process, altogether the final model explained 52% of
variance (R2 = .52) in behavioral intention and 50 % of variance (R2 = .50) in actual usage
behavior. Based on the final model, SI, PE and RTC were all significant predictors of BI (β =
0.46, p < .001, β = 0.38, p < .001, and β =-0.18, p < .050, respectively). Additionally, both BI
and ALT were significant predictors of UB (β = 0.50 and 0.30, p < .001, respectively).

Qualitative Data Analysis
For the purpose of exploring subjects’ self-archiving behaviors and the reasons behind

their contributions or delay in contributing to university-based IRs in greater detailed, semistructured interview using Skype and semi-structured email interviews were conducted. Among
176 respondents, 26 respondents indicated willingness to participate in follow-up semi-structured
interviews. However, six respondents did not provide contact information. After the recruiting
177

emails were sent to twenty respondents, only five respondents from three universities agreed to
participate in the follow-up interviews. Table 5.66 presents the distribution of interviewees based
on self-archiving experience, whether or not they were IR contributors, academic position, and
discipline.

For the current study, faculty members whose materials were available or deposited in their
university-based IRs were considered as IR contributors. Four interviewees considered
themselves as IR contributors or IR supporters. Among these four interviewees, three of them
had self-archiving experience, while the remaining one interviewee, who was an assistant
professor in library and information science field, did not have self-archiving experience.
However, this interviewee considered herself as an IR contributor, since her scholarly work had
been deposited into the university-based IR by librarians. One interviewee, who was a lecturer in
mathematics and computer science, identified himself as a non-contributor since he had never
deposited any of his work to the Knowledge Bank (the university-based IR); however, he
considered himself as a supporter of the Knowledge Bank and planned to deposit his work in the

178

near future. All three interviewees from the humanities and social sciences fields were from the
field of library and information, including two assistant professors and one instructor. The other
two interviewees were a lecturer in biochemistry and a lecturer in mathematics and computer
science.
5.2.1

Attitudes Toward Open Access
In general, the interviewees had positive attitudes toward open access. However, their

general comments regarding open access were slightly different in each topic. The following
themes emerged from the conversation during the interviews.
5.2.1.1 Open Access Supporters
All five interviewees had heard about open access, supported the principle of open
access, and believed that OA publishing benefited scholarly communication and enhanced the
growth of scientific productivity. This alternative channel of scholarly communication helps
scholars and researchers in different geographic areas to disseminate, access, use, and benefit
from scholarly products freely available in both OA repositories and OA journals. An instructor
from Library and Information Science directly stated, “open access publishing provides
opportunities for scientists, researchers, and others in academia in different geographic locations
to access, use, and benefit from scholarly works free of charge” (IV001). Also, an interviewee
who was a lecturer in Mathematics and computer science supported the general assumption of
open access and explained that:
I support open access since the purpose of open access is for the development of
education and research in the long run. As a scientist and a user of scientific productivity,
I feel that open access repositories are important information sources that offer
opportunities for researchers from around the world to access research papers that are
freely available. In general, open access allows equality of learning and enhances a
research cycle that will support growth in science, particularly in developing countries.
(IV005)

179

One assistant professor from the field of Library and Information Science saw the benefit
of open access and believed that researchers and scholars should engage in open access. She
commented, “there are more benefits to open access, and it is a new type of scholarly
communication that academicians should be engaged in” (IV004).
This shows that the interviewees had positive attitude toward open access and open
access publishing. In addition, all interviewees clearly stated that they were open access
supporters. However, this finding contrasts with the findings of a previous study reporting a low
rate of acceptance of OA publishing among Thai researchers (Klungthanaboon, 2015). This may
be explained by noting that researchers and scholars may have changed their attitude toward
open access publishing due to the global trend toward open access publishing.
5.2.1.2 OA as a Tool for Creating Collective Knowledge
An assistant professor from the LIS field expressed the belief that not only authors
(contributors) but also users or readers benefited from the scholarly products shared through OA
publishing. As a result of this, collective knowledge could be produced. He stated,
I agree with the idea of open access, both green and gold OA. I believe that the more we
share, the more benefits both others and me can gain. This idea also helps authors spread
their work out. The users accessing our work sometimes give us useful comments or
feedback. We can do further research and grow the study areas we are interested in
together. I mean that we can build ‘collective knowledge’ at last. (IW003)
Based on the assumption that knowledge building is regarded as interplay between the
cognitive system and the social system, if a knowledge community uses information and
communication technologies for that purpose, collective knowledge can appear and exist not
only as the fragile product of communication activities within a community but also in a variety
of digital artifacts, including chat log files, wiki articles, and weblog entries (Kimmerle, Cress, &

180

Held, 2010). This assumption about collective knowledge may be used to explain why the
interviewee felt that open access could help to create collective knowledge.
5.2.1.3 OA Publishing as Important Tool for Reducing Information Inequality
Access to quality scholarly productivities such as research reports and peer-reviewed
articles and quality educational materials is essential for the health of education and the growth
of science. However, information inequality exists as a major issue in education, particularly in
developing countries. The emergence of open access in the last decades, the adoption of both
green and gold open access, and the idea of open education have helped to narrow down this gap
between rich and poor countries as well as rich and poor universities. A lecturer from
mathematics and computer science stated,
Posting work in knowledge banks or OA journals allows equality of learning and
enhances the research cycle. This will support the growth in science in general. Also, this
can help other researchers, particulary in poor and developing countries, who may have a
problem with a paywall and have limited access to high quality scholarly articles, to build
upon the existing research freely available in institutional repositories (knowledge
banks), subject repositories, and OA journals. (IV005)
Another lecturer in Biochemistry also stated that free access to scholarly works could
help to narrow the information gap between scientists and researchers working in rich
institutions with the ability to invest in research resources and those working in poor institutions
with a limited budget. The interviewee compared his past experience working in two different
research environments, one in the UK, where he had graduated, and the other in a research
university in Thailand where he was working. He stated,
When I was working as a researcher in a university in the UK, access to high quality
scholarly information was not an issue. But I realize that this issue is becoming more
relevant in the Thai context. I hope that OA can help to narrow this gap. I absolutely
agree with the principle of OA and open access publishing, but I think the implications
and implementation of both open access journals and open access repositories in Thailand
are not there yet. (IV002)

181

It is clear that the interviewees believed that the full implementation of open access
repositories may help to narrow the information gap and solve the issue of information
inequality.
5.2.1.4 Acceptance of Open Access Journals
Although all interviewees expressed overall positive attitudes toward OA publishing,
they had slightly different opinions on open access journals. Both of the interviewees from
Science and Technology fields, including Biochemistry and Mathematics and computer science,
indicated a familiarity with open access journals and expressed an acceptance of this alternative
channel of scholarly communication. The Biochemistry faculty member stated:
When I was studying my PhD in the UK, I worked with the Medical Research Council,
UK. It is compulsory for researchers to make their research available by publishing in
open access journals or depositing their work to open access repositories. Publishing in
open access journals is more common in the UK. Although I prefer to publish in more
prestige journals in my field, publishing in some peer-reviewed and accurate OA journals
such as PLOS Biology and PLOS Medicine is a good idea. (IV002)
In addition, this interviewee had published several papers in open access journals;
including PLOS Biology, PLOS Medicine, Nucleic Acids Research, Biotechnology for Biofuels,
Molecular & Cellular Proteomics, Genome Biology by the BMC, and eLife. He also mentioned:
Publishing in the top open access journals in life science and biomedicine, like PLOS
Biology, is very competitive, since the rejection rates are high. Only outstanding research
papers will get accepted. However, you need to be careful and should not publish in any
open access journals listed in Bell’s list of predatory publishers 2016. (IV002)
A lecturer from Mathematics and computer science expressed similar opinions on open
access journals and predator publishers. Additionally, this interviewee showed a more positive
opinion toward open access journals than traditional journals by stating:
When comparing the two types of scholarly journals, I like open access journals more
than traditional subscription-based journals, since I support the idea of open access. The
term open access journals in this sense refers to only high quality peer-reviewed open
access journals. I know that there are many predatory publishers out there that authors or

182

researchers should be aware of before submitting their work. Personally, I prefer only
high quality OA journals. (IV005)
When comparing open access journals versus institutional repositories, both interviewees
expressed similar opinions, showing that they were more familiar with open access journals than
open access institutional repositories, particularly their university-based IRs. The biochemistry
faculty member stated, “I’m more familiar with the University of Cambridge’s repository.
Honestly, I just became aware of MUIR when I was completing your survey” (IV002). The other
lecturer from mathematics and computer science said:
There are many misunderstandings among faculty members and researchers. I’m one who
does not clearly understand OA publishing. I know that publishing in the Knowledge
Bank and OA journals is different, but have limited understanding of the benefit of
publishing in university-based IRs or the Knowledge Bank in my case. (IV005)
It can be seen clearly from the faculty members’ standpoint that they understand open
access and show a positive attitude toward OA journals. Publishing in high quality open access
journals is acceptable to them. In addition, they are also aware of the negative side of OA
publishing, as both of them mentioned avoiding publishing in journals published by predatory
publishers listed in Bell’s List of Predatory Publishers 2016. However, they expressed
misunderstanding of institutional repositories, particularly their university-based IRs. This
misunderstanding and ambiguity might lead them to delay their adoption. This can be seen from
the statement of a lecturer in mathematics and computer science:
There are some confusion and myths about open access and knowledge banks among us
(faculty members in my faculty). If the faculty members don’t clearly understand what
the PSU Knowledge Bank is and what the benefit of publishing through the knowledge
bank is, they won’t be willing to do so. (IV005)
This finding is consistent with those of the previous study indicating that researchers in
different disciplines have different attitudes toward open access publishing. It appears that none
of the interviewees from the field of library and information sciences mentioned open access

183

journals and had experience publishing in open access journals, although, this group of
respondents represented more knowledge and understanding of open access publishing and its
principles. By contrast, two interviewees who were from biochemistry and mathematics and
computer science were more familiar with open access journal and expressed positive attitude
toward them. Previous study also found that researchers in science and technology fields were
more familiar with open access publishing as compared with those in social sciences and
humanities (Klungthanaboon, 2015).
5.2.2

Self-Archiving Experience
The qualitative data show that among the four interviewees who identified themselves as

IR contributors or IR supporters, only three of them had self-archiving experience. However, the
interviewees expressed both similar and different opinions and concerns on this topic. The
following themes regarding mandated self-archiving, self-archiving culture, venues for selfarchiving, and content types emerged from the discussion with the interviewees.
5.2.2.1 Mandated Self-Archiving vs. Voluntary Self-Archiving
Two different assumptions on mandated self-archiving are found in the literature. While
some researchers believe that self-archiving mandate helps to increase faculty participation and
populate content in institutional repositories, others think that mandatory policy is not the
answer. Since currently, self-archiving in Thailand is completely voluntary, questions regarding
interviewees’ opinions on this topic were posted during the interview to determine whether the
interviewees agreed on this topic. Interestingly, the interviewees expressed different opinions on
this topic. Both a junior lecturer from the LIS field and a lecturer in Mathematics and computer
science supported the mandatory policy and called for a self-archiving mandate. They also
believed that a clear university policy on mandated self-archiving and a reward system could

184

help to increase faculty participation. The former stated several times during the interview that “I
would be willing to deposit my work if the university launched a clear mandate policy asking
faculty members to deposit work in the CUIR and had clear incentives in place” (IV001). A
similar opinion was also expressed by the latter interviewee: “The university should
acknowledge faculty members who deposit work into the knowledge bank and have a clear open
access mandate policy or reward system for those who do so” (IV005).
However, a Biochemistry lecturer showed his disagreement on this issue, stating,
“Libraries/librarians and IR developers should act as facilitators to facilitate communication
between the library and faculty members. Depositing work into the MUIR should not be
compulsory. The library should play a supportive role, not a policy role” (IV002). The same
interviewee also stated that a mandatory policy should be applied to students’ work such as
theses, dissertations, and conference presentations, but a similar procedure might not work for
faculty members. For this interviewee, MUIR was more appropriate as a students’ showcase. It
should be noted that the MUIR is different from other university-based IRs in the current study,
since it houses only faculty work; any theses and dissertations are excluded from the collection.
It is clear that faculty members expressed different views toward mandatory selfarchiving vs. voluntary self-archiving, indicating that both librarians and IR managers/developers
should consider carefully before making any decision on whether to make self-archiving
mandatory.
5.2.2.2 Self-Archiving Culture: Non-common Behavior in Thai Research University Context
Two contrasting opinions were expressed by interviewees in response to the question of
whether making a work publicly available through university-based IRs and other open access
forums is a common behavior. One assistant professor from the field of Library and Information

185

Science opined that this is quite common behavior. She stated, “Making academic works
publicly available through university-based IRs and other open access venues is quite common
behavior in my field” (IV004). On the other hand, four interviewees expressed the idea that selfarchiving work through university-based IRs was not a common behavior. A junior lecturer in
LIS field said:
Depositing work or making work publicly available in both the CUIR and other open
access forums is not a common behavior. Some scholars may view university-based IRs
such as CUIR as an information resource that collects intellectual works of the scholars
within the CU community; however, the majority of them do not consider it as a channel
for scholarly communication. That is a reason why many of them do not deposit and
distribute their work. (IV001)
The other interviewees from Biochemistry and Mathematics and computer science also
mentioned that self-archiving research work to university-based IRs was not a common behavior.
When comparing this behavior with publishing work in OA journals, these two interviewees
agreed that publishing in OA journals was more common in their field and department. The
former (IV002) stated, “Depositing work to the MUIR is not a common behavior. I know some
faculty members publish their paper in OA journals, but I have not heard any faculty in my
department mention MUIR.” Similarly, the latter interviewee mentioned,
I have never known any colleagues that publish their work in the knowledge bank or
other open access venues. This is not a common behavior in my field, I mean in my
faculty and department. Some people mentioned the PSU Knowledge Bank, but they did
not deposit their work in the knowledge bank. I have heard that some people have
published in open access journals. (IV005)
Based on the interviewees’ responses, it is clear that self-archiving work in universitybased IRs is not a common behavior in the Thai research university context. However,
publishing work in OA journals, which are Gold Open Access is more common, especially for
faculty members from the science and technology fields. Both interviewees from the science and

186

technology fields stated that this behavior was more common in their field and also showed
positive attitudes toward OA journals.
5.2.2.3 Venues for Self-Archiving
5.2.2.3.1

University-based IRs

The major focus of this study was to investigate whether the faculty members in Thai
research universities had deposited their work in university-based IRs. Findings from the
quantitative data analysis (Table 5.11) show that only a small proportion of the respondents (44
out of 176, 25%) had deposited their work through university-based IRs. Findings from the
qualitative part also show similar pattern. It is interesting to note that although all interviewees
had positive attitudes toward open access and considered themselves as IR contributors (n = 4),
none of them had experienced posting their works to institutional repositories established by
their respective universities. Two faculty members, one from LIS and the other from the field of
biochemistry, mentioned that they had experienced depositing their dissertations to into the IRs
of the universities where they graduated. For these two interviewees, depositing their
dissertations into the university-based IR was a university requirement. A lecturer from
biochemistry stated, “I have experienced posting my dissertation to Apollo, previously known as
DSpace@Cambridge. There is a university policy requiring all PhD students to deposit their
work into the repositories” (IV002). Although these two interviewees did not have experience
self-archiving their work into university-based IRs, they expressed their interest in universitybased IRs and mentioned that they might consider depositing their work in the near future under
some conditions and factors regarding benefit, ease of use, and copyright. In addition, the other
interviewee from mathematics and computer science identified himself as non-contributor but
stated that he supported the development of the PSU Knowledge Bank, the university-based IR

187

developed by Prince of Songkla University, and was considering depositing his work in the near
future. It is clear that university-based IRs have not been widely accepted and used for selfarchiving by scholars in Thai research universities. However, the interviewees also mentioned
other venues in which they have self-archived their works or in which they planned to selfarchive in the future, including social networking sites and disciplinary repositories.
5.2.2.3.2

Social Networking Sites

Recently, there have been growing numbers of social networking sites available for
scholars and researchers to disseminate their work and communicate with other researchers. Two
popular sites are Academia.edu and ResearchGate.net. Findings from the quantitative part of the
current study (Figure 5.2) show that respondents cited a number of social networking sites as
venues for self-archiving, including ResearchGate.net, Facebook, Academia.edu, and Google
Scholar. Among these social networking sites, ResearchGate.net seems to be the most popular
site, mentioned by seven respondents in the survey. This social networking site was also the only
social networking site mentioned by three interviewees. Those interviewees were: a junior
lecturer in biochemistry who mentioned that he had self-archived his current research on this site
(IV002); a junior lecturer in LIS who was a member of ResearchGate but had never published
any work (IV001); and an assistant professor in the LIS field who was actively engaged in this
social networking site and currently self-archived his work, which was a conference paper to
ResearchGate.net (IV003).
While the first two interviewees did not mention anything in particular about this social
networking site, the latter interviewee (IV003) provided a more detailed explanation regarding
how he started participating in this site and the reasons behind his decision. The interviewee
mentioned that participating in ResearchGate.net allowed him to communicate with other

188

scholars and researchers in LIS and other related fields, and this site also allowed him to track
the latest work of those researchers, their publications, and the sources that they had cited. This
interviewee said,
A number of academics, researchers, and colleagues of mine, who were already
ResearchGate.net members, are the reason for my choice of ResearchGate.net. I found
that this site suits my primary purpose in terms of regularly connecting to the scholarly
community in the field of information studies. (IV003)
Based on this quote, it appears that the popularity of the site among researchers in the IS
field and peer-influence are the primary reasons why this interviewee preferred using a social
networking site such as ResearchGate.net over CUIR (a university-based IR developed by his
university). Another reason was Web 2.0 user interface features that allowed him to easily
upload and disseminate his works through the site. However, there were some negative sides of
social networking sites mentioned by interviewees, including issues relating to long-term
preservation and access (IV003) and to such sites’ ability to increase communication with peers
or other researchers (IV001). The latter issue was mentioned by a junior lecturer in the LIS since
she didn’t believe that actively engaging in social networking sites could help to increase
communication with peers.
5.2.2.3.3

Disciplinary Repositories-bioRxiv

For some disciplines such as physics and mathematics, self-archiving preprint research
articles is a disciplinary norm. Findings from the quantitative part of this study (Figure 5.2) show
that among 61 faculty members who had made their work publicly available on the Internet, six
mentioned depositing work into subject-based or disciplinary repositories, including Pubmed,
BiomedCentral, London School of Economics, and Political Science. None of them mentioned
arXiv and bioRxiv. However, the interview data show that a faculty member from biochemistry
showed his interest in disciplinary repositories, particularly bioRxiv (http://biorxiv.org/), a

189

preprint server in life sciences and other related fields. He also mentioned that different from
physicists and mathematicians, life scientists and biologists did not have a preprint culture.
However, in the past few years, the depositing of unpublished preprints in bioRxiv has become a
norm in biology and life sciences. He also expressed his interest in depositing his work in
bioRxiv in the future, since depositing work in bioRxiv provides a chance for researchers to
distribute their research findings immediately to the scientific community. The interviewee
mentioned:
Some disciplines, such as Physics, have arXiv.org for archiving and disseminating
research papers before they are published in peer-review journals. Recently, we have
bioRxiv (http://biorxiv.org/), which is the preprint server for biology, where authors can
post unpublished preprints in life sciences to make their findings immediately available
and get feedback from the community before submitting their final versions to journals.
(IV002)
Clearly the interviewee valued the benefits that he could gain from depositing work into
disciplinary repositories and getting feedback from scholars in the same fields, who had similar
research interests. He also had favorable opinion toward disciplinary repositories regarding
plagiarism issues, as he indicated by stating:
I think there is no need to worry about plagiarism. If you post your work to bioRxiv or
other discipline-based repositories such as arXiv, you will have your name and date of
publication on your published work. Therefore, other researchers know that you are the
first author working on this research area. (IV002)
Similar findings were made in Kim’s (2008) study. According to Kim (2008), two
professors in her study were not worried about plagiarism, since when they posted or deposited
their work to arXiv, the date and time would appear in their pre-printed articles. As a result,
plagiarism was not an issue for self-archiving pre-printed research findings in disciplinary-based
IRs.

190

BioRxiv was launched in 2013 and has been embraced by some pioneers in life sciences.
Recently, its collection has expanded to cover all aspect of research in life sciences, and about
3,100 preprints have been deposited since it was launched (Callaway & Powell, 2016). The
increased interest of biologists toward publishing preprints in disciplinary repositories such as
bioRxiv may be explained by the success of the preprint culture of the pioneers in physics and
mathematics. In addition, during the past few years, many major scientific journal publishers in
biology have begun to allow researchers to preprint their manuscripts. Those publishers include
Nature, Science, PLOS, Elsevier, and Springer. Additionally, some open access journals have
launched their own preprint server. PeerJ has launched its own preprint server, called ‘PeerJ
Preprint’ (https://peerj.com/preprints). To date, the total number of submissions has reached
2,314 preprint manuscripts. All of these contribute to the increasing interest in self-archiving on
the part of researchers, particularly in the science and technology disciplines.
5.2.2.3.4

Content Types

Although four out of five interviewees identified themselves as IR contributors, as some
of their works had been made available through university-based IRs, none of them had had
experience in self-archiving their works in university-based IRs. However, this group of
interviewees and the other interviewee who considered himself as a non-contributor expressed
different opinions and concerns regarding content types that they considered depositing in IRs in
the near future, including peer reviewed articles, teaching materials, conference papers,
presentations, posters, and data sets.
5.2.2.3.4.1 Peer Reviewed Articles
At the time of the study, none of interviewees had self-archived peer reviewed articles in
their university-based IRs. However, all of them stated that they would prefer to deposit only

191

quality work such as peer reviewed articles and research reports, particularly the final versions,
in the future. A lecturer from library and information sciences stated, “I would deposit only
quality work such as peer reviewed articles and research reports, since these two types of work
have already been peer-reviewed. The quality of work is the most important factor affecting my
decision to deposit my work” (IV001). Similarly, a lecturer from biochemistry said, “For MUIR,
I agree to deposit the final version of my paper (a published version), if it is allowed by
publishers” (IV002). This interviewee also mentioned that he had published many articles in peer
reviewed open access journals and knew that some journals, such as PLoS One, Nucleic Acids
Research, and Biotechnology for Biofuels, supported open access and allowed authors to selfarchive their work in other open access repositories, including university-based IRs. However, he
had not self-archived his peer-reviewed articles in MUIR at the time. Although his two final
versions of peer-reviewed articles were made available in MUIR, he stated that he had not selfarchived them. That work had been done by the MU librarian. The interviewee also stated that he
would be willing to contribute if he were contacted by a librarian and if the deposition process
did not require more time and effort. Based on the interviewee opinion, personal contact with
faculty is a good strategy for the promotion of IRs, as one interviewee stated that he would be
willing to contribute if he were contacted by a librarian.
A lecturer in mathematics and computer science also mentioned that he would be willing
to deposit his final work (a publisher’s version/PDF) into the PSU Knowledge Bank in the near
future if he were published in BMJ, which allows authors to publish under a non-exclusive
license. Therefore, authors can use articles for non-commercial purposes without seeking
permission from the publisher.

192

It appears that all interviewees intended to deposit only final versions of their work into
university-based IRs. However, some of them also expressed concerns and uncertainty
concerning whether it was legal to post a final version of their work (publisher’s versions/PDFs)
into university-based IRs. As a result, some faculty members, such as a lecturer from
biochemistry and a lecturer from mathematics and computer science, indicated that they would
be willing to deposit work published in open access journals that supported self-archiving, so
they would not have to deal with the legal issue.
5.2.2.3.4.2 Teaching Materials
The survey data show that a small number of respondents had made course
materials/lecture notes and course syllabi publicly available on university-based IRs (Figure 5.1)
and other venues (Figure 5.3). A similar pattern was found in the analysis of the interview data.
None of interviewees had made their course-related material available in such a venue.
Particularly, two interviewees, one a lecturer in library and information science and the other a
lecturer in biochemistry, stated that they would not agree to post course-related or teaching
materials in university-based IRs or other publicly accessible web sites. These two interviewees
provided different reasons. The faculty member from the LIS field stated, “I don’t want to
deposit teaching material such as Power Point Presentations or other course materials into the
CUIR, since the materials are dynamic and constantly changing over time” (IV001). This
interviewee also expressed concerns regarding the third-party copyright materials that she had
utilized in her teaching materials.
Rather than the dynamic nature of teaching materials and copyright concerns, the
biochemistry lecturer discussed an interesting case concerning students’ use of teaching

193

materials available online. Actually, he had been afraid that if students could get access and
download course materials more easily they might avoid coming to class. He stated:
I would not agree to publish teaching materials or course-related materials, since students
can get them more easily. If they can access and download course materials or examples
of previous exams from MUIR, they might not come to class. There was an example for
this issue. Recently, some Pre-med students decided not to come to class since they could
download lectures, recorded from the previous year, from the e-learning system. I don’t
want to deal with this issue in my classes. (IV002)
The interviewee was extremely concerned about this issue and thought that it could
provoke conflicts between teachers and students. To resolve this issue, the interviewee thought
that “MUIR should not allow the faculty members to post any course-related materials” (IV002).
It is clear that copyright concerns, the dynamic nature of teaching materials, and issues
related to how students make use of teaching materials are three major factors that make faculty
members reluctant to post teaching materials. Two faculty members preferred to keep teaching
materials private rather than make them publicly available on university-based IRs or any other
open access repositories, although these faculty members identified themselves as contributors
and supported the development of university-based IRs and the principle of open access.
5.2.2.3.4.3 Conference Papers
While the survey data analysis showed that only one respondent, who was an IR
contributor, had self-archived a conference paper to a university-based IR, three interviewees
mentioned conference papers as another type of research-related content for self-archiving.
Interestingly, none of the interviewees had self-archived conference papers in IRs hosted by their
respective universities, while some of them self-archive conference paper in other venues.
Particularly, an assistant professor in the LIS field had posted his recent conference paper to
ResearchGate.net. The other lecturer in a similar discipline mentioned that a conference paper of
which she was a co-author was available in Purdue e-Pubs (http://docs.lib.purdue.edu/), an open

194

access repository held by Purdue University Libraries. She noted that this conference paper was
self-archived by her co-authors.
While a lecturer in biochemistry indicated that he had never self-archived his own
conference papers to university-based IRs or other open access venues, he agreed that selfarchiving conference papers and posters in university-based IRs might be an alternative way for
a research showcase. This interviewee said:
In my opinion, an institutional repository, particularly MUIR, is appropriate for archiving
ongoing research work, including other research-related work such as conference
presentations or posters of faculty. Students’ work such as dissertations and theses,
conference papers/posters, and other kinds of work should be accepted. (IV002)
This interviewee also showed willingness to share his conferences papers and
presentations and stated that if his university-based IR accepted this type of research-related
work. He also stated that he would like to encourage his students to share their papers and
posters. It should be noted that currently neither faculty members’ conference
presentations/posters nor students’ research-related work were allowed for self-archiving in
MUIR.
The interviewees cited a number of reasons including perceived benefits of self-archiving
conference papers as a research showcase for a work in progress (IV002) and the perceived
absence of any negative impact from self-archiving conference papers, particularly copyright
issues (IV003), as reasons why they had self-archived or were willing to self-archive this type of
research-related work in such a venue.
5.2.2.3.4.4 Data Sets
Although there is a growing interest in research data sharing at a global level and selfarchiving research data has become a common behavior and norm in particular disciplines such
as ecology and molecular biology, findings from the quantitative part of this study show that

195

depositing data sets in not only university-based IRs but also other open venues was not a
common practice in the Thai research university context. None of the IR contributors had made
data sets available in university-based IRs (Figure 5.1), and only one respondent from the
computer science field had made a data set available through any other public accessible venue
(Figure 5.3). Similarly, the interview data show that only an interviewee in biochemistry
expressed his intention to engage in self-archiving of research data, since his research involved
creating a huge data set. Additionally, the interviewee cited the increasing concerns related to
research data sharing within the scientific community as another reason why he was considering
depositing and sharing his research data. The interviewee indicated by stating:
To date, some scientific journals, as Nature, have declared their stand toward data
sharing. Open access journals, such as ScientificData, have started accepting and
publishing data sets. Also, there is a trend in scientific data sharing. Scientists in many
fields have begun sharing data, including in biology and biomedical science. It would be
great if we could put our data in a safe place. (IV002)
Although this interviewee declared his intention to deposit a data set into the universitybased IR developed by his respective university in the near future, he expressed concern
regarding the quality of university-based IR and doubts about whether he could trust the system.
Additionally, the interviewee also mentioned issues related to human subjects and clinical data,
which are very sensitive data. He mentioned, “If the university-based IR will allow faculty
members to self-archive this type of data in the future, it is essential that they make clear policy
regarding this issue and make sure that librarians can deal with it” (IV002).
Other interviewees, including three interviewees (two assistant professors and one
lecturer) in the LIS field and another lecturer in mathematics and computer science, had never
self-archived data sets and did not have any plan regarding this issue. All of them stated that their

196

research did not involve creating huge data sets as was the case for other faculty and researchers
in other science fields.
5.2.3

Factors Hindering or Motivating Self-Archiving
Each of the interviewees showed both similar and different opinions concerning

university-based IRs and factors hindering or motivating them to deposit their work, opinions
which are examined and discussed in the following section.
5.2.3.1 Trustworthiness
For the current study, trust toward IRs was proposed as an important factor affecting
faculty members’ decisions to deposit work in university-based IRs. However, this factor was
found not significant (β = -0.11, p = .096). Contrast with the quantitative findings, most
interviewees mentioned trustworthiness as an important factor in decisions regarding
contribution to university-based IRs. A senior lecturer in the LIS field mentioned trustworthiness
as a reason behind her decision to contribute. She stated, “CUIR is trustworthy, and the system is
reliable” (IV004). Similarly, the junior lecturer in LIS emphasized trustworthiness and ranked
trust toward IRs as the first important factor that would affect her decision to contribute to the
CUIR and other open access repositories in the near future. This interviewee stated, “the
accuracy and trustworthiness of an IR can affect my decision whether to deposit my work in a
particular venue such as the CUIR or other open access repositories” (IV001). This also can be
interpreted to mean that failing to establish trust among faculty members toward IRs may delay
their participation in them. A junior lecturer in biochemistry whose research involved creating a
huge data set expressed concern about this issue and compared two university-based IRs, one
developed by the university where he graduated and the other operated by his respective

197

university, while he was talking about archiving scholarly work and research data in universitybased IRs:
An archiving system such as MUIR can be a good archiving system for scholarly work,
like the one in Cambridge. However, the University of Cambridge’s repository has been
established for a long time and the system is stable and can guarantee long-term
accessibility and preservation. If MUIR or other open access repositories in Thailand had
equal quality, I would be the first one to contribute and publish my work, I mean work
that has never been published anywhere else, including research data. … It would be
great if we could put our data in a safe place. I don’t know if I can archive my research
data in MUIR, and also I wonder whether I can trust the system. (IV002)
It is clear that scholars in the Thai research university context also emphasized
trustworthiness of IRs and viewed it as an essential factor that might affect their decision
whether to contribute or deposit their work in an IR. This finding is in line with that of other
previous studies conducted in different contexts. Kim (2008) also found that some interviewees
in her study expressed concern about the issue of trust, and the low level of trust made them
hesitate to self-archive in IRs.
5.2.3.2 Ease of Use and Additional Time and Effort
For the current study, ease of use was regarded as one factor that might affect faculty
members’ decisions to deposit their work into university-based IRs; however, results from the
quantitative analysis failed to identify this factor as important factor affecting faculty acceptance
and use of university-based IRs. In the discussion with the interviewees, two faculty members
who had self-archiving experience expected the content deposition process to be easy. A lecturer
from the LIS field noted that she had had a difficult time understanding guidance for depositing
work. The interviewee recalled her experience when she self-archived her dissertation in the IR
of the university where she graduated: “I think the content deposition is a somewhat complicated
process. I have had a difficult time understanding the guidance, since it was written in English. I
expected the deposition process to be easy” (IV001). The other lecturer from biochemistry noted,

198

“The depositing process of the institutional repository where I graduated is very easy, simple,
and straight-forward. I did it myself. I uploaded the PDF file of my dissertation and typed in
some metadata fields. That’s all.” The interviewee continued:
I spent no more than ten minutes depositing my dissertation to the University of
Cambridge Repository. If an author would like to deposit something, it should be easy.
Personally, if the depositing process of the MUIR takes more than ten minutes, I’ll
probably ask my student assistant to do it for me. (IV002)
It is clear that this interviewee was concerned with not only ease of use but also
additional time and effort that he would spend in the content deposition process. The other
assistant professor in LIS field, who self-archived his work in ResearchGate.net, said, “The
ReseachGate.net provides me with an easily understandable interface like other social
networking sites I meet in everyday life. There is no need to read any instructions before use. I
can upload my work effortlessly” (IV003). He also clearly stated that he would be willing to
deposit his work if the repository of his respective university were developed based on Web 2.0
technology and was easy to use. The interviewee stated, “It would be preferable to its rivals if the
university-based IR (CUIR) was developed in Web 2.0 form like ResearchGate.net” (IV003). It
is clear that the interviewee valued ResearchGate.net due to its ease of use. This interviewee also
mentioned that he would continue self-archiving his work in that social networking site so that
he could stay connected with his colleagues in the LIS field.
Like the IR contributors, a non-contributor from mathematics and computer science with
no self-archiving experience also agreed that an easy content depositing process could help in
recruiting and encouraging some faculty members to become engaged in depositing work.
Thus, not only interviewees with previous self-archiving experience but also an
interviewee without self-archiving experience expected the content deposition process of
university-based IRs to be easy and to require little additional time and effort. Additionally, a

199

Web 2.0-like user interface was suggested as an approach for designing and improving the user
interface of university-based IRs.
Regarding the interviewees’ past experience with self-archiving, it is clear that all
contributors expected the content depositing process to be easy. It may be assumed that ease of
use in the content depositing system may help to motivate faculty members to deposit their work.
In other words, additional time and effort required to deposit work can be considered as a major
barrier to self-archiving, and this barrier may delay faculty members’ decisions to contribute to
university-based IRs. One interviewee clearly explained his concerns regarding this issue. A
similar pattern was also found in previous studies. For instance, Kim (2008) identified extra time
and effort as a barrier to participants’ self-archiving practices, and this issue tended to be
mentioned in connection with the technical skills necessary for self-archiving. However, extra
time and effort in Kim’s (2008) study were mentioned by interviewees who had no self-archiving
experience. In the current study, conducted in a different context, additional time and effort in
content deposition were mentioned by faculty members having previous experience depositing
their works in both university-based IRs and social networking sites like ResearchGate.net. It is
clear that based on their past experience, this group of faculty members still preferred an
uncomplicated submission process that did not require additional time and effort. This finding is
also similar to that of a previous study conducted in the same context. In the study of
stakeholders’ perspectives on institutional repositories in the National Research University in
Thailand, Klungthanaboon (2015) identified the complicated submission process and additional
time and workload as barriers to self-archiving and participation in university-based IRs. In
addition, technical skills seem not to be an issue since none of the interviewees in the current

200

study mentioned this issue. This might be due to the fact that most interviewees in the current
study were junior faculty members and had the skills necessary to deal with content deposition.
5.2.3.3 Global Visibility and Popularity of IRs
One major objective for developing and implementing institutional repositories is to
create global visibility for the host institutions and research by their faculty. One assistant
professor in the LIS field who considered herself as an IR contributor mentioned global visibility
as one important factor that affected her decision to make her work available through a
university-based IR, the CUIR. This interviewee mentioned, “I decided to make my academic
work available in CUIR, since it can be globally and publicly accessible” (IV004). Additionally,
global visibility was mentioned along with the popularity of IRs or other venues by a lecturer
(IV001) and by another assistant professor (IV003) in the LIS field. The former mentioned that
she considered the popularity of IRs or other venues as an important factor affecting her decision
on whether to contribute, since it will help to increase the visibility of work after it is deposited
(IV001). The assistant professor (IV003) also mentioned the popularity of the source and global
visibility of work after it had been deposited as a factor in his decision to actively engage in
ResearchGate.net. He stated, “I have deposited my work in ResearcGate.net because it makes my
papers known in the global online community of the IS field” IV003. It can be concluded from
the conversation with these two interviewees that both of them were concerned that the IR
developed by their respective university lacked this advantage, since it was not fully open access
as were other university-based IRs. This may be interpreted to mean that, if a university-based IR
is not popular and does not have the potential to increase the visibility of its institution or the
institution’s faculty’s research, it is less likely to gain any attention from its community,
particularly from faculty members.

201

5.2.3.4 Benefit: Academic Reward
All interviewees mentioned that posting or self-archiving their scholarly work, such as
journal articles, research reports, and teaching-related materials, was not a priority task for them
and that they did not see any benefit of posting or self-archiving their work. For all of them,
depositing work to university-based IRs was absolutely voluntary; therefore, they did not want to
put in effort without seeing any benefit, particularly clear academic rewards. A junior lecturer in
LIS stated, “I don’t see any benefit of depositing work in the CUIR. Doing so also requires more
work and effort, so many faculty members do not want to get involved” (IV001). The
interviewee continued, “Many faculty members in the CU community do not perceive any
benefits and do not consider it as important or as a high priority task. That is one reason why
many of them do not deposit and distribute their work” (IV001).
The benefit of self-archiving in a university-based IR was also mentioned by a
biochemistry lecturer. The interviewee expressed the idea that merely promoting the positive
impact of self-archiving in terms of increased citation rates might not be enough: “the library
should clearly state how we as faculty members can benefit from depositing our work, in terms
of academic rewards” (IV002).
Additionally, another interviewee, who was a lecturer in mathematics and computer
science without any self-archiving experience, also expressed a similar opinion regarding this
issue, saying, “If the faculty members don’t clearly understand what the knowledge bank is and
what the benefit of publishing through the knowledge bank is, they won’t be willing to do so”
(IV005).
It is likely that a clear mandatory policy that addressed clear academic rewards could help
to deal with this issue. A junior lecturer from the LIS field stated:

202

In my opinion, the university mandatory policy on open access and self-archiving has a
direct effect on faculty members’ decisions about whether to deposit their work. As I’ve
said, a clear reward system can motivate faculty members to deposit their work. The
reward system may include but not be limited to giving credits for self-archiving, using
self-archiving as one indicator for evaluation, or recognizing and acknowledging those
who contribute to the CUIR. (IV001)
A similar opinion on rewarding systems was also expressed by a lecture in mathematics
and computer sciences, who stated, “The University should acknowledge faculty members who
deposit work into the knowledge bank and have a clear policy or reward system for those who do
so” (IV005).
Based on the interviewees’ opinions, it is concluded that faculty members value benefits,
especially in the form of an academic reward system. The academic reward systems proposed by
interviewees include giving credit or acknowledging those who self-archive and using selfarchiving as an indicator for evaluation. The appropriate reward system could not only help to
increase the uptake of IRs but also help to populate their content.
5.2.3.5 Altruism
In this study, altruism refers to faculty members’ altruistic motivation to self-archive.
This factor was measured based on the extent to which faculty members reported having a clear
perception of the principle of open access and having notions about helping others to access and
build on research work, particularly those who had difficulties in accessing scholarly work.
Three interviewees mentioned that open access and self-archiving scholarly work in OA
repositories allowed other researchers to benefit from that work. A junior lecturer in LIS stated,
“Open access publishing provides opportunities for scientists, researchers, and others in
academia in different geographic locations to access, use, and benefit from scholarly work free of
charge” (IV001). The other assistant professor in the same field, who supported open access and
had benefited from using work shared by other scholars, strongly believed that the more they

203

shared the more they gained. This interviewee thought that “we can do research further and grow
the study areas we are interested in together” (IV003).
In addition, a lecturer from mathematics and computer sciences pointed out that as both
teacher and scientist, he had benefited from unrestricted access to research work and teaching
materials. The interviewee said:
As I am a teacher and researcher, unrestricted access to research work and teaching
materials allows me to access and benefit from using those materials not only in classes
but also in my research without worrying about the paywall system. As a scientist and a
user of scientific productivity, I feel that open access repositories are important
information sources that offer oppotunities for researchers from around the world to
access research papers that are freely available. In general, OA allows equality of
learning and enhances a research cycle that will support growth in science, particularly in
developing countries. (IV005)
This interviewee concluded that the principle of open access was essential and said that
his belief that local researchers should benefit from his public funded research motivated him to
share his works with other researchers, not only in the university community but also at the local
and the global level. This was the reason that he planned to self-archive his work in a universitybased IR if he could publish in an OA journal. The interviewee stated:
I agree that making my work publicly accessible on the web or any other open access
venues can help other researchers to build on my research, particularly researchers in
Thailand and other developing countries in Asia and Africa and other areas around the
world. (IV005)
Similar to the previous study by Kim (2008), the current study also found that faculty
members were encouraged by reciprocal altruism more than by true altruism. Reciprocal altruism
happens when “scholars or researchers want to reciprocate after receiving benefits from using
OA content by giving back to other researchers through self-archiving their research” (Kim,
2008, p. 192).

204

5.2.3.6 Copyright Concerns
For the survey part of this study, the respondents’ copyright concerns were measured by a
set of questions regarding whether the respondents agreed that 1) they needed to ask permission
from publishers to post their work on university-based IRs, 2) they might infringe on copyright if
they posted their work on university-based IRs without permission, 3) they needed to ask for
permission from co-authors or collaborators to post their work on university-based IRs, and 4)
they could not publish their works if they posted them on university-based IRs before
publication. Results indicated that copyright concerns did not have a significant direct effect on
faculty members’ actual usage of university-based IRs (β = 0.01, p = .893).
In the qualitative part of this study, all of the interviewees expressed concerns and
uncertainty regarding copyright issue. One interviewee, a lecturer in LIS, cited copyright issues
as the most important factor for her to consider before posting or depositing her work. She stated
“I am concerned about the copyright issue. If I would like to deposit my work, I would probably
consider the publisher’s policies on open access. This is the most important factor that affects my
decision as an author whether to deposit a piece of work” (IV001).
Specifically, one lecturer from the LIS field expressed concern regarding 3rd party
copyright materials and whether it was legal to post dissertations or other research-related
materials with 3rd party copyright materials, such as images and diagrams. She stated, “I’ve done
the depositing work by myself. However, I had an issue about the 3rd party copyright materials,
particularly images and diagrams, to be included in my dissertation” (IV001).
Some of interviewees also felt uncertainty regarding whether it was legal to post the final
versions of their work (publisher’s versions/PDFs) to university-based IRs (IV002 and IV005). A
lecturer from biochemistry explained:

205

My concern is about the copyright issue. I wonder if I could post the final PDF versions
of my work on MUIR. I just know that if my papers were published in OA journals, I
could get them linked to my profile in social media sites such as ResearchGates right
away. (IV002)
Since these two interviewees did not want violate the copyright issue, they indicated that
they would be willing to deposit work published in open access journals that supported selfarchiving, so they did not have to deal with the legal issue. For instance, a lecturer from
biochemistry mentioned that if he were contacted by the librarian, he would be willing to post
published versions of his articles published in open access journals to MUIR. A mathematics and
computer science lecturer also stated that he planned to deposit a final version of his article to the
PSU Knowledge Bank, if he were to be published in BMJ (British Medical Journal), which
allows authors to publish under a non-exclusive license.
The interviewees were asked whether they had been aware of the existence of
SHERPA/RoMEO (http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/index.php), where they can check publisher
copyright and self-archiving policies by themselves. All interviewees who were faculty members
in the LIS field had been aware of that site, while faculty members from both biochemistry and
mathematics and computer science had not heard about it. A junior lecturer from the LIS field
pointed out:
Some faculty may have concerns about some issues such as copyright, publisher policy,
and funding agency policy, but they may not have time to learn more about these issues
since depositing work in CUIR is not a high-priority task. If the library/librarians want to
populate IR collections, they should work actively to help faculty members to resolve
these issues.
A faculty member from biochemistry also mentioned that it would be beneficial if the
library could help faculty members to check with publisher policies on self-archiving. Findings
from the follow-up interview indicate that the copyright issue seems to be the most important
issue that concerns all interviewees. Both IR contributors and non-contributors were uncertain

206

whether they were allowed to make published materials accessible on university-based IRs. It
also appears that tools like SHERPA/RoMEO that can help authors to check publisher
information were not widely known, particularly among faculty members in other disciplines. It
is essential that libraries promote this tool or take responsibility to learn about publisher policy
on open access and self-archiving on the behalf of faculty members.
5.2.3.7 Long-Term Preservation and Access
One objective that drives an institution to develop institutional repository is to provide
long-term preservation and access for the digital assets of its community. However, findings
from the qualitative data analysis in this study showed that interviewees had different opinions
regarding long-term preservation. Three interviewees agreed that in general depositing work to
university-based IRs or other open access forums provided safety (long-term preservation) and
long-term accessibility for scholarly work. While an assistant professor in LIS mentioned that
long-term preservation depended on the data curation plan and policy of each university, a junior
lecturer in the same field expressed the view that the institutional repository developed by her
respective university failed to address issues related to long-term preservation. She said:
The CUIR neither provided any information regarding this issue nor mentioned any plan
for long-term preservation. Therefore, I’m not sure whether they have any plan for longterm preservation. (IV001)
By contrast, a lecturer in mathematics and computer science strongly believed that the
university-based IR was a source for long-term preservation for both the journal articles and the
research papers of its community. The interviewee gave an example:
In some cases when you publish your work with some publishers, if those publishers stop
publishing journals that they have published or if the library discontinues subscription to
online databases or journals due to financial constraints, users will no longer to be able to
access their work.

207

The interviewee then concluded that this issue could be solved by the depositing of work
in university-based IRs. It is interesting that although this interviewee did not have self-archiving
experience, he had positive opinions about self-archiving in university-based IRs.
Alongside the interviewees’ opinions on long-term preservation by means of universitybased IRs, an assistant professor in LIS who had self-archived his work on a social networking
site addressed the issue of long-term preservation of work on social networking sites. He stated,
“Honestly, I used to worry about this issue. Because of the popularity of ResearchGate.net, I
hope it will last long enough. All my work is regularly uploaded on GoogleDrive as a back-up”
(IV003).
It is clear that interviewees expressed concerns regarding long-term preservation in both
university-based IRs and social networking sites. Despite the fact that university-based IRs in
this study have been operated for a long period of time, some of them still did not have a long
term preservation plan in place. If one of the major aims of university-based IRs is for long-term
preservation and access for the digital assets of its community, an absence of a clear preservation
plan may create confusion. Yakel et al. (2013) noted that the guarantees of preservation and
sustainability are important factors to all IRs stakeholders, particularly for faculty members. The
current study confirmed that long-term preservation should not be ignored. It should be
considered as a motivating factor for IRs contribution. It is essential for academic libraries and
other IRs developers to explicitly state the strategy for long-term preservation and sustainability
of the IRs to the users or designated communities, which can help to establish trust in IRs. This
in turn will lead to more deposition and use. On the other hand, uncertainty regarding the longterm preservation and sustainability of scholarly content and IRs themselves might make some
authors reluctant to deposit their work into IRs.

208

5.2.3.8 Social Influence
Results from the quantitative part of this study revealed that social influence is an
important factor that affected faculty members’ behavioral intention to use university-based IRs
(β = 0.46, p < .001). Findings from the interviews supported the quantitative part. Some
interviewees’ intention to participate in social networking sites was influenced by their peers and
funding agencies. For instance, an assistant professor in LIS field mentioned that he was
encouraged by his supervisor to participate in social networking sites. This interviewee stated
“my ex-PhD supervisor invited me online to join ResearchGate.net” (IV003). Additionally, peer
pressure appears to be an important reason that made this interviewee continue to actively
engage in this social networking site. He mentioned, “a number of academics, researchers, and
colleagues of mine, who have already been ResearchGate.net members, are a reason for my
choice of ResearchGate.net” (IV003).
A lecturer in biochemistry explained that his decision to publish in open access sources
when he was studying in the UK was a result primarily of peer pressure. He stated:
The university policy, faculty members (particularly my supervisor), and colleagues’
thoughts about open access influenced me to publish in open access resources. (IV002)
By contrast, this interviewee mentioned that peer pressure did not currently affect him
since “in Thailand publishing in either open access journals or repositories is not a common
behavior” (IV002).
The context of self-archiving also appears to be an important factor relating to peer
pressure. The interviewees were also asked whether their funding agencies affected their
decision to self-archive. Only a lecturer from biochemistry responded to this question, stating:
I worked with the Medical Research Council, UK, while I was studying for my PhD. It is
compulsory for researchers to make their research available by publishing in open access
journals or depositing that work to open access repositories. The funding agency also

209

provides support for all publication cost (the author-pay model). Different from the UK,
in Thailand the funding agencies do not provide support for publication, particularly for
open access journals, and do not ask researchers to self-archive their works in open
access. I’m not aware of any funding agency policy that supports open access or open
access publishing in Thailand (IV002).
However, two interviewees, an assistant professor and a junior lecturer in LIS field from
the same university, perceived no influence from either peers and faculty or the department
regarding self-archiving. Both of them considered themselves as contributors. Their work was
deposited to university-based IR by librarians. An assistant professor stated:
Other people’s opinions do not affect my decision to deposit my works to CUIR, since I
already know the advantage of using the institutional repository. The opinions of other
people such as university, faculty, and department do not affect my decision to make my
works available. (IV004).
Similarly, a junior lecturer stated “In the case of CUIR, depositing work into CUIR is
absolutely voluntary. Other people’s opinions do not affect my decision” (IV001).
Findings from the qualitative part showed that social influence affected only some
interviewees and can be used to explain their intention to self-archive or share their work through
other open access venues in some cases. Since self-archiving or posting scholarly work in
university-based IRs is completely voluntary in the Thai research university context, this finding
can be taken to confirm that the social influence factor may be useful to explain the acceptance
of technology in both mandatory and voluntary contexts.
5.2.3.9 Facilitating Conditions
For the current study, facilitating conditions refers to the degree to which faculty
members believe that there are guidance, people, and technical infrastructure available to support
their use of university-based IRs. It appears from the survey of the websites of all participating
institutions that only some participating libraries are already provided online guidelines. Those
who relied solely on DSpace software simply used a link to DSpace Help; however, specific

210

guidelines tailored to fit their institutional context were not provided. Therefore, interviewees
asked for more personalized guidelines and expressed preferences and suggestions.
5.2.3.9.1

Online Guidance

Three interviewees indicated that online guidance should be made available. More
specifically, a lecturer in biochemistry preferred short and easily understood guidelines. He said,
“Guidance, such as online pamphlets, should be short and clear. A short and easy depositing
process would be helpful” (IV002). The guidelines should cover important topics such as the
benefits of the university-based IR (IV001), author-self archiving guidelines and requirements
(IV002), and open access publishing guidelines (IV005). A lecturer from mathematics and
computer science also mentioned that the library might create separate guidelines for each topic,
since nobody would want to read long guidelines.
5.2.3.9.2

Personal Consulting Services

A junior lecturer in LIS field suggested that library should provide personal consulting
services to help faculty members who might have a problem with content deposition process.
This faculty member recalled her experience while she was depositing her dissertation into
university-based IR where she graduated. She mentioned that although the deposition process
was not difficult since there were guidelines and online tools available, she still needed to consult
with a librarian personally, particularly on some issues related to copyright. However, only
online consultant via email was provided at that time. This suggestion should be considered by
librarians and IR developers if they want to improve or launch new IR-related services that are
more closely tailored to their community members’ needs.
5.2.3.9.3

Meetings and Workshops

It is interesting to note that training and workshops in in some specific topics were

211

thought to be needed. In fact, three out of five interviewees mentioned this. The topic of
meetings and workshops may cover but not be limited to:
1) Benefits of university-based IR. A lecturer in the LIS field stated:
there should be a continuing meeting/workshop that establishes a discussion on the CUIR
within the community. It is essential that the library make the faculty members (authors
and contributors) understand the real benefits of CUIR, which in turn will lead to more
contribution and use.
2) Training and workshops on the content deposition process, a topic which was
mentioned by a lecturer in biochemistry and a lecturer in mathematics and computer science. The
former interviewee stated, “A short training session on content deposition (no more than 3 hours)
would probably be okay. If the training session is more than 2 such days of training, no one will
participate” (IV002). Similarly, the latter interviewee stated:
Libraries can provide support by organizing workshops on the content deposition process
and on how to access and use the PSU Knowledge Bank. Even though depositing work to
the knowledge bank is easy and may not require more work, learning by doing during the
workshop will provide good experience for the users and may make them more
comfortable and willing to deposit more work. (IV005)
This interviewee also suggested that libraries should promote the use of university-based
IRs, particularly the PSU Knowledge Bank, both on and off campus. Then local researchers
around the university community could benefit from these resources. He explained:
The promotion of IRs, particularly the PSU knowledge bank, should be done both on and
off campus so local researchers around the univesity community could benefit from
freely available public funded research. Some local researchers cannot reach international
open access repositories and journals due to language barriers and technological barriers.
It would be good if the library could help them to reach invaluable resources in the
knowledge bank. (IV005)
The interview data analysis shows that faculty members in the current study expressed
their need for particular guidelines and services that are tailored to meet their preferences.
Relying on only the existing guidance and limited services may not help to improve faculty

212

participation and expand IR collections. Librarians and IR developers need to go beyond user
expectations and work more actively if they want to succeed in this effort. Additional guidelines
and services may need to be implemented.
5.3

Summary
This chapter reports the findings of the study. The descriptive statistic section reports the

frequency and percentage of demographic data, the usage of university-based IRs, and
respondents’ opinions on the usage of content available in IRs. The path analysis section is
provided to test the hypotheses of the study. Of the ten hypotheses, only five of them were
supported. The trimmed path model was also proposed as the final model that is best fit for the
observed data concerning factors affecting faculty acceptance and use of university-based IRs in
Thai research university context. Chapter 6 summarized the findings of the study and presents
conclusions and implication.

CHAPTER 6
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
The primary purpose of this study was to identify factors affecting faculty acceptance and
use of university-based IRs in the Thai research university context. This study explored the
relationship and relative importance of factors that influenced users’ intentions and behavior
regarding the use of IRs. This chapter discusses the results of hypothesis testing and the answers
to the research questions. The results are summarized in the summary of findings section.
Additionally, opportunities for future research and the limitations of this research are presented.
Finally, practical recommendations concerning factors affecting faculty member acceptance and
use of university-based IRs in the Thai research university context are also provided.
6.1

Summary of Findings
This section presents the major research findings, hypothesis testing, and answers to the

research questions. The proposed research model was tested in the context of the adoption of
university-based IRs by faculty members in Thai research universities. This study tried to answer
three major research questions. The first question concerned faculty members’ acceptance and
usage of university-based IRs. The second question concerned factors affecting their decision to
use university-based IRs. Finally, the third question addressed how those factors affected faculty
members’ acceptance and use of university-based IRs in the current situation.
6.1.1

Faculty’ Acceptance and Usage of University-based IRs
The first research question—to what extent do faculty members in Thai research

universities accept and use university-based IRs?—focused on whether faculty members
accepted and made use of university-based IRs. Based on technology acceptance theories, user
acceptance is “the demonstrable willingness within a user group to employ information

214

technology for the tasks it is designed to support” (Dillon and Morris, 1996, para. 4). More
importantly, the absence of user acceptance is a significant impediment to the success of new
information systems. For this study, faculty members’ acceptance of IRs was determined based
on their awareness and usage of university-based IRs, as well as their intention to use this
alternative channel of scholarly communication in the future. The following sections provide
answers to the first research question by briefly providing information on the respondents’
backgrounds and then addressing faculty members’ IR awareness, status as IR contributors or
non-contributors, IR usage, and current self-archiving practice in other venues.
The total number of respondents in this study was 176 faculty members from four
research universities in Thailand. There were 99 female participants (56.2%) and 77 male
participants (43.8%). The ages of the respondents ranged from 25 to 66 years. The largest
number of the respondents were aged 25-39 years (84, 47.7%). Most of the respondents were
from science disciplines, including 71 (40.3%) respondents from other sciences and technology
disciplines and 49 (27.8%) respondents from the medical and health sciences, as compared to 50
(28.40%) respondents from the humanities and social sciences. In terms of academic positions,
slightly more than half of the respondents were instructors and lecturers (101, 57.4%), followed
by assistant professors (48, 27.3%), associate professors (21, 11.9%), full professors (3, 1.7%),
and researchers (3, 1.7%). Most of the respondents held Ph.D. degrees (138, 80%). It was evident
that the respondents had been actively engaged in scholarly communication prior to the study.
More than three-fourths of the respondents (136, 77.3%) had published at least 1-2 articles per
year, and some of them had engaged in several scholarly activities, as shown in Table 5.3. This
fact may be explained by the promotion criteria currently in place, which required an individual
to publish several articles in recognized publications (both national and international journals) in

215

order to move from the rank of a lecture/instructor to the upper levels (assistant professor,
associate professors, and full professor). In terms of Internet usage skills, overall, faculty
members were confident that their Internet usage skills were sufficient for accessing and
disseminating scholarly information. However, their level of confidence in their ability to search
for and access scholarly information on the Internet varied by age. Faculty members aged 50
years and over indicated that they had significantly lower confidence in their ability to search for
and access scholarly information on the Internet than those who were 25-39 years (U = 711.50, p
= .013, r = - 0.23) and 40-49 years (U = 476.00, p = .012, r = - 0.27). The lack of confidence in
their ability to search for and access scholarly information on the Internet might have prevented
them from gaining access and from benefiting from the use of university-based IRs and other
open access forums. Kim (2008) identified age as the second most significant barrier to selfarchiving. Kim found that younger faculty members tend to self-archive a greater percentage of
their work than do older faculty, since they are more familiar with publishing and disseminating
their work on the Internet. Inadequate Internet search skills and technical skills were identified as
one factor that constrained self-archiving and the use of this type of scholarly communication
(Ivwighreghweta & Onoriode, 2012; Kim, 2008; Okoye & Ejikeme, 2011).
6.1.1.1 IR Awareness and Acceptance
The 176 faculty members, the majority (N = 129, 73%) had been aware of universitybased IRs. The faculty members’ awareness of IRs did not differ significantly by discipline or
academic position. The larger proportion of faculty members in all disciplines and academic
positions, except full professors, had been aware of the development of university-based IRs
prior to this study. The high proportion of faculty members who had been aware of IRs may be
explained by the current stage of IR development. All of the university-based IRs in this study

216

had been operated for more than five years. One of them was the first university-based IR
developed in Thailand and had operated since 2006.
When the faculty members were asked whether the development of university-based IRs
was important, the majority of them (153, 87%) thought the development of IRs for archiving
and disseminating scholarly work and teaching materials was important, while only a small
proportion of them (23, 13%) thought that it was not important. Faculty members who had been
aware of university-based IRs were more likely to agree that the development of IRs was
important, as compared to those who had not been aware of IRs, χ2 (1, N = 176) = 8.77, p = .003
(Table 5.18). Additionally, their opinions on the importance of the development of IRs varied
significantly by academic position. In fact, the majority of faculty in all academic positions
agreed with the importance of IR development, with the exception of all of the full professors,
who thought that it was not important.
Many researchers have found that the success of IRs depends mainly on faculty
participation and the numbers of items contained in the IRs (Markey et al., 2007, Shearer, 2003;
Tribodeau, 2007; Yakel et al. 2009; Xia & Sun, 2007). This study found that the high rates of
faculty awareness of IRs and their agreement with the importance of IRs did not reflect the
success of university-based IRs in terms of faculty participation. Although nearly three-fourths
of the respondents (129 out of 176, 73%) had been aware of IRs, only one-fourth of the
respondents (44 out of 176, 25%) had participated and deposited their work into IRs. However,
there was a statistically significant relationship between the respondents’ awareness of IRs and
whether they contributed to the university-based IRs, χ2 (1, N = 176) = 5.12, p = .024, ϕ = .17).
This suggests that faculty members who had been aware of IRs were more likely to contribute
and deposit their work. In fact, most of the contributors (38 out of 44, 86.4%) were faculty

217

members who had been aware of IRs, as compared to six (13.6%) respondents who had not been
aware of IRs but who considered themselves as contributors.
Interestingly, the numbers of faculty members who had been aware of IRs but had never
deposited any work seems very high (91 out of 129) (Table 5.9). It is essential that IR developers
pay attention to this group of faculty members who may be aware of IRs but have not yet
contributed any work to them. It may be necessary to carry out an in-depth user study to
understand this group of faculty members, to identify their specific needs, and to discover the
reasons for their reluctance to contribute. The results could indicate a better strategy to persuade
them to contribute to the university-based IRs, which in turn could lead to a growth in the
number of collections, thus attracting a greater number of users.
Despite the fact that the majority of respondents across academic positions had agreed
that the development of university-based IRs was important, some of them were still not willing
to deposit their work, and a number of them were uncertain whether or not to participate.
Clearly, the high proportion of non-contribution to IRs is in contrast with the participants’
opinions about the importance of the development of university-based IRs. There were 132 noncontributors. Among the 132 non-contributors, 56 (42.4%) indicated that they would be willing
to deposit their work in university-based IRs in the near future, while 23 (17.4%) said they would
not be willing to deposit their work. It should be noted that more than one third (53, 40.2%)
remained uncertain about whether to contribute to university-based IRs. The number of noncontributors who remained uncertain about whether to contribute was nearly equal to the number
of those who indicated that they would be willing to contribute. It is essential that IR developers
and staff pay more attention to this group of faculty members.

218

Two major reasons cited by both faculty members who had not made a decision about
whether to contribute and those who were not be willing to deposit were a) absence of
submission guidelines and lack of knowledge/information about IRs, as well as b) the perception
that there were no benefits of using IRs. This may suggest that although many faculty members
stated that they were aware of IRs, they did not really understand what IRs were or what their
real benefits might be. Similar issues were identified in a previous study conducted in a similarly
context and showing that a low rate of awareness and misconception of IRs were the major
issues related to IR development and implementation in Thailand (Klungthanaboon, 2013). If
libraries can paint a clearer picture of the university-based IRs and their benefits and provide
user manuals or depositing guidelines, more faculty members might change their mind and want
to participate and deposit their work into university-based IRs. If IR developers or IR staff were
able persuade these groups of non-contributors to become contributors and deposit their work,
the result would be growth of university-based IRs in terms of contents and participation.
Contrary to the findings of Kim (2008), where most of the full professors were IR
contributors, among the participants in this study, none of the full professors were IR
contributors. Additionally, none of them agreed that the development of IRs was important; thus,
they would not be willing to contribute their work to university-based IRs. Although there were
only three full professors participating in this study, their opinions on IRs may well be important.
If the junior faculty members look to them for guidance and leadership, they might also decide
not to deposit their work into university-based IRs. Indeed, the findings in this study showed that
social influence had a positive direct effect on faculty members’ behavioral intention to use
university-based IRs (β = 0.42, p < .001).

219

6.1.1.2 Content and Review of Repository Content
Not surprisingly, about a half of IR contributors had deposited theses and/or dissertations,
(21, 47.7%), followed by journal articles (17, 38.6% (mostly pre-refereed articles) and research
reports and technical reports (15, 34.1%). Other materials that the contributors had made
available through university-based IRs were course-materials and lecture notes, books and book
chapters, and course syllabi. OpenDOAR also lists journal articles, theses and dissertations,
unpublished reports and working papers, and conference papers as major content types deposited
in open access repositories in Thailand. In contrast with the OpenDOAR list, only one contributor
in this study had made a conference paper available on a university-based IR. This may be
explained by the fact that none of the participants’ universities explicitly stated that they allowed
faculty to deposit conference papers. Only one university mentioned on a policy webpage that
faculty members were allowed to deposit research-related work. In general, conference papers
and presentations may be counted as part of research-related work. Some faculty members (n =
6) mentioned that they had self-archived conference papers, posters, and presentations in other
open access venues (Figure 5.3). Additionally, three interviewees mentioned conference papers
as another type of research-related content for self-archiving. However, none of them had selfarchived conference papers in IRs hosted by their respective universities. One interviewee, who
was an assistant professor in the LIS field, mentioned that he had self-archived a conference
paper in ResearchGate.net. The other interviewee, who was a junior lecturer in LIS, mentioned
that a conference paper of which she was a co-author had been self-archived by her co-author in
Purdue e-Pubs (http://docs.lib.purdue.edu), an open access repository held by Purdue University
Libraries. This may imply that the faculty members might not have known that they could selfarchive their conference papers in university-based IRs. One of the interviewees, who was an IR

220

contributor, suggested self-archiving conference papers and posters in university-based IRs
might be an alternative way to create a research showcase. This interviewee also showed
willingness to share his conferences papers and presentations and stated that if his universitybased IR accepted this type of research-related work, he would like to encourage his students to
share their papers and posters. The interviewees cited a number of reasons, including perceived
benefits of self-archiving conference papers as a research showcase for a work in progress
(IV002) and the perceived absence of any negative impact from self-archiving conference
papers, particularly copyright issues (IV003), as reasons why they had self-archived or were
willing to self-archive this type of research-related work in such venues. Based on these findings,
this study suggests that academic libraries in Thailand should make a clear policy regarding
content types that will be allowed in university-based IRs and take the faculty members’
suggestion into consideration by considering graduate students’ conference papers as another
type of research-related content that could be self-archived in university-based IRs.
Despite the growing concerns around research data management and the fact that many
institutional repositories have accepted data sets as a part of their content, none of the
contributors in this study reported depositing a data set to a university-based IR. Findings from
the quantitative part of this study indicate that only one respondent, from the computer science
field, had made a data set available through another publicly accessible venue. Self-archiving
data sets was not a common practice in the Thai research university context. Additionally, at the
time of this study none of the participating universities had allowed faculty to deposit data sets
into its IR. However, one interviewee, who was a junior lecturer in biochemistry, showed his
intention to deposit research data into the IR developed by his university. This interviewee said,
“If the university-based IR will allow faculty members to self-archive this type of data in the

221

future, it is essential that they make clear policy regarding this issue and make sure that librarians
can deal with it” (IV002). This study highlights the notion that if the libraries plan to launch any
services for self-archiving research data in the future, they should have a clear policy in place
and work more collaboratively with faculty who are both data providers and data users.
Researchers and scholars in different disciplines have different needs and work with different
types of data. Starting with those who have experience self-archiving research data or those who
are interested in this issue would be beneficial. Newton, Miller, and Bracke (2011) suggested
that librarians should work closely with faculty and researchers at the first stage in collecting
data sets, since data sets must be identified, evaluated, and prepared before they are deposited
into data repositories. Then they must be made discoverable and retrievable though the
repositories. Importantly, such a decision should be made jointly by both parties in a
collaborative environment.
Regarding the review of content, two-thirds of faculty members (118, 67%) agreed that
all work should be peer reviewed before being submitted to university-based IRs, while only a
small proportion of faculty members (58, 33%) disagreed with this idea. Faculty members who
had been aware of IRs (69%, n = 89) were more likely to agree that any work should undergo
peer-review before being deposited into university-based IRs, as compared to only 31% (n = 40)
of such faculty members who reported that they did not agree with this idea. Among those who
had agreed, the largest group felt faculty research committee should take responsibility for the
review process (52, 44%), followed by a university research committee (26, 22%) and a
departmental research committee (19, 16%). This may be explained by the fact that the faculty in
each of the research universities in Thailand already had its own research committee, which had
been working closely with faculty members to develop and promote research. This may imply

222

that the faculty members in the current study had already established trust in their faculty
research committee. If library or IR managers can work closely with those committees and
engage them in the university-based IR projects, they may help to encourage or recruit more
faculty members to participate in IRs.
6.1.1.3 Usage of University-based IRs
Since the current study views faculty members as both authors and users of universitybased IRs, it is of interest to know whether the faculty members make use of the university-based
IRs. Slightly more than half of the respondents (97, 55%) indicated that they had used and
searched a university-based IR, while the remaining 79 (45%) faculty members had never used
one. Results from a chi-square test confirmed that faculty members who had been aware of IRs
were more likely to use them (χ2 (1, N = 176) = 16.626, p = .000, ϕ = .307). Faculty members
had used university-based IRs for three major activities, including research-related activities (79,
81%), teaching-related activities (56, 57%), and other scholarly productivity-related activities
(29, 30%) such as preparing for a manuscript. Clearly, the development of university-based IRs
had helped to support faculty teaching and research activities, which was one of its purposes.
However, the majority of faculty members reported using them infrequently (Table 5.33). It
would be of interest for IR developers to study the reasons why those who made use of IRs used
them infrequently. One interviewee who was a contributor mentioned that he had tried to use the
university-based IR but found that it had a poor user-interface, particularly the search feature. A
similar reason was mentioned by some faculty members who had never used a university-based
IR.
The open-ended questions provided the opportunity for this study to capture reasons
behind the faculty members’ decisions. Based on the participants’ reasons and comments, some

223

suggestions and solutions for the development and improvement of IRs appear reasonable. For
instance, system design is an essential issue, mentioned by not only respondents who stated that
they did not plan to use university-based IRs but also some who were still unsure whether they
would use IRs in the near future. This finding is consistent with the finding in Davis and
Connolly’s (2007) study. A perceived lack of software functionality was one of the important
reasons mentioned for non-use of Cornell’s DSpace (Davis & Connolly, 2007). It should be
noted that most of the university-based IRs in the current study used DSpace as a platform.
Therefore, redesigning the existing user interface and search systems may help to draw the
attention of more users and increase the usage rates of university-based IRs. Improved search
interface and user interface design may also be of value. For those who reported having a lack of
information or having misunderstandings about the purpose of IRs or reservations about the
quality of their contents, effective promotion of IRs within the university community may help to
eliminate misconceptions. At the same time, such promotion may help to establish greater
understanding among faculty members (as authors and users) and IR developers (libraries). This
may help to improve the uptake of the university-based IRs in the long run. One participant
stated that his decision to use or not to use the university-based IR depended solely on “how the
library promotes the IR, it’s content, and ease of use” (ID041).
Faculty members’ opinions on the usage of contents available in the university-based IRs
differed by age for the first statement, “All users should be allowed to make any comments on
work available in the university-based IRs”, H(2) = 8.73, p = .013. Results from the post hoc test
showed that those aged 25-39 years had significantly different opinions on this statement as
compared to faculty members aged 40-49 years. Additionally, faculty members’ opinions on the
usage of contents in the university-based IRs varied significantly by academic position for all

224

statements, including “all users should be allowed to make any comments on work available in
the university-based IRs,” (H(4) = 16.66, p = .002); “any use of a work deposited in the
university-based IRs is acceptable as long as it is acknowledged and cited” (H(4) = 14.90, p
= .005); and “individual users should register before using the university-based IRs, so that the
usage statistics can be collected,” (H(4) = 9.96, p = .041). Although the faculty members’
opinions differed significantly by age and academic position, they were more likely to agree that
users should be allowed to use the content as long as it was acknowledged and cited and to agree
that individual users should register before using university-based IRs so that the usage statistics
could be collected. One interviewee (IV001) stated that she had received email from Purdue ePubs about the usage statistics of her conference paper occasionally and that it was very nice to
know that her paper had been downloaded. However, she stated that she had never received any
information regarding her work deposited in the university-based IR developed by her university.
Based on faculty members’ opinions, it can be inferred that the faculty members valued the
usage statistics and wanted to know if their work was used and properly cited. Additionally, they
may have wished to know the usage statistics of an individual piece of work hosted by the
university-based IRs. It should be noted that one university-based IR had already made a clear
policy about the usage of content available in the IR by requiring all users to register on the IR
website before accessing and using the full text in the IR. However, based on the survey of
university-based IR websites participating in this study, only one of them provided usage
statistics at the individual item level, such as when was the article was last used and downloaded,
total visits per month, top country views, and top city views. The usage statistics may be used to
provide feedback to the faculty members and help them see how the university-based IRs work,
as well as to see some of the benefits of contribution. This may help to encourage them to

225

contribute more work to the university-based IRs in the future. This study suggests that both
libraries as IR developers and faculty members as contributors would benefit from using this
statistical data.
6.1.1.4 Current Self-Archiving Practice in Other Open Access Venues
The present study also explored the current self-archiving practices and experience of the
participants and their intention to self-archive in the near future. At the time of this study, selfarchiving was not a common behavior in the Thai research university context; evidence from
both the quantitative and the qualitative parts of this study lead to this conclusion. A smaller
proportion of faculty members (61, 34.70%) had made their scholarly work and/or teaching
materials available in other open access repositories and/or other publicly accessible web sites, as
compared to a larger proportion of faculty members (115, 65.3%) who had not made their work
available in such venues. Among the 61 respondents, only 40 (65.60%) had become involved in
self-archiving, while the others had not done so. However, the work of those involved in selfarchiving had been made available on publicly accessible sites on their behalf.
Although a chi-square test showed that there was no statistically significant association
between discipline and whether faculty members had made their work publicly available in OA
repositories and other venues, χ2 (2, N = 170) = 1.25, p = .490, a larger proportion of faculty
members in all disciplines had not made their work publicly available through such venues.
Furthermore, a Fisher’s exact test yielded p = .054, confirming that their decision to self-archive
differed significantly by academic position. In fact, all researchers had made their work publicly
available in OA repositories and other venues, while the greater proportion of faculty in all
academic positions had never done so. Interestingly, slightly more than three-fourths (72 out of
101) of instructors and lecturers had never made their work publicly available on the Internet.

226

Only one of the three professors had made his work available on other OA repositories or
publicly accessible sites on the Internet.
Journal articles, theses and dissertations, and research reports and technical reports were
cited as the top three main content types that faculty members had made available on the
Internet. Similar to previous studies conducted in the U.S. (Kim, 2008) and Tanzania (Dulle,
2010) contexts, this study found that departmental and faculty web sites were the most
commonly used venues for publishing work for public access. More interesting, a new
publishing trend had emerged. Social networking sites appeared to be drawing more attention
from faculty members, as a number of them (n = 10) mentioned that they had posted and shared
their work through social media sites such as ResearchGate, Facebook, Academia.edu, and
Google Scholar. Among these social networking sites, ResearchGate.net appeared to be the most
popular site, mentioned by both respondents to the survey and interviewees during semistructured interview. Particularly, one interviewee who was an assistant professor in the LIS field
had been actively engaged in a social networking site and valued it as it had allowed him to
communicate with other scholars and researchers in LIS and other related fields. Three national
open access repositories—eLibrary-the Thailand Research Fund, Thai Digital CollectionThaiLIS, and the Thailand National Research repositories—were also mentioned along with
discipline repositories, including PubMed Central, BioMed Central, and LSE Theses.
Additionally, in the interview, a faculty member from biochemistry showed his interest in
disciplinary repositories, particularly bioRxiv (http://biorxiv.org), a preprint server in life
sciences and other related fields. Despite the fact that bioRxiv was newly launched in 2013, it
has been embraced by some pioneers in life sciences, and its collection has expanded to cover all

227

aspect of research in life sciences; about 3,100 preprints have been deposited since it was
launched (Callaway & Powell, 2016).
While self-archiving in university-based IRs did not appear to receive much attention
from faculty members, publishing in Open Access journal was cited as more common behavior
by faculty members from the science and technology fields. Evidence of this can be seen in the
findings from both the quantitative and qualitative parts of the study. The two interviewees from
biochemistry and mathematics and computer sciences agreed with this idea. Additionally, about
one-third of respondents (20 out of 61) had already published their work through open access
journals, both international open access journals and open access journals published by
professional organizations in Thailand. Most of the journals mentioned in the current study were
journals in the medical and biomedical fields; the exceptions were the Journal of the Association
for Information Research, which is a journal in the field of information systems and information
technology, and PLOS One, a multidisciplinary open access journal.
6.1.1.5 Planning for Self-Archiving and Use of OA Repositories in the Future
The number of faculty members who did not have any experience in self-arching or in
posting work to other publicly accessible venues was considerably high (115 out of 176).
Slightly more than one-third of the respondents (46, 40%) indicated they would be willing to
publish their work through other publicly accessible web sites, while 27 (23.5%) respondents
said they would not be willing to do so. Interestingly, another slightly more than one third (42,
36.5%) did not indicate whether they planned to publish through these alternative channels.
While a Chi-square test indicated that there was no statistically significant association between
discipline and whether the respondent planned to publish in OA repositories or other publicly
accessible venues on the Internet, the data showed that respondents in the humanities and social

228

sciences were more likely to publish their work in the near future, as compared to those in the
medical and health sciences and other science and technology fields. When academic position
was considered, the proportion of respondents who were willing to publish in OA repositories or
other publicly accessible venues varied by academic position. Instructors and lecturers (38, 33%)
were more willing to self-archive their works in the near future, as compared to respondents in
other positions.
In contrast with the previous study which found that faculty members who did not
currently self-archive were less likely to do so or were unsure whether to self-archive in the near
future (Kim, 2008), the current study found that many respondents who had never self-archived
their work in either university-based IRs or other open access venues stated that they would be
willing to do so in the near future. Although the numbers of respondents who were uncertain
whether to self-archive in the near future were high, they did not exceed the numbers of those
who wanted to contribute. The top reasons cited as major factors hindering their contribution
were not having any work, low levels of trust toward OA repositories and quality of content, and
lack of information about OA publications.
The findings showed that faculty members participating in the current study used other
work more frequently than they published their own work. The majority of respondents (148,
84%) had already searched for and used scholarly work available in OA repositories and other
publicly accessible web sites, while only 28 (16%) indicated that they had never searched for or
used scholarly works from these sources. The major purposes for using scholarly work available
in OA repositories and other publicly accessible web sites were for research related activities,
teaching related activities, and other scholarly activities such as to prepare for a manuscript, to
search for information, to conduct a literature review, and to stay current in the field. These

229

findings show that while many respondents in the current study understood the concept of
institutional repository as well as that of open access in general, there was still a lack of
information about OA and misunderstandings among some scholars. This finding is related to the
findings of a previous study conducted in the Thai higher education context. The study found
that 47% of LIS faculty in Thai government universities knew about open access resources only
moderately or hardly knew about them at all (Thaotip, 2011). Despite the fact that the greater
proportion of faculty members participated in the current study reported that they had been aware
of IRs, a number of them reported a lack of information. These facts indicate that education in
and promotion of open access and institutional repositories can play an important role in the
adoption of IRs in this context. IR developers should pay particular attention to these aspects and
work hard to increase understanding among faculty members in the community.
6.1.2

Factors Affecting Faculty Members’ Acceptance and Use of University-Based IRs
The primary purpose of this study was to determine the factors affecting faculty

acceptance and use of university-based IRs in the Thai research university context. This section
discusses answers to the second and the third research questions: what are the factors that affect
faculty members’ acceptance and use of institutional repositories in the Thai research university
context? To what extent do those factors affect faculty members’ acceptance and use of
institutional repositories (IRs) in the Thai research university context? Discussion on each factor
is also presented.
The proposed research model was developed based on two major models, the UTAUT
model (Venkatesh et al., 2003) and the model of factors affecting faculty self-archiving (Kim,
2008). Additionally, more factors identified in the literature regarding open access and
institutional repositories were included in the proposed model. In total, the proposed model

230

consisted of nine exogenous variables (ATT, PE, EE, SI, RTC, ALT, CCs, TTIRs, and FC) in
relation to two endogenous variables (BI and UB). A path analysis was used to evaluate the
contribution of the combination of each path to the overall fit of the structural model. Results
showed that the proposed path model indicated poor fit and showed that the path diagram of the
proposed research model did not fit well with the observed data, χ2 (9) = 35.65, p = .000, CMIN
= 3.96, GFI = .98 (Figure 5.4). The proposed research model did not fit the data based on the
significant chi-square test. Of the ten hypotheses, only five were supported. The model was
trimmed, and a final model with a better fit to the observed data was proposed, χ2 (31) = 49.52, p
= .020, CMIN = 1.60, GFI = 0.95 (Figure 5.5). Although the chi-square value was still
significant, it was better than the value for the proposed research model. Furthermore, the final
model could be used to explain faculty members’ behavioral intention and actual usage behavior
toward the university-based IRs in the Thai research university context. Table 6.1 summarizes
the findings and hypothesis testing of the study.

6.1.2.1 Attitude toward IRs.
Faculty members’ attitudes toward IRs were found to not have a direct effect on
behavioral intention to use university-based IRs. Hypothesis 1 was not supported (Table 6.1, β =
0.19, p = .056). The question of attitude presented an interesting case in the literature regarding
technology acceptance. It was found to be significant across other technology acceptance models
(TRA, TPB/DTPB, and MM), while this construct was not significant in the UTAUT model
(Venkatesh et al., 2003). The results in this study confirmed those reported in the UTAUT
model, which indicated that attitude does not have a direct influence on behavioral intention due
to the fact that the variance of BI is already accounted for by performance expectancy (PE) and
effort expectancy (EE) (Venkatesh et al., 2003). However, the results of this study are contrary to
those of studies employing the UTAUT in the open access context (Mann et al., 2009; Dulle,
2010). In a large-scale study of 1,443 scientists across 49 countries, Mann et al. (2009) found
that attitude was one of the factors affecting the scientists’ behavioral intention to use open
access publishing. However, Mann et al. (2009) noted that their study was conducted at the early
stage of open access publishing; thus, at that time scientists might have had a more positive
attitude toward open access. Similarly, in a study of researchers’ open access adoption within
public universities in Tanzania, Dulle (2010) found that attitude had a direct effect on researcher
intention; however, it did not have a direct effect on actual usage. Different from Mann et al.’s
(2009) and Dulle’s (2010) studies, the current study was conducted after university-based IRs in
Thailand had been in operation for many years, and for that reason faculty members’ attitudes
toward IRs might have changed as explained by Mann et al. (2009). The current study also
sought to fill a gap by investigating whether attitude had a significant effect on behavioral
intention to adopt new technology, particularly in the area of the acceptance and use of IRs. The

232

findings in this study may contribute to a better understanding of behavioral intention by
confirming that attitude did not have a significant direct effect on faculty members’ behavioral
intention to use IRs. Although attitude could not be counted as a factor affecting faculty
members’ behavioral intention to use IRs in this study context, it should not be disregarded from
the perspective of the promotion and the implementation of IRs since many studies have
confirmed that it was one of the factors contributing the success of open access and institutional
repositories (Dulle, 2010; Mann et al., 2009).
6.1.2.2 Performance Expectancy
Performance expectancy had a positive direct effect on faculty members’ behavioral
intention to use university-based IRs. Hypothesis 2 was supported (Table 6.1, β = 0.38, p < .001).
This means that for each standard deviation increase in performance expectancy, behavioral
intention increased by 0.38 standard deviation. Therefore, this study confirms that performance
expectancy enhanced usage intention and that faculty members would intend to use universitybased IRs if they found that IRs were useful for their work, for instance, if using IRs helped them
to publish their teaching and scholarly work more quickly, increased their teaching and scholarly
productivity, increased their chance to communicate with peers, helped them to enable
researchers from other countries to access their work, and increased their chance of promotion or
getting more credit. It may be concluded that the future adoption of IRs is highly dependent on
the expected benefits of such adoption. By confirming that PE is a strong predictor of behavioral
intention, these findings also support those of other studies utilizing the UTAUT model (Dulle,
2010; Dulle, Minishi-Majanja, & Cloete, 2010; Mann et al., 2009; Van Schaik, 2009; Venkatesh
et al., 2003; Wang, Wu, & Wang, 2009).

233

One emerging theme from the qualitative data also points in the same direction. Clearly,
faculty members valued the performance of IRs and expected that depositing work in universitybased IRs would help to increase the visibility of their work at the global level. A senior lecturer
in LIS field said, “I decided to make my academic work available in CUIR, since it can be
globally and publicly accessible” (IV004), and a junior lecturer in the same field stated, “I
considered the popularity of IRs or other venues as an important factor affecting my decision on
whether to contribute, since it will help to increase the visibility of work after it is deposited”
(IV001). This may be interpreted to mean that if a university-based IR has the potential to
broaden the visibility of its institution, faculty, and research, it is more likely to gain attention of
its community, particularly of faculty members.
6.1.2.3 Effort Expectancy
Effort expectancy did not have a significant direct effect on behavioral intention.
Hypothesis 3 was not supported (Table 6.1, β = 0.05, p = .507). While the UTAUT model
suggests that adoption of technology (in this case university-based IRs) by individuals will
depend on the level of ease of use of the technology, and this factor was confirmed to be
significant in the context of open access and IRs adoption (Abizah, Hilmi, & Kassim, 2015;
Dulle, 2010; Singeh et al., 2013a), the current study found that this factor did not directly
enhance usage intention. The faculty members’ adoption of IRs did not depend on the level of
ease of use of the system. One possible reason for the statistical insignificance of the effort
expectancy variable is that the ease of use or difficulty associated with the use of such a
technology is more likely to be relevant during the early stages following its introduction but will
become non-significant over a period of time (Venkatesh et al., 2003). In light of this, it is
relevant that the current study was conducted many years after IRs had first been operated.

234

Although results from the quantitative part of this study show that this factor was not
significant and did not have a direct effect on faculty member intention to use university-based
IRs, ease of use and additional time and effort were mentioned as one factor hindering faculty
decision to deposit work into IRs. In fact, this factor was mentioned by both contributors and one
non-contributor, with and without self-archiving experience. Clearly, all contributors expected
the content depositing process to be easy. This suggests ease of use in the content deposition
process may help to motivate faculty members to deposit their work. In other words, additional
time and effort required to deposit work can be considered as a major barrier to self-archiving,
and this barrier may delay faculty members’ decisions to contribute to university-based IRs. A
similar pattern was discovered by Kim (2008, 2010), who found that additional time and effort
had negative direct effects on faculty self-archiving behavior. Additionally, Klungthanaboon
(2015) confirmed in a qualitative study of IR stakeholders in Thailand that a complicated
submission process and additional time and workload are barriers to self-archiving and
participation in university-based IRs. Therefore, this study suggests that this factor should not be
disregarded. IR developers should consider revising the IR system. Consideration should be
given to both the depositing process and the user interface system, since both quantitative and
qualitative data from this study point in these directions.
6.1.2.4 Social Influence
Social influence had a positive direct effect on faculty members’ behavioral intention to
use university-based IRs with the highest standardized path coefficient (Table 6.1, β = 0.46, p <
.001). This means that for each standard deviation increase in social influence, there was a 0.46
standard deviation increase in behavioral intention. This study confirmed that faculty members
would intend to use university-based IRs if they recognized that important individuals, such as

235

peers, the faculty member’s organization, and funding agencies, believed that they should use
IRs. Based on the UTAUT model, this factor is significant in mandatory environments, but it is
not significant in voluntary environments (Venkatesh et al., 2003). The current study suggests
that this factor can be used to explain behavioral intention to use IRs in the Thai higher education
context, in which such use is completely voluntary. Thus, this study sheds light on this issue.
Additionally, social influence has characteristics similar to those of “peer pressure” in the selfarchiving context (Kim, 2008, 2010). However, Kim (2008) found that quantitative data
indicated that peer pressure did not have a direct relationship with faculty decisions to selfarchive. This factor, however, was discovered through the reviewing of results from qualitative
data in her study and added to the model of factors affecting faculty self-archiving. Results from
the current study can be used to support the conclusion that social influence has a significant
direct effect on faculty members’ intention to used IRs, even though it was conducted in a
different context.
Results from qualitative data analysis also support these findings. Some interviewees
mentioned that they intended to participate in social networking sites due to the influence of
peers and funding agencies. An assistant professor in the LIS field mentioned that he had been
encouraged by his supervisor to participate in social networking sites. He stated, “my ex-PhD
supervisor invited me online to join ResearchGate.net” (IV003). Additionally, peer pressure
appears to be an important reason that made this interviewee continue to actively engage in this
social networking site. Also, a lecturer in biochemistry mentioned that his decision to publish in
open access sources had a result primarily of peer pressure such as supervisors and colleagues
and the influence of the university policy (where he had graduated).

236

As both quantitative data and qualitative data in this study indicate the relative
importance of social influence on faculty members’ behavioral intention to use IRs in a voluntary
context, it is essential that IR developers work closely with individuals who might influence and
encourage faculty members to engage in university-based IRs, for instance, senior faculty or
faculty research committee members who may have worked closely with the faculty members in
promoting their research, as mentioned by participants in this study. In the case of senior faculty,
this study discovered that none of the full professors were IR contributors. Additionally, none of
them agreed that the development of IRs was important; as a result, they indicated they would
not be willing to contribute work to university-based IRs. Although there were only three full
professors participating in this study, their opinion on IRs might be considered important as it
could influence other junior faculty members. If the junior faculty members look to them for
guidance and leadership, they might decide not to deposit their work into university-based IRs.
Therefore, this study suggests that if the IR developers could establish trust with this group of
faculty members and persuade them to change their mind about the importance of IRs, there
would be beneficial results.
6.1.2.5 Resistance to Change
The findings showed that resistance to change had a negative direct effect on faculty
members’ behavioral intention to use university-based IRs (Table 6.1, β = -0.18, p < .01).).
Hypothesis 5 was supported. This means that faculty members who exhibited a higher level of
resistance to change were less intent on trying to use university-based IRs, since for each
standard deviation increase in resistance to change, the was a 0.18 standard deviation decrease in
behavioral intention. This factor was incorporated into the proposed research model since there
has been a debate on whether to confirm or to disregard RTC as a determinant of behavioral

237

intention. In the context of open access, resistance to change has also been mentioned in some
studies conducted at the early stage of OA and IR development. For instance, Chan (2004) found
that many faculty members cited cultural inertia, which is a resistance to change or reluctance to
adopt new culture or technology, as a reason for the slow adoption of self-archiving (Chan, 2004;
Kim, 2008). In the digital library adoption context, Nov and Ye (2008, 2009) confirmed that
users with higher RTC had higher effort expectancy toward new technology. No studies in the
areas of OA and IRs have been conducted to determine whether resistance to change has an
effect on OA or IR adoption. This study confirmed that resistance to change is one of the
important factors hindering faculty members’ intention to adopt and use university-based IRs.
This factor can be used to predict the inclination to adopt new technology or products as reported
in Oreg’s (2003) study. The findings of this study can help to fill the gap in the literature in the
area of technology adoption, particularly in the institutional repository adoption context.
6.1.2.6 Altruism
The notion of altruism in this study refers to faculty members’ altruistic motivation to
self-archive their work in university-based IRs. The current study found that altruism had a
positive direct effect on faculty members’ actual usage of university-based IRs. Hypothesis 6
was supported (Table 6.1, β = 0.30, p < .001). This means faculty members’ usage of IRs
increased by 0.30 standard deviation for every one standard deviation increase in altruism. In
Kim’s studies (2008, 2010), altruism was identified as one factors influencing faculty members’
tendency to contribute their work to their university IRs in the U.S. context. The current study
confirms that this factor can be used to explain the actual behavior of faculty members in a
different context, specifically, in the Thai research university context. Findings from the
qualitative part of this study show that faculty members, both contributors and non-contributors,

238

had a clear perception of the principle of open access and had ideas about helping other
researchers to access and build on their research. The non-contributor, who intended to deposit
his work in the near future, concluded that the principle of open access was essential, and he
reported his belief that local researchers should benefit from his public funded research
motivated him to share his work with other researchers, not only in the university community but
also at the local and the global level. Clearly, findings from the qualitative part of this study can
be used to explain in greater detail how altruism behavior affects faculty members. Similar to
Kim’s (2008) study, the current study also found that faculty members were encouraged by
reciprocal altruism more than by true altruism: “scholars or researchers want to reciprocate after
receiving benefits from using OA content by giving back to other researchers through selfarchiving their research” (Kim, 2008, p. 192). In support of this, four out of five interviewees in
this study mentioned that they benefited from the principle of open access by using other
scholars’ work freely available on other open access venues, including open access journals;
thus, they would be in turn giving back to the community by sharing their work. An assistant
professor in the LIS field notably stated, “the more we shared the more we gained, in that we can
do research further and grow the study areas we are interested in together” (IV003).
6.1.2.7 Copyright Concerns
Interestingly, copyright concerns were found to not be significant and did not have a
direct effect on usage of IRs. Hypothesis 7 was not supported (Table 6.1, β = 0.01, p = .893).
This finding presents a contradiction to findings in the literature in which copyright concerns
(CCs) along with fear of plagiarism are frequently cited as a major barrier to self-archiving and
to IR contribution (Abrizan et al., 2015; Casey, 2012; Creaser et al., 2010; Kim, 2007, 2008,
2010, 2011; Singeh et al., 2013b; Swan & Brown, 2005; Xia et al., 2012). While the quantitative

239

part of this study did not shed light on this issue, copyright concerns and uncertainty regarding
the issue of copyright were captured in the qualitative part. In fact, all of the interviewees
expressed concerns regarding this issue. Specifically, a lecturer from the LIS field stated that
copyright was the most important factor affecting her decision on whether to deposit work. This
interviewee mentioned third-party copyright materials and brought up the question of whether it
was legal to post dissertations or other research-related materials with third-party copyright
materials, such as images and diagrams. The other two interviewees from scientific fields felt
uncertainty regarding whether it was legal to post the final versions of their work (publisher’s
versions/PDFs) to university-based IRs. Hence, they stated that if they would deposit any work
in the future, they would deposit work published in open access journals that supported selfarchiving, so they would not have to deal with the legal issue. Studies conducted in similar
contexts have also found the issue of copyright and its legal aspects to be a major issue and one
considered to be a major barrier pertaining to the success of the development of open access and
IRs in Thailand (Klungthanaboon, 2013, 2015; Wipawin & Wanna, 2014). Findings from a
mixed-method in the current study suggest that the copyright issue should not be neglected in the
adoption and the implementation of university-based IRs. Unexpectedly, tools like
SHERPA/RoMEO were not widely known to this study’s participants, particularly in the case of
faculty members in other disciplines outside the LIS field. It is essential that libraries promote
the use of such tools or take responsibility to learn about publisher policy on open access and
self-archiving on behalf of faculty members and work closely with them to make sure that they
are available for help and support.

240

6.1.2.8 Trust toward IRs
Faculty members’ trust toward university-based IRs was found not to be significant and
did not directly enhance their actual usage of university-based IRs. Hypothesis 8 was not
supported (Table 6.1, β = -0.11, p = .096). The notion of trust in this study is related to issues
such as fear of plagiarism, long-term preservation, and quality of the IR itself. While results from
the quantitative part of the study suggest that issues relating to trust did not directly contribute to
faculty members’ actual usage of university-based IRs, the qualitative findings show that
trustworthiness was cited an important factor in decisions regarding contribution to universitybased IRs. Most contributors in the qualitative study emphasized trustworthiness. A previous
study also found that faculty members in the U.S. research universities expressed concern about
the issue of trust, indicating that a low level of trust made them hesitate to self-archive in
university IRs (Kim, 2008, 2010). A faculty member from the biochemistry field who was
interested in depositing research data in a university-based IR said, “if university-based IR or
other open access repositories in Thailand had equal quality as one developed by the university
where I graduated, I would be the first one to contribute. It would be great if we could put our
data in a safe place. I don’t know if I can archive my research data in MUIR, and also I wonder
whether I can trust the system” (IV002). Clearly, failing to establish trust among faculty
members toward IRs may delay their participation in them. In other words, if the faculty
members could trust the system, they would be more likely to use IRs.
One important factor emerged from the qualitative part is that interviewees expressed
concerns regarding long-term preservation in both university-based IRs and social networking
sites. This finding is similar to that in the study of repositories in the U.S. context, that
“repositories are not yet providing key preservation services, such as guaranteeing the integrity

241

of file formats for future use” (Markey et al., 2007, pp. ix). However, the study in the U.S.
context was carried out at the early stage of IR development and implementation, while the
current study was conducted many years after university-based IRs had been operated in the Thai
research university context. Evidently, this issue has been ignored for a very long period of time.
Librarians and IR developers in Thailand should take responsibility by developing and
implementing preservation plan as part of the university-based IR services. It also seems clear
that some degree of uncertainty existed and led one of the interviewees to seek an alternative
means of personal archiving, by uploading works to GoogleDrive. There has been an increasing
concern regarding personal digital archiving and preservation. If libraries can offer this service
along with IRs, it would be of great benefit for faculty members.
6.1.2.9 Facilitating Conditions
The findings in the current study demonstrated that facilitating conditions did not have a
direct effect on faculty members’ actual usage of university-based IRs. Hypothesis 9 was not
supported (Table 6.1, β = 0.05, p = .497). This means that the faculty members’ actual usage of
university-based IRs did not depend on the availability of facilitating conditions such as the
Internet or guidance in using the technology. Although the UTAUT model suggests that
technology and other issues related to technology are important factors contributing to
technology acceptance and use (Venkatesh et al., 2003), there is no evidence in the present
sample that facilitating conditions can predict actual usage of university-based IRs. In the open
access context, Dulle (2010) and Dulle and Minishi-Majanja (2011) reported that facilitating
conditions were found to significantly affect researchers’ actual usage of open access in
Tanzania. In the Thai higher education context, Boonsong (2014) found that facilitating
conditions had the strongest positive direct effect on instructors’ usage behavior in the use of

242

web-based learning. Although this factor was found not significant and could not predict the
actual usage of IRs, both contributors and a non-contributor in the qualitative part of the current
study indicated that they valued facilitating conditions. The conversation with interviewees
allowed this study to identify some services requested by faculty members, such as online
guidance, personal consulting services, and meetings and workshops on suggested topics such as
the benefits of university-based IRs and the content depositing process. A faculty member
suggested that libraries and librarians should promote the use of university-based IRs both on
and off campus. Therefore, local researchers around the university community could benefit
from these invaluable resources. This study recommends that IR developers take facilitating
conditions into account and provide necessary resources and services that may help to facilitate
faculty members’ use of IRs, as suggested by faculty members who participated in this study.
6.1.2.10

Behavioral Intention

Consistent with results in several studies (Boonsong, 2014; Dulle, 2010; Dulle &
Minishi-Majanja, 2011; Venkatesh et al., 2003), usage intention was found to have a significant
direct effect on actual usage. Hypothesis 10 was supported (Table 6.1, β = 0.50, p < .001). The
standard path coefficient of 0.50 shows a strong effect, making behavioral intention an important
and indeed the strongest predictor of faculty members’ actual usage of university-based IRs. This
means that usage increased by 0.50 standard deviations for every one standard deviation increase
in intention. Clearly, faculty members who intended to use IRs were more likely to engage in and
use them and increase their use of them in the future. Along with those of other studies, results
from this study confirm that behavioral intention is a consistent predictor of actual usage of
technology as proposed in the UTAUT model (Venkatesh et al., 2003). The significance of this
factor implies that IR developers should pay attention to encouraging the faculty members’

243

intention to use university-based IRs, for instance, by enhancing their awareness of IRs and
providing information on the real benefits of IRs. Additionally, the qualitative findings of this
study suggest that faculty members value benefits, especially a direct academic reward system
such as giving credit or acknowledging those who self-archive and using self-archiving as an
indicator for evaluation. This study proposes that an appropriate reward system could not only
help to improve faculty intention to use IRs but also help to increase the uptake of IRs in the long
run.
The findings of this study reveal that both the UTAUT model and the model of factors
affecting faculty self-archiving can help to explain the adoption and use of university-based IRs
in the Thai research university context. This study confirms that performance expectancy, social
influence, and resistant to chance are significant predictors of behavioral intention, while
behavioral intention and altruism are significant predictors of actual usage. It may be inferred
from the findings that improving factors that affect faculty members’ intentions such as
performance expectancy, social influence, and reduced resistance to change, will also increase
the adoption of IRs. Altogether these three factors accounted for 52% of variance (R2 = .52) in
behavioral intention. Furthermore, behavioral intention and altruism were found to be significant
predictors of usage behavior; these two predictors accounted for 50% of variance (R2 = .50) in
actual usage behavior. The final model was found to fit the observed data better than the
proposed research model. Although some factors such as attitude, effort expectancy, copyright
concerns, trust toward IRs, and facilitating conditions were found not to be significant, none of
them should be disregarded in the development of IRs. More emphasis may be put on the major
significant factors, while other factors also need to be taken into account in order to ensure the
success of IRs in the long term.

244

6.2

Limitations of the Study
This study has some limitations due to the sample size, response rates, and data gathering

methods. Theoretically, structural equation modeling (SEM) is a large sample technique (Kline,
2005). This study adopted a path analysis, a variant of SEM, for assessing the model fit and for
hypothesis testing. According to Kline (2005), a small sample size may result in an unstable
model estimate. After the data screening, there were 173 cases left for path analysis. This number
is considered a small sample size for SEM. Additionally, a complex model such as the one
proposed by this study requires a large sample for stable estimates. The ratio of case can be as
low as five cases per variable (5:1), by which indicator an appropriate sample for this study
should be 240 cases. Also, if latent variables have multiple indicators, 100 cases per group is
recommended for multi-group modeling (Kline, 2005). Theoretically, it is not optimal to carry
out analysis for multi-group modeling with the sample size of the current study.
The participants in this study were limited to faculty members who volunteered to
participate and to fill out the survey. Even though this study employed both traditional mail and
online questionnaire using Qualtrics, the response rates were still low, which might create a risk
of bias (Bryman, 2008). Additionally, about half of participants in this study were faculty
members aged 25-39 years (84, 47.7%), and slightly more than half of them were instructors and
lecturers (101, 57.4%). They might not have been a good representation of all faculty members
in Thai research universities. Therefore, the results may not be generalizable to the entire
population, the faculty members in all Thai research universities. In addition, the data in this
study were also limited by the possibility of various biases due to the use of a self-reporting
questionnaire.

245

Another limitation was that the participating institutions in this study were only four
research universities. Therefore, this study lacked information about other university-based IRs
operated by other research universities. Currently, some other research universities have also
implemented university-based IRs, for instance, Chiang Mai University Intellectual Repositories
(http://cmuir.cmu.ac.th), which was launched in 2014, and Kasetsart University Knowledge
Repository (http://kukr.lib.ku.ac.th/db/kukr/multi_menu/index/8), which has been operated since
2015. Since this study did not cover these newly operated IRs, space for future research on this
topic is available.
6.3

Future Research
This study was the first study to address factors affecting faculty members’ acceptance

and use of university-based IRs in the Thai research university context. It uncovered factors
underlying user acceptance and use of university-based IRs. Additionally, using a mixed
methods approach allowed the researcher to discover and explain faculty acceptance and usage
of university-based IRs and the factors affecting their decision in greater detail. Although the
limitations of the study might have an effect on the interpretation of a final path model, all
factors identified in this study may well be useful to librarians and IR developers who currently
operate IRs and who plan to implement IRs in the near future.
The results of this study were based on the study of faculty members in only four
research universities in Thailand that have implemented and operated university-based IRs.
Therefore, this study reflected the views of only faculty members in these institutions. There are
other IR stakeholders, including researchers and graduate students, who also play an important
role as both contributors and users of IRs. Further studies should include more institutions and

246

address all stakeholders in order to obtain a fuller view of the development and implementation
of IRs in Thailand.
Finally, another important finding of this study was the confirmation that there is a
disciplinary difference among the science and technology fields versus the humanities and social
sciences in the use of IRs and attitudes toward open access publishing, as suggested by many
studies (Abrizah et al., 2015; Akers & Doty, 2013; Dubinsky, 2014; Dulle, 2010; Kim, 2008;
Tenopir et al., 2015). Findings from both the quantitative and the qualitative parts of this study
revealed this pattern. The majority of respondents were faculty members from the science
disciplines (71 from other science and technology fields and 49 from medical and health
sciences), as compared to 50 from the humanities and social sciences. The quantitative findings
indicated that when IR contributors from other science and technology disciplines and those
from the medical and health sciences were combined, this group made up the overwhelming
majority of IR contributors (30 out of 44, 68%), compared with faculty members from the
humanities and social sciences (14 out of 44, 32%). Interestingly, faculty from the humanities
and social sciences said they were more likely to publish their work in the near future, as
compared to those in the medical and health sciences and other science and technology fields.
Findings from the interviews showed that two interviewees from scientific fields (biochemistry
and mathematics and computer science) were more familiar with open access journals and
expressed more positive attitudes toward them, as compared with those from the library and
information sciences. None of the interviewees from the field of library and information sciences
mentioned open access journals or had experience publishing in open access journals although
this group of respondents had more knowledge and understanding of open access publishing and
its principles. In a similar context, a study concerning stakeholders’ perspectives on IRs also

247

found that researchers in the science and technology fields were more familiar with open access
publishing as compared with those in the social sciences and humanities (Klungthanaboon,
2015). Clearly, such disciplinary differences are key for IR development, particularly in the Thai
higher education context. Future studies should be done examining each discipline in a greater
detail or comparing scholars from these two camps in terms of IR usage, preferences, and factors
that may motivate their acceptance and use.
6.4

Recommendations and Suggestions
Based on the findings, some recommendations for libraries, librarians, IR managers and

developers who are currently involved in IR projects and those who plan to implement IR
projects in the future are presented.
First, university-based IRs should be built based on a bottom-up approach with
complementary formal policies regarding benefits. It was found that a lack of faculty
participation was the major problem hindering IR development and implementation in the Thai
research university context. Despite the fact that university-based IRs in the current study have
been operated for more than ten years, they have not been successful in terms of faculty
participation and the quantity of content. Faculty members in this study expressed different
opinions on mandated self-archiving versus voluntary self-archiving. On one hand, faculty
members believed that a clear university policy on mandated self-archiving and a reward system
could help to increase faculty participation. Others believed that libraries/librarians and IR
developers should act as facilitators to facilitate communication between the library and faculty
members and create a more collaborative environment to encourage faculty members to engage
in IRs. The results from this study suggest that libraries should adopt a bottom-up approach to
engage faculty members in the development of IRs and build collections. Any new services

248

should be designed based on the needs of faculty members as a major concern. Working closely
with those who were the pioneers (early adopters) may be beneficial for reaching the late
majority and the laggards, who may follow the example of the pioneers, as explained by the
technology adoption curve (Rogers, 2003). However, clear policies on benefits should be enacted
because the findings show that if faculty members think that they can gain benefits through
depositing their work into IRs, they will be willing to do so.
Second, clear policy regarding open access and self-archiving is important as evidenced
by the fact that it was mentioned by faculty members in the interview part. The absence of open
access and self-archiving policies may contribute to faculty members’ lower motivation to
contribute to university-based IRs or make their work publicly available in other venues.
Different opinions have also been posted regarding mandated versus voluntary self-archiving.
This study proposes that libraries have a clear policy regarding open access and self-archiving in
place and adopt the policy of voluntary self-archiving. However, incentives and benefits, such as
academic rewards, for those who self-archive and commit to contributing to university-based IRs
should also be provided and made clear in the policies. Based on the qualitative data analysis of
this study, benefits and academic rewards may include but not be limited to giving credit or
acknowledging those who self-archive and using self-archiving as an indicator for evaluation and
promotion.
Third, need assessment and usability testing at an institutional level are needed. The
current study was conducted in four research universities in Thailand. Although the major focus
of the study was not to address faculty members’ needs regarding university-based IRs, results
from the mixed method approaches provide some insight into faculty members’ need for specific
services related to university-based IRs. The faculty’s needs may vary depending on the

249

characteristics of the IRs developed by their respective universities. It was also found that
although university-based IRs in Thailand have been operated for a long of time, in some cases
for more than five years, not all of them has been evaluated. In order to understand faculty
members in each community more clearly, needs assessment and usability testing at an
institutional level should be conducted. Kim and Kim (2008) suggest that a usability evaluation
for digital institutional repositories may cover user satisfaction, system supportiveness,
usefulness, and effectiveness. Since many researchers suggest that the evaluation of an IR should
cover both the self-archiving process and the searching system (Qing & Ruhua, 2008; Zhang,
Maron, & Charles, 2013; Betz & Hall, 2015), this study suggests that librarians and IR
developers should apply an evaluation framework to assess issues regarding content and the
content deposition process (self-archiving process), and IR functionalities (the browse system
and the user-interface design) identified in the current study. Both large-scale and small-scale
user studies may be needed. While a large-scale user study can provide the general feedback
about an IR, a small-scale usability study, using both on-site (laboratory testing) and remote
usability tests, may provide more inside into IR functionality (search system and interface
design). Results could provide invaluable information that may be useful for not only improving
the existing services but also launching new IR-related services tailored based on the users’
needs.
Fourth, the findings show that there has been a lack of communication and collaboration
between libraries and librarians, who have been responsible for developing and implementing
university-based IRs, and faculty members, who are one of the major stakeholders of IRs, being
both contributors and users. Results from both the survey data and the interviews indicate that
many of the faculty members in this study had not been aware of university-based IRs. Of those

250

who indicated that they had been aware of university-based IRs, only a small proportion (25%)
had contributed. The interview data analysis shows that some faculty members still did not
understand the real benefits of university-based IRs and asked for more clarification from
libraries and librarians. Therefore, it is important for librarians to work closely and collaborate
with faculty members in order to promote the benefits of IRs and establish trust among faculty
members and other stakeholders in the community. By working closely and collaboratively with
faculty members, librarians may gain more trust and support from them, which in turn may result
in their being more willing to contribute. It also appears that younger or junior lecturers were
more likely to participate in and contribute to university-based IRs. Therefore, this study
suggests that librarians should work collaboratively with this group of faculty members.
Fifth, researchers also suggest that the success of a library-operated institutional
repository may be based upon a new role of librarians in developing and implementing the IR
(Palmer, Teffeau, & Newton, 2008; Foster & Gibbons 2005). Although the findings in this study
indicate some success on the part of librarians in the promotion of knowledge about the existence
of university-based IRs, the participation rate of the faculty members was still low. This study
suggests that libraries/librarians should play a more active role in encouraging faculty members
to use university-based IRs as a new channel for scholarly communications. The new role may
include offering new services related to research data management. An interviewee from
biochemistry field showed his interest in depositing a data set into the university-based IRs
developed by his university. However, the interviewee expressed concern about whether the
university-based IR was a safe place for his data set and whether the librarians were capable of
dealing with sensitive data such as human subjects and clinical data. The interviewee said, “If the
university-based IR will allow faculty members to self-archive this type of data in the future, it is

251

essential that they make clear policy regarding this issue and make sure that librarians can deal
with it” (IV002). Therefore, this study suggests university libraries and librarians should make a
clear policy regarding research data services and work closely with faculty members to support
them.
Sixth, it may be beneficial to use a combination of methods to promote IRs. The results
of this study show that IR staff members and librarians, library/university websites, and
colleagues were found to be the major sources through which the faculty members were
informed about university-based IRs. This evidence shows that IR staff members and librarians
played a significant role in promoting of university-based IRs, as also shown by many other
studies (Foster & Gibbons, 2005; Kim, 2008). Several other ways in which the faculty members
had learned about university-based IRs included personal contact with other important persons,
such as deans/directors of the libraries, deans of colleges, and presidents/vice presidents of the
universities; events such as university and faculty meetings and international and national
conferences; and by other ways such personal contact via electronic mail and Google searches.
The results of this study suggest that using a combination of methods in promoting universitybased IRs can be beneficial for reaching a larger number of potential users and may help to
recruit more participants.
Seventh, IR user-interface design and search interface systems should be improved to fit
the users’ needs. At the time of the study, all university-based IRs in the current study had
adopted DSpace and relied on its user-interface design. In both the survey and the interviews, a
number faculty members complained about the user-interface and search-interface of IRs
developed by their respective universities. Some faculty members also cited this issue as a reason
for not using the IR. At present, in the digital environment, user-interface design is becoming

252

more important since users rely solely on user-interface to reach and explore digital collections
as well as IR collections. If the user-interface fails to capture user attention, it is less likely that
they will use those collections or return to use them again in the future. The results of this study
suggest using a Web 2.0 approach for designing and improving the user-interfaces of universitybased IRs. This finding is in line with those of a previous study which confirm that Web 2.0
design patterns and approaches have potential for enhancing community participation in
institutional repositories, particularly in the case of PocketKnowledge at the Teachers College,
Columbia University (Cocciolo, 2010). The traditional browsing system which allows users to
browse by communities, subjects, authors, and titles, may need to be redesigned through the
addition of more browse functions.
Finally, at this time the majority of content in university-based IRs is research papers,
thesis and dissertations (graduate students are required to deposit their work in university-based
IRs except for MUIR). Other resources, such as grey literature, are less likely to be deposited.
The recommendation of this study is that university-based IRs should be expanded to accept a
greater variety of works. Supplementary materials related to research such as conference papers,
presentations, and posters of not only faculty members but also other stakeholders such as
researchers, staff, and students should be allowed for self-archiving. Additionally, a faculty
member in biochemistry suggested that even unpublished papers or negative research results
should be allowed to be posted in university-based IRs, since these resources can benefit other
researchers by allowing them to build upon them (IV002). Depositing such work into universitybased IRs would provide a better chance for visibility and accessibility of the work.
Although the survey data show that none of the faculty respondents had deposited a data
set in a university-based IR, a faculty member in biochemistry expressed his interest toward data

253

sharing. He was also interested in depositing a data set into the university-based IR developed by
his university. However, the faculty member indicated that he was not sure if he could trust
either librarians or the system. Libraries and IR developers may consider collecting and
preserving data sets in IRs and preparing for this new service. In order to guarantee long-term
preservation and accessibility of research data, collaborative work between librarians as metadata
specialists and faculty members, who are data originators, may be needed.
6.5

Conclusions
This study provides a holistic picture of university-based IRs from the faculty members’

perspective. The core purposes of university-based IRs are to store and to make accessible digital
materials created by their communities. Dorner and Revell (2012) proposed a simple equation by
which IRs can become a successful innovation: “Input of documents + Access/Use of documents
= Success of the IR” (p. 262). Evidence found in this study confirms that awareness of IRs is key
for both sides of the equation. For the input (deposit) side, it was found that those who had been
aware of university-based IRs were more likely to agree that the development of IRs was
important. The greater proportions of them were contributors and were more likely to become
involved and deposit their work in the future. On the access and usage side, it is clear that faculty
members who had been aware of IRs were more likely to use them. This study suggests that the
inclusion of awareness of IRs in Dorner and Revell’s equation may help to increase the uptake of
IRs and help them to become a successful innovation: “Awareness of IRs (Input of documents +
Access/Use of documents) = Success of the IR.”
However, in view of the findings of this study, the numbers of those who had been aware
of IRs but did not contribute and did not know whether to contribute seems to be high, and these
numbers should not be ignored. Education in and promotion of open access and institutional

254

repositories can play an important role in the adoption of IRs in this context. Proper guidance is
also essential and must be made available in a variety forms. This study confirms that the success
of university-based IRs does not depend on a single factor; rather, every factor must be taken
into account. The usefulness of university-based IRs (performance expectancy), social influence,
and resistance to change are significant predictors that can enhance a faculty member’s intention.
Additionally, faculty members’ usage of university-based IRs can be predicted by their intention
and their altruistic motivation. Other factors can also contribute to the success of IRs. Therefore,
all of these factors can be used to assist IR managers and developers to implement strategies,
derived from the users’ perspectives, to increase faculty participation and involvement, which
will help to improve the uptake of university-based IRs in Thailand. Besides, the collaborative
efforts among faculty members (as contributors and users), libraries/librarians (as IR
developers), and other stakeholders within communities are necessary and essential for the
sustainability of university-based IRs.
