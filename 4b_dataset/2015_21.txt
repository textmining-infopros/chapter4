ABSTRACT
Educators have a responsibility to choose and share picture books with young
children carefully, with a full understanding of the psychological, cultural and
developmental potential that these books have for children. Picture books have a
profound and lasting effect on children at a most impressionable age. Children identify
with the characters in the picture books, sometimes through the personality of the
characters, and that identification allows them to acquire ideas and emotions, conscious
and unconscious, that promote developmental growth and teach social and cultural
constructs.
This study employed a mixed methods research design using content analysis to
describe the total personality of young characters in picture books from three decades: the
1950s, the 1980s, and the 2000s. This study looked for changes in the personalities of
young characters in those time periods, including changes related to the gender of the
characters.
This study found a consistent whole personality for the young characters in the
picture books studied that can be described using the Big Five Personality Factors. There
were statistically significant differences in the time periods for two of the Big Five
Personality Factors. Although there were differences in personality between genders,
those differences were not statistically significant.
Significant differences in the personality factors of extroversion and openness to
experience in the time periods studied may be related to changes in society that have
impacted the lives of children. The use of media, especially television, had exploded into

the lives of children in the time periods studied. The relationship between children and
nature had changed over the time periods.
Children may need adult intervention in terms of providing context, literary
analysis, and discussion when reading picture books. Educators using picture books in
instruction may need to carefully consider cultural standards, cultural ideals, and cultural
change reflected in the books as part of instructional planning. Educational researchers
need to examine the whole personality of characters in picture books so that the findings
of their studies may inform and influence those in the home and the school using this
powerful tool to help our children achieve their potential.

Chapter I
INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER
Purpose of the Study
The characters in picture books provide models for children to emulate and to use
to help them learn about the world, including social conventions. The personality of the
characters is significant in providing a way for children to identify with the characters.
One way in which children learn stereotypes is through media, including picture books.
Stereotypes, learned through media, may have a lasting effect on children in the way they
perceive themselves and the way they interact with the world. The purpose of this study
was to determine and explore the whole personality of young characters in Caldecott
Award winning picture books from three decades: the 1950s, the 1980s, and the 2000s. A
list of the 30 books that won the Caldecott Award in the time periods studied is found in
Appendix A. This study looked for changes in the personalities of young characters in
those time periods, specifically changes related to the gender of the characters.
Because picture books have a profound and lasting effect on children at a most
impressionable age, it was important to recognize how they were used to model social
conventions in the home, in the school, and in counseling. Bibliotherapy, the therapeutic
use of books, is used in educational settings to help students in both counseling and in the
classroom. It has been used to address problems of sexism and racism and to promote
1

2
positive self-concept as well as social competence development and has been used to
reduce gender differentiation in children’s play (Honig, 1998; Marrs, 1995). Articles have
been written about the importance of appropriate teacher training for bibliotherapy in the
classroom (Catalano, 2008; Morawski, 2006). In the bibliotherapy process, children
identify with literary characters and learn from character’s behaviors, attitudes, and
coping mechanisms (Gladding & Gladding, 1991). However, little work has
systematically examined the personality factors and traits of these characters. The
personality factors making up the whole child modeled in these picture books is
important to understanding how these picture books influence children, how they can
most effectively be used in home and educational settings, and how they reflect aspects
of our culture.
Organization of the Chapter
After introducing the chapter by presenting the purpose of the study, this
explanation of the organization of the chapter is followed by background information
germane to understanding the research problem. A statement of the problem precedes a
brief description of the personality theory central to the instrument used in the
quantitative portion of the study. Next, the importance of the study is discussed, both in
terms of academic significance and real-life application. Definitions of key terms critical
to understanding the study are provided. The three research questions addressed by the
study are presented with the rationale for each question. The chapter ends with a
summary.

Background of the Problem
History of Picture Books in America
From the beginnings of history in America, children’s books have been used to
model and to mold the American child. In colonial America, religious instruction was the
basis of most reading materials available to children (Meigs, Eaton, Nesbitt, & Viguers,
1969; Smith, 1967; Saucier, E., 1941). After achieving independence, a new emphasis on
nationalistic aims and moral concerns of the period replaced religious themes in
children’s books. Developing an ideal citizen was the major theme of reading materials
for children for many decades (Kiefer, M., 1948). In the second half of the 19th century,
reading materials for children began to be differentiated by gender (Murray, 1998;
Russell, 2001).
Throughout most of American history, there was a paucity of books written for
children, including picture books, and very little written for the enjoyment of children
(Martinez & McGee, 2000; Zipes, 2001). In the beginning of the 20th century, there was
an increase in the number of picture books written for the enjoyment of children,
although at this point such books were not yet widely available to all groups of children.
By mid-20th century many more families, including middle-class and working-class
families, were able to purchase picture books (Bader, 1976; Meigs et al., 1969). It is only
in the last several decades that children’s literature has become widely available to almost
all children in American society. Trade books have been included in many areas of
school curriculum. Reading instruction utilizes children’s literature in addition to, or even
in place of, basal readers. Classroom libraries provide opportunities for self-selected
reading for students in many school districts. School libraries provide opportunities for

4
children to borrow books. Children’s literature has potential to influence almost all
children in society (Bader, 1976; Martinez & McGee, 2000; Meigs et al., 1969; Murray,
1998).
Picture Books as Conveyers of Cultural Models
Picture books convey and model cultural constructs and norms (Mattix &
Sobolak, 2014; McCabe, Fairchild, Grauerholz, Pescosolido, & Tope, 2011; Spitz, 1999;
Taylor, 2003; Warner, 1995; Worland, 2008; Zipes, 2001). They have been used to shape
morals, control information, model proper behavior, delineate gender rules, and reinforce
class, race, and ethnicity (Bader, 1976; Kortenhaus & Demarest, 1993; Murray, 1998;
Nilsen, 1971; Oskamp, Kaufman, & Walterbeek, 1996; Spitz, 1999; Zipes, 2001). They
have challenged or reinforced stereotypes in many areas including gender, ethnicity, age,
occupations and lifestyles. They have modeled the optimal child, in terms of character
traits and behaviors as well as attitudes and coping mechanisms (Flerx, Fidler, & Rogers,
1976; Gladding & Gladding, 1991; Jalongo, 2004). Picture books also reflect idealized
cultural constructs that have the potential to change and shape communities and society
as well as individuals (Kortenhaus & Demarest, 1993; Martinez & McGee, 2000;
Murray, 1998; Sipe & Pantaleo, 2008; Warner, 1995).
Picture books are especially effective as conveyers of cultural models because
they are used when children are young and impressionable; they combine the power of
words and pictures; they transfer the positive emotions contained in the significant
adult/child reading situation to the cultural message of the picture book (Bader, 1976;
Jalongo, 2004; Kiefer, B., 2008; Kitchen, 2000; Oskamp et al., 1996; Spitz, 1999;
Worland, 2008). The target audience for picture books is preschool and early elementary-

5
aged children who do not yet possess the evaluative skills to assess critically picture
books and the literary, social, conceptual and cultural constructs contained in the books
(Bader, 1976; Diekman & Murnen, 2004; Marshall, G., 1975; Nilsen, 1971; Pelletier &
Astingtom, 2004; Pike, Barnes, & Barron, 2010; Spitz, 1999; Yu, 2009). The characters
in these picture books have a part in shaping culture; an understanding of the total
personality of the characters provides a better understanding of American culture. The
many different values and mores of diverse ethnic and cultural groups in America are
reflected in the words and behaviors of the characters in picture books. Some authors and
researchers, such as E. D. Hirsch, Jr., deliberately work at creating a “‘shared knowledge’
and hence a uniform culture” (Murray, 1998, p. 211), while others, such as William J.
Bennett, create fables extolling nostalgic American virtues (Murray, 1998; Zipes, 2001).
Ethnic groups pursue children’s literature that reflects the hopes and values of their
cultures. Murray (1998) wrote that “children and childhood have become the pawns in an
ideological war” (p. 212), and are exposed to a wider range of values, mores, cultural
constructs than ever before in our history. These children will use what they learn to
create tomorrow’s culture (Murray, 1998).
Statement of the Problem
Picture books have potential for great psychological, social and cultural power in
the lives of young children. Young children are exposed to the power of picture books
when they are impressionable, vulnerable and not yet capable of critical literary analysis
(Diekman & Murnen, 2004; Marshall, G., 1975; Nilsen, 1971; Oskamp et al., 1996;
Pelletier & Astingtom, 2004; Pike et al., 2010; Spitz, 1999). The young characters in

6
picture books serve as models for young children. Currently there is a lack of research
identifying the total personality of young characters in picture books.
Bibliotherapy is the therapeutic use of reading materials, including picture books.
Although initially associated with medicine and psychiatry, in recent years it has
expanded into other fields, including education (Bernstein, 1977; Jack & Ronan, 2008;
Lehr, F., 1981). In the school setting, bibliotherapy has been used to address gender and
ethnic bias, and to promote social competence development, promote positive selfconcept, and reduce gender differentiation in children’s play (Honig, 1998; Marrs, 1995).
An important step in the process of bibliotherapy is identification, which may take the
form of emotional connection to a character in a book (Pardeck, 1998; Russell &
Shrodes, 1950; Zipes, 2001). An understanding of the personalities of the characters in
picture books will help in the selection and use of the most appropriate books for the
identification step in the process of bibliotherapy. The present study provided information
about the whole personality of young characters in picture books that is valuable for
gaining insight into the identification children feel with certain characters in picture
books.
Characters in picture books also serve as models for gender socialization.
Numerous studies have found that picture books have significant gender bias (Allen, A.,
Allen, & Sigler, 1993; Collins, Ingoldsby, & Dellmann, 1984; Crabb & Marciano, 2011;
Creany, 1995; Dellmann-Jenkins, Florjancic, & Swadener, 1993; Dougherty & Engel,
1987; Kolbe & LaVoie, 1981; Kortenhaus & Demarest, 1993; Mattix & Sobolak, 2014;
McCabe et al., 2011; Nilsen, 1971; Weitzman, Ross, Eifler, & Hokada, 1972; Williams,
J. A., Vernon, Williams, & Malecha, 1987). This gender bias has a negative effect on

7
children’s development, limiting the behavioral and occupational aspirations of girls and
limiting the emotional range of boys. Gender bias in children’s literature may influence
children’s future roles as parents and even influence personality characteristics (Flerx et
al., 1976; Fox, 1993; Goodroe, 1998; Hamilton, Anderson, Broaddus, & Young, 2006;
Weitzman et al., 1972). A greater understanding of the personalities of the characters in
picture books would provide additional information about the gender bias and gender
stereotypes present in certain picture books and how that bias has changed.
Big Five Personality Factors to Measure Total Personality
This study used a standard Big Five personality instrument to identify the whole
personality of the young characters in Caldecott Award winning picture books in three
time periods. Across several decades, five recurring personality factors have emerged as
consistently replicable (Borgatta, 1964; Digman & Takemoto-Chock, 1981; Goldberg,
1990, 1992; John, Angleitner, & Ostendorf, 1988; Norman, 1963; Tupes & Christal,
1992) and meaningful as a structure for classification and comparison of personality in a
variety of contexts (Barrick & Mount, 1991; Digman, 1990). Goldberg used the term Big
Five Personality Factors to name the factors that make up the total personality. The five
factors are: “(I) Surgency (or Extroversion), (II) Agreeableness, (III) Conscientiousness
(or Dependability), (IV) Emotional Stability (vs. Neuroticism), and (V) Culture”
(Goldberg, 1990, p. 1217). The Big Five Personality Factor, culture, is also referred to as
openness to experience.
The personality factors reflected in the young characters in picture books were
expected to change over time reflecting changes in society, especially the changes
brought about by the American feminist movement. The feminist movement associated

8
with 1960s and 1970s was concerned about the portrayal of girls and women in the
media, including picture books. Several studies of gender stereotypes and sexism
conducted in the 1990s and 2000s found a decrease in gender role stereotypes and sexism
through the 1980s, but the trend leveled off before the advent of the 1990s (Clark,
Lennon, & Morris, 1993; Hamilton et al., 2006; Kortenhaus & Demarest, 1993). Mattix
and Sobolak (2014) looked at five decades of best-selling picture books, 10 books from
each of the following years: 1972, 1982, 1992, 2002, and 2012. They looked at numbers
of central characters by gender and at the characteristic they called strength, defined as
showing “independence, determination, and a tenacity to solve their problems or go about
their business on their own” (p. 231). They found that before 1992 there were
increasingly larger numbers of female central characters as well as strong female
characters, and declining numbers of such female characters after 1992. Numbers of male
characters in both categories tended to remain stable.
The present study filled a missing piece of the research literature by providing a
more holistic view of the personality of young characters in picture books and how that
personality changed over time and how it changed by gender. Short recognized the need
for “more studies that demonstrate the vital connections between literature and issues
critical to students’ lives” (Short, 1995, p. 24).
Importance of the Study
Importance of the Study to Scholarly Research
This study was important to scholarly research because it provided new
information about the portrayal of personalities of young characters in Caldecott Award
winning picture books. This study, for the first time, looked at the portrayal of the whole

9
personality, using a standard personality measure. There have been calls in the literature
for a study that examined the portrayal of total personality of characters in picture books.
In a 1977 article, Kingston and Lovelace critically reviewed 78 articles that studied
sexism in various forms of children’s media and literature, including picture books. The
authors criticized many aspects of the research and suggested that researchers needed to
be more certain about the severity and gravity of sex role stereotyping in children’s
literature before recommending “a wholesale rewriting of the literature” (p.157). One
research need that was yet to be filled was careful study of the whole personality of the
characters. Kingston and Lovelace stated, “those who have examined the educational
literature rarely have examined the total personality of the men and women or boys and
girls portrayed” (p.136). A more recent call in the educational literature suggested that an
understanding of the complexity of characters in children’s literature requires an
understanding of the whole personality; “heroes and heroines in good literature are
portrayed as complex individuals, so it is necessary to analyze them in a holistic manner
by paying special attention to the interplay of both positive and negative traits” (Singh &
Lu, 2003, p.2).
The present study determined a standardized total personality measure of the
young characters, differentiated by gender, as depicted in Caldecott Award winning
picture books, during three decades: the 1950s, the 1980s, and the 2000s. This study
provided a new and valuable look at a more holistic concept of the model personality of
young characters in picture books. This study examined how that model personality
changed over a specific time period when gender issues in children’s literature were

10
prominent in scholarly literature and in the publishing world. This study looked for
differences in personality by gender, overall and in the three time periods.
Identification with a character in a picture book has the potential to play an
important role in gender development. Social learning theory emphasizes the importance
of learning from symbolic models, including characters found in books (Bandura, 1971;
Mischel, 1966). Flerx et al. (1976) used two sets of picture books with kindergarten
children that presented either an egalitarian portrayal of gender roles or a traditional
portrayal of gender roles. They found that the characters children identified with in
picture books were important in the development of attitudes about gender and important
in changing gender stereotypes. The present study provided new information about the
total personality of some of the symbolic models that play such an important role in
gender development and potentially have a part to play in changing gender stereotypes.
A critical step in the bibliotherapy process is identification (Bernstein, 1977;
Pardeck, 1998; Russell & Shrodes, 1950). As the child identifies with the character, he or
she begins to share the character’s motivations, conflicts, needs, and aspirations: the child
vicariously experiences the character’s emotions. Problems, feelings, and ideas that the
child has not consciously recognized may surface (Bernstein, 1977; Cohen, 1994). Case
studies and small group studies have found that preschool children construct meaning
from literature by identifying with the feelings of the characters (Lehr, S., 1990; Shine &
Roser, 1999). The bibliotherapeutic process can result in positive effects on the selfimage and aspirations of the developing child (Hynes & Hynes-Berry, 1986; McCulliss,
2012; Rubin, 1978). Developmental bibliotherapy has successfully dealt with individual
problems and group problems, such as gender and ethnic bias, development of social

11
competence, and promotion of subjective well being (Marrs, 1995). The present study
provided new information about the total personality of the young characters in picture
books that has the potential to provide a deeper understanding of the identification felt by
some children with some characters in picture books.
Practical Importance of the Study
The present study has real-world, practical importance. Picture books have
enormous potential to help children flourish. They shape the way children view the world
and view themselves. Much of the power of picture books comes from the positive
emotions contained in the significant adult/child reading situation. Very young children,
however, are vulnerable as well as impressionable. They lack the cognitive development,
the visual literacy skills, and the critical literary skills necessary to consciously
understand many of the socialization messages contained in the picture books (Marshall,
G., 1975; Pelletier & Astingtom, 2004; Pike et al., 2010; Spitz, 1999; Yu, 2009). Articles
have been written about the importance of appropriate teacher training for bibliotherapy
(Catalano, 2008; Morawski, 2006). Parents, librarians, and teachers must make informed
decisions in the selection and use of picture books so that the books chosen are most
appropriate for the flourishing of young children. This study provided valuable new
information about the personalities of the young characters in picture books that will help
adults in the picture book selection process.
Definitions of Key Terms
Androgyny – Androgyny is a term used to describe people who exhibit both
stereotypic masculine and stereotypic feminine traits (Bem, 1974; Schneider, 2004). Bem
considered the androgynous person to be the most flexible, the most comfortable in

12
multiple roles, and the most mentally healthy. “In a society where rigid sex-role
differentiation has already outlived its utility, perhaps the androgynous person will come
to define a more human standard of psychological health” (Bem, 1974, p. 162).
Bibliotherapy – Webster’s Third New International Dictionary provided the first
definition of bibliotherapy in common English usage. The definition is “the use of
selected reading materials as therapeutic adjuvants in medicine and psychiatry” (Rubin,
1978, p.1), as well as “guidance in the solution of personal problems through directed
reading” (Sclabassi, 1973, p.71).
Big Five Personality Factors – Across several decades, five recurring personality
factors have emerged as consistently replicable (Borgatta, 1964; Digman & TakemotoChock, 1981; Goldberg, 1990, 1992; John et al., 1988; Norman, 1963; Tupes & Christal,
1992) and meaningful as a structure for classification and comparison of personality in a
variety of contexts (Barrick & Mount, 1991; Digman, 1990).
The five factors are: “(I) Surgency (or Extroversion), (II) Agreeableness, (III)
Conscientiousness (or Dependability), (IV) Emotional Stability (vs. Neuroticism), and
(V) Culture” (Goldberg, 1990, p. 1217). The Big Five personality factor, culture, is also
referred to as openness to experience.
Cognitive Developmental Theory – Cognitive Developmental Theory is a theory
of gender socialization first advanced by Kohlberg in 1966. Kohlberg’s theory “assumes
that basic sexual attitudes are not patterned directly by either biological instincts or
arbitrary cultural norms, but by the child’s cognitive organization of his social world
along sex-role dimensions” (1966, p. 82). Kohlberg’s theory also posits a three-stage
sequence of gender development occurring from approximately age two to age seven.

13
Kohlberg believes that after reaching the final stage, children are motivated to acquire
same-gender attitudes, behavior, values, and personality traits in order to achieve
cognitive consistency and to enhance self-esteem (Bem, 1981; Kohlberg, 1966).
Developmental Bibliotherapy – Developmental bibliotherapy is the use of reading
materials to help healthy individuals in their “normal growth and beneficial
development” (Hynes & Hynes-Berry, 1986, p.14). Developmental bibliotherapy is most
likely used in an educational setting.
Gender role stereotype (Sex role stereotype) – “When gender roles become rigid
prescriptions for gender-linked behaviors, they are known as gender role stereotypes”
(Creany, 1995, p. 289). Personality traits have been associated with gender role
stereotypes (Eagly, 1987).
Gender schema – Gender schema is “an organized knowledge structure that
contains information about the sexes” (Eckes & Trautner, 2000, p. 442). Children
recognize the significance of gender at a very early age and use gender to categorize, to
regulate behavior, and to make inferences and interpretations (Eckes & Trautner, 2000;
Martin, C., & Halverson, 1981).
Gender socialization – Gender socialization is the process of learning to conform
to the gender expectations of the culture. It is one of “the central tasks of the developing
person…a central feature of our identity” (Woodhill & Samuels, 2003, p. 555). “Given
the way human beings process information and the type of society in which we live, it is
not surprising that children are highly sex stereotyped by age 4 and that these stereotypes
are maintained throughout childhood and often into adulthood” (Martin, C. & Halverson,
1981, p. 1130).

14
Personality – Personality is the “complex of characteristics that distinguishes an
individual” (Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary (electronic resource), 2012).
Personality factor – Personality factors are broad categories, or dimensions, of
personality traits that provide a description of the complete personality. A considerable
amount of research has established that five factors are consistently reliable and valid for
classifying and describing total personality (Barrick & Mount, 1991; Digman, 1990;
Digman & Takemoto-Chock, 1981; Goldberg, 1990, 1992; Norman, 1963; Tupes &
Christal, 1961).
Personality trait – A personality trait is a “distinguishing quality” (MerriamWebster’s Collegiate Dictionary (electronic resource), 2012).
Picture book – The Association of Library Service to Children, a division of the
American Library Association, defines a picture book as a book “that essentially provides
the child with a visual experience. A picture book has a collective unity of story-line,
theme, or concept, developed through the series of pictures of which the book is
comprised” (Association of Library Service to Children [ALSC], 2012).
Bader, in 1976, provided an expanded definition of picture books:
A picturebook is text, illustrations, total design; an item of manufacture and a
commercial product; a social, cultural, historical document; and foremost an
experience for a child. As an art form it hinges on the interdependence of
pictures and words, on the simultaneous display of two facing pages, and on the
drama of the turning of the page. On its own terms its possibilities are limitless.
(p. 1)
Schema –The concept of schema in the field of psychology was originally
associated with memory and cognition but became more associated with gender
socialization in the 1980s with the work of Bem (1981) and C. Martin and Halverson
(1981) (Frawley, 2008). Schemas are defined as “naïve theories that guide information

15
processing by structuring experiences, regulating behavior, and providing bases for
making inferences and interpretations” (Martin, C. & Halverson, 1981, p. 1120).
Social Learning Theory – Social Learning Theory includes the view that media,
such as picture books, provide symbolically represented models that children use to learn
how to understand and interact with the world (Bandura, 1971). Mischel’s social learning
theory included the concept of gender socialization from “observational learning from
live and symbolic models” (Mischel, 1966, p. 57).
Socialization – Socialization is the process children go through as they learn to
conform to the expectations and norms of the society and culture around them.
Stereotype – Stereotype is defined as “an oversimplified generalization about the
characteristics of members of a group” (Martin, G. & Osborne, 1993, p. 342).
Stereotype boost – Stereotype boost occurs when performance is enhanced due to
the individual’s awareness that they are part of a positive stereotype (Schneider, 2004;
Shih, Pittinsky, & Ho, 2012).
Stereotype threat – Stereotype threat occurs when an individual feels anxiety and
that individual’s performance suffers due to awareness that they are part of a negative
stereotype (Schneider, 2004; Shih et al., 2012).

16
Research Questions and Rationale
The following research questions guided this research:
1) How can the total personality of the model child be described using the results
of the Big Five Mini-Markers personality instrument and the results of the qualitative
analysis of Big Five personality factors?
The rationale for the study rested on the concept that young characters in picture
books provided models for children to emulate and to help them learn about the world,
including social conventions. The young characters model the optimal child; children
identify with the picture book characters as part of the bibliotherpy process, sometimes
through the personalities of the characters, and learn behaviors, attitudes, and coping
mechanisms (Flerx et al., 1976; Gladding & Gladding, 1991; Jalongo, 2004). An
understanding of the personality factors that make up the model child in these picture
books is important to understanding how these picture books can be most effectively used
in the educational community. The model personality described as a result of this
research is expected to reflect the values of American culture.
2) How do the personality factors of young characters in Caldecott Award
winning picture books compare and contrast in three different time periods: the 1950s,
the 1980s, and the 2000s?
Part of the rationale behind the study was that the personality factors for young
characters would be significantly different in the three time periods, reflecting changes in
American culture. Picture books reflect culture and cultural ideals (Mattix & Sobolak,
2014; McCabe et al., 2011; Murray, 1998; Zipes, 2001) and can reflect changes in culture
(Kortenhaus & Demarest, 1993; Martinez & McGee, 2000; Murray, 1998; Sipe &

17
Pantaleo, 2008; Weitzman et al., 1972). Portrayal of culture in the America of the 1950s
emphasized traditional values as the cultural ideal. The 1960s and the 1970s brought
great change in several different ways. The Civil Rights Movement, the American
Feminist Movement, the war in Vietnam and protests against that war brought great
divides as well as great opportunities to American society. Picture books were identified,
in academia and the popular press, as a conveyer of traditional stereotypes (Nilsen, 1971;
Pyle, 1976; Weitzman et al., 1972). Publishers established guidelines to promote fair and
equitable portrayal of characters in children’s books (Pyle, 1976).
The 1990s and the 2000s brought great social, cultural and political changes to
America. The war on terrorism, extended military involvement overseas, political
disagreements over immigration, women’s increased role in the workplace, the
“asymmetry in social change” (Diekman & Murnen, 2004, p.374) brought new problems,
new solutions, new insights and new fears to America. Diekman and Murnen (2004)
considered the asymmetry in social change in the roles of men and women, especially in
terms of responsibilities in the workplace and in the home, to be a significant current
issue. Changes in the American culture that took place in the three time periods studied
were expected to be reflected in the changes in personality factors of young characters in
picture books.
3) How are the personality factors of young characters in Caldecott Award
winning picture books differentiated by gender in three different time periods: the 1950s,
the 1980s, and the 2000s?
Part of the rationale behind the study was that characters in picture books serve as
models for gender socialization. The American feminist movement of the mid-20th

18
century perceived the stereotypical portrayal of women in the media as a serious problem.
Several feminist groups looked to the portrayal of girls and women in children’s literature
as part of their investigation of the problem (Marshall, E., 2004). Numerous studies found
that picture books had significant gender bias (Allen, A. et al. A, 1993; Collins, et al.,
1984; Crabb & Marciano, 2011; Creany, 1995; Dellmann-Jenkins, et al., 1993;
Dougherty & Engel, 1987; Kolbe & LaVoie, 1981; Kortenhaus & Demarest, 1993;
Mattix & Sobolak, 2014; McCabe et al., 2011; Nilsen, 1971; Weitzman et al., 1972;
Williams, J. A. et al., 1987). This gender bias had a negative effect on children’s
development, limiting the behavioral and occupational aspirations of girls and limiting
the emotional range of boys (Flerx et al., 1976; Fox, 1993; Goodroe, 1998; Hamilton et
al., 2006; Weitzman et al., 1972). Many articles, over several decades, identified
personality traits of characters in picture books, often emphasizing masculine and
feminine traits, but these articles did not describe a whole personality of the characters.
Part of the rationale behind the study included the expectation that the differences
in personality factors in the three time periods, differentiated by gender, would show
change for both genders, but more change for females, as the need for change in the
portrayal of girls and women had been emphasized in the popular and academic
literature. Several studies of gender stereotypes and sexism conducted in the 1990s and
2000s found a decrease in gender role stereotypes and sexism through the 1980s, but the
trend leveled off before the advent of the 1990s (Clark et al., 1993; Hamilton et al., 2006;
Kortenhaus & Demarest, 1993).
A greater understanding of the whole personalities of the characters in picture
books has the potential to provide additional information about the gender bias and

19
gender stereotypes present in certain picture books and how that bias changed during the
time periods studied.
Chapter Summary
This chapter started by presenting the purpose of the study. Background
information important to understanding the problem, including a brief look at the history
of picture books in America and the role of picture books as conveyers of cultural
models, provided a foundation for a statement of the problem. The personality theory that
forms the basis for the instrument used in the quantitative part of the study was briefly
explained. The importance of the study, in terms of scholarly research as well as practical
applications, was explained. Definitions of key terms critical to understanding the study
were provided. The three research questions addressed by the study were put forth with
the rationale for each question. The chapter ended with this summary.

Chapter II
LITERATURE REVIEW
Introduction
Psychological and sociological theory has given picture books a place in the
psychological development of children as well as the socialization of children. Part of
that socialization is the development of stereotypes. Accurate stereotypes make coping
with the myriad choices of life easier and more efficient and deepen and enrich our
understanding of the world (Schneider, 2004). Gender stereotypes, however, have been
associated with a limiting and negative effect on children’s development (Flerx et al.,
1976; Fox, 1993; Hamilton et al., 2006; Weizman et al., 1972). The personality traits that
a child shares with a character in children’s literature provide the basis for identification
with that character. Identification with the character plays an important part in
effectiveness of the literature in the psychological development of the child as well as the
socialization of the child (Pardeck, 1998; Russell & Shrodes, 1950; Zipes, 2001). The
therapeutic use of books, or bibliotherapy, is used to deal with psychological problems
and social problems, including gender and ethnic bias (Calhoun, 1987; Disque &
Langenbrunner, 1996). Although much research in gender bias and gender stereotypes in
children’s literature has considered personality traits, that research has limited the traits to
masculine, feminine, and androgynous traits. This study used the Big Five Personality

20

21
Factors to provide a measure of the whole personality of young characters in Caldecott
Award winning picture books from three time periods.
Organization of the Literature Review
This literature review was organized into several major sections. An introduction
was followed by this explanation of the organization of the literature review. The
literature review then examines the role of picture books in the psychological
development of children, the psychological aspects of gender socialization, and the
sociological aspects of gender socialization, including stereotypes. The next major
section considers the personality traits of young characters in picture books and how
those traits related to the Big Five Personality Factors. The literature review then presents
empirical research findings regarding how picture books have been shown to affect the
behavior and attitudes of children. Bibliotherapy in the educational setting and the
bibliotherapy process with fiction is explained in the literature review. The literature
review ends with a summary.
Role of Picture Books in Psychological Development of the Child
Theorists and researchers recognize the potential importance of picture books in
the psychological development of children. Through picture books children learn about
their world and themselves. The experience of reading the picture book with an adult
provides a sense of safety and psychological warmth that is transferred to the
psychological and social messages contained in the picture book. Children identify with
the characters in the picture books, and that identification allows them to acquire ideas
and emotions, conscious and unconscious, that promote developmental growth and teach
society’s standards for behavior and attitudes (Bettelheim, 1975; Spitz, 1999; Tatar,

22
1992; Warner, 1995). Spitz specifically addressed the importance of the adult/child
reading situation. Bettelheim used the psychoanalytic model to explain the role of
children’s literature in the psychological development of children, helping children deal
with psychological problems, issues, and fears on conscious and unconscious levels.
Although they recognized the psychological power of children’s literature, Tatar and
Warner took a more historical approach to understanding the role of reading in the
development of children.
Spitz recognized the experience of the adult reading a picture book to a child as
having great psychological, social and cultural power. An adult reading to a child often
provides a “psychological embrace as well as a physical one. The adult’s presence
produces a sense of safety, and this feeling of security is of paramount importance
because in the years when picture books are used, representations are not yet fully
distinguished from the objects they represent” (1999, p.16). Young children are exposed
to the power of picture books when they have not yet reached a developmental stage that
allows them to fully differentiate between what they are reading in the story and the real
world. The psychological and cultural messages that are conveyed in the book take on the
emotional tone of warmth and security provided by the warm, loving reading situation
provided by the adult reading to the child (Spitz, 1999).
Bettelheim also wrote about the psychological importance of children’s literature,
however, he based his ideas on the psychoanalytic model and looked to classic fairy and
folk tales. Bettelheim was critical of most modern children’s literature, especially
sanitized fairy and folk tales, because it avoided the difficult and dark aspects of life,
issues that children need to deal with on conscious and unconscious levels (Bettelheim,

23
1975). The more authentic and original fairy and folk tales, such as those attributed to the
Grimm Brothers, Hans Christian Andersen, and Charles Perrault, help children deal with
problems like sibling rivalry, sexual identity, selfishness, anxiety, fear, and death
(Bettelheim, 1975).
Tatar was critical of Bettelheim’s interpretation of the psychological value of
fairy tales. She rejected the “deeper” (Tatar, 1992, p. xx) meaning that Bettelheim found
in fairy tales that “looks for latent meanings by detecting inversions, projections, and
enactments of fears and fantasies” (Tatar, 1992, p. xx). She found psychological meaning
in classic children’s literature, but also looked at fairy and folk tales from an historical
perspective. She saw the meanings of these classic tales as complex and multilayered,
harnessed into service to explain psychological theory, used to control and mold the
character and psyche of children. “From its inception, children’s literature had in it an
unusually cruel and coercive streak – one which produced books that relied on brutal
intimidation to frighten children into complying with parental demands” (Tatar, 1992, p.
8). In more recent times society has gone to the other extreme, telling stories “that give
children the illusion of empowerment as consolation for their true state of
vulnerability…stories in which they magically acquire wealth and autonomy” (Tatar,
1992, p. 189).
Warner (1995) recognized the psychological and historical meaning of classic
children’s literature but emphasized the relationship between the story and the audience.
She wrote of concerns about the loss of connection between the story and its context,
historical and sociological.

24
All four theorists suggested that the child identifies with the character and takes
away a wealth of information and feelings, conscious and unconscious, which have
tremendous potential to affect the child’s self-concept, world view, behavior, and
attitudes. The present study analyzed the young characters in Caldecott Award winning
picture books from three decades: the 1950s, the 1980s, and the 2000s, using quantitative
and qualitative measures, to provide a more complete understanding of the personality of
the models that are shaping our children.
Psychological Aspects of Gender Socialization
There are several major theories describing gender socialization. One theory is
based on the concept that gender role acquisition occurs through identification with the
same-sex parent. This theory has its origins in Freudian psychology and its foundation is
the discovery by young children of the biological/genital differences between boys and
girls (Freud, 1925 [1963]). Other theories departed from Freud’s model with its emphasis
on biological/genital differences, turning to social, cognitive and developmental forces to
offer explanations for gender development in children.
Social Learning Theory
Albert Bandura, an influential 20th century psychologist, has written extensively
about the importance of symbolically represented models, including media such as
picture books, as part of his social learning theory. Picture books provide symbolically
represented models that children use to learn how to understand and interact with the
world (1971). Mischel’s social learning theory emphasized the importance of
“observational learning from live and symbolic models” (Mischel, 1966, p. 57). Symbolic
models include characters found in books. Although this social learning theory looks to

25
imitation and reinforcement to explain gender socialization, Mischel made a point of
distinguishing between direct reinforcement and inferred reinforcement, considering both
important in gender socialization.
Experimental research conducted in 1976 confirmed Mischel’s social learning
theory. The researchers used two sets of picture books with kindergarten children. One
set of books presented an egalitarian portrayal of gender roles; the other set of books
presented a traditional portrayal of gender roles. The research team included several
variables in the study: age, 4- or 5-year-old children; gender, male or female; and, of
course, the presentation of gender equitable stories or gender biased stories. A pretest
established gender stereotypical attitudes. The researchers found that the gender equitable
presentation was more effective for changing gender stereotypical attitudes for 5-yearolds than 4-year-olds and more effective for changing the attitudes of females than males.
They found that “the symbolic models children encounter in picture books…are
important factors, not only in the development of sex-typed attitudes (Mischel, 1970), but
also in changing those stereotypes” (Flerx et al., 1976, p. 1006).
Cognitive Developmental Theory
Kohlberg advanced a different theory. Like Mischel, he stressed the importance of
observation in gender socialization. His cognitive developmental theory “assumes that
basic sexual attitudes are not patterned directly by either biological instincts or arbitrary
cultural norms, but by the child’s cognitive organization of his social world along sexrole dimensions” (1966, p. 82). Kohlberg’s theory posits a three-stage sequence of gender
development. The first stage is gender identity, generally developed around the age of
two or three. In this stage, children understand that everyone is either male or female, and

26
they can identify themselves as boys or girls. At this stage children do not yet understand
that gender does not change over time. Children in the first stage may believe that
superficial changes, like a change in clothing, may change gender. In the next stage,
gender stability, developed around the age of 3 or 4, children understand that gender does
not change over time. In the stage of gender stability, children learn to organize into
gender categories. In the last stage, gender constancy, developed around the ages of 5 to
7, children understand that gender does not change over time, or in different contexts or
situations, or with superficial changes to appearance or with changes in behavior. “The
child’s gender identity can provide a stable organizer of the child’s psychosexual
attitudes only when he is categorically certain of its unchangeability” (Kohlberg, 1966,
p.95). Kohlberg believed that after reaching gender constancy, children are motivated to
acquire same-gender attitudes, behaviors, values, and personality traits in order to achieve
cognitive consistency and to enhance self-esteem (Bem, 1981; Kohlberg, 1966).
Research has confirmed and refined the understanding of Kohlberg’s theory of
gender development. Recent research suggests that the process of gender socialization
may begin earlier, perhaps as early as at 17 months old, and that children may engage in
gender-stereotypical behavior before reaching the stage of gender constancy (Thompson,
1975; Warin, 2000; Zosuls, et al., 2009). Recent research also suggests that children go
through shifts in their thinking and behavior about gender, starting with awareness of a
gender belief or behavior then moving to rigidity about that belief or behavior and finally
becoming flexible about that belief or behavior. (Katz & Ksansnak, 1994; Ruble, et al.,
2007; Trautner, et al., 2005). In 1983, Hill and Lynch proposed the gender intensification
hypothesis, suggesting that in early adolescence increased social, family and peer

27
pressures to conform to stereotypical gender roles cause adolescents to intensify gender
stereotypic beliefs, attitudes and behaviors. Although the subsequent research has mixed
results, several studies have confirmed the gender intensification hypothesis (Galambos,
Almeida, & Petersen, 1990; Priess, Lindberg, & Hyde, 2009; Signorella, Bigler, & Liben,
1993; Signorella & Frieze, 2008; Trautner, et al., 2005).
Gender Schema Theory
Gender schema theory provides an explanation for the process of organizing
gender-based relevant information so that it is useful to the individual. Bem and also C.
Martin and Halverson have proposed gender schema theories that are similar but have
significant differences.
C. Martin and Halverson defined schemas as “naïve theories that guide
information processing by structuring experiences, regulating behavior, and providing
bases for making inferences and interpretations” (1981, p.1120). Two aspects of the C.
Martin and Halverson gender schema are critical, the self-defining aspect of the schema
and the salience of the schema. Gender schema “provides some information about selfdefinition, in that the self is a member of the schema” (1981, p.1126). Salience refers to
“the extent that schemas are available for encoding information about both the self and
objects in the world” (1981, p.1126). Self-defining schemas are highly salient because
they are so important to the individual’s concept of self and how that self interacts with
the world.
Once gender schemas are adopted by children, at a very early age, they are
“maintained by making inconsistent and neutral information congruent with the schemas”
(1981, p.1130). Empirical research, some conducted with picture books, has

28
demonstrated that children tend to change nontraditional aspects of stories to fit their
traditional gender schemas (Frawley, 2008; Koblinsky et al., 1978; Rice, 2000). C.
Martin and Halverson do not believe that children have the capacity to be flexible in their
gender development. They theorize that gender development is a necessary and normal
aspect of early childhood development. Children’s gender schema remains rigid and
important until they reach an age when they start to define themselves according to
characteristics, groups, and roles that are not gender defined. C. Martin (1987) suggested
that “sex stereotypes are schemas” (p. 497).
Bem’s gender schema theory differs from C. Martin and Halverson’s in several
critical ways. Bem (1981) presents concerns for the worldview presented in gender
schema and the impact that may have on self-concept. She writes of “society’s ubiquitous
insistence on the functional importance of the gender dichotomy, from its insistence that
an individual’s sex makes a difference in virtually every domain of human experience”
(p. 362). She further explains that “gender schema becomes a prescriptive standard or
guide (Kagan, 1964; Kohlberg, 1966), and self-esteem becomes its hostage” (1981, p.
355). She views gender schema as a process of perpetuating cultural myths about gender.
Although she agrees with C. Martin and Halverson’s concept that gender schemas change
inconsistent and neutral information until it fits the schemas, she presents this as a
negative self-fulfilling prophecy.
Bem also developed the Bem Sex-Role Inventory, also known as the BSRI, which
has been used in much of the research in children’s literature that identified masculine
and feminine personality traits. Prior to the development of the BSRI, Bem and other
feminist psychologists questioned the “legacy of naturalizing gender conformity and

29
pathologizing gender nonconformity” (Bem, 1993, p. 118) that was prevalent in the field
of psychology. There are four results for the BSRI; people who take the inventory may
have a score that indicates they are masculine, feminine, androgynous, or
undifferentiated. People who are “sex-typed” (Bem, 1974, p. 162) as masculine have high
scores in masculine traits; those who are “sex-typed” (Bem, 1974, p. 162) as feminine
have high scores in feminine traits. People who have high scores in both masculine and
feminine traits are androgynous. People who have low scores in both masculine and
feminine traits are undifferentiated. Bem considered the androgynous person to be the
most flexible, the most comfortable in multiple roles, and the most mentally healthy. “In
a society where rigid sex-role differentiation has already outlived its utility, perhaps the
androgynous person will come to define a more human standard of psychological health”
(Bem, 1974, p. 162).
A large number of studies investigating the mental health, academic and social
competence, and self-esteem of masculine, feminine, androgynous, and undifferentiated
people have mixed results. Generally masculine and androgynous people have exhibited
higher levels of mental health, however, boys and men who exhibit feminine traits have
lower scores in social acceptance than girls and women who exhibit masculine traits
(Aube & Koestner, 1992; Aube, Nordiffe, Craig, & Koestner, 1995; Bassoff & Glass,
1982; Campbell, Steffen, & Langmeyer, 1981; Cano, Solomon, & Holmes, 1984;
Lefkowitz & Zeldow, 2006; Marsh, Antill, & Cunningham, 1987; Orlofsky & Oheron,
1987; Stake, 1997; Woodhill & Samuels, 2003).
Studies of children and adolescents have generally found that androgyny,
flexibility in gendered behavior, and masculinity are associated with mental health, self-

30
esteem, social acceptance, and academic competence (Alpert-Gillis & Connell, 1989;
Aube & Koestner, 1992; Boldizar, 1991; DiDonato, et al., 2012; Lamke, 1982). However,
some research indicates that feminine sex-typed children rate themselves as better
behaved, especially in the structured classroom setting (Boldizar, 1991; Hall &
Halberstadt, 1980).
Several theorists have suggested that androgyny and flexibility in gendered
behavior may remain controversial as needed empirical research provides a more
complete understanding of gender socialization (Baumrind, 1982; Schneider, 2004;
Worell, 1979). Zeldow further suggested that the pursuit of androgyny may interfere with
gender socialization as the “ordering of experiences into masculine-feminine polarities
helps to facilitate children’s personality integration and may ease the consolidation of a
gender identity” (1982, p.401). Levy (1988) also warned of the problems of not
appreciating the complexities of gender development. Several theorists question the lack
of negative traits in the construct of androgyny and suggest that the mixed results in the
empirical research in androgyny may be due to this lack of a complete understanding of
the construct (Pryor, 1994; Woodhill & Samuels, 2003, 2004).
Picture books play an important role in the development of gender schema, or
gender stereotypes. Picture books have challenged or reinforced gender schema as well as
other stereotypes. They have modeled the optimal child, in terms of traits, behaviors,
attitudes and coping mechanisms (Flerx et al., 1976; Gladding & Gladding, 1991;
Jalongo, 2004). Gender schema theory plays a critical role in the development of
children. Learning the personality traits that are associated with gender lead children to

31
an understanding of gender stereotypes (or schemas) and the critical role they have in
gender socialization.
Sociological Aspects of Gender Socialization
Gender socialization is one of “the central tasks of the developing person…a
central feature of our identity” (Woodhill & Samuels, 2003, p. 555).
Given the way human beings process information and the type of society in which we
live, it is not surprising that children are highly sex stereotyped by age four and that
these stereotypes are maintained throughout childhood and often into adulthood.
(C. Martin & Halverson, 1981, p.1130)
Gender socialization is a key psychological task for individuals in our society. It
is, however, also an important element for our society, with implications for many of our
societal institutions, especially the family.
Influential early-to-mid-20th century American sociologist Talcott Parsons (1954)
developed a theory of gender role differentiation and segregation necessary to the
functioning of the family of his time as an essential system in our society. Men had the
instrumental role, working outside of the home earning an income; women had the
expressive role, making a home and caring for children. The traits associated with the
instrumental role are described as task-oriented, competitive, and self-sufficient. The
traits associated with the expressive role are described as nurturing, caring, affectionate,
and dependent (Parsons, 1954). A meta-analysis of research about gender differences in
personality found that males are higher in traits associated with the instrumental role and
females are higher in traits associated with the expressive role (Feingold, 1994). Bem’s
gender schema theory, introduced in 1974, presents masculine and feminine traits and
behaviors in terms of the classic instrumental and expressive orientation first theorized by
Parsons. Several studies of gender socialization in picture books have analyzed picture

32
book characters in terms of instrumental and expressive roles and traits (Kortenhaus &
Demarest, 1993; Kolbe & LaVoie, 1981; McDonald, 1989; St. Peter, 1979; Weitzman et
al., 1972).
Stereotypes
Part of the socialization of children, of learning to cope and to thrive in society, is
learning stereotypes. Stereotype is defined as “an oversimplified generalization about the
characteristics of members of a group” (Martin, G., & Osborne, 1993, p. 342). Preschool
children are familiar with certain specific stereotypes, including gender and gender role
stereotypes (Schlossberg & Goodman, 1972; Williams, J. E. et al., 1975).
Early 20th century sociological theory linked the concept of stereotype to
discrimination and prejudice (Allport, 1954; Judd & Park, 1993; Lippmann, 1922 [1965];
Martin, C., 1987). Later theorists refined the concept of stereotype and made it a more
neutral idea by introducing the concept of stereotype accuracy, that is, a stereotype may
or may not contain errors and biases; empirical research determines the accuracy of the
stereotype (Judd & Park, 1993). Later research has emphasized the positive aspects of
accurate stereotypes (Stangor, 1995).
Despite the negative connotation that still links stereotypes to discrimination and
prejudice, they serve important positive functions for individuals and for society. Humans
use “theories or knowledge structures” (Schneider, 2004, p. 122), to recognize, interpret,
and label stimuli, making “our interactions with the world more efficient” (Schneider,
2004, p. 122), as well as “enriching our understanding of the world” (Schneider, 2004, p.
122), by allowing humans to make inferences about stimuli that would otherwise seem
incomprehensible (Martin, C., & Halverson, 1981; Schneider, 2004).

33
Recent research in the field of reasoning has implications for stereotypes and how
they are processed in everyday life. Researchers in the field of reasoning and decisionmaking have recently advanced the dual process theory of thinking, arguing that human
thinking relies on two human reasoning systems. One system is heuristics, based on
intuitive feelings and stereotypical beliefs. The other system is the more cognitively
demanding analytic system, based on logic and controlled, deliberate reasoning.
According to this theory, human judgment is frequently biased because the analytic
operations heavily burden limited working memory resources, thus judgments and
decisions tend to be made using the quicker and easier heuristics. (De Neys &
Vanderputte, 2011; Kokis, Macpherson, Toplak, West, & Stanovick, 2002; Schneider,
2004). There is some disagreement on the developmental process of the two human
reasoning systems. One theory posits that the analytic system develops increasing ability
to override the heuristic system as human beings age; the other theory posits that both the
analytic and the heuristic systems develop in a less than orderly progression throughout
life (Kokis et al., 2002).
Recent stereotype theory includes the concepts of stereotype threat, stereotype
boost and stereotype lift (Schneider, 2004; Shih et al., 2012). Individuals who are aware
of their inclusion in a negatively stereotyped group may feel anxiety and suffer poor
performance because of the stereotype. This is stereotype threat. Individuals may benefit
from stereotype boost, when performance is enhanced due to awareness that they are part
of a positive stereotype. Enhanced performance due to stereotype lift results from
awareness of negative stereotypes about other groups (Schneider, 2004; Shih et al.,
2012).

34
The accuracy of gender stereotypes remains controversial, even among feminists.
In 1987, C. Martin conducted two studies designed to assess the accuracy of gender
stereotypes by comparing subjects’ self-reports of personality traits with subjects’ reports
of gender stereotypes. She found that “much of the content of stereotypes is based on
exaggerations of real differences, many of which are quite small” (p. 497). B. Allen
replicated C. Martin’s study in 1995 and also found that gender stereotypes were based
on exaggerated and inaccurate gender differences. Grant, Button, Ross, & Hannah
studied gender differences in attitudes. They found that “both men and women expected
larger gender differences in attitudes than actually exist” (1997, p. 83).
The American feminist movement of the mid-20th century perceived the
stereotypical portrayal of women in the media as a serious problem. Several feminist
groups looked to the portrayal of girls and women in children’s literature as part of their
investigation of the problem (Marshall, E., 2004). One group working specifically on
children’s literature was Feminists on Children’s Literature. The National Organization
for Women published a book about sexism in children’s literature. Professors wrote
feminist articles criticizing gender role stereotypes found in children’s books that
included anecdotal evidence to make their points. Pyle (1976) wrote such an article
offering examples of picture books that portray female characters as passive and
nurturing and male characters as active, adventurous and exhibiting rescuing behavior.
In 1971, after reading a New York Times article that suggested “children’s books
were unfair to girls,” (p. 918), Nilsen wrote an academic article about the role of female
characters in children’s literature. Her study sample included the Caldecott Award
winners and honor books from 1938 to 1970. She concluded that female characters were

35
underrepresented; the percentage of female characters relative to male characters was
decreasing. Female characters were portrayed primarily as homemakers and as passive,
“looking out at the action” (p. 919).
The Weitzman et al. (1972) study is often described as the seminal work in
identifying gender role stereotypes in picture books and their negative effects on the selfimage and aspirations of the developing child, both girls and boys. The Weitzman et al.
study was the beginning, not only of gender bias research in children’s literature, but also
of using picture books and other children’s literature in research to explore children’s
literature as a reflection of society, a shaper of society and a profound influence on the
development of children in multiple aspects. The authors chose to conduct a content
analysis of both text and illustration. The picture books chosen for this study were likely
to have a wide audience, winners of the Caldecott Award, winners of the Newberry
Award, Little Golden books and a group of children’s etiquette books. The results
reported were based primarily on the Caldecott sample emphasizing the winners from the
five-year period 1966-1970. The authors of the study found that female characters “were
underrepresented in the titles, central roles, pictures, and stories of every sample of
books” (p. 1128). Female characters present in the sample were “usually insignificant or
inconspicuous” (p. 1129).
The authors of the study concluded that the “simplified and stereotyped images”
(p.1147) overwhelmingly present in the representative sampling of picture books may be
“harmful to the normal personality development of the child” (p. 1147). The behavioral
aspirations and opportunities modeled for the girls were extraordinarily limiting. The
emotional range modeled for the boys was likewise limiting.

36
In a 1977 article, Kingston and Lovelace critically reviewed 78 articles that
studied sexism in various forms of children’s media and literature, including picture
books. The primary criticism of all of the articles revolved around the failure of the
researchers to determine if the materials studied were detrimental to learning or if they
just perpetuated gender stereotypes. Kingston and Lovelace suggested that the authors of
the 78 articles assumed that the materials perpetuate gender stereotypes, although none of
the studies substantiate that claim.
The Collins et al. (1984) study followed up on the Weitzman et al. (1972) study
using Caldecott Award winning and honor books from 1979 to 1982. The researchers
found that “male and female differences have decreased substantially toward more sexual
equality” (p.281). Although male characters still predominated in titles, central roles and
illustrations, there were more female characters in each of those categories than there
were reported in the 1972 study. The Collins et al. study also found that when female
characters were portrayed in the central role of the story, they exhibited the
characteristics and traits that were exclusive to male characters in the 1972 study. The
authors concluded that their sample of books showed a move towards greater gender
equality in children’s literature.
The Dellmann-Jenkins et al. (1993) study followed up on the Collins et al. (1984)
and the Weitzman et al. (1972) studies, making a few significant changes. In addition to
gender role stereotyping, the central characters in the books were examined for portrayal
of androgyny. The researchers concluded that there was greater gender equality in the
portrayal of male and female characters in their sample compared to the Collins et al.

37
sample. The researchers found that a significant number of central characters in the
sample were androgynous.
Later researchers working with gender role stereotypes in picture books criticized
the early research by Weitzman et al. and others. Davis (1984) and Williams, J. A. et al.
(1987) wrote that the Weitzman et al. (1972) study failed to provide operational
definitions for many of their measures, failed to test for statistical significance, did not
provide any information about coder reliability, and failed to be consistent in identifying
their units of analysis. The Davis study and the Williams, J. A. et al. study extended and
corrected the seminal Weitzman et al. research.
Hamilton et al. (2006) sought to update the research on gender bias in picture
books. They assessed the gender bias in 200 top-selling picture books, both award
winners and non-award winners. Picture books from 1995 to 2001 were represented in
the sample. The researchers found that female characters were still underrepresented in
picture books. Men and women characters were portrayed in gender traditional jobs. Men
characters were more often portrayed working in jobs outside of the home. In terms of
gender stereotypic behaviors, the study found that some traits appeared to portray less
gender bias; with other traits there was a trend toward less gender bias through the 1980s
and 1990s and then “a slip back for the 2001 book sample” (p.763); with some traits there
was no change in gender bias; the portrayal of one trait showed more gender bias in the
2001 book sample than in the 1980s and 1990s. Mattix & Sobolak (2014) also found a
trend toward greater representation of female characters and increasing numbers of strong
female characters in the 1970s and the 1980s and then declining numbers in the 2000s

38
and in 2012. More detailed information about the personality traits of characters in
picture books is presented in the next section.
Personality Traits of Characters in Picture Books
This section of the review of literature examines the personality traits reported in
studies of picture books. Many studies have considered masculine traits and behaviors
and feminine traits and behaviors as part of gender stereotypes. Personality traits,
characteristics, behaviors, and settings indicative of personality traits have been reported
in these studies. Many of the studies have replicated or extended the work done by the
seminal 1972 Weitzman et al. study.
Weitzman stated,
in addition to learning sex-role identification and sex-role expectations, boys
and girls are socialized to accept society’s definition of the relative worth of each of
the sexes and to assume the personality characteristics that are “typical” of members
of each sex. (p. 1125)

The Big Five Personality Factors do not align with the masculine/feminine
personality traits reported in the literature. However, there are some overlaps and
connections between the research that has been done on traits and each of the Big Five
Factors. This section of the literature review is organized around the Big Five Factors.
Here are findings from the research over a period of several decades reporting on
the traits, characteristics, and behaviors found to be “typical” for each gender.
Extroversion
Personality traits that have repeatedly been reported in the studies of picture
books over several decades are: active versus passive, assertive, adventurous, and
explorative. In the Big Five Personality Factors the traits of active, assertive,

39
adventurous, and explorative are positively related to the factor of extroversion. Certain
aspects of the explorative trait, such as the sense of curiosity, are positively related to the
factor of openness to experience, or culture. Passive and submissive are traits negatively
related to extroversion. Passivity is also negatively related to emotional stability
(Goldberg, 1990, 1992).
Several studies in the 1970s looked at gender differences in picture books. Nilsen
(1971), cited by Weitzman et al., found that female characters were frequently depicted
as passively watching the action. Male characters were active. The seminal Weitzman et
al. study (1972) differentiated characters by age. The researchers found boys involved in
“riotous activity” (p.1131) while girls were passive and “immobile” (p.1132). Girls were
depicted wearing clothing that inhibits movement. Men characters were depicted in jobs
and professions often requiring a wide variety of action. Pyle (1976) identified male
characters in picture books as active and female characters as passive.
Kolbe and LaVoie (1981) examined 19 Caldecott Award winners and honor
books representing picture books from 1972 until 1979. The purpose of their study was to
extend findings into a new time period and compare results with the Weitzman et al.
(1972) study. The researchers found that female characters were portrayed as passive in
17 out of the 19 books studied.
Both male and female characters portrayed in central roles were portrayed as
active and adventurous in the 1984 Collins et al. study.
Williams, J. A. et al. (1987) found that male characters were portrayed as active
twice as often as female characters. Male characters were portrayed as explorative three

40
times as often as female characters. Female characters were six times as likely as male
characters to be portrayed as passive. Female characters were portrayed as submissive.
The 1993 study by A. Allen et al. compared Caldecott Award winners from two
time periods, 1938-1940 and 1986-1988. The portrayal of male characters as active
increased in the later time period. Female characters were portrayed as less active in the
later time period.
Kortenhouse and Demarest (1993) studied 125 non-award picture books and 25
Caldecott Award winners or honor books. The books were published over a 50-year
period, 1940s to 1980s. Boy characters were involved in active outdoor play three times
as often as girl characters (1993).
Creany’s 1995 research on Caldecott Award winning and honor books from 1980
to 1995 found that male characters were more often active and adventurous than female
characters but the sample studied had more female characters portrayed as active and
adventurous than researchers from the 1970s had reported from their study samples.
Goodroe’s 1998 dissertation used a sample of 100 books, published between 1988
and 1998, chosen from the lists of best-selling picture books as reported in Publishers
Weekly. Overall, male characters were portrayed as active and female characters were
portrayed as passive. Goodroe found that in one of the years studied, 1990, “females
outnumbered males in active/mobile activities” (p.38).
Hamilton et al. (2006) sought to update the research on gender bias in picture
books. They assessed the gender bias in 200 top-selling picture books, both award
winners and non-award winners. Picture books from 1995 to 2001 were represented in
the sample. In their book sample male main characters were portrayed as slightly more

41
active than female main characters. They found no significant difference by gender in
portrayal of assertive behavior.
The trend seems to be that although male characters continue to be more active,
adventurous, and explorative than female characters, female characters are increasingly
portrayed as active and adventurous rather than passive. Based on the research results for
this trait, male characters are likely to be more extroverted than female characters.
Female characters are likely to exhibit increased levels of extroversion in later time
periods.
Agreeableness
Much of the research that reported on personality traits in picture books included
results about the trait of aggressiveness versus nurturing. Nurturing, or tendermindedness, is positively related to agreeableness (Saucier, G., 1994). The trait of
aggressiveness is negatively related to the Big Five factor of agreeableness (Goldberg,
1990, 1992). Cooperation is positively related to the factor of agreeableness (Goldberg,
1990, 1992). Being helpful, taking care of others, is positively related to agreeableness.
Rescuing behavior, if considered being helpful, is positively related to agreeableness
(Goldberg, 1990).
The seminal Weitzman et al. study (1972) found that women characters were
identified by their nurturing role as wife, mother. Women’s activities usually involved
“taking care of the men and children in their families” (p. 1139). Girls’ activities often
involved cooking or serving food to their brothers or fathers. Father characters were not
depicted as nurturing; they were not involved in caring for their children or their home.
Boys were depicted working together to solve problems. Girls were rarely depicted

42
working or playing with other girls. Male central characters rescued female characters.
Boy characters also rescued helpless animals.
The 1976 Pyle study found that female characters were portrayed as nurturing.
The same study found that male characters were portrayed as exhibiting rescuing
behavior.
The J. A. Williams et al. (1987) study using Caldecott Award winning and honor
books from 1972 to 1985 found that male characters were more often portrayed as
aggressive and female characters were more often portrayed as cooperative. Male and
female characters were equally likely to engage in rescuing behavior.
The Oskamp et al. (1996) study also found that male and female characters were
equally likely to engage in rescuing behavior.
Hamilton et al. (2006) studied gender bias in 200 top-selling picture books,
published from 1995 to 2001. They found no significant difference by gender in portrayal
of aggressive behavior. They also found that “nurturant behaviors are even more likely
now than in the 1980s and 1990s to be performed exclusively by girls and women” (p.
764). They found that male and female characters were equally likely to engage in
rescuing behavior.
Conscientiousness
Personality traits identified in the research of picture books do not include traits
generally identified with the factor of conscientiousness.
Emotional Stability
The trait of independence positively relates to the Big Five factor of emotional
stability (Goldberg, 1990, 1992).

43
Several traits and behaviors reported in the academic literature are negatively
related to the factor of emotional stability; these traits and behaviors include displaying
negative emotions, passivity, and lack of emotional expression (Goldberg, 1992).
Nilsen (1971), cited by Weitzman et al. (1972), found that female characters were
frequently depicted as passively watching the action.
The seminal Weitzman et al. study (1972) found that girls were portrayed as
dependent; boys were portrayed as independent. Girls were portrayed as passive. The
study also found that “girls are allowed a great deal of emotional expression; a boy who
cries or expresses fear is unacceptable” (p. 1138). Women characters were depicted as
crying in some of the picture books.
Both female characters in central roles and male characters in central roles were
portrayed as independent in the Collins et al. (1984) study. In the Kortenhouse and
Demarest (1993) study, examining 125 non-award picture books and 25 Caldecott Award
winners or honor books published over a 50-year period, 1940s to 1980s, boy characters
were portrayed as independent. Mattix & Sobolak (2014), looking at best-selling picture
books from 1972, 1982, 1992, 2002, 2012, found increasingly larger numbers of female
characters who were independent and determined in the decades up to 1992 and declining
numbers of such female characters in 2002 and 2012. Numbers of independent and
determined male characters tended to remain stable.
Openness to Experience (Culture)
Creativity is positively related to openness to experience (Goldberg, 1990).
Curiosity, an element of the trait explorative, is positively related to the factor of
openness to experience. The J. A. Williams et al. (1987) study, using Caldecott Award

44
winning and honor books from 1972 to 1985, found that male characters were portrayed
as creative.
Although the results of the research were mixed, it does seem that female
characters were engaging in more active, cooperative, rescuing, independent behaviors in
picture books in later time periods. Research strongly suggested that there are still major
gaps in gender roles and gendered behavior in picture books.
Empirical Research: How Picture Books Affect Children’s Behavior and Attitudes
The models and cultural constructs children experience when reading picture
books shape their view of the world and their concept of self (Allen, A. et al., 1993;
Mattix & Sobolak, 2014; McCabe et al., 2011). Picture books provide symbolically
represented models that children use to learn how to understand and interact with the
world (Bandura, 1971; Mischel, 1966).
Case studies and small group studies found that preschool children construct
meaning from literature by relating to the life experiences in the story and identifying
with the feelings of the characters (Lehr, S., 1990; Shine & Roser, 1999). Several studies
of the effectiveness of bibliotherapy found that literature, as part of a bibliotherapy
program with children, enhances self-concept (Calhoun, 1987; Disque & Langenbrunner,
1996; Wagener, 1975).
Empirical research also suggests that gender bias in picture books has a negative
effect on the self-concept, attitudes, interests, behavior, and aspirations of young children
(Schau & Scott, 1983).
The general results of a meta-analysis of experimental research conducted by
Schau and Scott in 1983 showed that reading gender equitable materials resulted in more

45
flexible gender role attitudes for both males and females. The amount of attitude change
was positively related to the amount of exposure to the materials. Females preferred
female main characters. Males preferred male main characters but also showed a
preference for materials that contained traditional male content. Neither males nor
females rejected gender equitable materials. Gender equitable materials did not result in
decreased reading comprehension.
Several studies over decades considered the effect gender biased versus gender
equitable children’s literature had on the recall of children who experienced the literature.
The results of the studies were mixed both in terms of how well students recalled
information and what conclusions the researchers made based on their data. Jennings, in
1975, found that preschool children who had heard a story with reversed gender roles and
a story with traditional gender roles remembered the story with reversed gender roles
longer and in more detail. She concluded that the students remembered the story with
reversed gender roles better because of the novelty of the story. Koblinsky et al., in 1978,
told elementary school children stories with male and female characters with each
character exhibiting an equal number of masculine and feminine characteristics. The
children recalled more masculine characteristics of male characters and more feminine
characteristics of female characters even though the characters in the story had equal
numbers of masculine and feminine characteristics. The children were least proficient in
the recall of feminine traits of male characters. The children had more trouble
remembering traits than remembering behavioral descriptions. The authors concluded
that children use gender stereotypes as an organizational framework for reading
comprehension. After telling a group of elementary school children a feminist folktale

46
that included male and female characters with traditional and nontraditional traits, Rice
(2000) found that the girls remembered significantly more nontraditional inclusions than
the boys. Both the boys and the girls changed nontraditional aspects of the story to fit
their traditional gender schemas. In 2008, Frawley concluded that elementary schoolaged children’s gender schema interfered with the accurate recall of gender biased
information from picture books. Quay, et al. (1993) found that preschool children who
heard stories with reversed gender roles and stories with traditional gender roles had
higher recall when the main character was the same gender as the child, regardless of
whether the story had reversed gender roles or traditional gender roles. Kropp and
Halverson (1983) presented four stories to children. Each story had a male or female
main character involved in a gender stereotypic activity. Girls reported that they liked the
story with the female character engaged in stereotypically feminine activity best and the
story with the male character engaged in stereotypically masculine activity least. Boys
reported that they liked the story with the male character engaged in stereotypically
masculine activity best and the story with the female character engaged in stereotypically
feminine activity least. However both genders of students recalled more about the story
they liked the least.
Winer and Bradenburg conducted experimental research on the effect of stories
on the behavior of first grade students and concluded that
the evidence that children imitate most strongly those behaviors characteristic
of their own sex points to the possibility that reading can affect behavior and
might serve to enhance sexually stereotyped behavior. We also have data
which indicate that through reading behavior characteristics of one sex can be
encouraged in members of the opposite sex. (1977, p.1153)

47
McArthur and Eisen (1976) measured preschool children’s task persistence
behavior after the children heard different types of achievement related stories. Both boys
and girls showed longer task persistence after hearing an achievement related story about
a character of their gender. The more they remembered about the story with the samegendered character, the more task persistence they showed. Ashton (1983) found that
young children’s play behavior was significantly affected by exposure to gender biased
versus gender equitable picture books. Those children exposed to gender biased picture
books exhibited gender stereotypical behavior while children exposed to gender equitable
picture books exhibited more comfort in play behavior stereotypically associated with
children of the opposite gender.
Several studies of preschool and elementary school children indicated that use of
gender equitable stories about occupations resulted in less gender stereotypic attitudes
about occupational roles of men and women (Ashby & Wittmaier, 1978; Barclay, 1974;
Flynn & Falconer, 2003; Schau, 1978; Trepanier-Street & Romatowski, 1999). Jennings
(1975) found that after exposure to stories that portrayed traditional gender occupations
and stories that portrayed gender reversed occupations, both preschool boys and
preschool girls preferred the characters in the traditional gender stories but remembered
the stories with the gender reversed occupations better. The girls found the gender
reversed occupations for females more acceptable than the boys found the gender
reversed occupations for males. Knell and Winer (1979) found that materials that
portrayed traditional gender occupations tended to make girls’ thinking more traditional
about occupations. Schau and Kahn (1978) found that students’ attitudes towards
occupations changed after exposure to gender reversed reading materials. They also

48
found that greater exposure to gender reversed reading materials resulted in less
stereotypical attitudes about occupations. They also found that boys tended to exhibit
more gender stereotyped behavior than girls. Children who were exposed to gender
equitable materials were less traditional about gender in their own personal occupational
aspirations (Franzoni, 1980).
Bibliotherapy
Much of the theory and the research in the area of gender socialization and gender
stereotypes recommends that parents, schools, and societal institutions in general, work
towards providing an environment conducive to more equitable gender socialization
(Catalano, 2008; Morawski, 2006). Bibliotherapy has been used to move towards
accomplishing this goal. It has successfully dealt with social problems such as gender and
ethnic bias, and has been used to promote social competence development, promote
positive self-concept, and reduce gender differentiation in children’s play and children’s
social interactions (Ashton, 1983; Honig, 1998; Jack & Ronan, 2008; Lehr, F., 1981;
Marrs, 1995).
Children’s literature, including picture books, is used in bibliotherapy for
children. A critical element in the process of bibliotherapy is identification. Identification
may involve an emotional connection to a character, group, setting or problem in a book
(Pardeck, 1998; Russell and Shrodes, 1950; Zipes, 2001). An understanding of the
personalities of the characters in books will help in the selection of books that will work
in the identification element in the process of bibliotherapy.
Bibliotherapy started in the medical/psychological fields and later expanded into
other fields, including education (Bernstein, 1977; Jack & Ronan, 2008; Lehr, F., 1981).

49
Hynes and Hynes-Berry wrote that when using bibliotherapy with children it is important
to make a clear distinction between traditional educational goals of literature class and
reading group and the goals of bibliotherapy, “a tool to help young people deal with the
issues so critical to this stage – self-identity, independence, and self-worth” (1986, p. 15).
Several authors emphasized that good literary quality is important in choosing books for
use in bibliotherapy. Spitz and F. Lehr both suggested that the genre of self-help books
lack in literary quality to an extent that such books are not compelling enough to have an
impact on the reader (Lehr, F., 1981; Spitz, 1999).
In the educational setting, bibliotherapy is considered appropriate for all students,
including those without diagnosed problems.
Everyone can be helped through reading. One might not necessarily be faced with a
problem, one might not be in therapy, and one might not be directed to the reading
material…bibliotherapy is a process in which every literate person participates at one
time or another. (Bernstein, 1977, p. 21)
In 1975, Olsen “published the first study on bibliotherapy for socially maladjusted
children” (McCulliss, 2012). This work differed from previous educational use of
children’s literature in that Olsen emphasized the use of reading to help children
overcome their problems rather than the use of reading for the purposes of character
development, values education, and/or socialization. Olsen likened bibliotherapy to
disease prevention suggesting that bibliotherapeutic reading helps children deal with
current and future problem-solving by helping them develop positive self-concept
(McCullis, 2012; Olsen, 1975).
Process of Bibliotherapy with Fiction
In 1950, Shrodes wrote a dissertation identifying a psychodynamic model for the
therapeutic process of bibliotherapy with imaginative literature or fiction. She identified

50
three steps in the bibliotherapeutic process: identification, then catharsis, and finally the
development of insight. She validated her framework in a descriptive study (Russell &
Shrodes, 1950). Since then many authors working in the field of bibliotherapy have used
the same or similar psychodynamic model as a theoretical framework to explain the
process of bibliotherapy (Bernstein, 1977; Pardeck, 1998; Russell & Shrodes, 1950).
Identification is the affiliation of the reader with a character, group, setting, or
idea in the book read. The reader shares the character’s motivations, conflicts, needs,
aspirations, and vicariously experiences the character’s emotions. Problems, feelings, and
ideas that the reader had not consciously recognized may surface (Bernstein, 1977;
Cohen, 1994).
Catharsis, the next part of the process of bibliotherapy, is the release of repressed
emotions and tension that have surfaced during identification. Although catharsis is
helpful, its benefits are often temporary. The next part of the process, insight, is essential
for a more lasting resolution to problems and the development of skills needed to deal
with future problems (Pardeck, 1998; Russell & Shrodes, 1950).
Insight is the final stage in the bibliotherapeutic process. “When the selfrecognition in identification is borne out in reality, the identification represents insight –
seeing oneself in the behavior of the character and thereby achieving an awareness of
one’s own motivations and needs” (Russell & Shroder, 1950). In this stage the reader
recognizes the solutions to problems that have been presented in the book and is able to
learn strategies to deal with similar problems in reality.

51
Chapter Summary
A comprehensive search of the professional literature found a body of theory and
research on the potential importance of picture books in the psychological development
and the socialization, especially the gender socialization, of children. Part of that
socialization included the formation of stereotypes so descriptions of the importance of
and mechanism for stereotype formation were included in the chapter. The stereotypes
children learn at this stage in life when they are impressionable, vulnerable and not yet
capable of critical literary analysis (Diekman & Murnen, 2004; Marshall, G., 1975;
Nilsen, 1971; Oskamp et al., 1996; Pelletier & Astington, 2004; Pike et al., 2010; Spitz,
1999), may have a lasting effect on the way they perceive themselves and the way they
interact with the world. Recent research in the field of human reasoning has implications
for stereotypes and how they are processed in everyday life and may result in biased
judgment because of the workings of human brains (De Neys & Vanderputte, 2011;
Kokis et al., 2002; Schneider, 2004). Stereotypes, perhaps learned early in life, also have
profound influence on human perception and performance through the workings of
stereotype threat, stereotype boost and stereotype lift (Schneider, 2004; Shih et al., 2012),
briefly explained in the literature review.
The body of literature included information on personality traits, mainly
masculine and feminine personality traits, of characters in picture books. Because this
study looked to the whole personality of the characters in picture books, using the Big
Five Personality Factors for assessment, the review of personality traits was organized
around the Big Five. This chapter presented empirical research linking the educational
use of picture books to changes in children’s behavior and attitudes. Bibliotherapy

52
includes the practice of bringing about changes in children’s behavior, attitudes, and
stereotypes. This chapter presented a brief explanation of the therapeutic model for the
mechanism of bibliotherapy. Identification, sometimes through personality traits, is a key
step in the bibliotherapeutic model.
Although much research in gender bias and gender stereotypes in children’s
literature considered personality traits, that research was limited to masculine, feminine,
and androgynous traits. There have been calls in the literature for a study that moves
beyond gender-linked traits and examines the total personality of characters in picture
books (Kingston & Loveoace, 1977; Singh & Lu, 2003). An understanding of the whole
personality of characters in picture books is essential to understanding the idealized
cultural constructs found in picture books that have the potential to change and shape
communities and society as well as individuals (Kortenhaus & Demarest, 1993; Martinez
& McGee, 2000; Murray, 1998; Sipe & Pantaleo, 2008; Warner, 1995). An
understanding of the personality factors making up the whole child modeled in these
picture books is important to understanding how they can most effectively be used in
educational settings.

Chapter III
RESEARCH METHOD
Research Questions
The research questions explored in this study are:
1) How can the total personality of the model child be described using the results
of the Big Five Mini-Markers personality instrument and the results of the qualitative
analysis of Big Five personality factors?
2) How do the personality factors of young characters in Caldecott Award
winning picture books compare and contrast in three different time periods: the 1950s,
the 1980s, and the 2000s?
3) How are the personality factors of young characters in Caldecott Award
winning picture books differentiated by gender in three different time periods: the 1950s,
the 1980s, and the 2000s?
Organization of the Chapter
After introducing the chapter by putting forth the research questions that guide the
study, this explanation of the organization of the chapter is followed by a brief review of
the theories that provide the framework for the study. The theoretical framework
considers social learning theory, gender socialization, the acquisition of gender
stereotypes, and sociological aspects of gender socialization. Next the chapter looks at the
53

54
research design, mixed methods content analysis, considering separately the importance
of content analysis, mixed methods design, and triangulation, to the study. This chapter
provides a detailed look at the subjects of the study, young characters in Caldecott Award
winning picture books from three decades. Ethical considerations are put forward. A
detailed consideration of the standard personality measure used in the quantitative part of
the study, the Big Five Mini-Markers, includes theoretical and historical background of
Big Five personality theory and measurement. The research procedures for pilot testing,
quantitative portion of the study, and qualitative portion of the study are explained. An
explanation of the data analysis is provided. The basic assumptions and limitations
underlying the study are enumerated. The chapter ends with a summary.
Theoretical Framework
Social Learning Theory
The theoretical framework for this study rested on the foundation of social
learning theory. Social learning theory posits that one way children learn how to
understand and interact with the world is from symbolically represented models in the
media, including models found in picture books (Bandura, 1971; Mischel, 1966). Other
theoretical approaches and philosophies were important to this study including several
specialized social learning theories that explain gender socialization.
Several researchers and psychologists have specifically studied the impact of
picture books and other children’s literature on the social and cultural learning of
children, as well as the psychological development of children. Picture books are
especially powerful because they elicit positive emotions based on the reading
experience, generally a warm, loving, and fun situation. Those positive emotions transfer

55
to the social and cultural messages contained in the books (Spitz, 1999). Picture books
have enhanced influence because they combine words and pictures to convey cultural
messages and models. Picture books influence children when they are young,
impressionable, and lacking in critical cognitive, visual, and literary skills (Jalongo,
2004; Kitchen, 2000; Marshall, G., 1975; Pelletier & Astingtom, 2004; Pike et al., 2010;
Worland, 2008; Yu, 2009).
Gender Socialization
Several significant theories of gender socialization guided this study including
Mischel’s social learning theory (1966), Kohlberg’s cognitive developmental theory
(1966) and gender schema theories, one advanced by Bem (1981) and the other by C.
Martin and Halverson (1981).
Mischel’s social learning theory looked to imitation and reinforcement to explain
gender socialization (1966). Experimental research conducted in 1976 confirmed
Mischel’s theory, finding that “the symbolic models children encounter in picture
books…are important factors, not only in the development of sex-typed attitudes
(Mischel 1970), but also in changing those stereotypes” (Flerx et al., p. 1006). Mischel’s
theory was critical to this study. Picture books provide the symbolic models that play a
part in the socialization of children. Gender development, often including gender and
gender role stereotypes, are part of that socialization. Mischel’s social learning theory is
also associated with changing children’s attitudes and behaviors about gender.
Kohlberg (1966) advanced a developmental theory of gender socialization. His
theory looked to the child rather than the culture as the prime organizer of gender

56
development. He also provided a developmental timeline for gender socialization and
provided a motivation for continued gender socialization.
Gender schema theory provides another explanation for gender socialization. C.
Martin and Halverson (1981) proposed a gender schema theory that revolves around the
concept that individuals organize gender-based relevant information so that it is useful to
the individual. They theorized that gender development is an inflexible, rigid, but also
normal and necessary aspect of early childhood development. Bem (1981) viewed gender
schema as a process of perpetuating cultural myths about gender. Gender schema theory
was important to this study for two main reasons. Gender schema theory recognizes
schema to be a stereotype (Martin, C., 1987). Bem (1981) clearly believed that gender
schema is not related to the real needs of society and is detrimental to the positive
development of children.
Gender Stereotypes
Part of the gender socialization of children, of learning to cope and to thrive in
society, is learning stereotypes. Stereotype is defined as “an oversimplified generalization
about the characteristics of members of a group” (Martin, G., & Osborne, 1993, p. 342).
Preschool children are familiar with certain specific stereotypes, including gender
stereotypes and gender role stereotypes (Schlossberg & Goodman, 1972; Williams, J. A.
et al., 1975). Early 20th century sociological theory linked the concept of stereotype to
discrimination and prejudice (Allport, 1954; Judd & Park, 1993; Lippmann, 1922;
Martin, C., 1987). Later theorists refined the concept of stereotype and made it a more
neutral idea by introducing the concept of stereotype accuracy, that is, a stereotype may
or may not contain errors and biases; empirical research determines the accuracy of the

57
stereotype (Judd & Park, 1993). Recent research has emphasized the positive aspects of
accurate stereotypes (Stangor, 1995).
Sociological Aspects of Gender Socialization
Gender socialization is a key psychological task for individuals in American
society. It is also an important element in American society, with implications for many
of American societal institutions, especially the family (Parsons, 1954). Early American
sociological theory posited gender role differentiation and segregation as necessary to the
functioning of the family. Parsons (1954) suggested that men have the instrumental role
while women have the expressive role in the family structure. Men, in the instrumental
role, work outside of the home and earn an income. Women, in the expressive role, make
a home and care for children.
Research Design
Mixed Methods Content Analysis
This study used a mixed methods content analysis research design. Content
analysis is a research method that may be quantitative, qualitative, or mixed methods. It
is used to explore communication. It is often employed in the research of written
materials, including picture books. The use of a mixed methods design, utilizing the
strengths of both quantitative and qualitative research techniques, allowed the researcher
to explore a greater depth and breadth of information about the personalities of characters
in Caldecott Award winning picture books from three time periods (Creswell & Clark,
2007; Leech & Onwuegbuzie, 2007; White & Marsh, 2006).

58
Content Analysis
The content analysis design is a “highly flexible research method … widely used
in library and information science (LIS) studies with varying goals and objectives”
(White & Marsh, 2006, p.22). Many studies of picture books have used this methodology
(Collins et al., 1984; Crabb & Marciano, 2011; Creany, 1995; Davis, 1984; DellmannJenkins et al., 1993; Kolbe & LaVoie, 1981; Mattix & Sobolak, 2014; McCabe et al.,
2011; Nilsen, 1971; Weitzman, et al., 1972; Williams, J. A., et al., 1987). White and
Marsh (2006) defined content analysis as “a research technique for making replicable and
valid inferences from texts (or other meaningful matter) to the contexts of their use” (pp.
26-27). The analytical constructs “may be derived from (1) existing theories or practices;
(2) the experience or knowledge of experts; (3) previous research” (White & Marsh,
2006, p. 27). In the present study the analytical constructs were derived from existing
theory: Mischel’s social learning theory (1966), Kohlberg’s cognitive developmental
theory (1966) and gender schema theories, one advanced by Bem (1981) and the other by
C. Martin and Halverson (1981) and measurement practice in personality research, using
the Big Five Factors as defined and structured by Goldberg (1990) and Saucier (1994).
Analytical constructs were also derived from previous research conducted using picture
books, often Caldecott Award and honor books (see Literature Review). “Content
analyses are most often useful when they have a historic or comparative dimension to
them…By taking a historical point of view we can … see whether there have been
significant changes in our attitudes about (or stereotypes of) women” (Berger, 1991, p.
94). This study compared and contrasted three time periods: the 1950s, the 1980s, and the
2000s. Content analysis provided an understanding of how picture books model social

59
conventions, including stereotypes. These models have a profound and lasting effect on
children at their most impressionable age. An understanding of the personality factors
making up the whole child modeled in these picture books is important to understanding
how these picture books influence children and how they can most effectively be used in
educational settings.
Mixed Methods Design
This study employed a mixed methods research design. Employing aspects of
both quantitative and qualitative research has the potential to harness the strengths of
each of the different methods and, to some extent, offset the weaknesses of each.
Quantitative research safeguards the research design, practice, and findings from
personal biases by keeping the biases of the researcher in the background (Creswell &
Clark, 2007; Leech & Onwuegbuzie, 2007). The foundation of the research was the
quantitative portion of the study that consisted of two coders using a standard personality
measure, in the form of an adjective checklist, to establish a precise measure of the whole
personality of young characters using the manifest content of the picture books. The
concept of manifest content “means the apparent content, which means that content must
be coded as it appears rather than as the content analyst feels it is intended” (Stemple,
Weaver, & Wilhoit, 2003, p. 210). Each of the two coders independently chose a number
on a Likert Scale to correspond to the strength of a personality trait related either
positively or negatively to one of the factors for each of the forty traits on the personality
assessment measure. In the quantitative analysis, the scores for the factors were based on
overall impressions formed by the coders of the young characters in the picture books.

60
Qualitative research recognizes and uses the personal biases of the researcher in
recognizing the research problem, creating the research design, following through on the
research and drawing conclusions. This study reflected the researcher’s interest and bias
in supporting the quest for gender equality as well as the researcher’s interest and bias
toward the potential influence of picture books. The researcher alone conducted the
qualitative portion of the study. The qualitative portion of the research provided for
coding underlying meaning in the latent and manifest content of narrative and illustration
(Babbie, 2010). The researcher used several different data analysis techniques to explore
the underlying meaning of the latent and manifest content of the narrative and
illustration; the techniques included classic content analysis, word count, using
descriptive text, and constant comparison analysis, with codes identified prior to analysis
but also looking for patterns and potential codes that emerged iteratively (Leech &
Onwuegbuzie, 2007).
Qualitative research has strengths in understanding the context or setting of the
research, providing potential for richer descriptions and potential for revealing
complexity (Leech & Onwuegbuzie, 2007). In this study careful repeated examination of
the context and setting of the characters in the picture books was especially important
since classic folk literature from specific time periods as well as educational messages of
picture books had impacts on the personality of the characters in the books. A careful
qualitative analysis of the descriptive language in the picture books provided a richer
understanding of the personalities of the characters. Recent academic criticism of the
feminist studies of the 1970s suggested that “more complex conceptions of gender”

61
(Worland, 2008, p. 45) are needed to more fully understand the differences between the
genders and the relationships between the genders in picture books.
In the qualitative study, the researcher collected data from the text and illustration
on each page that indicated behavior, attitude or emotional expression corresponding to
one of the traits positively or negatively associated with the factors. In the qualitative
analysis, the scores for the factors were based on data collection by the researcher
observing young characters in the picture books studied. The qualitative study considered
both manifest content and latent content of the picture books. In the qualitative portion of
this study, a coding system was designed, and redesigned as patterns emerged from
repeated explorations of the picture books. Multiple techniques were used to explore the
latent content, the underlying meaning of the text and illustration (Babbie, 2010; Berger,
1991; Stemple et al., 2003).
Content analysis also requires attention to all parts of the communication in the
effort to achieve the more complete understanding of the meaning and message found in
the picture books. Marantz and Marantz (1995) emphasized the importance of using all
parts of the picture book to achieve a complete understanding of the story and the
message. They wrote that the picture book is “a totality that integrates all the designed
parts in a sequence in which the relationships among them – the cover, endpapers,
typography, pictures – are crucial to understanding the book” (p. xiv). In both the
quantitative and the qualitative portions of this study all parts of the picture book were
used.
The mixed methods methodology allowed the researcher to use the tools of data
collection from both quantitative and qualitative methodology to provide more

62
comprehensive evidence to study the research questions. Mixed methods research
allowed the researcher to answer not just the question “What is this phenomenon? but
also to explore the “Why did this phenomenon occur?” and “What explains this
phenomenon?” questions (Creswell & Clark, 2007; Leech & Onwuegbuzie, 2007).
Triangulation
Triangulation is the use of a combination of methodologies to strengthen research
design, to increase validity of research results, and to enhance and deepen the
significance of the research (Jick, 1979; Denzin & Lincoln, 2005; Leech &
Onwuegbuzie, 2007). Denzin and Lincoln (2005) explain that
the use of multiple methods, or triangulation, reflects an attempt to secure an in-depth
understanding of the phenomenon in question. Objective reality can never be captured.
We know a thing only through its representations. Triangulation is not a tool or a
strategy of validation, but an alternative to validation (Flick, 2002, p. 227). The
combination of multiple methodological practices, empirical materials, perspectives,
and observers in a single study is best understood, then, as a strategy that adds rigor,
breadth, complexity, richness, and depth to any inquiry. (see Flick, 2002, p. 229)
This study combined quantitative and qualitative methods. Two coders were used
in the quantitative portion of the study and intercoder reliability established. A pilot study
already undertaken had statistically acceptable intercoder reliability of .796, using
Cronbach’s Alpha (see Research Procedures for Pilot Testing in Research Procedures and
Pilot Testing in Chapter III: Research Method). The qualitative portion of this study
utilized several different data analysis techniques including classic content analysis, word
count, using descriptive text, especially adjectives, and constant comparison analysis,
with codes identified prior to analysis but also looking for codes that emerged iteratively
(Leech & Onwuegbuzie, 2007).

63
Subjects of Study
The subjects of study for this investigation were young characters in the Caldecott
Award winning picture books from the 1950s, the 1980s, and the 2000s. The 10 award
winning books from each of the decades studied were borrowed from the public library
for use in the study. The study used a content analysis to examine human characters as
well as humanized animal characters that were young, generally children and youth.
Picture Books
The Association of Library Service to Children, a division of the American
Library Association, defines a picture book as a book “that essentially provides the child
with a visual experience. A picture book has a collective unity of story-line, theme, or
concept, developed through the series of pictures of which the book is comprised”
(Association of Library Service to Children [ALSC], 2012). Kiefer (1995) further
describes a picture book as:
a unique art object, a combination of image and idea that allows the reader to come
away with more than the sum of the parts. We can no more look at a single
illustration in the book or examine the words without the pictures than we can view 5
minutes of a 2-hour film or see an opera without hearing the singers’ voices and say
we have experienced the whole. The picture book is unique, and our experience of it
will be something magical and personal, one that will change with each reading.
(p.6)
Other researchers agree that in picture books the words and pictures work together
to provide the narrative and message of the story (Browne, 1998; Huck et al., 1997;
Hughes, 1998; Marantz & Marantz, 1995; Sipe, 1998; Stewig, 1995). Academics who
have studied picture books emphasized the importance of using all parts of the picture
book and the relationship between the parts, including the cover, the endpapers, and the

64
typography, to achieve a complete understanding of the story and the message (Marantz
& Marantz, 1995; Sipe, 1998).
Use of Caldecott Award Winning Books for Study
The sample for this study was the young characters in the Caldecott Award
winning picture books from three decades: the 1950s, the 1980s, and the 2000s. For a
complete list of the 30 Caldecott Award winning picture books from the three decades
studied see Appendix A. The Caldecott Awards are presented annually by the
Association of Library Service to Children, a division of the American Library
Association, for illustration of the most distinguished American picture book published
the previous year. (Association of Library Service to Children [ALSC], 2012). One book
is chosen each year; however, other distinguished picture books are designated as
Caldecott honor books. After winning the award these books generally reach a wide
audience over a period of many years. “Caldecott winners and honor books are highly
visible and frequently selected for use with children. Even though they may not be
representative of all that is published, as a group they may be a stronger socializing
influence than any other identifiable group of books” (Dougherty & Engel, 1987, p. 394).
Dellman-Jenkins, et al. (1993) referred to the importance of Caldecott winners using the
sociological term “cultural capital” (p.81), suggesting that the Caldecott winners have
value to families and educational programs in terms of providing cultural information and
advantage to children who learn from them.
This study used Caldecott Award winning books to provide a sample of
influential picture books that are most likely to represent the model child that American
culture puts forth as a socializing influence. The whole personality of the young

65
characters in these picture books presented a model that children may identify with,
emulate, and use to learn about cultural expectations, including gender expectations. This
study looked at three time periods to see how the personality of the young characters in
the picture books changed and specifically, how the personality of young characters
changed by gender.
Target Audience for Picture Books
Although picture books may be useful for the enjoyment and instruction of people
of any age, the general target audience for picture books is children in preschool and
early elementary school. One of the books in the study, The Invention of Hugo Cabret
(2007), targeted an older age group. Only in recent history have picture books been
widely available to almost all children in American society (Bader, 1976; Martinez &
McGee, 2000; Meigs et al., 1969; Murray, 1998).
Children identify with the characters in the picture books, sometimes through the
personality of the characters, and that identification allows them to acquire ideas and
emotions, conscious and unconscious, that promote developmental growth and teach
social and cultural constructs, including stereotypes (Bader, 1976; Bettelheim, 1975;
Diekman & Murnen, 2004; Marshall, G., 1975; Nilsen, 1971; Spitz, 1999; Tatar, 1992).
Bandura has written about the importance of symbolically represented models, such as
picture books, for children to learn how to understand and interact with the world (1971).
Young children, the primary target audience for picture books, do not yet have the
ability to critically assess picture books and the literary, social, conceptual and cultural
constructs contained in the picture books (Bader, 1976; Diekman & Murnen, 2004;
Marshall, G., 1975; Nilsen, 1971; Pelletier & Astingtom, 2004; Pike, Barnes, & Barron,

66
2010; Spitz, 1999; Yu, 2009). Yet picture books are effective because they are used when
children are young and impressionable; they combine the power of words and pictures;
they transfer the positive emotions contained in the significant adult/child reading
situation to the cultural message of the picture book (Bader, 1976; Jalongo, 2004; Kiefer,
B., 2008; Kitchen, 2000; Oskamp et al., 1996; Spitz, 1999; Worland, 2008).
Picture books reflect culture and cultural ideals (Mattix & Sobolak, 2014;
McCabe et al., 2011; Murray, 1998; Zipes, 2001). Picture books also shape culture by
providing the models and constructs that have the potential for great influence on young
children (Kortenhaus & Demarest, 1993; Martinez & McGee, 2000; Mattix & Sobolak,
2014; McCabe et al., 2011; Murray, 1998; Sipe & Pantaleo, 2008).
Ethical Considerations
Notre Dame of Maryland University’s Institutional Review Board granted an
exemption because human subjects were not used in the study.
Instrumentation
The personality assessment tool used for this study is the Big Five Mini-Markers
developed by Saucier (1994) based on Goldberg’s Unipolar Big Five Markers (Goldberg,
1990). The Mini-Markers is a list of 40 adjectives, utilizing a Likert scale, which
provides a quick and easy-to-use assessment of personality. The adjectives chosen for the
Mini-Markers were partially chosen for understandability over the larger 100-item
assessment. It has the further advantage of being a public domain test.

67
Theoretical and Historical Background
Sir Francis Galton, in 1884, recognized the “fundamental lexical hypothesis”
(Goldberg, 1990, p. 1216) that natural language provides a complete list of personality
descriptive terms. Galton’s lexical hypothesis was more carefully defined over the years
first by Klages (1926/1932), and then elaborated by Allport (1937), Cattell (1943),
Norman (1963), and Goldberg (1982): Those individual differences that are most
salient and socially relevant in people’s lives will eventually become encoded into
their language; the more important such a difference, the more likely is it to become
expressed as a single word. (John et al., 1988, p.174)
Cattell reduced the large number of personality descriptors and added “previously
missing neurotic and psychotic terms” (John et al. 1988, p.178). He then employed the
first empirical reduction, using a study that rated 100 adults on the identified personality
descriptors, combined results with correlations found among descriptors, and arrived at a
manageable number of personality clusters. Rating scales based on this research were
developed and used for self-report, ratings by acquaintances, ratings by intimates, and
“objective test data” (John et al., 1988, p. 183). Cattell theorized that personality
descriptors could be reduced to 12 factors; however, independent reanalysis by several
different researchers resulted in only five factors being consistently replicable and
meaningful (Barrack & Mount, 1991; Borgatta, 1964; Digman, 1990; Digman &
Takemoto-Chock, 1981; Goldberg, 1981; Norman, 1963; Tupes &Christal, 1961).
Although theorists have used somewhat different terminology, the five factors are
essentially the same.
The five factors are: (I) Surgency (or Extroversion), (II) Agreeableness, (III)
Conscientiousness (or Dependability), (IV) Emotional Stability (vs. Neuroticism), and

68
(V) Culture (Goldberg, 1990, p. 1217). The Big Five Factor, Culture, is also referred to as
Openness to Experience.
•

Extroversion (or surgency) refers to a person’s quantity and intensity in
interpersonal interactions, need for stimulation, and capacity for happiness.
The adjectives used in the Big Five Mini-Markers that correlate positively with
Extroversion are: Bold, Energetic, Extroverted, Talkative. The adjectives used
in the Big Five Mini-Markers that correlate negatively with Extroversion are:
Bashful, Quiet, Shy, Withdrawn (Saucier, 1994).

•

Agreeableness refers to feelings of compassion compared to antagonism in
thoughts, feelings and actions (Martin, 2000). The adjectives used in the Big
Five Mini-Markers that correlate positively with Agreeableness are:
Cooperative, Kind, Sympathetic, Warm. The adjectives used in the Big Five
Mini-Markers that correlate negatively with Agreeableness are: Cold, Harsh,
Rude, Unsympathetic (Saucier, 1994).

•

Conscientiousness (or dependability) includes a person’s characteristics as
orderly, attentive, responsible, self-disciplined, dutiful and achievement
oriented. The adjectives used in the Big Five Mini-Markers that correlate
positively with Conscientiousness are: Efficient, Organized, Practical,
Systematic. The adjectives used in the Big Five Mini-Markers that correlate
negatively with Conscientiousness are: Careless, Disorganized, Inefficient,
Sloppy (Saucier, 1994).

•

Emotional Stability (vs. neuroticism) refers to adjustment versus instability
and can be defined as an enduring tendency to experience positive emotional

69
states. The adjectives used in the Big Five Mini-Markers that correlate
positively with Emotional stability are: Relaxed, Unenvious. The adjectives
used in the Big Five Mini-Markers that correlate negatively with Emotional
Stability are: Envious, Fretful, Jealous, Moody, Temperamental, Touchy.
Neuroticism is also considered to be a predisposition for traditional neuroses,
such as phobias and other anxiety disorders (Saucier, 1994).
•

Culture (or openness to experience) includes a person’s characteristics as
artistic, curious and insightful. The adjectives used in the Big Five MiniMarkers that correlate positively with Openness to Experience are: Complex,
Creative, Deep, Imaginative, Intellectual, Philosophical. The adjectives used in
the Big Five Mini-Markers that correlate negatively with Openness to
Experience are: Uncreative, Unintellectual. People with high levels of
openness to experience tend to have broad interests and to be very imaginative.
People with low levels of openness to experience tend to be practical,
traditional, and set in their ways (Saucier, 1994).

Many longitudinal and cross sectional studies have shown a high degree of
stability in personality traits during adulthood (McCrae & Costa, 1990). More recent
research and meta-analyses of previous studies showed evidence for a maturation effect.
Levels of agreeableness and conscientiousness typically increased over time, while levels
of extroversion, emotional stability, and openness to experience decreased over time
(Srivastave, John, Gosling, & Potter, 2003).
Cross-cultural research from 55 nations has shown a universal pattern of gender
differences in responses to Big Five measures (Schmitt, Realo, Voracek, & Allik, 2008).

70
Women consistently scored higher in neuroticism and agreeableness, and men
consistently scored higher in extroversion and conscientiousness. Gender differences in
personality factors have been found to be largest in prosperous, healthy, egalitarian
cultures where women have access to increased cultural, political, educational, and
vocational opportunities (Schmitt et al., 2008).
A great deal of research has been conducted on the predictive ability of the Big
Five Factors personality assessment results (Palmer & Loveland, 2004). Work
performance, performance in college, performance of work teams, and coping with stress
are just some of the behavioral criteria studied. “The research indicates some of the Big
Five traits have usefulness in applied settings, such as employee or student selections,
counseling and employee development” (Palmer & Loveland, 2004, p. 232).
Measures of the Big Five
Several researchers, including Norman (1967) and McCrae and Costa (1987),
developed instruments to measure the Big Five. Goldberg developed both a questionnaire
and a set of adjective markers. Both of Goldberg’s measures have “received wide support
as viable Big Five measures” (Palmer & Loveland, 2004, p. 232).
The instrument used in this study is an adaptation of Goldberg’s Unipolar BigFive Markers, the Mini-Markers, developed by Saucier in 1994. The Mini-Markers
consist of 40 adjectives, eight for each of the Big Five Factors. The response scale is a 9point Likert scale ranging from 1 (extremely inaccurate) to 9 (extremely accurate). The
Mini-Markers were developed to provide a tool that could be completed quickly, that
used adjectives that were more easily understandable and that corrected the problem of
high interscale correlations that plagued Goldberg’s Unipolar Big-Five Markers. The

71
Mini-Markers have, however, the “typical disadvantage of abbreviated inventories, lower
reliability” (Saucier, 1994, p. 514).
Palmer and Loveland investigated the psychometric properties of the MiniMarkers and found:
the advantages of such an adjective checklist, including ease of use, ease of scoring,
length, understandability, simplicity, and the lower interscale correlations, in addition
to the fact that it is a public domain test, potentially make it a very valuable tool in the
assessment of personality. (Palmer & Loveland, 2004, p. 236)
Research Procedures and Pilot Testing
Research Procedures for Pilot Testing
To begin preparation for the pilot test, the researcher compiled a list of all the
Caldecott honor books from the 1950s and from the 1980s. Caldecott Award winning
books from these two time periods were excluded from the pilot test since they would be
used in the study. The researcher then borrowed these books from the public library
system and read them to determine if they had a character or characters with adequate
information to complete the Mini-Markers. Other Caldecott Award or honor books from
time periods other than the 1950s and the 1980s were chosen for training purposes. These
picture books were generally from the 1990s.
Two coders participated in the pilot study. The researcher was the third coder.
The two coders chosen for the study were employed as teachers and were also graduate
students who had successfully completed a course in educational research. Training
materials were prepared for the coders. The training materials included an introduction to
the study, the aims and objectives of the study, basic information about the instrument
that would be used in the pilot study, the Mini-Markers, and basic information about the
choice of Caldecott Award winning books from the 1950s and the 1980s for the study.

72
Concerns and guidelines were listed. The coders also received a copy of the instrument
and definitions of the adjectives used in the instrument (see Appendices A, B, C, D).
The coders and the researcher met for two sessions. The first session included
introductions, training, and time for questions before coding the picture books from one
of the time periods. The second session began with coding books from the other time
period and ended with a discussion of shared impressions and ideas for the study. The
meetings took place in reserved library private rooms. The researcher and the two coders
carefully read each picture book to be coded before doing any coding. After the second
reading of each picture book, the Mini-Markers instrument was used to code the traits for
young characters in the book. The coders were able to peruse the picture books during the
coding. All coding was done independently, with no discussion and no collaboration.
The researcher gained valuable insight from the pilot study and from the ideas and
impressions of the other coders. The coders all agreed to some surprise at the extent of
negative scores for many of the young characters in the factor of emotional stability. The
educational intention of a book may involve overcoming negative traits. The coders
suggested that educational intention of the book should be included in the coding sheet
for the study. The coders also found inconsistent levels of a trait on different pages of the
book for the same character. There seemed to be two explanations. In one picture book,
the lesson of the story involved misunderstanding the personality of the main character;
again, this points to the importance of considering the educational intention of the book.
In another book the character behaved differently, but appropriately, in different
situations and settings of the story. The coders suggested that the setting of the story and
even different settings within the story might be included in the coding sheet. The coders

73
were surprised that gender role stereotypes may be evident in a picture book while the
personality traits of the male and female young characters were similar.
Overall intercoder reliability, as well as intercoder reliability for each of the Big
Five Personality Factors, was established for the pilot study using Cronbach’s alpha
coefficient. The score reliability estimate for overall intercoder reliability was .80. The
score reliability estimates for the factors were: .94 for Extroversion, .98 for
Agreeableness, .87 for Conscientiousness, .92 for Emotional Stability, and .88 for
Openness to Experience. Nunnally and Bernstein (1994) suggested .70 as an acceptable
minimum criterion for a score reliability coefficient pertaining to affective measures.
Reliability for each of the five factors as well as overall reliability was more than
adequate.
Research Procedures for the Study
The first data collection was the quantitative section of the study. Coders used the
Mini-Markers as the instrument for determining the Big Five Personality Factors of
young characters in Caldecott Award winning picture books of the 1950s, the 1980s, and
the 2000s.
The researcher used the same picture books in the qualitative section of the study
but read through the books many times, collecting data for the coding sheet and searching
for patterns and explanations for findings. The researcher used several qualitative
techniques, including classic content analysis and word counts, looking for language
describing the characters, especially adjectives. Constant comparison analysis was
employed, seeking patterns and codes identified in the coding sheet as well as patterns
and codes that emerged during multiple readings.

74
Data Analysis
The data collection instrument used for the quantitative study was an adaptation
of Goldberg’s Unipolar Big-Five Markers, the Mini-Markers, developed by Saucier in
1994. The Mini-Markers consist of 40 adjectives, eight for each of the Big Five Factors.
For each factor some of the adjectives correlate positively with the factor and some of the
adjectives correlate negatively with the factor. When scoring results the positive and
negative responses were combined; positive responses added and negative responses
subtracted from the total. The response total was then divided by eight (because there are
eight traits for each factor) to calculate the final score for each factor. The response scale
was a 9-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (extremely inaccurate) to 9 (extremely
accurate). The numbers in the Likert scale indicated the strength of the response for the
trait under consideration by the coder. For example, a young character that consistently
displayed behavior, emotional expression, and attitude that corresponded to traits
positively associated with the factor, extroversion, and did not consistently display
behavior, emotional expression, and attitude that corresponded to traits negatively
associated with the factor, extroversion, would have a strong positive extroversion score.
Conversely, a young character who consistently displayed behavior, emotional
expression, and attitude that corresponded to traits negatively associated with the factor,
extroversion, and did not consistently display behavior, emotional expression and attitude
that corresponded to traits positively associated with the factor, extroversion, would have
a strong negative extroversion score. A score of zero could indicate that a young
character had equivalent positive and negative scores on traits associated with
extroversion or a score of zero could indicate that there was not adequate behavior,

75
emotional expression and/or attitude associated with traits for the coder to provide a score
for extroversion.
The study variables included gender, personality characteristics, and time period.
For the purposes of this study gender was identified as female, male or neutral. Young
characters in picture books that included human and humanized animals were identified
as any of those three in the context of the story. Neutral characters have appeared more
often in recently published picture books (Creany, 1995). Data was collected from
Caldecott Award winning books from the 1950s, the 1980s, and the 2000s. Some years
the Caldecott Award winning book did not have a young character.
Assumptions and Limitations
The basic assumptions underlying this study included the following:
1. A mixed methods content analysis is the best research design to compare
young characters in award-winning picture books from three time periods, differentiated
by gender.
2. Picture books convey and model cultural constructs and norms, including
gender rules and gender stereotypes (Murray, 1998; Mattix & Sobolak, 2014; McCabe et
al., 2011; Nilsen, 1971; Spitz, 1999; Taylor, 2003; Worland, 2008; Zipes, 2001). They
also model personality traits (Flerx et al., 1976; Gladding & Gladding, 1991; Jalongo,
2004). Picture books can also reflect changes in culture (Kortenhaus & Demarest, 1993;
Martinez & McGee, 2000; Murray, 1998; Sipe & Pantaleo, 2008; Weitzman, et al.,
1972).
3. Caldecott Award winning books are likely to be influential for a large
number of children for a long period of time. They are likely to be purchased for homes,

76
schools, libraries and preschool programs. “Even though they may not be representative
of all that is published, as a group they may be a stronger socializing influence that any
other identifiable group of books” (Dougherty & Engel, 1987, p. 394).
4. Coders who participated in the study received the same materials
introducing and explaining the study; received the same training in preparation for the
coding; used the same definitions for the personality traits in the instrument and coded
the personality traits of young characters in picture books in similar fashion.
The limitations of this study included the following:
1. The choice of picture books was limited to Caldecott Award winning books
because they are likely to be influential for a large number of children for a long period
of time (Dougherty & Engel, 1987; Nilsen, 1971), however, they are not a random
selection and are not likely to be representative of picture books (Dougherty & Engel,
1987).
2. The books chosen for this study were limited to three decades, the 1950s,
the 1980s, and the 2000s. The rationale behind the time frame was that the 1950s was a
traditional time period before the American feminist movement of the 1970s. Scholarly
articles in that time period analyzed the portrayal of male and female characters in picture
books, sometimes considering masculine and feminine personality traits. Publishers
established guidelines to help authors avoid gender stereotypical portrayals in children’s
literature. The 1980s was a time period outside of and past the feminist movement of the
1970s. Several studies of gender stereotypes and sexism in picture books, conducted in
the 1990s and 2000s, found that although there was a decrease in gender role stereotypes
and sexism through the 1980s, the trend leveled off around the advent of the 1990s

77
(Clark, Lennon & Morris, 1993; Hamilton et al., 2006; Kortenhaus & Demarest, 1993;
Mattix & Sobolak, 2014). The study considered more contemporary times with use of the
2000s. The use of books from only three decades provided a small selection of young
characters.
3. The personality traits used in the Big Five Mini-Markers, the instrument
used in the quantitative part of this study, are meant to describe adults, and may result in
less accurate results when used with young characters in picture books. Bem, however,
developed a similar instrument, using adjective checklists to discern personality
information related to gender, the Bem Sex-Role Inventory (Bem, 1993) that has been
used in research with characters in picture books (Dellman-Jenkins et al., 1993).
4. The researcher’s beliefs, cultural background, gender, gender assumptions,
and feminist stance were variables that may affect the research process in this study
(Harding, 1987; Gottfried, 1996; Reinharz, 1992).
5. The coders’ beliefs, cultural background, and gender assumptions were
variables that may affect the research process in this study (Harding, 1987; Gottfried,
1996; Reinharz, 1992).
Chapter Summary
This chapter presented the theoretical framework for the study based on social
learning theory and theories of gender socialization. The advantages of using a mixed
methods content analysis research design for this study were explained in detail. Using
both quantitative and qualitative methods, as well as utilizing several different data
analysis techniques in the qualitative portion of the study, provided triangulation in the
design. The data analysis techniques included classic content analysis, word

78
count, and constant comparison analysis. Young characters in Caldecott Award winning
picture books from the 1950s, the 1980s, and the 2000s, were the subjects of the study.
This chapter presented the rationale for choice of the Big Five Mini-Markers as the
instrument for the study. The procedures for the pilot study and the study were explained.
The assumptions and limitations underlying the study were put forward.

Chapter IV
RESULTS AND ANALYSIS
Introduction
The purpose of this study was to determine the personality of the young
characters in Caldecott Award winning picture books from three decades: the 1950s, the
1980s, and the 2000s and to examine both changes in the personalities across the time
periods and differences in personality related to gender. This study used a mixed methods
content analysis research design, utilizing the strengths of both quantitative and
qualitative research techniques, allowing the researcher to explore a greater depth and
breadth of information about the personalities of the young characters in the picture
books studied (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2007; Leech & Onwuegbuzie, 2007; White &
Marsh, 2006).
Organization of the Chapter
After presenting the research questions and a review of the procedures used in
conducting both quantitative and qualitative portions of the study, the results were
presented for each research question. The Big Five Personality Factors (Goldberg, 1990;
Saucier, 1994) were used to organize the results for each research question: first
quantitative results, followed by qualitative results. The chapter ends with a look at the
importance of triangulation to the study and a summary of the chapter.

80
Research Questions
The three overarching research questions sought to describe the whole personality
of the model child based on the young characters studied, identify similarities and
differences in each of the three time periods studied, and examine differences by gender
overall and differences by gender across the three time periods. The study used the Big
Five Mini-Markers as the personality assessment tool for the quantitative portion of the
study. It is a standard personality assessment tool developed by Saucier (1994) based on
Goldberg’s Unipolar Big Five Personality Factors.
The three specific research questions:
•

How can the total personality of the model child be described using the
results of the Big Five Mini-Markers personality instrument and the results of
the qualitative analysis of Big Five personality factors?

•

How do the personality factors of young characters in Caldecott Award
winning picture books compare and contrast in three different time periods:
the 1950s, the 1980s, and the 2000s?

•

How are the personality factors of young characters in Caldecott Award
winning picture books differentiated by gender in three different time
periods: the 1950s, the 1980s, and the 2000s?
Procedures

Pilot Study
A pilot study was used to establish overall intercoder reliability, as well as
intercoder reliability for each of the Big Five Personality Factors. The researcher gained

81
valuable insight from the pilot study and the ideas and impressions of the other coders.
Input from the coders was used in the design of the coding sheet for the qualitative
portion of the study (see Research Procedures for Pilot Testing in Chapter III: Research
Method).
Subjects of the Study
Young characters from the 30 Caldecott Award winning books from the 1950s,
1980s, and the 2000s were used in both the quantitative and qualitative study. Of the 30
books considered, 21 books were used in the study: eight books from the 1950s; six
books from the 1980s; seven books from the 2000s.
Child-and-youth-aged human characters as well as child-and-youth-aged
humanized animal characters were included in the study. Only subjects with adequate
behavioral, attitudinal, or emotive information to determine personality traits on the
instrument were included; generally this limited the subjects included to central
characters. Table 1 shows the number of characters used in the study by decade and
gender.
Only one young character met the criteria to be considered neutral and that
character was excluded from statistical analysis related to gender.

Procedures for Quantitative Study
The researcher and one other coder used the Big Five Mini-Markers (Saucier,
1994) to assess the young characters in the picture books on each of the five personality
factors (see Data Analysis in Chapter III: Research Method). The coder was one of the
coders who participated in the pilot study. She was a teacher and a graduate student who
had successfully completed a graduate level course in educational research. There had
been one major modification to the training materials used in the pilot study, the
inclusion of a new decade in the study, the 2000s, and there were also some minor
modifications to the training materials. A complete list of the 30 picture books with the
potential to have characters to be used in the study was also sent to the coder, who
acquired the books on her own for use in the study (see Appendices A, B, C, D). The
researcher and the coder carefully read each picture book to be coded before doing any
coding. After a second reading of each picture book, the Big Five Mini-Markers
instrument was used to code the traits for young characters in the book (see Data
Analysis in Chapter III: Research Method). The coders considered only manifest content
in all parts of each picture book studied to determine traits for the characters. Picture
books were available for the coders to peruse during the coding. All coding was done
independently, with no discussion and no collaboration (see Research Procedures in
Chapter III: Research Method). The researcher and the coder communicated by email
while the study progressed; once the data were collected, the researcher and the coder
met for a session to go over data and share ideas and impressions.

83
Intercoder Reliability
Overall intercoder reliability, as well as intercoder reliability for each of the Big
Five Personality Factors, was established for the quantitative study using Cronbach’s
alpha coefficient. The score reliability estimate for overall intercoder reliability was .76.
The score reliability estimates for the factors are: .82 for Extroversion, .93 for
Agreeableness, .71 for Conscientiousness, .91 for Emotional Stability, and .85 for
Openness to Experience. Nunnally and Bernstein (1994) suggested .70 as an acceptable
minimum criterion for a score reliability coefficient pertaining to affective measures.
Reliability for each of the five factors as well as overall reliability was more than
adequate.
Procedures for Qualitative Study
The qualitative study used the same picture books used in the quantitative study
but used multiple readings of the books to code information and look for new patterns.
The researcher used all parts of the picture books and considered both manifest and latent
content in completing the coding and looking for patterns. Information gleaned from the
pilot study and the coders involved in the pilot study played a role in creating the original
coding sheet. Educational intention, setting of the story, character demographics and, of
course, behavior, attitude, or expression evident on any page in the book that related to
one of the personality traits were the major categories on the coding sheet. Categories
were deleted and added as patterns emerged through the multiple readings of the picture
books. Categories for indoor settings and outdoor settings, as well as outdoor realistic
settings and outdoor imaginary settings, were examples of additional categories added as
patterns emerged. Because of the differing lengths of the picture books, the number of

84
scenes in each book was tabulated and total scores were divided by the number of scenes.
This provided a score that made it possible to compare and contrast results. Descriptive
language, specifically any adjective or descriptive phrase that could be turned into an
adjective, was collected separately and matched to one of the Big Five Personality
Factors or designated as not fitting any of the personality factors.
Research Question 1:
How can the total personality of the model child be described using the results of the Big
Five Mini-Markers personality instrument and the results of the qualitative analysis of
Big Five personality factors?

Descriptive Statistics: Qualitative Results
Descriptive statistics from the qualitative analysis also suggested a consistent
personality model for the young characters in the picture books. Results gleaned from
work done with the coding sheet provided a Big Five Factor personality description
similar to the description based on the quantitative results (see Table 3).
Adjectives, or language that could be turned into adjectives, that described young
characters were gathered and matched to one of the Big Five Personality Factors as part
of the qualitative study. Picture books generally have carefully chosen text and limited
vocabulary; some picture books have no text. Twenty characters in 13 books were
described using language that could be turned into adjectives. There were 10 such
characters in six books in the 1950s; four such characters in three books in the 1980s, and
six such characters in four books in the 2000s. Some of the descriptive language used to
describe these characters did not match any of the Big Five Factors; that descriptive
language was designated “Other.” One of the picture books in the 2000s, The Invention of
Hugo Cabret, targeted an older audience than most picture books; it had much more text
than any of the other books in the study; it accounted for 89 of the 234 adjectives
gathered in the study. Both positive and negative descriptive language was matched to
factors that showed young characters had the right personality to navigate the interesting
adventures present in these picture books (see Table 4).

Big Five Factor Model Personality of Young Characters in Picture Books
Extroversion (Quantitative Results)
The quantitative data portrayed the model young character as extroverted (see
Figure 1). Table 2 presents the descriptive statistics for the quantitative scores for
extroversion. In the quantitative data, only one character had a negative score for
extroversion; one character has a score of zero for extroversion (see Table 2). Figure 1
shows the range of scores and the large number of positive scores.

Extroversion (Qualitative Results)
The qualitative results also portrayed the model young character as extroverted
(see Figure 2). Table 3 presents the descriptive statistics for the qualitative scores for
extroversion. In the qualitative data, only two characters had scores of zero for

88
extroversion (see Table 3). Figure 2 shows the range of scores and the large number of
positive scores.
There are 72 adjectives, or descriptive language that could be turned into
adjectives, which describe extroversion in the young characters; 32 of those were positive
and 40 were negative.
The unnamed young girl in House in the Night had a negative extroversion score
in the quantitative results and a score of zero in the qualitative results. She had a solitary,
highly imaginative adventure. The book that she read provided the impetus for her
imaginative adventure; the musical and academic items in her bedroom suggested that
she engaged in and enjoyed some solitary and quiet activities.

89
Agreeableness (Quantitative Results)
The quantitative study found that the model young character was agreeable (see
Figure 3). Table 2 presents the descriptive statistics for the quantitative scores for
agreeableness. Figure 3 shows the range of scores and the large number of positive
scores.

Agreeableness (Qualitative Results)
The qualitative study also found that the model young character was agreeable
(see Figure 4). Table 3 presents the descriptive statistics for the qualitative scores for
extroversion. Figure 4 shows the range of scores and the large number of positive scores.
There were 16 adjectives, or descriptive language that could be turned into adjectives,
which described agreeableness in the young characters; eight of those were positive and
eight were negative.

90
The two stepsisters in Cinderella or the Little Glass Slipper were the only
characters who had negative scores for agreeableness. They had negative scores in both
the quantitative and qualitative results. This famous story sets up contrast between
Cinderella and her stepsisters as an important part of the plot and the educational message
of the story (see Outliers As a Result of the Use of Contrast in Picture Books at the end of
Research Question 1 in Chapter IV: Results and Analysis).

Conscientiousness (Quantitative Results)
Although the quantitative results of the study found the model young character to
be conscientious, for this Big Five Factor, the characters’ mean scores were closer to zero
than they were for extroversion, agreeableness and openness to experience (see Figure 5).

91
Table 2 presents the descriptive statistics for the quantitative scores for
conscientiousness. Figure 5 presents the range of scores and shows the large number of
positive scores.

Conscientiousness (Qualitative Results)
The qualitative results found the model young character to be conscientious,
although, for this Big Five Factor, the characters’ mean scores are closer to zero than they
are for extroversion, agreeableness and openness to experience (see Figure 6). Table 3

92
presents the descriptive statistics for the qualitative scores for conscientiousness. Figure 6
shows the range of scores and the large number of positive scores.
There were 19 adjectives, or descriptive language that could be turned into
adjectives, which described conscientiousness in the young characters; 15 of those were
positive and four were negative. Young characters were described by adjectives in
positive terms far more than in negative terms for the conscientiousness factor,
supporting positive conscientiousness findings in both quantitative and qualitative results
(see Table 4).

93
Emotional Stability (Quantitative Results)
The Factor of Emotional Stability refers to consistency in experiencing and
displaying positive emotions. Negative emotional stability may be an indication of
neuroses (Saucier, 1994). Quantitative emotional stability descriptive statistics presented
far more negative scores than found in any other factor (see Table 2). Figure 7 shows the
range of scores and the larger number of negative scores.

Emotional Stability (Qualitative Results)
Qualitative emotional stability descriptive statistics presented far more negative
scores than found in any other factor (see Table 3). Figure 8 shows the range of scores
and the larger number of negative scores.
There were 60 adjectives, or descriptive language that could be turned into
adjectives, that described emotional stability in the young characters; 13 of those were

94
positive and 47 were negative (see Table 4). The data on the descriptive language
supported the quantitative and qualitative results. The larger number of negative
adjectives used to describe young characters was sometimes driven by plot, often exciting
adventures, or educational intention, including contrast in several books. Some adjectives
found in the picture books that corresponded to the Big Five personality factor of
emotional stability, such as sad, crazy, desperate, scared, terrified, fearful, frustrated,
angry, agitated, feverishly, trembling, shaking, frightened, may be an entirely appropriate
emotional response for the young characters in some of the extreme situations depicted in
these picture books.

Openness to Experience (Quantitative Results)
Openness to experience includes abilities in the artistic realm, curiosity,
knowledge, imagination, and complexity. High levels of openness to experience indicate
young characters that are very imaginative and have broad interests. Low levels of

95
openness to experience indicate young characters that tend to be practical, traditional, and
set in their ways (Saucier, 1994). The quantitative data portrayed the model young
character as open to experience (see Figure 9). Table 2 presents descriptive statistics for
the quantitative scores for openness to experience. Figure 9 shows the range of scores and
the large number of positive scores.

Openness to Experience (Qualitative Results)
The qualitative data portrayed the model young character as open to experience
(see Figure 10). Table 3 presents descriptive statistics for the qualitative scores for
openness to experience. Figure 10 shows the range of scores and the large number of
positive scores.
There were 18 adjectives, or descriptive language that could be turned into
adjectives, which described openness to experience in the young characters; 14 of those
were positive and four were negative. Young characters were described by adjectives in

96
positive terms far more than in negative terms for the Openness to Experience Factor (see
Table 4). The descriptive language supported the positive quantitative and qualitative
results for openness to experience.
Several young characters in the picture books studied from the 2000s enjoyed
highly imaginative adventures that required positive openness to experience scores far
from the mean (see Outliers in Research Question 1 in Chapter IV: Results and Analysis).

Outliers
For the purposes of this study, outliers had an important and critical role in the
stories that unfolded in these picture books. The definition of outlier for this study was
more than one standard deviation from the mean. The majority of fictional young
characters, for every factor, exhibited behaviors, attitudes, and emotions that resulted in
scores within one standard deviation of the mean. The behaviors, attitudes, and emotions

97
that resulted in scores outside of one standard deviation from the mean on either the
positive or negative side of the mean generally indicated an extreme that was necessary to
the plot or the educational intention of the story. There were outliers in every factor in
both quantitative and qualitative results that were often supported by descriptive
language. Triangulation of three data sources, quantitative findings, qualitative findings,
and descriptive language, showed similarity of results for many of the outliers.
Outliers in every factor in both quantitative and qualitative results can generally
be explained. Some of the outliers were essential to the plot of the story; others were
essential to the educational intention of the story. Some of the outliers occurred because
of difficulties in assessing some personality factors for young characters. It may be
difficult to accurately assess some traits for the young characters because children are
still developing and acquiring habits so some traits may not be fully formed (Grist &
McCord, 2010; Rothbart, Evans, & Ahadi, 2000). Also, the traits considered in the
instrument used for the quantitative study are meant to describe adults, and may result in
less accurate scores when used for children.
Outliers as a Result of the Use of Contrast in Picture Books
Contrast is recognized as a literary element important to children’s literature
(Arbuthnot, 1964; Oskamp, et al, 1996). Contrast may be important to the plot of the
story and may also be used as part of the educational intention of the story. For several of
the Big Five Factors, characters with scores more than one standard deviation from the
mean were used for contrast, often with one young character in the book within one
standard deviation of the mean and the contrasting character(s) more than one standard
deviation from the mean. Sometimes the contrast was even more extreme. The picture

98
book, Cinderella, or the Little Glass Slipper, offered examples of the use of contrast. In
both quantitative and qualitative findings, the two stepsisters and Cinderella were at least
one standard deviation apart for the factors of agreeableness, conscientiousness,
emotional stability and openness to experience. In the quantitative and qualitative results
for agreeableness, Cinderella was within one standard deviation of the mean and the
stepsisters were four standard deviations from the mean on the negative side of the mean
in the quantitative results; in the qualitative results the younger stepsister was two
standard deviations from the mean on the negative side of the mean and the older
stepsister was three standard deviations from the mean on the negative side of the mean.
The language used to describe the characters that was associated with the factor of
agreeableness supported these results. Cinderella was described as sweet once and good
three times in the book, descriptive language positively associated with agreeableness in
the context of the story. The stepsisters were described as rude, an adjective negatively
associated with agreeableness; the older stepsister was described as rude twice, the
younger stepsister was described as rude once. For the factor of conscientiousness, in
both quantitative and qualitative results, Cinderella was within one standard deviation of
the mean and the stepsisters were two standard deviations from the mean on the negative
side of the mean. The language used to describe the characters that was associated with
the factor of conscientiousness supported these results. Cinderella was described as
grand, charming, graceful and courteous, descriptive language positively associated with
conscientiousness in the context of the story. The stepsisters were both described as
proud and busy, adjectives negatively associated with conscientiousness in the context of
the story. In the quantitative results for emotional stability, Cinderella was one standard

99
deviation from the mean on the positive side of the mean while both stepsisters were
three standard deviations from the mean on the negative side of the mean. For the factor
of openness to experience, in both quantitative and qualitative results, Cinderella was
within one standard deviation of the mean and the stepsisters were two standard
deviations from the mean on the negative side of the mean.
Another picture book where contrast was a major component of the story was My
Friend Rabbit, a highly imaginative story of enduring friendship and contrasting
personalities. The contrast in the personalities was critical to the plot and the educational
intention of the story and resulted in exaggerated personalities. Rabbit’s exuberant and
thoughtless behavior resulted in problems that Rabbit then tried to solve with fanciful,
highly impractical solutions. Mouse was Rabbit’s steadfast friend and rescuer. Rabbit and
Mouse had differences in scores on several of the Big Five Factors. For extroversion,
looking at the quantitative results, Mouse was within one standard deviation of the mean
on the negative side of the mean and Rabbit was two standard deviations from the mean
on the positive side of the mean. The qualitative results were even more extreme for
extroversion with Mouse within one standard deviation of the mean on the negative side
and Rabbit three standard deviations from the mean on the positive side. For
agreeableness, Rabbit was within one standard deviation of the mean on the negative side
and Mouse was two standard deviations from the mean on the positive side in the
qualitative results. For conscientiousness, in the quantitative results Mouse was within
one standard deviation of the mean on the negative side and Rabbit was two standard
deviations from the mean on the negative side; the qualitative results were more extreme
for conscientiousness with Mouse within one standard deviation of the mean on the

100
positive side of the mean and Rabbit three standard deviations from the mean on the
negative side of the mean. For emotional stability, Rabbit was within one standard
deviation of the mean on the positive side and Mouse was two standard deviations from
the mean on the negative side in the qualitative results.
In one picture book, Saint George and the Dragon, which utilized contrast,
gender was the basis for the contrast in the qualitative results. For the factor of
extroversion, the female character, Una, was within one standard deviation of the mean,
toward the negative side of the mean, while the male character was three standard
deviations from the mean on the positive side of the mean. The language used to describe
the characters that was associated with the factor of extroversion supported these
qualitative results. The Red Cross Knight, the male character, was described as brave five
times in the book. The adjective, brave, is associated positively with extroversion. For the
factor of emotional stability, using the qualitative results, the female character was two
standard deviations from the mean, toward the negative side of the mean; the male
character was two standard deviations from the mean toward the positive side of the
mean. The language used to describe the characters that was associated with the factor of
emotional stability supported these qualitative results. The Red Cross Knight was
described as noble and victorious in the book, descriptive language positively associated
with emotional stability. The female character was described as fearful and gentle, both
negatively associated with emotional stability in the context of the story. Looking at the
quantitative data, both female and male characters were within one standard deviation of
the mean for four of the five factors. They were both two standard deviations from the

101
mean on the positive side of the mean for the factor of conscientiousness in the
quantitative results.
The gender contrast evident in Saint George and the Dragon was consistent with
the academic literature studying gender differences in picture books. Extroversion was
positively associated with being active and negatively associated with being passive,
although passivity was also negatively linked to emotional maturity. Throughout the
book, the male character, the Red Cross Knight, was portrayed as actively pursuing
information and adventures as well as rescuing the female character’s kingdom by
battling and finally killing a greatly feared dragon. The female character, Una, attended to
the Red Cross Knight, avoiding the dangers of battle. Numerous studies, over several
decades, had reported that male characters were portrayed as active, adventurous, and
explorative while female characters were portrayed as passive (Allen, A., et al., 1993;
Goodroe, 1998; Kolbe & LaVoie, 1981; Kortenhouse & Demarest, 1993; Nilsen, 1971;
Pyle, 1976; Weitzman et al., 1972; Williams, J. A. et al., 1987). Some research reported
that although male characters continue to be portrayed as active, adventurous, and
explorative, increasing numbers of female characters were also portrayed as active and
adventurous rather than passive (Collins et al., 1984; Creany, 1995).
The gender contrast evident in Saint George and the Dragon was consistent with
the academic literature studying gender differences in picture books, although for the
factor of agreeableness, the behavior linked to males and the behavior linked to females
were both positively associated with agreeableness. The Red Cross Knight was
consistently and repeatedly engaged in rescuing behavior while Una was consistently and
repeatedly engaged in nurturing behavior. Rescuing behavior, as long as it was helpful,

102
was associated positively with agreeableness and was linked to male characters in the
early academic literature (Pyle, 1976; Weitzman et al., 1972) although both male and
female characters were reported to engage in rescuing behavior in later academic
literature (Hamilton et al., 2006; Oskamp et al., 1996; Williams, J.A. et al., 1987).
Nurturing behavior was also associated positively with agreeableness and female
characters were portrayed as nurturing in the academic literature (Hamilton et al., 2006;
Pyle, 1976; Weitzman et al., 1972).
Outliers as a Result of Adventures Outside of Usual Routine in Picture Books
Some characters with scores more than one standard deviation from the mean had
exciting adventures that resulted in depiction of traits more extreme than what would be
expected in the usual routine of the characters’ lives. Madeline, in Madeline’s Rescue,
stood out from all the other girls in her live-in school. Madeline was rescued from
drowning by a dog who was then adopted, despite difficulties, by the girls at the school.
For the quantitative results in the factor of extroversion, Madeline was two standard
deviations from the mean on the positive side of the mean. For both qualitative and
quantitative results for emotional stability, Madeline was two standard deviations from
the mean on the negative side of the mean. These outlier scores allowed Madeline to have
individualized adventures critical to the plot of the story.
Hugo and Isabelle, in The Invention of Hugo Cabret, were examples of young
characters caught in an exciting and challenging adventure that required behaviors,
attitudes, and emotions outside of what would be expected in ordinary life. Another
young character in the story, that was a few years older than Hugo and Isabelle, Etienne,
served as a foil to some of the behaviors, attitudes and emotions seen in Hugo and

103
Isabelle (see Outliers as a Result of the Use of Contrast in Picture Books in Outliers in
Chapter IV: Results and Analysis). For the factor of emotional stability, Isabelle was two
standard deviations from the mean on the negative side of the mean and Hugo was three
standard deviations from the mean on the negative side of the mean for the quantitative
results. Etienne provided contrast in that he was two standard deviations from the mean
on the positive side of the mean. The language used to describe the characters that was
associated with the factor of emotional stability supported these results. Isabelle was
described twice as angry and twice as terrified. She was also described as nervous,
confused and shaking. Hugo was described as afraid once, fearful once, terrified five
times, agitated once, trembling once, shaking once, angry three times, nervous three
times, frustrated twice, cautious twice, and crazy twice. He was also described as broken,
desperate, fierce, feverish, and resentful. This descriptive language was associated
negatively with emotional stability in the context of the story. For the factor of openness
to experience, in the quantitative results, Hugo and Isabelle were both three standard
deviations from the mean on the positive side of the mean. These outlier scores allowed
Hugo and Isabelle to have scary, exciting adventures critical to the plot of the story.
Outliers as a Result of Solitary Adventures in Picture Books
The isolated experiences of some of the characters resulted in outlier scores. The
unnamed character in Flotsom had an interesting, although somewhat ordinary, isolated
set of experiences on the beach in the summer until he discovered a camera washed up on
shore that propelled him into highly imaginative adventures. For the factor of openness to
experience, he was two standard deviations from the mean in quantitative results and

104
three standard deviations from the mean in qualitative results, on the positive side of the
mean for both sets of results.
Characters who had solitary experiences lacked interaction with other characters
and that had a negative impact on their extroversion and agreeableness scores. The
unnamed young character in House in the Night had an extroversion score two standard
deviations from the mean on the negative side of the mean in the quantitative and the
qualitative data. The unnamed character in Flotsom had an extroversion score two
standard deviations from the mean on the negative side of the mean in the qualitative
data. Kitten, in Kitten’s First Full Moon, mistook the full moon for a bowl of milk and
had several solitary misadventures trying to get to that bowl of milk. She had a score two
standard deviations from the mean on the negative side of the mean in the quantitative
data for the factor of agreeableness.
Outliers as a Result of Educational Intention of the Story in Picture Books
Contrast, already discussed, can be an important device for educational intention,
as a model for comparing characters. Outliers were used for educational intention in other
ways. Some of the picture books studied found young characters highly agreeable and
highly conscientious because the educational intention of the story required high scores in
those factors. In the picture book, Ox-Cart Man, a story that demonstrated the importance
of conscientiousness and agreeableness for a family working together to survive and
thrive in early New England, the two young characters, an unnamed son and daughter,
were outliers in these two Big Five Factors. For the factor of agreeableness both the son
and the daughter were two standard deviations from the mean on the positive side of the
mean in the qualitative results. For conscientiousness, in the quantitative results, they

105
were both two standard deviations from the mean on the positive side of the mean; in
qualitative results for conscientiousness, the son was three standard deviations from the
mean and the daughter was four standard deviations from the mean, both on the positive
side of the mean. A similar familial situation in Chanticleer and the Fox, a retelling of
Chaucer’s The Nun’s Priest’s Tale, resulted in the two young characters having outlier
quantitative scores for conscientiousness. Both of the young daughters were two standard
deviations from the mean on the positive side of the mean for conscientiousness.
Outliers as a Result of Humanized Animal Characters in Picture Books
Several of the picture books studied had humanized animals as the main
characters. Because they were animals they engaged in behavior and expressed emotions
that might not be available to children in real life, but because they had human qualities,
such as the ability to talk, children identify with them. The two main characters in
Finders Keepers, named Nap and Winkle, were dogs that had a disagreement about a
bone; they drew other characters into their disagreement until finally a larger dog tried to
take the bone away from them and they worked together to fight the larger dog and claim
the bone to share. Both main characters were two standard deviations from the mean on
the positive side of the mean in the quantitative results for extroversion. This extreme
extroversion score allowed the main characters to approach several characters who were
strangers to them, including the dog they attacked. Kitten, in Kitten’s First Full Moon,
had a qualitative extroversion score that was three standard deviations from the mean on
the positive side of the mean, an extreme score that allowed her to have exciting
adventures chasing the moon that she had mistakenly identified as a giant bowl of milk.
The language used to describe Kitten that is associated with the factor of extroversion

106
supported these results. She was described as brave and fast, two adjectives that are
associated with the bold, energetic actions that typify extroversion.
Research Question 2:
How do the personality factors of young characters in Caldecott Award winning picture
books compare and contrast in three different time periods: the 1950s, the 1980s, and the
2000s?
Descriptive Statistics over Three Time Periods (Quantitative Results)
Although there were differences in Big Five Factor scores over the decades,
statistically significant differences were limited to two of the Big Five factors studied,
extroversion and openness to experience. Table 5 displays the numbers of characters,
means, and standard deviations for each of the three decades, using the quantitative data.

Descriptive Statistics across Three Time Periods (Qualitative Results)
The qualitative descriptive statistics for the Big Five Factor scores over the
decades showed some similarities but also some differences from the quantitative
descriptive statistics. The mean scores were positive in both quantitative and qualitative
results except for the factor of emotional stability that had some negative mean scores in
both quantitative and qualitative results. Similar patterns emerged from the quantitative

108
and the qualitative results. Table 6 displays the number of characters, means, and
standard deviations for each of the three decades, using the qualitative results.

The language used to describe the young characters supported some of the

quantitative and qualitative results. The descriptive language positively associated with
extroversion followed the quantitative results for extroversion; high in the 1950s, low in
the 1980s, and high again in the 2000s (see Tables 5 and 7). The large amount of negative
descriptive language overall supported the generally low and negative results for
emotional stability in both the quantitative and qualitative results. The descriptive

109
language positively associated with openness to experience supported the positive results

qualitative and quantitative results across time periods, high in the 1950s, low in the
1980s, and high again in the 2000s (see Tables 5, 6, and 7).

A one-way ANOVA was conducted on both the quantitative and qualitative data
to test for statistically significant differences between time periods for all of the Big Five

Factors. Only two factors showed statistically significant differences in the quantitative
results, extroversion and openness to experience (see Table 8). Only one factor showed
statistically significant differences in the qualitative results, openness to experience.

Extroversion
Extroversion, as a personality factor of the young characters, changed
significantly over the decades studied: the 1950s, the 1980s, and the 2000s with the
quantitative data. There was a statistically significant difference between time periods as
determined by one-way ANOVA (F(2, 32) = 10.04, p = .000). A Games-Howell post-hoc

111
test revealed that the 1950s was statistically significantly higher than the 1980s at a level
of 1.76 (p = .000). There were no significant differences between the 1980s and the 2000s
(p = .090), nor were there any statistically significant differences between the 1950s and
the 2000s (p = .372).
The mean quantitative scores for extroversion for all three time periods studied
were positive; in the 1950s, the mean score was more than two standard deviations from
zero; in the 1980s and the 2000s the mean score was more than one standard deviation
from zero (see Table 9).

The quantitative extroversion scores in the 1950s were the highest scores of the

three decades. The scores dropped to their lowest in the 1980s and then began to increase
in the 2000s (see Figure 11).

112

Statistical analysis, as determined by one-way ANOVA, of the qualitative
extroversion data for the time periods studied, did not reveal statistically significant
results (F (2,32) = 0.69, p = .511). A Games- Howell post-hoc test revealed no significant
difference between the 1950s and the 1980s (p = .315); no significant difference between
the 1980s and the 2000s (p = .774); no significant difference between the 1950s and the
2000s (p = .991).
Agreeableness
Agreeableness, as a personality factor of the young characters, did not change
significantly over the decades studied in the quantitative or the qualitative results.

113
At an alpha of .05, the analysis of variance did not reveal significant differences
over the decades studied with the quantitative data for the factor of agreeableness,
(F(2,32) = .25, ns, effect size = .05). The effect size was small. A post-hoc test, Tukey
HSD, indicated no significant differences between any of the time periods studied for the
factor of agreeableness.
At an alpha of .05, the analysis of variance did not reveal significant differences
over the decades studied with the qualitative data for the factor of agreeableness, (F(2,32)
= 2.53, ns, effect size = .14). The effect size was small. A post-hoc test, Tukey HSD,
indicated no significant differences between any of the time periods studied for the factor
of agreeableness.
Conscientiousness
Conscientiousness, as a personality factor of the young characters, did not change
significantly over the decades studied: the 1950s, the 1980s, and the 2000s in the
quantitative or the qualitative results.
At an alpha of .05, the analysis of variance did not reveal significant differences
over the decades studied with the quantitative data for the factor of conscientiousness,
(F(2, 32) = .46, ns, effect size = .03). The effect size was small. A post-hoc test, Tukey
HSD, indicated no significant differences between any of the time periods studied for the
factor of conscientiousness.
At an alpha of .05, the analysis of variance did not reveal significant differences
over the decades studied with the qualitative data for the factor of conscientiousness,
(F(2, 32) = 2.54, ns, effect size = .14). The effect size was small. A post-hoc test, Games-

114
Howell, indicated no significant differences between any of the time periods studied for
the factor of conscientiousness.
Emotional Stability
Emotional Stability, as a personality factor of the young characters, remained
consistently low over the decades studied: the 1950s, the 1980s, and the 2000s. It did not
change significantly over the decades studied in the quantitative or the qualitative results.
At an alpha of .05, the analysis of variance did not reveal significant differences
over the decades studied for the factor of emotional stability in the quantitative results,
(F(2, 32) = 1.50, ns, effect size = .09). The effect size was small. A post-hoc test, Tukey
HSD, indicated no significant differences between any of the time periods studied for the
factor of emotional stability.
At an alpha of .05, the analysis of variance did not reveal significant differences
over the decades studied for the factor of emotional stability in the qualitative results,
(F(2, 32) = 1.26, ns, effect size = .07). The effect size was small. A post-hoc test, GamesHowell, indicated no significant differences between any of the time periods studied for
the factor of emotional stability.
Openness to Experience
Openness to Experience, as a personality factor of the young characters, changed
significantly over the decades studied, the 1950s, the 1980s, and the 2000s in the
quantitative and the qualitative results.
Looking at the quantitative openness to experience scores, there was a statistically
significant difference between time periods as determined by one-way ANOVA (F(2,32)
= 15.74, p =.000, effect size = .50). The effect size was large. A Games-Howell post-hoc

115
test revealed that the 1980s were statistically significantly higher than the 1950s at a level
of 1.11 (p = .038), the 2000s were statistically significantly higher than the 1980s at a
level of 1.67 (p = .014), and the 2000s were statistically significantly higher than the
1950s at a level of 2.78 (p = .000).
Most young characters had positive openness to experience quantitative scores. In
the 1950s, the mean score was more than one standard deviation from zero; in the 1980s
the mean score was more than three standard deviations from zero; in the 2000s the mean
score was more than three standard deviations from zero (see Table 10).
The mean quantitative openness to experience scores showed a nearly linear
increase across the time periods (see Figure 12).

Looking at the qualitative openness to experience scores, there was a statistically
significant difference between time periods as determined by one-way ANOVA (F(2,32)
= 6.86, p =.003, effect size = .30).The effect size was large. A Tukey HSD post-hoc test
revealed that the 1980s were statistically significantly higher than the 1950s at a level of
1.93 (p = .005) and the 2000s were statistically significantly higher than the 1950s at a
level of 1.65 (p = .022).There were no statistically significant differences between the
1980s and the 2000s (p = .891).
The qualitative results had some similarities with the quantitative results. Most
young characters had positive openness to experience scores and most young characters
were within one standard deviation of the mean. The mean scores for both qualitative and
quantitative data generally increased over the time periods. However the qualitative
results also had some differences when compared to the quantitative results. The mean

117
scores in the 1950s are the lowest scores of the three time periods for both quantitative
and qualitative results; however the quantitative results increased in mean scores through
the time periods while the qualitative results increased from the 1950s to the 1980s and
then declined slightly in mean scores from the 1980s to the 2000s (see Figure 12 and
Figure 13).
Most young characters had positive openness to experience qualitative scores. In
all three time periods studied, the mean score was more than one standard deviation from
zero (see Table 11).

Research Question 3:
How are the personality factors of young characters in Caldecott Award winning picture
books differentiated by gender in three different time periods: the 1950s, the 1980s, and
the 2000s?
Gender Similarities and Differences in Personalities of Young Characters in Picture
Books
Data were collected on the gender variable. Only one young character met the
criteria to be considered neutral, rather than male or female. Two categories for gender,
male and female, were considered in the statistical analysis of the data related to the
gender portions of the study.
Although there were differences in personality between genders (see Table 12 and
Table 14), those differences were not statistically significant in the quantitative study or
the qualitative study.

Gender Similarities and Differences in Personalities of Young Characters across Time
Periods in Picture Books
As the data were broken down across the time periods studied, the sample sizes
got small to the point that it was difficult to determine meaningful statistical analysis. A
univariate ANOVA was performed on the data one Big Five Factor at a time looking at
both gender and time period. There was no effect by gender, no statistically significant
differences in gender across decades, and no interaction effect with gender and time
periods.
Descriptive statistics for quantitative and qualitative data by gender and across
time periods are presented in Table 16 and Table 17.

Triangulation
Triangulation is the use of a combination of methodologies to strengthen research

design, to increase validity of research results, and to enhance and deepen the
significance of the research (Jick, 1979; Denzin & Lincoln, 2005; Leech &
Onwuegbuzie, 2007).

125
This study used triangulation by combining quantitative and qualitative methods.
Two coders, independently completing a standardized personality instrument, completed
the quantitative portion of the study and intercoder reliability was established. Prior to
undertaking the study, a pilot study established statistically acceptable intercoder
reliability. The qualitative portion of this study utilized several different data analysis
techniques including classic content analysis, word count, and constant comparison
analysis.
The quantitative and qualitative aspects of the study found a similar and
consistent whole personality for the young characters in the picture books studied,
described using the Big Five Personality Factors. The descriptive language supported the
quantitative and qualitative findings for three of the personality factors:
conscientiousness, emotional stability and openness to experience. Table 18 summarizes
data providing the description of the whole personality of the model young character,
based on the Big Five Personality Factors. Table 18 also shows the triangulation used in
the study with quantitative data collected from the Big Five Mini-Markers and qualitative
data collected on the coding sheet from observed behavior, attitude and expression, both
similarly describing the model young character for each of the Big Five Factors. The
qualitative data from the collection of descriptive language confirmed and supported the
other two data sets for three of the five factors.

Significant differences were found in both quantitative and qualitative data
between the time periods for two of the Big Five Personality Factors, extroversion and
openness to experience. The patterns of change for openness to experience had
similarities in the quantitative and qualitative data (see Figure 12 and Figure 13).

No statistically significant differences between genders were found in the data
from the quantitative study or the data from the qualitative study using the coding sheet.
One book had multiple examples of gender contrast, evident in the qualitative results and
supported by descriptive language in the story. The Big Five Personality Factor of
Agreeableness had a medium effect size between genders in both the quantitative and
qualitative results.
Triangulation of three data sources, quantitative findings, qualitative findings, and
descriptive language, showed similarity of results for many of the findings.
Chapter Summary
This study employed a mixed methods design using content analysis to describe
the total personality of young characters in Caldecott Award winning picture books from
three decades: the 1950s, the 1980s, and the 2000s. A standard personality measure,
based on Goldberg’s Big Five Personality Factors, was the instrument used in the
quantitative portion of the study.
This chapter presented the findings of the study. The quantitative and qualitative
aspects of the study found a similar and consistent whole personality for the young
characters in the picture books studied, described using the Big Five personality factors.
There were significant differences in the time periods for two of the Big Five Personality
Factors, extroversion and openness to experience. There were no statistically significant
differences in personality factors between genders in the study, no statistically significant
differences in gender across decades, and no interaction effect with gender and time
periods.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Introduction
Picture books have potential for great psychological, social, and cultural power in
the lives of young children. The characters in picture books provide models for children
to emulate and to use to learn about the world, including learning social conventions.
(Flerx et al.,1976; Gladding & Gladding, 1991; Jalongo, 2004; Mattix & Sobolak, 2014).
Young children are exposed to the power of picture books when they are impressionable,
vulnerable and not yet capable of critical literary analysis (Diekman & Murnen, 2004;
Marshall, G., 1975; Nilsen, 1971; Oskamp et al., 1996; Pelletier & Astington, 2004; Pike
et al., 2010; Spitz, 1999). An understanding of the personality factors making up the
whole child modeled in these picture books is important to understanding how these
picture books influence children and how they can most effectively be used in
educational settings. Picture books also reflect idealized cultural constructs that have the
potential to change and shape communities and society as well as individuals
(Kortenhaus & Demarest, 1993; Martinez & McGee, 2000; Murray, 1998; Sipe &
Pantaleo, 2008; Warner, 1995), so an understanding of the personality factors making up
the whole child modeled in picture books is important to understanding aspects of our
culture.

The purpose of this study was to determine and explore the whole personality of
young characters in Caldecott Award winning picture books from three time periods: the
1950s, the 1980s, and the 2000s. This study found a similar and consistent whole
personality for the young characters in the picture books studied that can be described
using the Big Five Personality Factors. There were statistically significant differences in
the time periods for two of the Big Five Personality Factors, extroversion and openness to
experience. Although there were differences in personality between genders, those
differences were not statistically significant in the quantitative study or the qualitative
study, although the factor of agreeableness had a medium effect size in both the
quantitative and qualitative results. There was no effect by gender, no statistically
significant differences in gender across decades, and no interaction effect between gender
and time periods.

Summary and Interpretation of Research Findings
Research Question 1:
How can the total personality of the model child be described using the results of the
Mini-Markers Big Five Personality Instrument and the results of the qualitative analysis
of Big Five Personality Factors?
Descriptive statistics from the quantitative data and the qualitative data suggested
a similar and consistent personality model for the young characters in the picture books
studied. The descriptive language supported the model for three of the five factors,
conscientiousness, emotional stability, and openness to experience. There were outliers in
every factor in both quantitative results and in qualitative results; however, they can
generally be explained. Some of the outliers were essential to the plot of the story; others
were essential to the educational intention of the story (see Outliers in Chapter IV:
Results and Analysis). Table 18 summarizes data providing the description of the whole
personality of the model young character, based on the Big Five Personality Factors.
Extroversion
The quantitative and qualitative data both portrayed the model young characters
as extroverted. The mean scores for extroversion were more than one standard deviation
from a score of zero in both the quantitative and qualitative results. In both the
quantitative and qualitative data, 33 out of 35 young characters had positive extroversion
scores. Young characters were described by adjectives in negative terms more than in
positive terms for the extroversion factor (see Table 18); this did not support the positive
findings of the quantitative and qualitative analysis of data. The quantitative data also
showed statistically significant differences between time periods in extroversion.

131
Although there is controversy, a case has been made that American society values
extroversion over introversion (Cain, 2012; Lloyd, 2012; Paulus & Morgan, 1997). To
some extent the controversy extends into other personality factors. A body of literature
explores the functionality and value of different personality factors and traits in different
settings. Lloyd, in the academic literature, explained the two different approaches to
personality theory: Type Theory versus Trait Theory. Both approaches recognize
extroversion/introversion as a major component of personality theory. One important
contrast in the two theories concerns “the moral worth of the personality characteristic
they measure” (Lloyd, 2012, p. 27). The Big Five Personality Factors, a trait approach,
“sees Extraversion [sic], Agreeableness, Openness and Conscientiousness as desirable
qualities, and deems low scores to indicate personality deficit. By contrast the Type
approach insists that the polar opposite expressions of the four personality factors each
have intrinsic value: one is not morally or functionally superior to the other” (Lloyd,
2012 pg. 27). In the popular nonfiction book, Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World
that Can’t Stop Talking, Cain (2012) argued that although extroversion is the cultural
ideal in American society, the undervalued introversion has great power, functionality,
and value. This study approached the subject of personality from the Trait approach,
using the Big Five Personality Factors established by Goldberg (1990).
People with high extroversion scores tend to be leaders, especially in active,
social situations (Bartone, Eid, Johnsen, Laberg, & Snook, 2009; Emery, Calvard, &
Pierce, 2013). People with high extroversion scores also tend to be successful in the
business world (Palaiou & Furnham, 2014). High scores in extroversion are linked to
career success (Judge, Higgins, Thoresen, & Barrick, 1999).

132
In the present study, the high mean score for extroversion as well as the number
of young characters with positive extroversion scores reflected the value American
society places on extroversion. Some of the adjectives that correlated positively with
extroversion were bold, energetic, and talkative. Some of the adjectives exhibited by the
young characters in the study that correlated positively with extroversion were bold,
energetic, and talkative. The young characters in the picture books studied modeled the
cultural ideal for the factor of extroversion.
The academic literature identified extroverted behavior on the part of characters
in picture books in many of the gender studies. Active, adventurous, assertive, bold, and
explorative behavior that indicated extroversion was identified in many of the studies
exploring gender differences and gender stereotypes in picture books. In the earliest time
period considered in this study, the 1950s, extroverted behavior was generally more
identified with male characters (Allen, A. et al., 1993; Creany, 1995; Goodroe, 1998;
Kortenhouse & Demarest, 1993; Nilsen, 1971; Weitzman et al., 1972; Williams, J. A. et
al., 1987). These gender studies also identified passive behavior that indicated negative
extroversion, although, especially in the 1950s, it was generally more identified with
female characters (Kolbe & LaVoie, 1981; Nilsen, 1971; Weitzman et al., 1972;
Williams, J. A. et al., 1987). Later research reported that male characters continued to be
portrayed as active, adventurous, and explorative, but increasing numbers of female
characters in the 1970s, the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s, were also portrayed as
active and adventurous rather than passive (Collins et al., 1984; Creany, 1995).

133
Agreeableness
The quantitative and qualitative data both portrayed the young characters as
agreeable. The mean quantitative score for agreeableness was more than one standard
deviation from a score of zero; the mean qualitative score for agreeableness was close to
one standard deviation from a score of zero. In both the quantitative and qualitative data,
33 out of 35 young characters had positive agreeableness scores. Young characters were
described by equal numbers of positive and negative adjectives for the agreeableness
factor (see Table 18); this reflected a model young character that differed from the model
established with the positive quantitative and qualitative results.
As with extroversion, people with high agreeableness scores tend to be successful
in the business world (Palaiou & Furnham, 2014). Agreeableness has been positively
related to team performance, largely through enhanced communication and cohesion
(Bradley, Baur, Banford, & Postlethwaite, 2013). High agreeableness, however, seems to
be a barrier to reaching leadership positions in the business world (Judge et al., 1999).
People high in agreeableness report high levels of life satisfaction and enjoy feelings of
subjective well-being (Soto, 2014).
Academic literature identified the Big Five Factor of agreeableness on the part of
characters in picture books in many of the gender studies. Both male and female behavior
and attitude were positively associated with agreeableness. Rescuing behavior, as long as
it was helpful, was associated positively with agreeableness and was linked to male
characters in the early academic literature (Pyle, 1976; Weitzman et al., 1972) although
both male and female characters were reported to engage in rescuing behavior in later
academic literature (Hamilton et. al, 2006; Oskamp et al., 1996; Williams, J.A. et al.,

134
1987). Nurturing behavior was also associated positively with agreeableness and female
characters were portrayed as nurturing in the academic literature (Hamilton et al., 2006;
Pyle, 1976; Weitzman et al., 1972).
The high mean scores as well as the large number of young characters with
positive agreeableness scores reflected the value that American society places on
agreeableness. The young characters in the picture books studied modeled the cultural
ideal for the Big Five Factor of agreeableness.
Conscientiousness
The quantitative and qualitative data both portrayed the model young characters
as conscientious, however, for this Big Five Factor, the characters’ scores were closer to
zero than they were for extroversion, agreeableness and openness to experience. The
mean scores for conscientiousness were less than one standard deviation from a score of
zero in both the quantitative and qualitative results. In the quantitative data, 32 out of 35
young characters had positive conscientiousness scores; in the qualitative data, 25 out of
35 young characters had positive conscientiousness scores. Young characters were
described by adjectives in positive terms far more than in negative terms for the
conscientiousness factor (see Table 18), supporting the positive quantitative and
qualitative results.
American society, especially in terms of school, work, and career, values people
with high conscientiousness scores. Of the Big Five Personality Factors,
conscientiousness is the best predictor of positive work performance (Barrick & Mount,
2005; Palaiou & Furnham, 2014); it is also correlated with external measures, such as
salary, promotions, occupational status, and internal measures, such as job satisfaction

135
and feelings of career success (Judge et al., 1999). Conscientiousness is also associated
with high academic performance for children (Abe, 2005; Drake, Belsky, & Fearon,
2014; Poropat, 2014).
The positive mean score, the number of young characters with positive
conscientiousness scores, as well as the description of young characters using positive
adjectives related to conscientiousness, reflected the value of conscientiousness in
American society. For this Big Five Factor, however, the characters’ scores were closer
to zero than they were for extroversion, agreeableness and openness to experience. This
comparatively lower score may be due to the age of the characters; they were not yet of
an age to be working or even seriously considering careers. Also, the traits considered in
the instrument used for the quantitative study were meant to describe adults, and may
result in less accurate scores when used for children. It may also be difficult to accurately
assess some traits for the young characters, because children are still learning and
forming habits and some traits may not yet be fully developed (Grist and McCord, 2010;
Rothbart, Evans, & Ahadi, 2000).
Emotional Stability
The factor of emotional stability refers to consistency in experiencing and
displaying positive emotions. Negative emotional stability may be an indication of
neuroses (Saucier, 1994). In this study, the mean quantitative score for emotional stability
was negative, although it was close to zero; the mean qualitative score for emotional
stability was positive but also close to zero. In the quantitative data, 17 out of 35 young
characters had positive emotional stability scores; in the qualitative data, 24 out of 35
young characters had positive emotional stability scores. The number of adjectives, or

136
descriptive language that could be turned into adjectives, that described emotional
stability in the young characters negatively (see Table 18) supported the quantitative and
qualitative results.
A positive score in the factor of emotional stability is clearly favored over a
negative score in our society, as a negative score may indicate neuroses (Saucier, 1994).
Emotional stability is second only to conscientiousness as a predictor of positive work
performance (Barrick & Mount, 2005; Palaiou & Furnham, 2014). Emotional stability is
associated with feelings of subjective well-being and positive feelings of life satisfaction
(Soto, 2014). It is also correlated with experiencing fewer negative emotions (Barrick &
Mount, 2005).
The academic literature identified behavior, attitude, and emotional expression
linked to the factor of emotional stability on the part of young characters in many of the
studies exploring gender differences and gender stereotypes in picture books. The trait of
independence was positively related to emotional stability. The literature reported male
characters as consistently independent through the time periods included in the present
study: the 1950s, the 1980s, and the 2000s (Collins et al., 1984; Kortenhouse &
Demarest, 1993; Mattix & Sobolak, 2014; Nilsen, 1971; Weitzman et al., 1972). The
literature reported changes in the trait of independence for female characters through this
same time period. In the early literature, reporting on picture books in the 1940s, 1950s,
and 1960s, female characters were portrayed as dependent (Nilsen, 1971; Weitzman et
al., 1972). In later academic literature, reporting on picture books published in the 1970s
and the 1980s, increasingly larger numbers of female characters were portrayed as

137
independent (Collins et al., 1984; Mattix & Sobolak, 2014). After 1992, Mattix &
Sobolak reported declining numbers of independent female characters in picture books.
Passivity was negatively related to both extroversion and emotional stability. The
academic literature identified passive behavior as more identified with female characters
(Kolbe & LaVoie, 1981; Nilsen, 1971; Weitzman et al., 1972; Williams, J. A. et al.,
1987). A few later studies indicated that fewer female characters were portrayed as
passive in the picture books of the 1970s and 1980s (Collins et al., 1984; Creany, 1995).
Displaying negative emotions was negatively related to the factor of emotional stability.
The academic literature found that young female characters were allowed more emotional
expression than young male characters and this may have the effect of limiting the
emotional range of boys (Fox, 1993; Weitzman et al., 1972).
The findings of this study do not reflect the value of emotional stability in
American society. The mean quantitative and qualitative scores at close to zero, the
number of young characters with negative emotional stability scores, and the description
of young characters using negative adjectives related to emotional stability do not reflect
the value of emotional stability in American society. The traits considered in the
instrument used for the quantitative study are meant to describe adults and may result in
less accurate scores when used for children; this may partially account for the findings of
negative indicators for emotional stability in the study. It may also be difficult to
accurately assess some traits for the young characters, because children are still learning
and forming habits and some traits may not yet be fully developed (Grist & McCord,
2010; Rothbart, Evans, & Ahadi, 2000). The major reason for the negative indicators for
the factor of emotional stability may lie in the plots of the picture books studied. The

138
young characters in these picture books often had exciting adventures that resulted in
depiction of traits more extreme than what would be expected in the usual routine of the
characters’ lives. Contrast may be important to the plot of the story and may also result in
depiction of extreme personality traits. The negative emotions evident in the behavior,
attitude, and especially emotional response of the young characters included being
scared, terrified, frightened, sad, crazy, desperate, angry, and agitated. These emotional
responses were appropriate to the extreme situations depicted in the books studied.
Openness to Experience
Openness to experience included abilities in the artistic realm, curiosity,
knowledge, imagination, and complexity. High levels of openness to experience indicated
young characters that were very imaginative and had broad interests. Low levels of
openness to experience indicated young characters that tended to be practical, traditional,
and set in their ways (Saucier, 1994). Both the quantitative and the qualitative results
indicated that the model young character was open to experience. The mean scores for
openness to experience were more than one standard deviation from a score of zero in
both the quantitative and qualitative results. In the quantitative data, 31 out of 35 young
characters had positive openness to experience scores; in the qualitative data, 30 out of 35
young characters had positive openness to experience scores. Young characters were
described by adjectives in positive terms far more than in negative terms for openness to
experience (see Table 18). The descriptive language supported the quantitative and the
qualitative results for openness to experience. The quantitative and qualitative data also
indicated statistically significant differences between time periods for openness to
experience.

139
American society values people with high openness to experience scores. Of the
Big Five Personality Factors, openness to experience is the factor positively associated
with intelligence (DeYoung, Quilty, Peterson, & Gray, 2014) and creative achievement
(Kaufman, 2013).
The findings of the study reflected the value of openness to experience in
American society. The high mean scores for openness to experience, the large number of
young characters with positive openness to experience scores, and the description of
young characters using positive adjectives related to openness to experience, reflected the
value American society places on openness to experience. The young characters in the
picture books studied modeled the cultural ideal for the factor of openness to experience.
The academic literature identified behavior, attitude, and emotional expression
linked to the factor of openness to experience on the part of young characters in many of
the studies exploring gender differences and gender stereotypes in picture books. The
traits of creativity and curiosity, an element of the trait explorative, were positively
related to openness to experience. The Williams, J. A. et al. (1987) study using Caldecott
Award winning and honor books from 1972 to 1985 found that male characters were
portrayed as creative. In the earliest time period considered in this study, the 1950s,
explorative behavior was generally more identified with male characters but increasing
numbers of female characters in the 1970s, the 1980s, and the beginning of the 1990s,
were also portrayed as explorative (Kortenhouse & Demarest, 1993; Weitzman et al.,
1972; Williams, J. A. et al., 1987).

140
Model Child Reflected in Young Characters in Picture Books
The quantitative and qualitative data reflected a similar and consistent whole
personality for the young characters in the picture books studied for all five of the Big
Five Personality Factors. The descriptive language supported the results of the
quantitative and qualitative data for three of the factors, conscientiousness, emotional
stability, and openness to experience. The whole personality of the young characters
modeled the cultural ideal for four of the five factors. The quantitative data, qualitative
data, and descriptive language for the factor of emotional stability were consistently close
to negative, and a large number of young characters had negative scores. This did not
model a cultural ideal as negative scores for emotional stability may indicate neuroses
(Saucier, 1994), negative work performance (Barrick & Mount, 2005; Palaiou &
Furnham, 2014), and experiencing negative emotions (Barrick & Mount, 2005). The
major reason for the negative scores was most likely due to the exciting, adventurous
plots of the picture books that required behavioral and emotional responses that were
appropriate for the extreme situations depicted in the books but resulted in negative
scores for the factor of emotional stability.

141
Research Question 2:
How do the personality factors of young characters in Caldecott Award winning picture
books compare and contrast in three different time periods: the 1950s, the 1980s, and the
2000s?
Although there were differences in Big Five Factor scores over the decades, a
one-way ANOVA conducted on both the quantitative and qualitative data found
statistically significant differences between time periods were limited to two the Big Five
Personality Factors studied, extroversion and openness to experience. For the quantitative
data statistically significant differences between time periods were limited to extroversion
and openness to experience. For the qualitative data statistically significant differences
between time periods were limited to openness to experience. The language used to
describe the young characters also supported some of the quantitative and qualitative
results. The descriptive language positively associated with extroversion followed the
quantitative results for extroversion, high in the 1950s, low in the 1980s, and high again
in the 2000s. For the factor of emotional stability, there was more negative than positive
descriptive language in the 1950s and the 2000s; this supported the qualitative results for
emotional stability. The large amount of negative descriptive language overall supported
the generally low and negative results for emotional stability in both the quantitative and
qualitative findings. The descriptive language positively associated with openness to
experience supported the positive results in both the quantitative and qualitative results,
but showed a pattern different from both qualitative and quantitative, high in the 1950s,
low in the 1980s, and high again in the 2000s (see Table 7).

142
Extroversion
For the factor of extroversion, the quantitative results had a high mean score in
the 1950s (M = 2.63 with SD = 0.90), a low mean score in the 1980s (M = 0.87 with SD =
0.57) and then increased in the 2000s with a mean score approaching the 1950s score (M
= 1.94 with SD = 1.35). The descriptive language positively associated with extroversion
followed the quantitative results for extroversion, high in the 1950s, low in the 1980s,
and high again in the 2000s.
The quantitative extroversion scores revealed a statistically significant difference
between time periods as determined by one-way ANOVA (F(2, 32) = 10.04, p = .000). A
Games-Howell post-hoc test revealed that the 1950s was statistically significantly higher
than the 1980s at a level of 1.76 (p = .000). There were no significant differences
between the 1980s and the 2000s (p = .090), nor were there any statistically significant
differences between the 1950s and the 2000s (p = .372).
The significant change in extroversion scores is the downward leap in quantitative
scores from the 1950s to the 1980s. This change is supported by the descriptive language
positively associated with extroversion in those time periods.
Why did this significant downward leap in extroversion scores occur between the
1950s and the 1980s? One explanation involved changes in culture with a likely major
effect on children. Picture books reflect changes in culture (Kortenhaus & Demarest,
1993; Martinez & McGee, 2000; Murray, 1998; Sipe & Pantaleo, 2008; Weitzman, et al.,
1972), and one major change in American culture that affected children was access and
use of media and technology in this time period. In 1946 only 0.5% of homes had
televisions. By 1955, the percentage of homes with televisions had risen to 55% and by

143
1974 to 97%. In 2006, the percentage of children with televisions in their homes had
risen to 99% and 33% of children aged 0 to 6 had a television in their bedroom (Roberts
& Foehr, 2008). Researchers suggested that televisions had reached saturation level in
American homes (German & Lally, 2007; Roberts & Foehr, 2007). Children were
watching television at a young age; according to Comstock (2007), “regular attention to a
television screen now begins earlier than the age of two” (p. 297). Roberts and Foehr
(2007) further explained that newer types of media, such as computers, video games, and
handheld devices had also reached saturation or near saturation levels in American
homes. “While new technology is emerging every day, children are not cutting back on
television time to fit the newer mediums into their day…They view television just as
much as they did in 1999” (p. 336, German & Lally, 2007). Children and youth were
targeted as a consumer market for media (Roberts & Foehr, 2008). Children spent less
time in outdoor adventures, less time playing with other children in a natural
environment, and less time exploring nature, partially due to spending more time with
entertainment media, computers, and video games (Louv, 2009). Some studies indicated
that the large amount of increasingly isolated time that children spent watching television
and accessing other media had an isolating effect, with children having less contact with
other people including family members (Comstock, 2007; German & Lally, 2007).
Multiple studies had also found that children and youth exposed to violent media tend to
exhibit aggressive and antisocial behavior (Comstock, 2007; German & Lally, 2007;
Roberts & Foehr, 2008). Access to media, especially television, increased dramatically in
the same time period that extroversion scores of young characters in picture books saw a

144
major decrease. This change in our society may be reflected in the change seen in the
personality of young characters in picture books.
The quantitative results for the factor of extroversion showed a downward leap
from the 1950s to the 1980s, but also suggested an increase towards higher scores from
the 1980s to the 2000s. Several factors related to media use, especially television, may
partially account for this increase. By the 1980s, televisions were close to reaching
saturation level in American homes. Information in the popular press and the academic
literature about the potential negative effects of media on children had alarmed parents,
educators, and even politicians. Some parents set rules for media use by their children,
the federal government set guidelines for children’s television through the Children’s
Television Act of 1990 and the Telecommunications Act of 1996, and educational
television became part of the media available to children (German & Lally, 2007; Roberts
& Foehr, 2007).
Another factor in the significant change in extroversion scores was the decrease in
outdoor time available to children over these decades. Tandon, Zhou, and Christakis
(2012) reported that children of this generation spend less time playing outdoors than any
previous generation. Fewer opportunities to play outside resulted in fewer interactions
with others and less active and energetic behavior (McBride, 2012; Tandon et al., 2012).
Agreeableness
Agreeableness, as a personality factor of the young characters, did not show
statistically significant change over the decades studied: the 1950s, the 1980s, and the
2000s in the quantitative or the qualitative results.

145
Conscientiousness
Conscientiousness, as a personality factor of the young characters, did not show
statistically significant change over the decades studied: the 1950s, the 1980s, and the
2000s in the quantitative or the qualitative results.
Emotional Stability
Emotional Stability, as a personality factor of the young characters, did not show
statistically significant change over the decades studied: the 1950s, the 1980s, and the
2000s in the quantitative or the qualitative results. All three decades showed consistent
scores close to zero except the quantitative mean score for the 1950s (M = 1.59 with a SD
= 1.47) that presented a higher score.
Openness to Experience
Openness to Experience, as a personality factor of the young characters, showed
statistically significant change over the decades studied, the 1950s, the 1980s, and the
2000s in the quantitative and the qualitative results. The mean scores in the 1950s were
the lowest scores of the three time periods for both quantitative and qualitative results;
however the quantitative results showed a trend with rising positive scores through the
time periods (see Figure 12) while the qualitative results showed a large increase from the
1950s to the 1980s and then a small decline in mean scores from the 1980s to the 2000s
(see Figure 13).
In openness to experience, the quantitative results showed a trend with rising
positive scores through the time periods. The quantitative results started with the lowest
score of the time periods in the 1950s (M = 1.53 with SD = 1.28), increased to a higher
mean score in the 1980s (M = 2.64 with SD = 0.82) and then increased even further in the

146
2000s to the highest mean score (M = 4.31 with SD = 1.41). The qualitative results also
started with the lowest score of the time periods in the 1950s (M = 0.84 with SD = 1.01)
then, like the quantitative results, increased even higher in the 1980s (M = 2.77 with SD =
1.65) and then, unlike the quantitative results, decreased slightly in the 2000s (M = 2.49
with SD = 0.62). The descriptive language positively associated with openness to
experience supported the positive results in both the quantitative and qualitative results,
but showed a different pattern, high in the 1950s, low in the 1980s, and high again in the
2000s.
Looking at the quantitative openness to experience scores, there was a statistically
significant difference between time periods as determined by one-way ANOVA (F(2,32)
= 15.74, p =.000, effect size = .50) The effect size was large. A Games-Howell post-hoc
test revealed that the 1980s were statistically significantly higher than the 1950s at a level
of 1.11 (p = .038), the 2000s were statistically significantly higher than the 1980s at a
level of 1.67 (p = .014), and the 2000s were statistically significantly higher than the
1950s at a level of 2.78 (p = .000).
Looking at the qualitative openness to experience scores, there was a statistically
significant difference between time periods as determined by one-way ANOVA (F(2,32)
= 6.86, p =.003, effect size = .30) The effect size was large. A Tukey HSD post-hoc test
revealed that the 1980s were statistically significantly higher than the 1950s at a level of
1.93 (p = .005) and the 2000s were statistically significantly higher than the 1950s at a
level of 1.65 (p = .022).There were no statistically significant differences between the
1980s and the 2000s (p = .891).

147
What explained this upward trend in openness to experience in the time periods
studied: the 1950s, the 1980s, and the 2000s? One explanation involved changes in
American culture with a likely effect on children. Picture books reflect changes in culture
(Kortenhaus & Demarest, 1993; Martinez & McGee, 2000; Murray, 1998; Sipe &
Pantaleo, 2008; Weitzman, et al., 1972). The upward trend in openness to experience
scores over the decades reflected changes in the culture, the world, and the day-to-day
way of life available to American children. Imagination was one of the traits used on the
Big Five Mini-Markers instrument that positively indicated openness to experience.
Quantitative data on the trait of imagination had good intercoder reliability and followed
the same trend as the quantitative data for the factor of openness to experience. The
experience of imagination changed for the young characters in these picture books as
they moved through the decades. Outdoor play decreased over the time periods as did
character interaction with nature. Adult supervision of children increased dramatically in
the lives of the young characters depicted in the books studied across the three time
periods.
In the picture books of the 1950s, young characters were pictured outdoors with
no adult supervision. In Time of Wonder, two young sisters explored the New England
coastal area. They were pictured exploring the shoreline, sailing, in a rowboat exploring
with a flashlight at night (See Figure 14), and many other explorations and adventures.
They were usually outdoors and they were not supervised by adults. In an even more
extreme example, Johnny, the young main character in the story The Biggest Bear, was
determined to go out in the woods by himself and shoot a bear (see Figure 15). He found
and befriended a bear cub; when the bear cub grew up and became a nuisance, Johnny

148
was responsible for keeping the bear away from the family farm and the community.
Throughout the book Johnny was alone in the woods or in the woods with his bear. Adult
supervision was evident only in providing the guidance Johnny needed to understand the
bear had become not only a nuisance, but a threat to the survival of the family, and must
be removed, or killed if that was the only recourse left. In both books, the young
characters were depicted as comfortable with and knowledgeable about nature and the
outdoors. They also exhibited many skills useful for enjoying nature. Characters were
pictured rowing a boat and exploring forested areas. The sisters also demonstrated
abilities in sailing, swimming, and helping to prepare for a hurricane. Johnny, in The
Biggest Bear, demonstrated ability to use firearms, to do outdoor chores on the family
farm, and to take responsibility for his pet bear when the bear becomes a threat to the
family farm and the community.

In the 1980s, when young characters were pictured in outdoor scenes, the scenes
were often imaginary and had a sinister undertone (see Figure 16 and Figure 17).
Although parental supervision was depicted, there was a lack of such supervision in the
outdoor adventures. In Jumanji, a brother and sister were left at home unsupervised while
their parents went to the opera. The young characters discovered a board game in the park
and brought it home. Playing the game resulted in multiple imaginary, dangerous, and
often sinister, adventures in their home. After dealing with a lion, monkeys, monsoon
season, sleeping sickness, a rhinoceros stampede, a python, and a volcanic eruption (see

151
Figure 16), they finally reached the end of the game and returned it to the park. They did
not exhibit comfort level, knowledge or skill when dealing with the various adventures,
but rather concentrated on finishing the game quickly. In The Polar Express, the
unnamed young main character caught an imaginary late night train to the North Pole.
The North Pole was pictured as a 19th century, somewhat sinister, industrial city (see
Figure 17). Santa Claus gave him the first gift of Christmas, a magic bell. Although he
lost it on the way home, it appeared, with a note from Santa Claus, on Christmas Day.
The forests the train passed on the way to the North Pole were snowy and pictured with
wolves; nature was not comfortable or friendly in the story.

In the picture books studied from the 2000s, the adventures are often imaginary
and far more elaborate and fantastic than the imaginary adventures of the 1980s. The
young characters were usually depicted as well-supervised by adults in the real world. In
The Hello, Goodbye Window, the young main character was not only supervised by her
grandparents, but had a wonderful relationship with them that included many adventures
and much play. The main character in The Invention of Hugo Cabret demonstrated the
importance of positive and supportive adult supervision in the lives of young characters.
Hugo, the main character, was introduced as an unhappy, unsupervised child forced to
fend for himself, do an adult job, steal, and dodge the authorities and the threat of jail in
order to survive. Through flashbacks the reader discovered that Hugo was once a normal,
happy child with a father who provided loving and supportive supervision. After his
father died, Hugo’s uncle took him out of school, mistreated him, forced him into doing
much of the uncle’s job as well as forced him into stealing. After the uncle died Hugo

153
was unhappily fending for himself. His friend, Isabelle, was over-supervised by a
guardian who was secretive and cautious about many things that Isabelle enjoyed, like
movies. At the end of the book Hugo and Isabelle were both happily supervised by
Isabelle’s guardians who found the right amount of supervision, support and love to
provide so that the young characters flourished.
In Flotsom, the unnamed young main character was supervised by both parents as
he enjoyed an interesting, although somewhat ordinary, isolated set of experiences on the
beach in the summer. Then he discovered a camera washed up on shore that propelled
him into highly imaginative, elaborate, fantastic adventures (see Figure 18).
The unnamed main young character in House in the Night was shown coming
home with her parents in the evening. Around the routine, loving activities in the bedtime
preparation, the young character had a highly imaginative outdoor adventure flying
through a whimsical night scene on the back of a bird (see Figure 19).

In the 1950s, the young characters in the picture books studied had great real-life,
outdoors adventures. They were comfortable with, knowledgeable about, and highly
skilled in their interactions with the natural world. There was little adult supervision even
when exploring at night in a boat (see Figure 14) or heading out into the woods with a
rifle to hunt for bear (see Figure 15). There were, however, few imaginative adventures.
In the 1980s, the young characters had imaginary outdoor adventures and the outdoors
was depicted as a sinister, dangerous, and uncomfortable environment. There was limited
adult supervision. In the 2000s the young characters had elaborate, even fantastic outdoor
adventures, but they were entirely imaginary. Adult supervision in the 2000s was
depicted as constant and necessary. In one book, The Invention of Hugo Cabret, positive
adult supervision was presented as necessary to the happy, positive development of
children.

156
The academic literature reports a growing gap between nature and children. Many
developments have contributed to the gap including “poor urban design, disappearing
open space, parental fear of ‘stranger danger,’ amplified news cycles and sensationalized
entertainment media, competition from computers and video games, the overstructuring
of childhood, and the devaluing of natural play” (Louv, 2009, p. 26-27). Studies have
reported that children have much less time for outdoor play than they did a few decades
ago. Parental concerns about safety, structured after-school activities, and lack of recess
time at school all contribute to the lack of outdoor play in children’s lives (Kalish, Banco,
Burke, & Lapidus, 2010; Louv, 2009; McBride, 2012; Tandon et al., 2012). Access to
media and technology has changed dramatically for children in the last several decades;
television, music, computers, and handheld devices, provide a vast array of media
opportunities for children and take up time that children once used playing outdoors.
Children and youth have been targeted as a consumer market for media (Roberts &
Foehr, 2008). The significant changes in extroversion and openness to experience over
the three time periods studied reflected these changes in American society.
Research Question 3:
How are the personality factors of young characters in Caldecott Award winning picture
books differentiated by gender in three different time periods: the 1950s, the 1980s, and
the 2000s?
One of the major purposes of this study was to look for and explore differences by
gender overall and in the three time periods in the picture books studied. Based on
information gleaned in the academic literature, differences by gender were expected,
especially for the female characters, and especially from the 1950s to the 1980s. It was

157
surprising to find there were no statistically significant differences by gender, no
statistically significant differences in gender over the decades, and no interaction effect
with gender and time periods in the analysis of the quantitative and the qualitative
findings.
Qualitative data determined some of the gender stereotypical behaviors and
attitudes identified in the academic literature were present in the picture books studied. In
one picture book, Saint George and the Dragon, gender contrast was evident throughout
the book. The male character was engaged in brave, bold, rescuing behavior while the
female character was engaged in fearful, gentle, nurturing behavior (See Outliers As A
Result of the Use of Contrast in Picture Books in Outliers in Chapter IV: Results &
Analysis). One book with an historical setting, Ox Cart Man, repeatedly modeled
division of labor by gender. Several of the books with historical settings showed female
characters in clothing that restricted movement. Weitzman, et al. (1972) identified
clothing that restricted movement as a gender issue. The descriptive language showed
that female characters were more often described by physical appearance. The word
beautiful was used 11 times in describing two female characters in two different picture
books; the word lovely and/or lovelier was used three times to describe two characters in
two different books; the word fair was used to describe a female character; the phrase,
splendidly dressed, was used to describe a female character. Male characters were not
described by physical appearance.

158
Implications
The results of this study have implications for parents and educators who assist
young children in choosing picture books and who read picture books with young
children. The young characters in picture books serve as models for young children at a
time in their lives when they are impressionable, vulnerable and not yet capable of
critical literary analysis (Diekman & Murnen, 2004; Marshall, G., 1975; Nilsen, 1971;
Oskamp et al., 1996; Pelletier & Astingtom, 2004; Pike et al., 2010; Spitz, 1999). Picture
books also reflect culture and cultural ideals (Mattix & Sobolak, 2014; McCabe et al.,
2011; Murray, 1998; Zipes, 2001) and can reflect changes in culture (Kortenhaus &
Demarest, 1993; Martinez & McGee, 2000; Murray, 1998; Sipe & Pantaleo, 2008;
Weitzman, et al., 1972). Some picture books, still readily available, reflect the culture and
cultural ideals of an earlier time. For example, in Time of Wonder, written and set in the
1950s, two young sisters are depicted exploring the shoreline, sailing, and out in a
rowboat exploring with a flashlight at night unsupervised. In another book written in the
1950s, The Biggest Bear, Johnny, the young main character, is frequently pictured with a
rifle, often out in the woods, unsupervised. Preschool children who choose these or
similar books to read may need additional background information to understand that
some of the behaviors modeled in these books are not appropriate in the current time
period. It is likely that other practices, values, and mores depicted in certain picture books
may need adult intervention in terms of providing context, literary analysis, and
discussion when reading the book with a young child. Parents and educators may also
consider the personality of the young characters in terms of what might appeal to the
young child choosing a picture book.

159
Educators choosing picture books for school libraries and classroom collections
need to carefully consider what is modeled in the book before making choices. Educators
using picture books in instruction may need to carefully consider the cultural standards,
the cultural ideals, and cultural change that may be reflected in the books as part of
instructional planning. Carefully selected collections of picture books are rich in
psychological, developmental, and cultural potential when used in an instructional
program. Educators may want to routinely include literary analysis and bibliotherapy in
picture book instruction (see Practical Importance of the Study in Chapter I: Introduction;
see Bibliotherapy in Chapter II: Literature Review).
The results of this study also have implications for the educators involved in
research. This study, for the first time, examined the portrayal of the whole personality of
young characters in picture books, using a standard personality measure. There had been
calls in the literature for such a study (Kingston & Lovelace, 1977; Singh & Lu, 2003).
The quantitative and qualitative aspects of this study found a similar and consistent whole
personality for the young characters in the picture books studied and statistically
significant changes in two of the five personality factors studied over the time periods
considered. This study, however, was limited to young characters in picture books and to
a small selection of picture books from just three decades. Research examining characters
of all ages, in picture books from many time periods, and considering multiple
demographic aspects of characters is needed. Singh and Lu (2003) suggest that an
understanding of the complexity of characters in children’s literature requires an
understanding of the whole personality; “heroes and heroines in good literature are
portrayed as complex individuals, so it is necessary to analyze them in a holistic manner

160
by paying special attention to the interplay of both positive and negative traits” (Singh &
Lu, 2003, p.2). It is critical that educational researchers examine the whole personality of
characters in picture books so that the findings of their studies may inform and influence
those in the home and the school using this powerful tool to help children achieve their
potential.
Limitations
Sample Size
One of the limitations of this study was the small sample size. The subjects of the
study were young characters, both child-and-youth-aged human characters and child-andyouth-aged humanized animal characters, in the Caldecott Award winning picture books
from the 1950s, the 1980s, and the 2000s. Only characters with adequate behavioral
information to determine personality traits using the Big Five Mini-Markers, the
instrument used in the quantitative portion of the study, were included. Of the 30
Caldecott Award winning books from the three decades studied, 21 books had young
characters with the needed adequate behavioral information for the study. Within those
21 books, there were 35 young characters who were the subjects of the study. The
analysis by time periods was based on data collected on 14 characters from the 1950s, 11
characters from the 1980s and 10 characters from the 2000s. The analysis by gender was
based on 18 female characters and 16 male characters. The findings for Research
Question 3 were plagued by ever smaller sample sizes. As the data differentiated by
gender were further broken down to analyze gender across the time periods studied, the
sample sizes got small to the point that it was difficult to determine meaningful statistical
analysis.

161
Caldecott Award Winning Picture Books Are Not a Random Selection
The Caldecott Award winning picture books are not a random selection and are
not likely to be representative of picture books (Dougherty & Engel, 1987; Williams, J.
A. et al., 1987). Other choices of book selections might be more representative, an
example being best-selling picture books from Publisher’s Weekly. The Caldecott Award
winners were chosen because they are likely to be influential for a large number of
children for a long period of time (Dougherty & Engel, 1987; Nilsen, 1971).
Time Periods
The books chosen for this study were limited to three decades, the 1950s, the
1980s, and the 2000s. Although the three decades were carefully chosen and statistically
significant changes were found across time periods for two of the Big Five Factors, they
provide only a small selection of young characters. This small selection of young
characters in only three short time periods limited ability to see broad ranges of patterns.
A study by McCabe, et al., 2011, looked at the gender of central characters and gender
apparent in titles of picture books. The study looked at over 5,000 picture books
published over the entire 20th century. Their study found that using “multiple types of
books across a long time period shows that change toward gender equality is uneven,
nonlinear, and tied to patterns of feminist activism and backlash throughout the century”
(p. 226).
Instrument
The personality traits used in the Big Five Mini-Markers (Saucier, 1994), the
standardized personality instrument used in the quantitative portion of this study, were
meant to describe adults and may result in less accurate scores when used for children.

162
Potential Bias of Researcher and Coder
The researcher’s and the coder’s beliefs, cultural background, gender, gender
assumptions, and feminist stances were variables that may have affected the research
process in this study (Harding, 1987; Gottfried, 1996; Reinharz & Davidman, 1992).
Suggestions for Future Research
The results found using a small sample size suggested that expanding the study by
choosing the whole body of Caldecott Award winners from 1938 to the most recent
winner would provide clearer patterns and would find significant results for more factors.
The study might also be extended to include characters of all ages, perhaps using the
following age groups: children, youth, adults, and older adults. This broader sample
might yield more gender differences in personality factors as well as more definitive
trends over time periods.
The Caldecott Award winning picture books are not a random selection and are
not likely to be representative of picture books (Dougherty & Engel, 1987; Williams, J.
A. et al., 1987). Other choices of book selections might be more representative. For
example, a more representative selection might be based on lists of best-selling picture
books. The New York Times and Publisher’s Weekly both publish such lists. Several
researchers investigating gender issues in picture books, including Goodroe (1998) and
Hamilton et al. (2006) have used such lists. Little Golden Books have enjoyed a long
period of popularity and have been available to a larger segment of American society.
They have also been used in picture book gender research (Weitzman et al., 1972;
McCabe et al., 2011).

163
As a quality control measure, recommended lists of picture books from reputable
sources such as The American Library Association or one of its divisions, or Children’s
Catalog, or The Reading Teacher, might be a source for selection of picture books.
Several researchers used such sources to choose books for picture book gender research
(McCabe et al., 2011; St. Peter, 1979; Tetenbaum & Pearson, 1989).
Recommendations
Educators have a responsibility to choose, introduce, and share picture books with
young children carefully, with a full understanding of the psychological, cultural and
developmental power that those books have over children. Young children are exposed to
the power of picture books when they are impressionable, vulnerable and not yet capable
of critical literary analysis (Diekman & Murnen, 2004; Marshall, 1975; Nilsen, 1971;
Oskamp et al., 1996; Pelletier & Astingtom, 2004; Pike et al., 2010; Spitz, 1999) and yet
picture books are especially powerful because they combine the power of words and
pictures and they transfer the positive emotions contained in the reading situation to the
cultural message of the picture book (Bader, 1976; Jalongo, 2004; Kiefer, 2008; Kitchen,
2000; Oskamp et al., 1996; Spitz, 1999; Worland, 2008). Children identify with the
characters in the picture books, sometimes through the personality of the characters, and
that identification allows them to acquire ideas and emotions, conscious and unconscious,
that promote developmental growth and teach social and cultural constructs, including
stereotypes (Bader, 1976; Bettelheim, 1975; Diekman & Murnen, 2004; Marshall, 1975;
Nilsen, 1971; Spitz, 1999; Tatar, 1992).
Educators choose picture books for classroom collections and choose picture
books to be used in instruction. A greater understanding of the potential use of picture

164
books in the psychological, developmental, and cultural, as well as the academic realms,
of the educational setting would help individual children as well as help provide a more
enlightened classroom environment (Honig, 1998; Hynes & Hynes-Berry, 1986; Marrs,
1995; McCulliss, 2012; Rubin, 1978). Educators help individual children choose picture
books for personal use. An understanding of the whole personalities of the characters in
picture books has the potential to help educators gain insight into the identification
children feel with certain characters in picture books. Increased pre-service and in-service
training in the appropriate selection and use of picture books to help children deal with
social problems, become more effective problem-solvers, and develop positive selfconcept would be a valuable use of training time (Bernstein, 1977; Catalano, 2008;
Hynes & Hynes-Berry, 1986; McCullis, 2012; Morawski, 2006; Olsen, 1975).
Conclusion
The purpose of this study was to determine and explore the whole personality of
young characters in Caldecott Award winning picture books from three time periods: the
1950s, the 1980s, and the 2000s. The quantitative and qualitative aspects of the study
found a similar and consistent whole personality for the young characters in the picture
books studied that can be described using the Big Five Personality Factors. Researchers
have suggested that picture books may reflect our culture and our cultural ideals (Murray,
1998; Zipes, 2001) and that seemed to be the case for four out of the five personality
factors; scores for the factors were positive and the factors are clearly valued by
American society. Emotional stability was the one factor where the many young
characters with negative scores and the mean scores close to zero did not reflect the high
value placed on emotional stability in American society. The plots of many of the stories

165
required negative emotional stability in order to navigate the exciting, extreme
circumstances. The emotional stability scores were not expected.
There were statistically significant differences in the time periods for two of the
Big Five Personality Factors, extroversion and openness to experience. Researchers have
suggested that picture books not only reflect our culture, but also reflect changes in our
culture (Kortenhaus & Demarest, 1993; Martinez & McGee, 2000; Murray, 1998; Sipe &
Pantaleo, 2008; Weitzman et al., 1972). The differences in openness to experience and
extroversion reflected changes in culture and changes in the lives of children. Several
striking changes evident in the time periods studied may well be related to changes in
extroversion and openness to experience. The use of media, especially television, had
exploded into the lives of children in the time periods studied. The striking decline in
extroversion scores corresponds to the increase in children’s access to media, especially
television. A steady increase in adult supervision, across the decades studied, was evident
in the picture books. The relationship between children and nature had changed. The
literature reported a growing gap between nature and children, less value placed on
natural play, and a lack of outdoor play in children’s lives (Kalish et al., 2010; Louv,
2009; McBride, 2012; Tandon et al., 2012). In the 1950s, young characters in the picture
books studied were knowledgeable about and comfortable with nature, spending much
time outdoors. In the 1980s, the young characters had imaginary outdoor adventures, but
nature was portrayed as uncomfortable and even sinister. In the 2000s, the young
characters enjoyed highly imaginative outdoor adventures, but few unsupervised real
outdoor adventures. There were differences in personality between genders; however,
those differences were not statistically significant in the quantitative study or the

166
qualitative study, although the factor of agreeableness had a moderate effect size in both
the quantitative and qualitative results. There was no effect by gender, no statistically
significant differences in gender across decades, and no interaction effect with gender
and time periods. Gender differences were expected across the time periods studied; the
changes that seem to reflect changes in our culture were not anticipated or expected.
A greater understanding of the total personalities of the young characters in
picture books has the potential to help educators in selecting books for classroom
collections, creating meaningful instruction for young students, and providing a more
enlightened classroom environment (Honig, 1998; Hynes & Hynes-Berry, 1986; Marrs,
1995; McCulliss, 2012; Rubin, 1978).

Personality Traits of Young Characters in Caldecott Award Winning Picture Books from
Three Time Periods: 1950s, 1980s, and 2000s
Summary of Study
The present study employs a mixed methods design using content analysis to
describe the total personality of young characters in picture books from three decades, the
1950s, the 1980s, and the 2000s. The picture books chosen for the study are the Caldecott
Medal winning books from the three time periods.
Children are introduced to picture books at about the same time that they undergo
gender socialization, from around age two until around age seven. At this age children do
not yet have the evaluative skills to critically assess the social constructs contained in the
books (Murray, 1998; Spitz, 1999).
The American feminist movement of the 1970s was concerned about the portrayal
of girls and women in literature. Many scholarly studies in that time period analyzed the
portrayal of male and female characters in picture books, sometimes considering
masculine and feminine personality characteristics. Feminist groups and publishers
established guidelines to help authors avoid gender stereotypical portrayals in children’s
literature. This study will investigate one decade before the 1970s and two decades after
the 1970s.
The whole personality of the young characters will be described using the Big
Five personality factors. The personality factors will be differentiated by gender and time

197
period. Saucier’s Mini-Markers, an adjective checklist, is the instrument used in the
quantitative portion of the study.
What Are the Aims and Objectives of the Study?
•

Look for changes in the depiction of the personality of the young characters in
Caldecott Medal winning books between three time periods: the 1950s, the 1980s,
and the 2000s.

•

Discover if there is differentiation by gender in the depiction of the personality of
the young characters in Caldecott Medal winning books between three time
periods: the 1950s, the 1980s, and the 2000s.

•

Expansion of the knowledge base about models and messages contained in picture
books to provide a fuller and more accurate concept of models and social
messages that influence our children and our society
Why Big Five Personality Factors?
Across several decades, five recurring personality factors have emerged as

consistently replicable (Borgatta, 1964; Digman & Takemoto-Chock, 1981; Goldberg,
1990; Goldberg, 1992; John, Angleitner, & Ostendorf, 1988; Norman, 1963; Tupes &
Christal, 1961) and meaningful as a structure for classification and comparison of
personality in a variety of contexts (Barrick & Mount, 1991; Digman, 1990).
The five factors are: “(I) Surgency (or Extraversion), (II) Agreeableness, (III)
Conscientiousness (or Dependability), (IV) Emotional Stability (vs. Neuroticism), and
(V) Culture” (Goldberg, 1990, p. 1217).
The instrument used in this study is an adaptation of Goldberg’s Unipolar BigFive Markers, the Mini-Markers, developed by Saucier in 1994. The Mini-Markers

198
consist of 40 adjectives, eight for each of the Big Five Factors. The response scale is a 9point Likert scale ranging from 1 (extremely accurate) to 9 (extremely inaccurate)with
the option of a response of “0” to indicate insufficient information to rate the trait. The
Mini-Markers were developed to provide a tool that could be completed quickly and that
used adjectives that were easily understandable (Saucier, 1994).
Why Caldecott Award winning books?
After winning the influential Caldecott Medal, books generally reach a wide
audience over a period of many years. These books have been used for many of the
studies of picture books, including the seminal 1972 Weitzman et al. study (Crisp &
Hiller, 2011; Kingston & Lovelace, 1977; Kolbe & LaVoie, 1981; Weitzman, et. al.,
1972).

199

Why time periods: 1950s, 1980s, and 2000s?
One of the concerns of the feminist movement of the 1970s was the portrayal of
women in the media and several feminist groups included the portrayal of girls and
women in children’s literature as part of that investigation. Many scholarly studies
analyzed the portrayal of male and female characters in picture books. Generally the
studies found that female characters were underrepresented and significant numbers of
characters were portrayed in stereotypical fashion, including stereotypically gendered
personality traits (Allen & Allen, 1993; Crabb and Marciano, 2011; Crisp & Hiller, 2011;
Dellmann-Jenkins, 1993; Dougherty & Engel, 1987; Kolbe and LaVoie, 1981;
Kortenhaus & Demarest, 1993; Nilsen, 1971; Weitzman, Ross, Eifler and Hokada, 1972).
During the 1970s, feminist groups and publishers established guidelines to help authors
avoid gender stereotypical portrayals in children’s literature (Kingston & Lovelace, 1977;
Pyle, 1976; Turner-Bowker, 1996). The present study will determine a standardized total
personality measure of the young characters, differentiated by gender, as depicted in
Caldecott Award winning picture books, during three decades, one decade prior to the
1970s and two decade after the 1970s. Picture books from the 2000s will provide
information reflecting the new millennium. This will provide a new and valuable look at
a more holistic concept of the personality of the child, how that concept is differentiated
by gender and how that concept changed over a specific time period when gender issues
in children’s literature were prominent in scholarly literature and in the publishing world.

What Are Some of the Coding Issues and Guidelines?
One of the guiding principles of content analysis is the concept of manifest content.
The concept of manifest content “means the apparent content, which means that content
must be coded as it appears rather than as the content analyst feels it is intended”
(Stemple, Weaver, & Wilhoit, 2003, p. 210). Controversy has arisen around this concept
for two main reasons. Some researchers feel that the author of the content
(communicator) intends to communicate something other than the face value of the
content and sometimes researchers feel that the content to be analyzed does not reflect
reality. However, to maintain objectivity the content must be studied and analyzed at
face value.
A related concept from picture book theory is the idea that the combination of
text, illustration and the interaction of the text and illustration provide a unique vehicle
that allows the reader to come away with a whole experience that is more than the sum of
the parts (Kiefer, 1995).
Theory in content analysis and in picture books both emphasize the importance of
using the whole book in the research; cover, back cover, end papers, title page may all
have messages important to the research.
Complex factors, including facial expression, body language, interactions
between characters, elements in the setting, are part of determining the personality traits
of the characters in picture books.

201

What is the role of the coders in the study?
The coders will complete the quantitative part of the study using a selection of
Caldecott honor books for the 1950s, the 1980s, and the 2000s, that have well-developed
young characters. They will provide valuable information about their experience of the
coding process that will be used in designing the qualitative portion of the research
design. Their work will also be used to establish the reliability of the instrument.
Information collected about the coders will be used to establish their qualifications for
participation in the study. The anonymity of the coders will be protected.

APPENDIX C
DEFINITIONS OF ADJECTIVES USED IN SAUCIER’S MINI-MARKERS TO
DETERMINE THE BIG FIVE FACTORS OF PERSONALITY
Most personality trait research is based on the “fundamental lexical hypothesis”
(Goldberg, 1990, p. 1216):

that natural language provides a complete list of personality

descriptive terms. In recent decades long lists of personality descriptive adjectives have
been reduced, using empirical methods, to small numbers of personality factors. Five
recurring personality factors have emerged as consistently replicable and meaningful as a
structure for classification and comparison of personality in a variety of contexts (Barrack &
Mount, 1991; Borgatta, 1964; Digman, 1990; Digman & Takemoto-Chock, 1981; Goldberg, 1990;Goldberg, 1992; John, Angleitner,
& Ostendorf, 1988; Norman, 1963; Tupes &Christal, 1961).

“Those individual differences that are most salient and socially relevant in people’s lives
will eventually become encoded into their language; the more important such a
difference, the more likely is it to become expressed as a single word.” (John, Angleitner, &
Ostendorf, 1988, p.174).
