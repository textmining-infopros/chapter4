Abstract
Making it Matters: Makerspaces’ Impact on Creativity in an Elementary School Media
Center. Austin, Janet Blair, 2017: Dissertation, Gardner-Webb University, Makerspaces/
Creativity/Elementary School Media Center/21st Century Learning
This mixed-methods action research study investigated the impact of makerspaces on
student creativity. Seventy fifth-grade students were exposed to makerspaces for 12
weeks. Quantitative data were collected using two assessment instruments. Prior to the
experience, the students were given a preassessment of their creative potential using the
Torrance Test of Creative Thinking (TTCT). After 12 weeks, students were given a
postassessment using a different form. A paired sample t test was used to analyze the pre
and posttest results. In addition, teachers were asked to evaluate student creativity by
completing the creativity portion of the Scales for Rating the Behavior Characteristics of
Superior Students (SRBCSS). Qualitative data were collected from an open-ended
questionnaire completed by the teachers. The questionnaire was used to determine the
teacher perceptions of student experiences with makerspaces related to creativity.
The results of the pre- and post-TTCT were analyzed. The t test showed a significant
gain in the mean score for the target group with the exclusion of one outlier score. The
results of the Pearson’s R analysis compared student TTCT posttests with teacher
rankings of individual students on the SRBCSS. The analysis showed a positive
correlation. An open-ended questionnaire was completed by the teachers and coded for
themes. The data were coded using Tesch’s Eight Steps for coding information. The
coding resulted in three themes related to creativity in makerspaces: communication,
engagement, and motivation. The data allowed the researcher to determine if
makerspaces in an elementary school media center had a positive influence on student
creative growth.

Chapter 1: Introduction
School libraries around the world are changing (Fleming, 2015; Kuhlthau, 2010).
“Global interconnectedness enabled by information technology calls for new skills,
knowledge, and ways of learning to prepare students for living and working in the 21st
century” (Kuhlthau, 2010, p. 1). According to Robinson and Aronica (2015), many
conventional aspects of schooling have been rethought and repurposed. One of the most
conventional parts of many schools has been the traditional library. Through the years,
some schools have renamed these spaces as media centers to include technology and
other resources beyond printed books. Increased access to digital media through
technology has been a driving change in the function and use of the school library.
Increasing numbers of electronic books and other digital media have lessened the need
for brick and mortar spaces as storehouses for books (Stanley, 2011). There are now new
purposes for common areas in schools such as libraries, media centers, cafeterias,
atriums, and foyers. These areas are now being used to meet the creative needs of
students in the 21st century (Fleming, 2015; Stanley, 2011). As part of the change in the
purpose and use of media centers, makerspaces have been appearing in schools across the
United States (Canino-Fluit, 2014; Fleming, 2015; Hlubinka et al. 2013; Maker Media,
2016).
Background
Makerspaces and the Maker Movement. The researcher explored the impact of
spaces within educational settings known as makerspaces. The people using the spaces
have been referred to as makers. Makerspaces in schools are spaces where students have
opportunities to explore, build, make, use tools, and develop creative projects (Fleming,
2015). Projects range from simple to complex. Some makerspaces involve highly

2
technological machinery and equipment, while other spaces provide everyday items such
as crayons, cardboard, and masking tape. Makerspaces first began gaining notoriety
around 2006 (Canino-Fluit, 2014; Martinez & Stager, 2013). They began as part of a
larger phenomenon in our society known as the Maker Movement. It was about this time
when school media coordinators and librarians began noticing the trend and started
implementing makerspaces in school settings (Canino-Fluit, 2014). The purpose of this
study focused on a makerspace within an elementary school media center. To begin, it is
important to understand the broader context of makerspaces to have a better
understanding of the implications of this work.
Makerspace interest grew out of what has been called the Maker Movement
(Maker Media, 2016). Several key events led to thousands of makerspaces emerging in
public and private spaces throughout the United States (Fleming, 2015). In 2006, Maker
Media began as a global networking site created to connect all kinds of makers with each
other to provide support. According to their website, “Maker Media serves a growing
community of makers who bring a DIY mindset to technology. Whether as hobbyists or
professionals, makers are creative, resourceful, and curious, developing projects that
demonstrate how they can interact with the world around them” (Maker Media, 2016,
para. 1). Around this same time, Maker Media began publishing Make Magazine which
has become an important communication tool for the movement. In 2006, the first Maker
Faire was said to spark the worldwide Maker Movement which continues to influence
innovation and education (Maker Media, 2016).
In 2009, the movement was recognized when President Obama launched the
Educate to Innovate Initiative. Through focus on science, technology, engineering, and
mathematics (STEM) subjects, the president urged students to become makers. “Every

3
child, a maker” became the slogan of the president in terms of this initiative (The White
House, 2016, para. 1). The focus of this program was to encourage young people and
adults to design and build on their own (The White House, 2016).
The momentum of the Maker Movement found its way into both public and
private entities. Many businesses, libraries, museums, community centers, churches, and
schools all over the United States have gotten involved with makerspaces (Peppler &
Bender, 2013). The movement emphasized several key ideas. First, it helped individuals
to hone skills that are important for survival in the future: creativity, innovation, problem
solving, and collaboration (Peppler & Bender, 2013). It has also provided opportunities
for learning and self-expression within a community environment (Bevan, Gutwill,
Petrich, & Wilkinson, 2014). Additionally, the Maker Movement facilitated the
development of important technical, artistic, and mechanical skills needed for the future
workforce of our nation (Tierney, 2015).
Maker Faires are events associated with the Maker Movement. These are
gatherings of makers in festivals or conventions held to showcase the creations of the
participants. Make Magazine sponsors and hosts these regularly across the country
(Hlubinka et al., 2013). In 2012, a Maker Faire was held in San Mateo, California with
about 120,000 participants. Mini-Maker Faires are held in smaller communities, while
larger cities host bigger events. These smaller Maker Faires have also grown (Hlubinka
et al., 2013). The projects at a Maker Faire vary widely in scale and scope. President
Obama supported such endeavors. During the launch of his Educate to Innovate
campaign to improve STEM education, the president spoke of his support. Kalil (2012)
cited the President’s words:
I want us all to think about new and creative ways to engage young people in

4
science and engineering, whether it's science festivals, robotics competitions, fairs
that encourage young people to create and build and invent—to be makers of
things, not just consumers of things. (para. 4)
The role of creativity. Makerspaces are places where creativity can be explored
by giving makers opportunities to express their ideas in a hands-on fashion as he or she
makes things (Bowler, 2014). To provide opportunities for the nurturance and
development of students’ creative potential, spaces for open-ended exploration may play
a key role. School libraries and media centers have become places where opportunities
for creative expression happen. The opportunity to develop creative potential is
important because creativity as a personal attribute has become a desirable and lucrative
characteristic (Florida, 2007). Creativity has become an economic commodity in the 21st
century (Benton, Mullins, Shelley, & Dempsey, 2013; Florida, 2007). Business, industry,
and society in general need creative thinkers to face challenges and opportunities of the
future (Florida, 2007). The rise of the creative class in the 21st century refers to those
people in society who make their living through endeavors that involve creative energy
(Florida, 2007). The age of knowledge and information for which schools have tried to
prepare students has rapidly turned into an age of new conceptualization and creativity
(Pink, 2006). If we follow the trends of recent years, it is possible many of the jobs our
children will have in the future do not even exist yet. Technological knowledge has
exploded exponentially during the past several decades, and creative thinkers are needed
to know what to do with it (Pink, 2006). With the increased demand for creativity in our
society, it is important for educators to understand exactly what creativity is and how it
impacts our students. Makerspaces relate to this because these are potential places in
schools for creativity to be nurtured.

5
Statement of the Problem
The United States educational system is faced with the problem of preparing
students for a future of great uncertainty. Cornish (2004) referred to this uncertainty as
“The Great Transformation” (p. 9). Cornish wrote,
We begin to sense the existence of the Great Transformation as we notice the
rapid changes in our lives: new technologies, new buildings, and new lifestyles. It
is not simply that human life is changing, but that it is changing extremely fast.
(p. 10)
Technology, the economy, and social institutions have experienced this rapid change
phenomenon; and it has influenced all aspects of life, especially how people live and
work (Cornish, 2014). The economic stability of the United States depends on
entrepreneurial innovation (Benton et al., 2013; Cox, 2009; Ross, 2016). Studies
reported by Benton et al. (2013) found that the United States ranked behind other
countries in several areas including global innovation-based competitiveness.
Robinson and Aronica (2015) noted the problem in education related to this is
the fact that public education reflects an industrial model that is far outdated.
The issue in a nutshell is this: most of the developed countries did not have mass
systems of public education much before the middle of the nineteenth century.
These systems were developed in large part to meet the labor needs of the
Industrial Revolution and they are organized on the principles of mass production.
The standards movement is allegedly focused on making these systems more
efficient and accountable. The problem is that these systems are inherently
unsuited to the wholly different circumstances of the twenty-first century.
(Robinson & Aronica, 2015, p. xxiii)

6
Since 1965, the population of the world has doubled to more than seven billion,
and the numbers are rising. As this has happened, the amounts of technologies and
means of communication have also risen. According to Robinson and Aronica (2015),
this is only the beginning. “The old systems of education were not designed with this
world in mind. Improving them by rising to conventional standards will not meet the
challenges we now face” (Robinson & Aronica, 2015, p. xxiii).
A study by Lichtenstein, Lyons, and Kutzhanova (2004) noted seeking innovation
is of critical importance for the sustainability of our society. This study looked at the
trends of economic growth and development in communities nationwide. Enabling
innovation starts by supporting its development among our youngest students (Benton et
al., 2013). Makerspaces may be places where innovations can begin, because they are
places where makers can be creative and try new ideas.
Teachers have always known that to be successful, they must meet the needs of
students regardless of their background. This includes student needs to express
creativity. Not only is it important to understand where students come from but also to
have a clear vision of how they can succeed in the future (Robinson & Aronica, 2015).
In the era in which we live, this has not always been clear. Teaching practices are needed
that encourage creativity and innovative thinking to prepare students for the future.
Teachers and students must look toward trying new things to facilitate rich
conceptualization and creativity (Pink, 2006).
One of the ways creativity can be nurtured is by giving it an opportunity to grow.
This includes giving it space and opportunity in an environment where teachers and
students can do the work of creating (Robinson & Aronica, 2015). The Maker Movement
has grown out of this need to give makers a platform for creating (Maker Media, 2016).

7
This also applies to learners in the educational environment (Fleming, 2015).
Makerspaces in schools have been born as places where students can go to create, build,
make, and develop their own creative ideas into actual products (Fleming, 2015).
Making at school is about helping students to identify the problems they want to solve
and the things they want to create related to their own inquiry. Makerspaces are more
than just crafting corners. “By providing students with space and resources and inviting
them to experiment, we can empower them to think of themselves as something other
than consumers” (Canino-Fluit, 2014, p. 22).
Another very important aspect of makerspaces is the collaborative effect making
with others has on the learning process. Students learn from each other in sharing ideas
and tools (Britton, 2012). In addition to creativity, collaboration is a critical skill for 21st
century learners (Partnership for 21st Century Learning, 2016). Makerspaces give
students the opportunity to work with others. Together, alongside others, students work
on creative endeavors in an environment where collaboration is encouraged (Britton,
2012). When students have problems they cannot solve themselves, others in the
makerspace may share ideas and give suggestions. Students can work in community to
solve problems that are of interest to them. This process can be very motivational and
drive inquiry-based learning (Educause, 2013).
Makerspaces can be places where inquiry-based learning can occur and can be
fueled by creativity. Kuhlthau (2010) discussed the importance of inquiry in school
media centers. This connects to the problem this researcher investigated. “Educators
around the world are seeking ways to prepare students for living and working in the
changing information environment of the 21st century” (Kuhlthau 2010, p. 2). Kuhlthau
also noted the importance of the media center and the media coordinator in the

8
preparation of students for living and working in this new complex environment. The
role of the media coordinator is to facilitate “new ways of learning” (Kuhlthau, 2010, p.
2). Media coordinators can guide students through the inquiry process into much deeper
and more meaningful kinds of learning to engage, motivate, and challenge students
(Kuhlthau, 2010). Makerspaces are an avenue for increasing the opportunities for both
creativity and inquiry. This is because students solving creative problems can be guided
by the media coordinator or other teachers toward research and reference material that
support student exploration and acquiring new knowledge (Weisgrau, 2015). Curiosity
along with creativity may lead to new discoveries and innovations. The key issue
involved in this research is whether makerspaces help students to be more creative.
Purpose of the Study
The purpose of the study was to gauge the impact makerspaces had on the
development of creativity in elementary school students. Creativity has been identified
as one of the key learning skills needed for students to be successful in the 21st century
(Partnership for 21st Century Learning, 2016). According to Robinson and Aronica
(2015), schools need to help students cultivate their creativity to sustain a future that is
economically sound and environmentally sustainable. Makerspaces may inspire students
to pursue their own creative aspirations. “Innovation is fundamentally an inspired
activity, and the right environment has the potential to inspire new thoughts and
endeavors” (Kurti, Kurti, & Fleming, 2014, p. 8). This study was aimed at determining if
a makerspace in an elementary school media center could provide the opportunities and
resources for students to work in such a way that their ability to think creatively is
enhanced.

9
Significance of the Study
Makerspaces is a growing phenomenon in the United States. Schools have
embraced the model because of the potential there is for encouraging creativity in
students (Bevan, Petrich, & Wilkinson, 2014). According to Bevan, Petrich et al. (2014),
Maker activities may come across as playful, even slightly wacky, explosions of
inventiveness. But in education contexts like schools, museums, libraries, and
after-school programs, research shows that if the invitation to creativity is
accompanied by intentional structure and guidance, maker activities can be
channeled to support deep student learning. (p. 28)
Makerspaces are different from traditional arts and crafts or vocational programs because
the projects are driven by student interest and motivation within a community of makers
(Bevan, Petrich et al., 2014). Makers is the term given to the individuals who are focused
on making things (Hlubinka et al., 2013). The focus is on producing things rather than
consuming things (Hlubinka et al., 2013). Quite often, making involves recycling or
upcycling of materials once considered trash; therefore, it can have a positive
environmental effect as well (Hlubinka et al., 2013).
Makers are encouraged to follow their own inquiry toward developing ideas that
solve problems (Bevan, Petrich et al., 2014). Making is also done in a community.
Students work on their ideas in a setting where other makers are present (Hlubinka et al.,
2013). At times, the students may call on their peers for help, ideas, or suggestions. In
turn, they may offer their ideas to classmates. The Partnership for 21st Century Learning
(2016) recognized communication, collaboration, and critical thinking in addition to
creativity as important skills all students should cultivate. Makerspaces are settings that
facilitate these skills (Hlubinka et al., 2013). For the purpose of this study, the research

10
focused on creativity as a 21st century skill by investigating whether makerspaces
increase creativity potential.
Research Questions
To determine if makerspaces had an impact on student creativity, the researcher
conducted a mixed-methods action research study. The researcher is a media coordinator
in an elementary school where makerspaces were implemented prior to the study. The
following questions enabled the researcher to collect both quantitative and qualitative
data.
1.

To what extent does student exposure to makerspaces in an elementary school
media center have an impact on student scores on the Torrance Test of
Creative Thinking (TTCT)?

2. To what extent is there an association between student scores on the TTCT
and teacher ratings of creativity on the Scales for Rating the Behavior
Characteristics of Superior Students (SRBCSS)?
3. What are teacher perceptions of student creativity after student exposure to
makerspaces in an elementary school media center?
Theoretical Framework
Makerspaces can be examined through a constructionist framework.
Constructionism is a theory related to constructivism (Ackermann, n.d.). Constructivism
is associated with the work of Jean Piaget and deals with the development of knowledge
within an individual (Hruby, 2001). Piaget’s theory focused on how learning happens as
knowledge is constructed over time through stages (Ackermann, n.d.). According to
constructivist theory, the learning process happens within the individual. Constructionist
theory differs in that it is something that happens through social construction (Hruby,

11
2001). The focus is on physically making something to construct learning through a
building process (Ackermann, n.d.). Seymour Papert is often associated with the ideas of
constructionism. Papert is known for his work with designing technological systems for
children during the 1970s and 1980s (Blikstein, 2013). He expanded the ideas of Piaget
to use technology as a platform for invention (Blikstein, 2013). Logo is the system of
programming that he developed which has enabled children to program and control
tangible objects such as Lego building blocks (Blikstein, 2013).
Assumptions
The assumptions in this study were related to the elements of the school
environment and learning situations which were considered likely to occur (Simon,
2011). The participants in the study were exposed to makerspaces in the school media
center twice per week for the duration of 12 weeks. It was assumed that students enrolled
in the fifth grade would be present at school and take part in the activities available in the
makerspaces each week. It was also assumed the teachers of these students would be
truthful in their qualitative feedback measuring their perceptions of student creativity.
The activities the students participated in were part of the regularly planned curriculum.
Limitations
Limitations were conditions which were out of the control of the researcher with
the potential to influence the outcome of the study (Simon, 2011). One limitation of the
study is the element of time (Simon, 2011). The duration of the study was 12 weeks.
The time was set to coincide with the fifth graders’ access to the media center where they
had access to the makerspaces. In addition to the weekly scheduled visit to the media
center, students had one additional time scheduled weekly to address the issue of
adequate exposure to the treatment of the makerspaces.

12
Another limitation of the study is the amount of materials available for the
makerspaces. Makerspaces require resources. To address this limitation, a grant was
written and awarded to fund materials for the makerspaces. This included Lego robotics
kits, and littleBits magnetic circuitry devices as well as arts and paper materials for
building and construction projects.
Delimitations
Delimitations are those factors that limit the scope and define the boundaries
of the research study over which the researcher has some control (Simon, 2011). The
delimiting factors of this action research study include the population which consists of
70 fifth-grade students from five classrooms within an elementary school. These students
were selected because of their level of understanding and because research has shown
that this age group often displays a slump in creative behavior (Runco, 2007). This
population is also a convenience sample because they were students of the researcher
already scheduled to use the media center for makerspaces. The makerspace at this
school was made of materials for design and building activities including technology
resources. These areas were within the school media center and under the direction of the
media coordinator (also the researcher).
Deficiencies in the Literature
Makerspaces are a relatively new endeavor for most schools and therefore formal
research studies related to the topic in elementary education was sparse. There are many
articles and reviews of how makerspaces can be implemented which describe how they
have been created and how they operate; however, data regarding the effectiveness of
makerspaces was difficult to find. There is also a wealth of descriptive literature
designed for media coordinators and others involved in implementing makerspaces, but

13
evaluative data regarding impact were not readily found.
The researcher did discover a qualitative study which investigated the
competencies of those involved in implementing makerspaces. The findings of this study
included the top 10 competencies for professionals (such as librarians and media
coordinators) who oversee facilitating the spaces. These included people, management,
and technology skills as well as implications for library professionals (Koh & Abbas,
2015). Although this study was related to media coordinators, it did not address the
impact on student creativity directly.
Another qualitative study by Sheridan et al. (2014) compared three makerspaces.
These makerspaces all served adults, and none were in school settings. One of the
settings was a commercial business makerspace. The other two were based in a
community center and a museum. This study sought to compare the environments of the
spaces in terms of tools, usage, and opportunities (Sheridan et al, 2014).
Although the role of creativity in makerspaces has been discussed in the research,
data regarding whether makerspaces enhanced creativity was not discovered by the
researcher. Along these lines, another piece missing in the literature is research dealing
with the fidelity of implementation of makerspaces. There is no single model or
methodology for starting a makerspace and evaluating the effectiveness. Definitions of
makerspaces are varied and range in complexity depending on the context and situation.
This is because makerspaces in themselves are meant to be open-ended. Their purpose is
to promote creativity. Tight definitions, standards, and guidelines are contrary to the
concept of makerspaces (Cooper, 2013).
Finding literature related to creativity was far less challenging. There was a
wealth of information related to creativity focused on definitions and the theories

14
surrounding it. It was also quite easy to find information on creativity programs and
strategies for promoting creative thinking. There were assessments available to gauge
creativity in individuals discussed in the literature. Most of the creativity assessment
research is geared toward the perceptions of creativity. One of the most well-known
studies is one by Paul Torrance who studied the progress of students for over a 40-year
period based on the results of his test of creative potential. The longitudinal study proved
the test to be highly valid (Cramond, Matthews-Morgan, Bandalos, & Zuo, 2005).
Runco (2007) discussed the great number of studies that have attempted to show
the results of creativity training or programs to increase creativity. According to Runco,
“There have been so many studies of the enhancement of creativity that meta-analyses
have also been conducted” (p. 369). One of these studies by Rose and Lin (1984)
investigated programs that used the Torrance test to measure effectiveness. They found
most improvement efforts could be grouped into one of six categories: Parnes-Osborn
Creative Problem-Solving Programs (or adaptions); Covington’s Productive Thinking
Program; The Purdue Creative Thinking Program; multiple-components programs;
school programs; and kinesthetic, dramatic or transcendental meditation efforts. The
study showed that the most effective program to be the Parnes-Osborn program (Rose &
Lin, 1984). The Parnes-Osborn model is a creative problem-solving model developed in
1960 by Osborn who is known for originating the process of brainstorming. The model
was later refined by Parnes and several others to what it is today (Rose & Lin, 1984). Of
all the programs studied, “The most dramatic effects were apparent in the Parnes-Osborn
program (eta=.63)” (Runco, 2007, p. 369). Rose and Lin (1984) concluded the other
programs reviewed had more moderate effects. Overall, it was concluded from the metaanalysis that creativity can be both innate within an individual and nurtured through

15
enhancement techniques (Rose & Lin, 1984).
Audience
The audience for this study includes educators interested in creativity and how it
applies to teaching and learning. The action research is especially relevant to librarians
and media coordinators who may wish to implement makerspaces in the media centers
where they work. Teachers wishing to teach students how to be more creative may also
pick up on ideas that could be applicable in classroom settings as well. Administrators
and supervisors may also be interested in the results of the study to determine whether
makerspaces are worthy of support. These leaders as well as others in positions of power
would be interested in the results of the study to determine whether money should be
allocated for resources, materials, and supplies for the implementation of makerspaces.
Organizations and individuals who provide grant money may be interested in the impact
of makerspaces on student creative learning when considering funding for such
endeavors.
Research Design
The research design used for this study was an embedded mixed-methods action
research model. Specifically, the design was a convergent, embedded mixed-methods
model. The students involved in the study consisted of 70 fifth-grade students who
attended a Title 1 public elementary school in North Carolina. The students were
exposed to the treatment of makerspaces in the school media center twice weekly for 12
weeks. The population consisted of students at the school where the researcher worked
as the media coordinator.
The quantitative information included analysis of a pre and postadministration of
the TTCT to heterogeneous groups of fifth graders. These data were analyzed using a

16
paired sample t test to look at relationships between the independent and dependent
variables. Students were given a pretest prior to their experience with makerspaces and
then a posttest after the experience. The second part of the study also considered
quantitative data contributed by teachers through a creativity rating scale on each of their
students. The instrument used was the SRBCSS. This is a Likert-like rating scale that
looks specifically at creativity as one of the distinguishing characteristics of the students.
A Pearson’s R test was used to analyze whether there is an association between the TTCT
scores and the SRBCSS ratings.
The third data point was qualitative. The same teachers were given an openended questionnaire to probe their perceptions of student creativity in a narrative format.
These qualitative data were intended to inform how makerspaces influenced the students
and if there were other factors teachers felt influenced their students’ creativity. The
questionnaire was piloted with third-grade teachers in the same school to establish
reliability and validity prior to beginning the study. The data were analyzed to look for
trends and patterns in response to support or refute the quantifiable results.
Definitions of Terms
Convergent thinking. Convergent thinking is characterized by conventional
paths of thought (Runco, 2007). “Convergent thinking questions always have one (or
very few) correct or conventional answers” (Runco, 2007, p. 4).
Creative capital. Creative capital refers to the resources and abilities an
individual possesses which enable him or her to gain benefit (Brecknock, 2003; Florida,
2007; Robinson & Stern, 1998).
Creative class. The term for a social class composed of individuals who use
and/or depend on creativity to prosper economically (Brecknock, 2003; Florida, 2007;

17
Robinson & Stern, 1998).
Creativity. Researchers have focused on creativity primarily in two ways:
creativity as a function of human intelligence or creativity as its own construct (Kaufman,
2009). Most creativity definitions include mention of creativity as something that is new
and something that is useful or relevant (Kaufman, 2009). Researchers including Runco,
Jaeger, and Stein would assert that creativity is the creation of something that is novel
and of value (Weisberg, 2015). Robinson and Aronica (2015) defined creativity in a
similar way and added the importance of imagination and innovation. “Imagination is the
root of creativity. It is the ability to bring to mind things that aren’t present in our senses.
Creativity is putting your imagination to work. It is applied imagination. Innovation is
putting new ideas into practice” (Robinson & Aronica, 2015, p. 118). Creativity is also
thought to deal with divergent thinking (Antonenko & Thompson, 2011), but divergent
thinking alone does not necessarily define creativity (Kaufman, 2009). Guildford and
Torrance focused on describing creativity as having the following four components
involved: fluency, flexibility, originality and elaboration (Kaufman, 2009).
Divergent thinking. “Divergent thinking is the intellectual ability to think of
many original, diverse, and elaborate ideas; while convergent thinking includes skills to
logically evaluate, critique and choose the best idea from a selection of ideas”
(Antonenko & Thompson, 2011, p. 205).
DIYer. An individual who is motivated to “do-it-yourself” in terms of making,
building, and/or creating things (Bajarin, 2014).
Elaboration. “…ability to develop, embroider, embellish, carry out, or otherwise
elaborate ideas…” (Torrance, 2008, p. 48).
Fab Lab. Short for fabrication laboratory. This is a space where products are

18
created using technology tools, machinery, and raw materials. The Fab Lab at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is known to be “comprised of off-the-shelf,
industrial-grade fabrication and electronics tools, wrapped in open source software and
programs” (Fab Foundation, 2016, para. 2).
Flexibility. Refers to the number of different categories of ideas (Runco, 2007;
Torrance, 1974).
Fluency. The number of ideas posed (Runco, 2007; Torrance, 1974).
Innovation. Robinson and Aronica (2015) defined innovation as putting new
ideas into practice.
Inquiry. The inquiry-based learning approach originated in the sciences based
around the development and testing of hypotheses. Inquiry is the development of
meaningful questions by students that guide their learning processes (Coffman, 2013).
Lego Education. Lego Education is a division of the Lego company specializing
in providing learning experiences through the popular toy building blocks. The content
of Lego Education is focused on STEM as well as literacy and humanities topics. The
resources are designed to provide hands-on, manipulative experiences that inspire
children to create, reason, and invent. Digitalization is also part of the program as there
are software applications that enable the Legos to move, make noise, and do things (Lego
Education, 2013).
littleBits. “littleBits is a platform of easy-to-use electronic building blocks that
empower you to invent anything, from your own remote controlled car, to a smart home
device. The bits snap together with magnets, no soldering, no wiring, no programming
needed” (Sansing, 2015, p. 10).
Maker Faire. A gathering of makers. It was created by Make Magazine to

19
promote and support arts, crafts, engineering, and science projects (Maker Media, 2016).
Maker Faires operate on both large and small scale. These events showcase projects by
makers. The projects emphasize creativity and innovation and are reflective of the
energy behind the Maker Movement (Hlubinka, et al., 2013).
Maker. Individuals who have a certain mindset geared toward making things.
“Makers believe that if you can imagine it, you can make it” (Hlubinka et al., 2013, p. 2).
Makers see themselves as more of creators than consumers (Hlubinka et al., 2013).
Makers seek out opportunities to learn to do new things, especially through
hands-on, do-it-yourself (DIY) interactions . . . Makers comprise a community of
creative and technical people that help one another do better. They are open,
inclusive, encouraging and generous in spirit. Makers are generally not in it for
the money. This isn’t about filing patents or making a profit. At the same time,
(makers are) not anti-commercial— Makers sometimes start businesses . . .
makers celebrate other makers — what they make, how they make it and the
enthusiasm and passion that drives them. (Hlubinka et al., 2013, p. 2)
Maker Movement. Refers to a direction in American society where people are
inspired to create and invent. The movement is towards encouraging people to be more
of producers than consumers. Creativity is encouraged and processes for making new
things are valued (Hlubinka et al., 2013).
Makerspaces. Spaces within buildings where students can come to work on
creating with the indirect guidance of a professional (Canino-Fluit, 2014). “A
makerspace is a physical location where people gather to share resources and knowledge,
work on projects, network, and build” (Educause, 2013, para. 5). “Makerspaces come in
all shapes and sizes, but they all serve as a gathering point for tools, projects, mentors and

20
expertise. A collection of tools does not define a Makerspace. Rather, we define it by
what it enables: making” (Hlubinka et al., 2013, p. 1).
Media coordinator. A library education professional working in a school library
media center whose duties include supervising and/or managing the collection, teaching
students, and maintaining technology assets (Ballard, 2016).
Originality. The number of unique ideas that have not been posed before
(Runco, 2007; Torrance, 1974).
SRBCSS. Also known as The Renzulli Scales, this is a battery of statements
designed to rank a teacher’s perception of certain behavioral characteristics including
creativity (Renzulli et al., 2010).
School library media center. The school library media center is a common area
within a school setting where students come to do research, leisure reading, and
participate in classes designed to enhance literacy and inquiry-based practices. Another
term for media center is library.
STEM education. An acronym for the movement in education emphasizing
science, technology, engineering, and mathematics to increase the global competitiveness
of students in the United States (Bailey, 2005; Guyotte, Sochacka, Costantino, Waither,
& Kellam, 2014).
STEAM education. In addition to STEM subjects as a focus, art educational
practices are also included in the acronym (Claymier, 2014; Erikson, 2013; Guyotte et al.,
2014; Padovan, 2015).
Tinkering. “Tinkering is a branch of making that emphasizes creative,
improvisational problem solving. It centers on the open-ended design and construction of
objects or installation, generally using both high-and low-tech tools” (Bevan, Gutwill et

21
al., 2014, p. 99).
TTCT. Well-known and widely used test of creativity. It was developed by Ellis
Paul Torrance and focuses on four key characteristics to rank creativity within an
individual: fluency, flexibility, originality, and elaboration (Runco, 2007).
Summary
Chapter 1 was an overview of the study. It began with background information
on makerspaces and the Maker Movement, because these are relatively new topics in the
field of education. The problem involved in this study dealt with how creativity could be
promoted in students, because this is a skill that research has identified as important for
future success in the 21st century (Partnership for 21st Century Learning, 2016; Robinson
& Aronica, 2015). The purpose of the study was to investigate whether makerspaces
could enhance student creativity. The research questions were stated related to this
followed by the assumptions, limitations, and delimitations associated with the study.
Deficiencies in the literature as well as definitions of key terms were also presented in
this chapter.
Many of the key ideas presented in the research will be discussed in the following
literature review (Chapter 2). The subject of creativity in educational settings is
extremely broad; therefore, the researcher focused on the importance of understanding
creativity as it applies to 21st century learning situations (Partnership for 21st Century
Learning, 2016). The teaching of creativity is also discussed as it applies to the
implementation of makerspaces (Fleming, 2015; Sternberg, 1995). Measuring creativity
was also of interest to the researcher for assessing the impact of makerspaces in an
elementary school media center through action research. The role of the media
coordinator also came into play in how creative activities were facilitated in the media

22
center’s makerspaces. Finally, the literature review examines the theoretical frameworks
related to makerspaces. The researcher discusses how constructionist theory aligns with
the basic goals of learning by making (Papert & Harel, 1991).
Following Chapter 2, Chapter 3 explains the mixed method action research
approach. The methodology describes the participants including the demographics of the
population sample. Procedures are outlined indicating the sequence of the activities, the
way the study was conducted, the research design, the rationale for the methods, and
justification of the appropriateness of the methods. The instruments used are cited and
described. The limitations of the study are presented including possible threats to validity
and reliability. In addition, the delimitations are also included. The researcher analyzes
and reports the results in Chapter 4. Chapter 5 focuses on conclusions, discussion, and
recommendations from the researcher.

Chapter 2: Literature Review
Introduction
The literature review focused on research towards understanding the use of
makerspaces in a school media center as a means of enhancing creative potential in
students. The problem investigated how to develop creative potential in elementary
school students to prepare them for their futures. The purpose of the study was to gauge
the impact makerspaces had on the development of creativity in elementary school
students. This action research study was a mixed-methods procedure. The study
analyzed student performances on a test of divergent thinking (TTCT) and teacher
perceptions of student creativity levels as evidenced on the Scales for Rating the
Behavior of Superior Students (SRBSS). A qualitative questionnaire was given to the
teachers of the students in the study to describe exposure to makerspaces in an
elementary school library. The first section of the literature review focuses on creativity
through the lens of education; the second section focuses on makerspaces; and the third
section focuses on constructionist theory as it is applied to creativity and makerspaces.
Creativity in Education
Creativity and 21st century education. Florida (2007) discussed the emergence
of a new class within American society. The creative class is known as a movement of
people from all over the world working in careers which require creativity (Brecknock,
2003; Florida, 2007; Runco, 2007). Florida (2007) estimated that the population of the
creative class in the United States was equal to about 30% of the workforce. During the
last several decades, new fields and careers have emerged because of creative endeavors.
“The resulting evidence of the links between creative capital, quality of life, and
competitiveness have made the creative industries a serious economic factor that needs to

24
be considered particularly in regard to city viability” (Brecknock, 2003, para. 1). With
this in mind, it is important for educators to consider how to promote practices which
may encourage the development of creativity within students (Robinson & Aronica,
2015).
The predominant model of education in the United States is considered outdated
by many in the educational field (Pink, 2006; Robinson & Aronica, 2015). According to
Robinson and Aronica (2015), the model of schooling still used in many places today was
designed over 100 years ago to meet the demands of the Industrial Revolution. The
factory model used during this time focused on systems of efficiency for mass
production. Neat and orderly rows in classrooms reflected the model factories set up for
automation and efficiency. These educational models are long outdated, do not address
the needs of our world now, and must be changed (Robinson & Aronica, 2015).
The answers to the uncertainty and challenges society faces lie in the cultivation
of creativity (Robinson & Aronica 2015; Wagner, 2006). This must be taken seriously
and with a sense of great purpose for educators because the challenges students face are
becoming more complex (Robinson & Aronica, 2015). In the United States, the
Partnership for 21st Century Learning (2016) proposed what are considered to be
important skills for students to possess to be successful in meeting such challenges. The
Partnership was established in 2002 and represents many business and educational
organizations such as Dell, Apple, Microsoft, and the National Education Association
(NEA; Formanack, 2008; Robinson & Aronica, 2015). “The Partnership believes schools
must go beyond basic competency by weaving in 21st century interdisciplinary themes
that are critical to success but not typically emphasized in schools today” (Formanack,
2008, p. 28). The partnership has offered what has come to be known as the Four Cs and

25
encourages educators to integrate them into classroom practices. The Four Cs are critical
thinking, communication, collaboration, and creativity (Formanack, 2008; Partnership for
21st Century Learning, 2016).
Creativity is one of the Four Cs educators find most challenging to address
(Partnership for 21st Century Learning, 2016). This is no doubt because of the different
contexts in which creativity can be defined (Plucker, Begehtto, & Dow, 2004). For the
purposes of education, creativity is a skill students should cultivate to address the
challenges of problem finding, problem solving, divergent thinking, and the creation of
new ideas and products (Runco, 2007). The challenge in promoting the development of
creativity in schools comes in the fact that it is a difficult construct about which to find
consensus (Partnership for 21st Century Learning, 2016).
Understanding creativity. Creativity is challenging to define (Runco, 2007).
Scholars suggest creativity involves the production of something original and useful
(Robinson & Aronica, 2015; Runco, 2007). Children are considered creative, yet in a
different sense than adults because their creativity does not always result in a product
(Runco, 2007). Children are not bound by their past experiences, routines, or
expectations as adults sometimes are (Runco, 2007). The way creativity is expressed has
a lot to do with why it is so hard to define (Runco, 2007). There is much diversity in how
creativity is expressed, and it can play a role in all aspects of life from business,
education, arts, and sciences to everyday common endeavors that require problem solving
(Runco, 2007).
There is also great diversity in understanding how individuals acquire and grow in
creativity. According to Runco (2007), all individuals have creative potential but not
everyone demonstrates creativity. Potential depends on both our natural tendencies and

26
our environment (Runco, 2007).
Each of us has potentials to fulfill, but the range of potentials varies from
individual to individual. That, again is the contribution of biology, genes, and
nurture. This same biological contribution is apparent in the trends and stages of
development. (Runco, 2007, p. 40-41)
One interesting trend in development of creativity has been identified in the literature as
the “fourth grade slump” (Torrance, 1967, p. 3). According to theories of stage
development from Piaget and Kohlberg, children begin to follow the conventions of
culture beginning around age eight or nine (Runco, 2007). Torrance (1967) identified
this as a time when students begin to be less creative in their language and reasoning to
fit the norms and expectations of their parents and teachers. “The conventional child is a
conformist in the sense that he or she follows social expectations and imitates typical
behaviors of his or her peers. This inhibits self-expression and creativity” (Runco, 2007,
p. 41). Runco stated that certain types of creative thinking require strategies that go
beyond conventional thinking such as those of scientists making new discoveries.
Independent thinking beyond normal expectations help to form creative ideas (Runco,
2007).
Creativity is also linked to student motivation according to Buchanan, Harlan,
Bruce, and Edwards (2016). Students who have more freedom to explore their own
learning interests tend to be more motivated and open to new ideas. “Student motivation
is linked to the students perceived value or meaning in the academic work at hand. It is
connected to student interest specifically where interest carries both affective and
cognitive components” (Buchanan et al., 2016, p. 29). Motivation is also a key part of
engagement. Students motivated by their own curiosity, questions, and imaginations are

27
generally more engaged in learning (Buchanan et al., 2016).
Henriksen and Mishra (2014) discussed some of the challenges in understanding
where creative ideas come from. The writers noted myths related to creativity:
“Creativity has often been thought of as an elusive and mystical force – emerging from
burst of insight available only to certain fortunate individuals” (Henriksen & Mishra,
2014, p. 15). Henriksen and Mishra disputed this myth and noted creativity deals with
the way individuals see old or known things in a new way. Background knowledge is
therefore essential to the building of creative ideas through variations of prior schema
depicted in new and novel ways (Henriksen & Mishra. 2014). Henriksen and Mishra
noted it is the job of educators to help students build upon their prior experiences and
broaden their perspectives so they can develop new and novel ideas.
Creativity is also differently expressed depending on the culture from which it
originates (Runco, 2007). Because there is great variation in how it is expressed, creative
potential is also hard to define (Florida, 2007; Runco, 2007). Creativity is a form of
human capital that when tapped into has great potential for many situations (Runco,
2007). Runco (2007) suggested study of creativity is extremely difficult because the
creative process is multifaceted and requires an eclectic approach to understand it.
In opposition to claims that creativity is difficult to define, Cropley (2000)
disagreed. He stated it is not hard to define because such a great deal of research has
been done on the subject. This began with the historical address by J. P. Guildford to the
American Psychological Association in 1950 where he spoke of the need for the study of
creativity (Cropley, 2000). Cropley posed a working definition of creativity as an
interaction between aptitude and process in an environment where a product is produced
that is considered both novel and useful. This aligns with the Robinson and Aronica

28
(2015) definition that creativity brings forth something of value. Cropley’s point for
educators was how the theoretical understandings of creativity are applied in school
settings.
Cropley’s (2000) definition was not unlike the definitions given by other
researchers on the subject (Robinson & Aronica 2015: Runco, 2007; Sternberg, 2006).
Henry (2009) looked at definitions of creativity and the importance of understanding
them before applying them in educational settings. Henry cited Bailin who said, “if we
are not clear about what is meant by creativity, we may end up sacrificing creativity
precisely in the process for trying to foster it” (p. 1). Henry went on to describe how
creativity has been defined through the years from four perspectives: the creative person,
the creative process, the creative environment, and the creative product.
Four P approach to creativity. Rhodes (1961) was the first to describe the Four
P approach to understanding creativity. Rhodes referred to creativity as evidenced
through the personality and refers to “intellect, temperament, physique, traits, habits,
attitudes, self-concept, value systems, defense mechanisms and behavior” (p. 306).
Process applies to “motivation, perception, learning, thinking, and communication”
(Rhodes, 1961, p. 307). Rhodes used the word “press” to represent environment and
described creativity relating to it through the relationship between human beings and the
environment. The product of creativity is the item that is created; and according to
Rhodes, it may be physical, tangible, or idea related.
According to Kaufman and Beghetto (2009), creative product is the most widely
understood aspect of creativity probably because there is something concrete or tangible
to evaluate. The product is what is yielded by the person through process and is
ultimately impacted by the press (Kaufman & Beghetto, 2009). Often, the person may or

29
may not be considered creative due to the cultural context in which he or she is operating.
Four C approach to creativity. Kaufman and Baghetto (2009) discussed the 4C
model of creativity that goes beyond what has been referred to as Big-C creativity and
little-c creativity. Big-C creativity is the type of creativity considered groundbreaking
within a field, while little-c creativity is that which is considered every day (Kaufman &
Baghetto, 2009). Two additional forms of creativity added to this by Kaufman and
Baghetto (2009) were mini-c creativity which is considered part of the learning process
and Pro-c creativity which is considered to be at a professional level.
Teaching creativity. Sternberg (2006) believed students could be taught to think
more creatively. Other researchers agreed with this premise (Berrett, 2013; Hirsch, 2010;
Hunsaker, 2005; Lin, 2011; McWilliam & Dawson, 2008; Robinson & Aronica, 2015).
The investment theory developed by Sternberg (1995) stated,
Creatively gifted people share characteristics, including certain styles of thinking
motivation and the right environment. It is consistent, however, with many
theories of creativity that teachers would do well to read. . . . Creative thinkers
buy low and sell high. That is they propose ideas that are like undervalued stocks,
ideas that are often summarily rejected by the public at large and viewed by others
as odd, counterproductive, or even foolish. Many people simply do not realize—
and often do not want to realize—that these ideas may be valid and perhaps
superior to the way they think. (p. 80)
Creativity is a balance of synthetic, analytic, and practical abilities; and educators
need to think about all three as very important (Sternberg, 1995). Synthetic ability is the
ability to synthesize new ideas and make connections not thought of before. Analytic
ability is the analysis of ideas also known as critical thinking with an evaluative element.

30
Practical ability is the ability to realize abstract ideas in real world ways (Sternberg,
1995). Sternberg (1995) developed strategies related to his Investment Theory that
educators might consider to promote creativity. Table 1 displays 12 strategies Sternberg
presented to apply his theory to the classroom.
Table 1
Sternberg’s Investment Theory Strategies
1.
Serve as a role model for creativity.
2.
Encourage questioning of assumptions.
3.
Allow mistakes.
4.
Encourage sensible mistakes.
5.
Design creative assignments and assessments.
6.
Let students define problems themselves.
7.
Reward creative ideas and products.
8.
Allow time to think creatively.
9.
Encourage tolerance of ambiguity.
10.
Point out creative thinkers invariably face obstacles.
11.
Be willing to grow.
12.
Recognize that creative thinkers need to find nurturing environments
(Sternberg, 1995, pp. 81-84).
Measuring creativity. Pioneers in the field of measuring creativity include
Guilford (Runco, 2007) and Torrance (Sternberg, 2006). Both were concerned with the
measurement of divergent thinking (Runco, 2007; Sternberg, 2006). According to Runco
(2007), J. P. Guildford was the president of the American Psychological Association and
is known for his 1950 presidential address on the subject of creativity. He spoke of
creativity as a natural resource and encouraged its development to help society. He spent
35 years studying it objectively; and much of his work is still influential in the field,
especially related to convergent and divergent thinking. He posed that divergent thinking
leads one to many different possibilities for solving a problem or finding an answer,
while convergent thinking leads to one correct or accepted response. The numerous and
varied responses may be described in terms of “fluency (the number of ideas), originality

31
(the number of unusual or unique ideas), and flexibility (the number of different
categories implied by the ideas)” (Runco, 2007, p. 9).
E. Paul Torrance was a highly acclaimed developmental psychologist and one of
the most recognized names in all of creativity research (Sternberg, 2006). He outlined
creativity as a process where one has tried to solve problems by coming up with new
solutions, testing them out, and then sharing the results (Millar & Dahl, 2011). He is
known for the development of the TTCT which is used to assess a person’s capacity for
creativity (Torrance, 1974). The test is considered highly reliable and is the most used
test of its kind across the world (Scholastic Testing Services Testing, 2016).
Torrance (1974) focused on solutions through divergent thinking. According to
Runco (2007), divergent thinking is not the same thing as creative thinking, but they are
related because it tells us something about the processes a person may be going through
cognitively that lead to novel solutions and new ideas. “Divergent thinking tests are the
most commonly used estimate of the potential for creative thought” (Runco, 2007, p. 10).
According to Runco, it is convergent thinking that dominates most of the activities in
traditional schools, meaning knowledge is valued based on one correct answer. This
sharply differs from the kinds of divergent thinking Torrance saw value in and sought to
measure through his instrument (Runco, 2007).
Creativity research. The nature of creativity and lack of consistent definitions
have led many to seek to learn more about how it applies in educational settings.
Numbers of researchers have studied creativity in very different ways (Kaufman, 2009;
Runco, 2007; Sternberg, 2006; Torrance, 1967; Weisberg, 2015). Paul Torrance’s
instrument, the TTCT, has become one of the most widely used instruments for
measuring creativity in individuals (Scholastic Testing Services, 2016). The research

32
behind this instrument spans the scope of 4 decades (Dahl et al., 2011). Torrance
conducted a longitudinal study that began in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The students
originally tested with his instrument for predicting creativity are still being studied (Dahl
et al., 2011).
Beyond the Torrance test, others have also sought to study how to nurture and
assess creativity in educational settings, but searching for studies on the assessment of
creativity at the elementary school level proves to be challenging. A recent search
yielded a study on the assessment of creativity in the United Kingdom in the field of art
and design business. Penaluna and Penaluna (2009) explored the question of how to
assess creativity in entrepreneurial learning at the postsecondary level. The findings of
this study were “an assessment of ideas generation, innovation, and opportunity
recognition are central to developing and learning entrepreneurial behaviors. There are
clear parallels between the pedagogic approaches from design disciplines and the
learning outcomes advocated in generic curriculum development for entrepreneurship”
(Penaluna & Penaluna, 2009, p. 718).
A study of the effect of science activities used for fostering creativity in Turkish
preschool children was another exploration of the issue (Mirzaie, Hamidi, & Anaraki,
2009). Much attention has been given to understanding the concept of creativity and less
toward understanding how to assess it.
The classical and contemporary views of creativity differ with respect to the
nature of such aspects of creativity as ‘insight’ and with respect to the distribution
of a capacity for creative activity within the population. But there is little
disagreement between these views of creativity on the centrality of the generative
processes of problem posing and problem solving in creative activity. (Mirzaie et

33
al., 2009, p. 82)
Mirzaie et al. (2009) noted researchers such as Torrance and Taylor both worked to
develop ways to measure creativity; however, today many teachers assess creativity in a
formative manner by monitoring work, discussion, and behaviors.
Makerspaces
Definitions of makerspaces. The Makerspace Playbook defines makerspaces as
“physical spaces for people, including kids, to work together and review their projects.
Making can happen anywhere—on a kitchen table or in a high-end Fab Lab, a living
room or a garage, a school or a community center” (Hlubinka et al., 2013, p. 11). Many
variations of makerspaces have grown worldwide (Cooper, 2013). The variety of
makerspaces means there are no standard lists of equipment, activities, or designs for the
spaces. The creative nature of makerspace entities means each makerspace can be as
unique as the makers who use it. Makerspaces may resemble labs, art studios, or shop
classes but do not represent one type of space. “Diversity and cross-pollination of
activities are critical to the design, making and exploration process” (Cooper, 2013, p. 1).
Flexible design is the best design when it comes to makerspaces. This is because the
activities are constantly evolving. According to Cooper (2013), The Makerspace
Playbook and other makerspace groups list tools and materials that can be considered.
As the popularity of makerspaces has grown so have the opportunities for companies to
profit. Commercial makerspace kits can be purchased from several suppliers (Hlubinka
et al., 2013). School budgets often do not have means to purchase commercial kits.
Many rely on donations and recycling programs as primary sources of materials
(Hlubinka et al., 2013).
Makerspaces are areas where people come together to work on personal projects

34
(Fleming, 2015). Within these spaces, people can share tools, expertise, and ideas.
(Benton et al., 2013). The term makerspace is intentionally broad and open-ended to
avoid conceptual limitations (Holman, 2015). These are spaces where people can come
to meet, socialize, and create. According to Barniskis (2014), these makers’ interests
often revolve around technology, science, and electronics but not always. A variety of
activities can happen in a makerspace including sewing, welding, building, sculpting,
wiring, painting, paper, and cardboard crafts (Hlubinka et al., 2013).
For example, the Milwaukee Makerspace offers tools, mills, kilns, sewing and
embroidery machines, and welding equipment, all in a large space with an
industrial-sized crane. Some of the recent activities there include sewing one’s
own craft apron, creating a no-rules pinewood derby track and cars similar to the
ones Boy Scouts use, and sharing all sorts of projects with the public on the
builder’s night out weekly events. (Barniskis, 2014, p. 7)
Despite the vast differences in the offerings of makerspaces, most do share some
common features. In most cases, these spaces offer informal opportunities for learning,
encourage collaboration, help to develop problem-solving and exploration skills, and help
to facilitate activities that involve creating (Britton, 2012, ; Krueger, 2014; Maker Media,
2016). The components of makerspaces also differ depending on the audience of makers,
funding, physical space, and goals of those in charge of running or maintaining the
venue. According to Dale Dougherty, founder of Maker Media, successful makerspaces
should do the following: promote learning through playful exploration, integrate naturally
with art and science, and offer materials and tools that equip them to create (Krueger,
2014). Table 2 displays some of the variations of makerspaces found all around the
world.

35
Table 2
Variations of Makerspaces
Fab Lab

Fab Lab is short for a fabrication laboratory equipped
with digital technology that enables people to create
products. The term came out of MIT and is credited to
Dr. Neil Gershenfeld (Fab Foundation, 2016).

Hackerspace

Hackerspaces apply to spaces where people join to work
communally with others who share similar interests that
revolve around technology and digitalization. These
places are social in nature and focus on media (Benton et
al., 2013).

TechShop

TechShops are like hackerspaces and Fab Labs but charge
fees for usage. Most allow users access to equipment,
software and space for working. These businesses also
offer training and technical support at a cost (Benton et
al., 2013).

Library Makerspaces

Areas within public, school, and academic libraries where
space has been reconfigured to meet the changing needs
of patrons. These spaces can look different depending on
the situation and resources available. Areas may include
open spaces with tables that facilitate group projects and
collaboration. The spaces may include computers, tools,
building materials, and technical supplies. In libraries
across the country, makerspaces offer access to all
members of the community (Barniskis, 2014).

School Makerspaces

“To define a school makerspace by its purpose in the
simplest of terms, it is a place where young people have
an opportunity to explore their own interests; learn to use
tools and materials, both physical and virtual; and develop
creative projects” (Fleming, 2015, p. 5).

Growth of the Maker Movement led to the development of makerspaces as places
for creative making to happen. These can be both physical and virtual. They can be
workshop-like settings or they can be set in libraries and media centers. Some are
commercial and others are parts of schools or other public settings (Hlubinka et al.,
2013). The increasing participation in makerspaces involves “all kinds of people in

36
interconnected communities, defined by interests and skills online as well as local efforts
to convene those who share common goals” (Hlubinka et al., 2013, p. 2). These ideas are
at the heart of the Maker Movement and contribute to the communal making experiences
that have become quite prevalent across the United States.
The Maker Movement. Humans have always made things. Since the dawn of
man, people have been creators. Whether out of necessity, boredom, or an innate desire,
people have always been makers (Halverson & Sheridan, 2014). The frame of reference
of the Maker Movement described here is a much more recent and specific situation that
began in the first decade of the 21st century (Halverson & Sheridan, 2014). “The maker
movement refers broadly to the growing number of people who are engaged in the
creative production of artifacts in their daily lives and find physical and digital forums to
share their processes and products with others” (Halverson & Sheridan, 2014, p. 496).
The Maker Movement described in the literature began around 2006 (Maker
Media, 2016). It was at this time that Maker Media emerged as a global network of
creative entities focused on the concept of production versus consumption (Maker Media,
2016). According to Techopedia (2016), the Maker Movement represents the trend
toward do-it-yourself (DIY) or do-it-with-others (DIWO) processes.
The individuals who create are known as makers. Makers use a variety of
materials, resources, and gadgetry to create unique products (Techopedia, 2016). There
are endless possibilities for makers; and as the movement grows, so do the bounds of the
types of creations. In the initial stages of the movement, much of the emphasis was on
recycling electronics; however, emphasis on building new creations out of any type of
media is the goal (Techopedia, 2016).
Another component of the Maker Movement is the emergence of Maker Faires.

37
Maker Faires are events designed to showcase the making of many makers. Make
Magazine is the largest corporate sponsor of the trademark events that occur in major
cities all across the United States (Maker Media, 2016). Mini-Maker Faires also occur in
smaller communities. These events happen in places where makerspaces are located. A
typical Maker Faire can last from 1 to several days.
Makers of all ages convene for one fantastic weekend to show off a spectacular
array of projects that combine arts, craft, engineering, food, health, music,
creative reuse, performance, science, and technology. Rockets to robots, felting
to beekeeping, pedal-power to mobile muffin cars, hardcore hardware to silly
software — you never know what you’ll see. (Hlubinka et al., 2013, p. 2)
The Maker Movement attracted a great deal of notoriety in 2014 when the White
House hosted its first ever Maker Faire (The White House, 2016). In 2014, President
Barack Obama called on leaders to promote elemental innovation from the ground up by
encouraging American making. In a presidential proclamation in 2015, he spoke of
providing more opportunities for students to engage in making programs involving
fabrication skills. Obama also noted the importance of the continued growth of the
Maker Movement as a catalyst for invention and entrepreneurialism (The White House,
2016).
According to Bevan, Gutwill et al. (2014), “the maker movement celebrates
creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship through the design and construction of
physical objects” (p. 28). There is a growing culture in modern society towards creating,
hands-on making, crafting, designing, and inventing. Common activities involved are
electronics, textiles, robotics, wood work, digital fabrication, welding, and computer
programming (Peppler & Bender, 2013).

38
Activities in makerspaces. The types of activities offered in a makerspace are
dependent on the tools and materials available as well as the desires of those using the
space. Large pieces of equipment can be costly, so some spaces are limited in what
experiences they can provide. Recycled materials are often used because they are cost
effective and offer a green option for items that might otherwise end up in a landfill
(Young Adult Library Services Association, 2016). Hlubinka et al. (2013) suggested
partnerships be pursued with local community groups and businesses that may help fund
resources. The Young Adult Library Services Association outlined a number of project
categories and examples of creations that can happen in a Makerspace. These are
described in Table 3. Other sources include similar and additional projects and are noted
as well. Some involve commercially purchased products, while others can be made from
simple and common items.

(Hlubinka et al., 2013).

Many of the making activities focus on STEM and STEAM related concepts and
themes. Makerspaces are a way to tie creativity in with science (Bevan, Petrich et al.,
2014). These kinds of activities can help students not only develop science skills, but

39
they can also be socializing activities as well (Bevan, Petrich et al., 2014).
Productive science learning identities are crucial for students choosing to pursue
science academically, professionally, and through lifelong engagement. STEMrich maker activities are powerful places for this identity work because they can
accommodate a wide variety of interests and experiences, they blend intellectual
and socioemotional engagement, and they provide opportunities for young people
to develop, pursue, persist with, and accomplish original ideas and solutions in
which they can take pride and ownership. (Bevan, Petrich et al., 2014, pp. 28-29)
Collaboration in making. The common thread in a makerspace is the fact they
are communal in nature (Thomas, 2014). Collaboration is a very important part of the
makerspace experience and is what makes it different from working on crafts, art, or
computers in isolation (Thomas, 2014). The relationships that develop among makers
provide a layer of support and expertise not available when one creates alone (Fleming,
2015).
Makerspaces can also lead to entrepreneurial opportunities. This country needs
methods to support creative risk-taking to prosper economically (Florida, 2007).
Economic prosperity depends on the creative talent within our people (Benton et al.,
2013). Many of the problems facing our nation in the diverse and ever-changing global
economy can only be solved through thinking critically and challenging old ideas. This
relates to the ideas of Florida (2007) and what he referred to as the need for creative
capital. Schools and communities need to establish more effective methods of producing
a new generation of innovators (Benton et al., 2013; Fleming, 2015). Makerspaces may
be an environment where creative solutions will flourish (Thomas, 2014).
Makerspaces in schools. Student success in the future requires preparation for

40
the global society. NEA (2010) introduced Preparing 21st Century Students for a Global
Society. This document follows the model developed by the Partnership for 21st Century
Learning by focusing on the Four Cs: critical thinking and problem solving,
communication, collaboration, and creativity and innovation (NEA, 2010). The
document stated there is “a critical need for innovation” (NEA, 2010, p. 6). The
changing workforce is the catalyst for a different focus in our schools. There is also a
need for deeper kinds of learning according to the Partnership for 21st Century Learning
(2016). Educational makerspaces have the potential to promote and inspire deeper kinds
of learning through student-driven methods (Kurti et al., 2014.
Facilitating 21st century learning requires new opportunities, structures, and tools.
Fleming (2015) believed makerspaces can meet this need. This is because makerspaces
go beyond the typical classroom environment and provide more open-ended, flexible
spaces where students can adapt to meet their own learning goals (Fleming, 2015).
Maker education follows the principles of constructivist education (Kurti et al., 2014.
More specifically, it aligns with the constructionist theory of learning where students
create products that engage them in meaningful learning (Fleming, 2015; Halverson &
Sheridan, 2014; Papert, 1993).
Another way makerspaces prepare students for the future is through the potential
for entrepreneurship and STEM focus. STEM jobs are likely to be prevalent in the future
(Bevan, Gutwill et al., 2014). The tinkering experiences makerspaces provide can incite
creativity and innovation (Martinez & Stager, 2013). Bevan, Gutwill et al. (2014)
conducted a study involving both researchers and practitioners that posed tinkering helps
to promote creativity and problem solving promoting STEM learning experiences.
STEM tinkering activities help learners to develop scientific principles using “technical

41
tools, processes, and phenomena. Physical phenomena or concepts such as balance,
forces, motion, light, electricity and magnetism, resonance, symmetry, and others
(depending on the activity design) are core-building blocks for the development and
construction of the learner’s idea” (Bevan, Gutwill et al., 2014, p. 99). The study
concluded that making is a potentially useful method to engage learners in tinkering
which will enhance learning (Bevan, Gutwill et al., 2014).
Implementing makerspaces in schools. There are a number of resources
available for the implementation of a makerspace within a school including steps taken to
get started. The first thing to be considered is the actual space where the making will
happen (Hlubinka et al., 2013). Hlubinka et al. (2013) suggested making the most of any
usable space common to the faculty and students. Repurposing unused space or using
spaces temporarily can work. Some spaces to consider might be the computer lab, the
library, or the cafeteria because these are generally considered shared spaces anyway
(Fleming, 2015). The following are steps suggested by Kurti et al. (2014):
1. Observe the students to determine their interests.
2. Review the curriculum and school programs to find compatibilities and
possible augmentations to offer makerspace.
3. Consider national and global trends in technology and culture.
4. Identify themes in steps 1-3 to use in the makerspace.
5. Set aside space and bring in tools and parts.
6. Create an environment promoting student ownership of the makerspace.
7. Continue assessing, redesigning and adding new tools every semester to
endure a relevant, growing experience. (p. 23)
It is hard to take on such a project as implementing a makerspace all alone. A committee

42
or team working together on implementation can make the experience more positive. It
is also necessary to have the support of the administration in the school setting. There
may be a need for schedule adjustments and other access granted to establish a
makerspace. Successful makerspaces have happened where there has been backing of the
principal and teachers (Kurti et al., 2014).
The role of the library media specialist. Library media specialists can have a
critical role in the development of makerspaces in schools (Bowler, 2014). The library is
one of the common spaces in a school where making can naturally occur. This is due to
the openness of the area as well as the access to technology. Makerspaces allow natural
inquiry experiences which are the cornerstone of many library programs (Fleming, 2015).
According to Fleming (2015), the Maker Movement coincides nicely with the existing
missions of many libraries. With the onset of digitalization, many libraries are shifting in
how space is used. No longer must libraries be exclusively brick and mortar buildings or
rooms to house print materials. Space once dedicated to stacks now hosts a variety of
communal endeavors (Fleming, 2015).
STEM related tinkering, building, collaboration, and invention thrive in modern
libraries. Makerspaces within school libraries are ideal spaces for these kinds of 21st
century skills to be developed (Bevan, Gutwill et al., 2014). School librarians have a
unique and important role in this (Fleming, 2015). According to Fleming (2015),
“Library Media Specialists have the scope and the affordances to enable activities that, in
so many ways, step outside the relative rigidity of the classroom canon” (p. 44).
Inspiring creativity. There is also the idea of how environmental influence
affects creative thinking and behavior (Runco, 2007). Whitehouse (2009) noted teachers
can either support or squelch creativity. If teachers model divergent thinking, they

43
overtly model creativity as something of value (Runco, 2007). Teachers who are overly
critical and evaluative model the opposite (Runco, 2007). Runco (2007) stated intrinsic
motivation encourages creativity more than extrinsic rewards and can lead the student to
follow his or her own means of expression without pressure. According to Runco,
“Creativity results from particular cognitive processes, attitudes, values, motivation, and
affect. It has been said that attitudes represent the most malleable part of the creativity
complex” (p. 192). Attitudes are important and educators should think about this when
giving assignments that are intended to get students thinking creatively (Runco, 2007).
Rationale for makerspaces in school settings. Thomas (2014) stated young
children should be given the tools they need to become makers. Makers are defined by
Thomas as
quite simply, makers make things. Some build robots, some sew clothes, some
prepare food, some design tools, some construct houses. “Maker” isn’t a new title
conveyed after passing some test or degree program; rather, it is a selfidentification. It’s also not, by any stretch of the imagination, a new concept. (p.
1)
Students who are given the chance to become makers are given the chance to become
innovators (Thomas, 2014). Making gives students the opportunity to express their
creativity (Thomas, 2014). Thomas described the qualities that can be developed in
children who are given the opportunity to make: curiosity, playfulness, risk,
responsibility, persistence, resourcefulness, generosity, and optimism. The Partnership
for 21st Century Learning (2016) suggested similar qualities to be developed in students
to optimize opportunities for a successful future.
Makerspaces are places where students can practice the development of these

44
kinds of skills (Hlubinka et al., 2013). If students do not have opportunities to build,
construct, take apart, and put back together again in a physical way will not be able to
become good at doing so. Ideas without opportunity for realization never become more
than ideas (Thomas, 2014).
Constructionist Theory
Constructionism. Makerspaces have a natural connection to the concept of
constructionism (Donaldson, 2014). The theory of constructionism derives from the
constructivist view of learning associated with Piaget (Hjorth & Wilensky, 2014). It
focuses on learning as a process where learners build their own knowledge based on the
world around them. Constructionist theory is associated with the work of Seymour
Papert from MIT. Papert was one of the early pioneers of artificial intelligence and is
most known for his work on how technology impacts learning (MIT Media Lab, 2016).
His work with Piaget in the late 1950s influenced his ideas about technology and learning
(Blikstein, 2013). In 1980, he published Mindstorms: Children, Computers and Powerful
Ideas which at the time was a very progressive work featuring his ideas about how
children can learn through constructing and creating using technology (Blikstein, 2013).
The constructionist approach is associated with constructivism, but there are
major differences. Piaget’s view of knowledge as a structure upon which cognitive
operations can be built is extended to experiences that depend on building something
physical; however, Piaget’s model was based on the importance of building cognition
within the individual (Hjorth & Wilensky, 2014). Constructionism requires an external
feature through which learners construct and share their thinking in social groups (Hjorth
& Wilensky, 2014). The physical model has an important function in constructionism,
where the model in constructivism may be internal (Hjorth & Wilensky, 2014). Much of

45
Papert’s work focused on technology and how students build knowledge using computers
(Papert, 1993).
Constructivism and constructionist theory. The two theories are somewhat
related, but there are inherent differences in constructivism and constructionist theory
(Ackermann, n.d.). Both constructivism and constructionism involve construction of
knowledge, but the difference lies in the environment (Hruby, 2001). Further explanation
of the distinction between constructivist and constructionist thinking might be explained
as “while constructivism deals with knowledge formation in the head, constructionism
deals with knowledge formation outside the head between participants in a social
relationship” (Hruby, 2001, p. 48).
Constructivists believe that knowledge is constructed by an individual through
experiences (Karagiorgi & Symeou, 2005). “Constructivism proposes the existence of
many levels of abstractions for knowledge construction” (Karagiorgi & Symeou, 2005, p.
18). Piaget’s stages of development are constructs which are the result of operations that
we carry out repeatedly (Karagiorgi & Symeou, 2005).
Another way of understanding how constructionism differs from constructivism is
to look at it through the lens of multiple intelligences. Gardner (2008) is known for his
theory of multiple intelligences and explained what he termed interpersonal and
intrapersonal intelligences. “Interpersonal intelligence allows one to understand and
work with others. Intrapersonal intelligence allows one to understand and work with
oneself” (Gardner, 2008, p.18). Constructivism resembles intrapersonal intelligence and
constructionism relates to interpersonal abilities.
Constructionism can be described simplistically as “learning by making,”
according to Papert and Harel (1991, para 1). Papert and Harel noted this definition

46
appears simple; but truly, it is not. According to Papert and Harel, there is no consensus
on the one best way to learn. Individuals therefore learn by building what works for him
or her, and the products of learning should be his or her own. Constructionism, therefore,
involves an external product or process tangible in the perception of the learner (Papert &
Harel, 1991). Makerspaces provide opportunities for the process to drive inquiry through
construction of a tangible project. Papert’s theories are related to this idea (Papert &
Harel, 1991).
Building as learning. Constructionism is the theoretical framework behind
makerspaces based on the ideas of Papert because makerspaces are student centered and
focused around the process of building, making, or creating something tangible (Papert &
Harel, 1991). “Makerspaces provide youth with a place to imagine, design, create,
construct, and express ideas. Both individual and collaborative products emerge as
children tinker and invent” (Lamb, 2015, p. 56). The principles of design, engineering,
and building are related to constructionist theory (Lindeman & Anderson, 2016). Handson, physical building with such materials as blocks and Legos enable students to develop
important skills that apply to both building and creativity. “Block building helps children
develop concepts about balance, friction, tension, and gravity. . . . Empowered by
success, (students) often challenge themselves with more complex designs” (Van
Meeteren, 2015, p. 30). Makerspaces allow for STEM experiences such as engineering
and building (Fleming, 2015). Van Meeteren (2015) stated that how teachers set up
building experiences for children is important for developing engineering skills.
Materials provided, parameters of the problem, and the inclusion or exclusion of
information are important parts of the process (Van Meeteren, 2015). When these types
of experiences are presented in groups, students encourage each other to practice

47
engineering habits.
They use creativity to design the structure—flipping, rotating, or rearranging a
block or a track. Perseverance and optimism are the result when a child moves a
block or track incrementally until the system is successful…Children develop
social skills so they can keep building and learning together. (Van Meeteren,
2015, p. 31)
Constructionism in makerspaces. According to Kurti et al. (2014), “educational
makerspaces and maker education have the potential to revolutionize the way we
approach teaching and learning. The maker movement in education is built upon the
foundation of constructionism, which is the philosophy of hands-on learning through
building things” (p. 8). Students construct their own knowledge alongside other learners
in a makerspace (Kurti et al., 2014). As the students work together to meet challenges,
they are all actively engaged in both learning and teaching new things to others
(Karagiorgi & Symeou, 2005; Kurti et al., 2014).
Summary
This study examined the impact of makerspaces on the creative potential of
students who are exposed to them weekly in an elementary school media center.
Creativity has been noted to be an important construct for students to cultivate (Robinson
& Aronica, 2015; Runco, 2007). Makerspaces are designed for students to have
participatory experiences in making new things (Hlubinka, et al., 2013). The
opportunities in a makerspace can be very open-ended and range from artistic endeavors
using basic materials to highly technical projects using software, electronics, and
mechanical equipment (Fleming, 2015). STEM-related activities find a natural fit in
makerspaces.

48
STEM-rich maker activities are powerful places for this identity work because
they can accommodate a wide variety of interests and experiences, they blend
intellectual and socioemotional engagement, and they provide opportunities for
young people to develop pursue, persist with, and accomplish original ideas and
solutions in which they can take pride and ownership. (Bevan, Petrich et al.,
2014, p. 29)
Constructionist theory relates to this because the development of the ideas in
makerspaces can lead to student construction of knowledge within groups of makers
(Sheridan et al., 2014).
The next chapter focuses on the methodology involved in this action research
study. This is an embedded mixed-methods action research study that explored the
problem of how to increase creativity in students. The research questions focused on to
what extent exposure to makerspaces in a school media center impacts creativity, whether
there is an association between student scores on the TTCT and teacher ratings of
creativity on the SRBCSS, and teacher perceptions of student creativity after the students
are exposed to makerspaces. The researcher analyzed three data points to help make the
determination of the impact of makerspaces in Chapter 4. Chapter 5 discusses the
conclusions and directions for further study.

49
Chapter 3: Methodology
Purpose
The purpose of this action research study was to determine if makerspaces in an
elementary school library might influence the creativity of fifth-grade students at an
elementary school located in the piedmont region of a state in the southeastern United
States. For the purposes of this study, the school site will not be named to protect the
confidentiality of the study participants. The study took place during the first semester of
the 2016-2017 schoolyear. Students were exposed to makerspaces in a school media
center where they were given opportunities each week to work in a space where they
could make things alongside other students. The materials included Lego WeDo
Robotics and software, littleBits circuitry components, and other art materials. The
format of the makerspaces experiences was open-ended. Content themes, creative
problems, and challenges were given weekly to scaffold students; however, students
picked the projects they wished to work on. Materials were available to all students to
use for the creation of projects and solutions. Creativity was the focus of the study
because this construct was identified as an important skill for students to cultivate and
should be considered in schooling (Partnership for 21st Century Learning, 2016;
Robinson & Aronica, 2015).
Establishing makerspaces. Makerspaces were implemented in the school during
the 2015-2016 school year through the joint efforts of the media coordinator,
administrators, and a volunteer committee representing the stakeholders in the school.
The group became a subcommittee of the Media Technology Advisory Committee which
is a standing committee within the school charged with making decisions regarding the
school library media program. The group met and established the vision, goals, and

50
expectations for establishing makerspaces at the school. This information is displayed in
Appendix A. The team also spent time researching and gaining knowledge regarding
makerspaces as most group members were not familiar with the concept. The
Makerspaces Playbook for Schools is a comprehensive reference the group used as a
resource for getting started (Hlubinka et al., 2013). This text was published by the
founders of Make Magazine which is the group credited for the launch of the Maker
Movement in 2006 (Hlubinka et al., 2013). A grant was written by the media coordinator
for funding to initiate a makerspace. The school was awarded $1,500.00 which was used
to purchase the Lego and littleBits materials. Other paper, cardboard recyclables, and art
materials were collected. Space for storing and accessing materials was established
within the media center. The group determined stations would be available for students
to use. The stations all had STEM/STEAM-related themes including robotics, computer
coding, and moveable and recyclable art. Table 4 displays the materials available in the
media center makerspaces involved in this study.

This study began at the beginning of the 2016-2017 schoolyear. This was the
second year of makerspaces at the school involved in the study. During the first year of
implementation, third-grade students piloted the program based on time available in their

51
schedule. Students in the pilot group were first oriented to the materials in each station
and then given the chance to work at their station of choice once weekly. Kindergarten,
first- and second-grade students were introduced to a portion of the materials in the
makerspaces during their regularly scheduled media classes and had opportunities to use
the spaces once per week. This was also based on their scheduled time in the media
center during the first year of implementation.
The researcher began to implement makerspaces for current study during the
2015-2016 school year after receiving a grant to purchase materials students could use for
creative projects. The space in the media center where makerspaces were available was
an alcove with access to an interactive Promethean Board, tables with surfaces for
students to use dry erase markers, vertical Lego stations, Lego tubs, electronic devices,
and craft materials. Students had access to these materials during their weekly classes in
the media center.
The activities in the setting of the makerspaces were open-ended. According to
Sternberg (1995), creative work comes in different forms. Numerous models exist that
intend to enhance creativity in students (Partnership for 21st Century Learning, 2016).
Many of these were referred to in the literature review in Chapter 2. Elements of several
models were drawn from by the researcher. One example of this was the Four P model
first developed by Rhodes (1961). According to this model, four components are person,
process, product, and environment (Rhodes, 1961). The model focused on creativity as
multi-dimensional (Partnership for 21st Century Learning, 2016). The makerspace model
in this study was designed by the researcher to align components of the Four P model
(Rhodes, 1961) with the Four Cs from the Partnership for 21st Century Learning (2016).
Collaboration, communication, critical thinking, and creativity stand as the pillars of

52
activity in the makerspaces. The activities in the makerspaces setting involved in this
study also integrated STEM principals and content areas. According to Bevan, Gutwill,
Petrich and Wilkinson, (2014), STEM activities can synthesize different subjects and
interests along with engagement to promote further inquiry. The types of materials and
activities available for fifth-grade students in the makerspaces were purposefully
connected to their science and social studies curricula. Weekly open-ended themes such
as ecosystems, weather, bionics, games, and challenges were offered during makerspaces
sessions to make connections to content area units of study. Suggestions for projects and
activities were only given at times by the facilitator of the makerspaces (the media
coordinator, also the researcher) to scaffold students who struggled to come up with
ideas; however, students were not instructed or given specific tasks. The open-ended
nature of the sessions was purposeful to determine if the materials and activities
encouraged or enhanced the creativity of the students, independent of the researcher. A
common thread within the makerspaces activities encouraged in this study was the focus
on higher order thought process such as those described in four of the six levels of the
Revised Bloom’s Taxonomy (Marzano & Kendall, 2007). Table 5 shows the verbs,
materials, and situations inherent in the top four levels of Bloom’s revised taxonomy as
well as potential activities and products aligned with activities content areas themes and
challenges the students participated in during the 12-week study.

Description of Research Design and Approach
This study was an embedded mixed-methods action research design. Action
research is inquiry-based investigations of educational problems and situations within the
practitioner’s own educational setting (Efron & Ravid, 2013). “Action research is a
distinct kind of research that is different from other traditional educational research. It is
constructivist, situational, practical, systematic and cyclical” (Efron & Ravid, 2013, p. 7).
Action research is constructivist because the researchers involved are focused on
generating knowledge and making decisions to build new ideas (Efron & Ravid, 2013).
Action research is situational because the context of the study involves the researcher
directly (Efron & Ravid, 2013). Action researchers select problems and questions that
need to be investigated in the real-world context they work in, thus making it practical in
nature (Efron & Ravid, 2013). The research is systematic when it is carefully and
intentionally planned to yield valid and reliable results (Efron & Ravid, 2013). Action
research is cyclical because it begins and ends with questions and new knowledge that
may start another strain of research (Efron & Ravid, 2013).
The steps in the action research process were considered dynamic because there
were many unknown variables that the researcher addresses within the context of the
study (Creswell, 2014; Efron & Ravid, 2013). However, Efron and Ravid (2013) have
identified six cyclical steps in the action research process. Figure 1 shows these steps.

Figure 1. Action Research Steps (Efron & Ravid, 2013).
The researcher began by establishing the problem which is step one of Efron and
Ravid’s (2013) model. The problem the researcher wanted to explore was how to
increase students’ creative potential. The researcher wished to know whether
makerspaces could help students be more creative. Creativity was the root issue and
served as the catalyst for establishing makerspaces. Step two in the model was to
research the situation and collect evidence. The researcher did this by reviewing the
literature related to makerspaces and creativity. The researcher also established
constructionism as a theoretical framework. Step three was to design the study. The
study was an embedded mixed-methods study incorporating the collection and analysis of
both quantitative and qualitative data. Two quantitative data points were collected. The
first was gathered through the administration of a pre and postcreativity assessment of
students using makerspaces. The second one was gathered through a survey of the

56
students’ teachers’ perceptions of the creativity levels of the students after their exposure.
The qualitative data came from open-ended responses given by the teachers.
Step four of the cycle occurred during and after the study was conducted. The
data were analyzed and interpreted in step five. Microsoft Excel software was used to
conduct statistical tests of the quantitative data, and the qualitative data was coded for
themes. Once the analysis was complete, the results were shared as step six (Efron &
Ravid, 2013). According to Creswell (2014), mixed-methods research involves
the collection of both qualitative (open-ended) and quantitative (closed-ended)
data in response to research questions or hypotheses. It includes the analysis of
both forms of data. The procedures for both qualitative and quantitative data
collection and analysis need to be conducted rigorously (e.g., adequate sampling,
sources of information, data analysis steps). The two forms of data are integrated
in the design analysis through merging the data, connecting the data, or
embedding the data. These procedures are incorporated into a distinct mixed
methods design that also includes the timing of the data collection (concurrent or
sequential) as well as the emphasis (equal or unequal) for each data base. (p. 217)
This research was an embedded-design model. This type of approach to action
research is described by the form (quantitative or qualitative) dominating the study
(Creswell, 2014; Efron & Ravid, 2013). “One approach is nested within the larger
method of data collection. Either the nested or the dominating approach may be
qualitative or quantitative” (Efron & Ravid, 2013, pp. 46-47). This study represented a
QUAN(qual) model which Creswell (2014) described as one that “nests one or more
forms of data (quantitative or qualitative or both) within a larger design (e.g., a narrative
study, an ethnography, an experiment)” (p. 288). This study was focused on the

57
quantitative results of a pre and postassessment of student creativity followed by a
quantitative analysis of teacher rating scales of the students to support or contrast with the
prior results. The qualitative data point used was an open-ended questionnaire that was
coded for themes to provide insight to the data revealed by the quantitative measures.
Research Questions
The researcher investigated three questions. The first two were evaluated
quantitatively, and the third was evaluated qualitatively.
1. To what extent does student exposure to makerspaces in an elementary school
media center have an impact on student scores on the TTCT?
2. To what extent is there an association between student scores on the TTCT
and teacher ratings of creativity on the SRBCSS?
3. What are teacher perceptions of student creativity after student exposure to
makerspaces in an elementary school media center?
Population
The participants in the study included 70 fifth-grade students ranging in age from
9-11 years old as the sample population that received the treatment of makerspaces. The
students were heterogeneously grouped in five homeroom classes. The students
attending the elementary school where the study took place ranged from prekindergarten
to Grade 5. The location was a suburban community located 20 miles from a major city
in the southeast region of the United States. The school was a Title 1 school where 62%
of the population qualified for free or reduced lunch. This status enabled the school to
receive federal funding for reducing class size and providing other programs to support
student achievement. The demographics of the sample population are shown in Table 6.

The homeroom teachers of the students were also included in the study. Their
perceptions were quantitatively measured using the SRBCSS. They were also given an
open-ended questionnaire as a qualitative data collection instrument. The teachers were
informed in advance that their participation was voluntary and that they could withdraw
from the study at any time. Table 7 displays information about the teacher population.

Students in the school remained in self-contained classrooms with the same
teacher for most of the school day including instruction of the core subjects: English and
language arts, mathematics, science, and social studies. Students went outside of the
regular classroom to participate in special area classes with certified specialists in the
areas of physical education (PE), art, music, computers, and media once per day on a
rotating schedule. These special area classes lasted 45 minutes.

59
One reason the researcher selected the fifth grade to participate in this study is
because of the research done by Torrance (1967) noting students around the age of 8 or 9
often show a slump in creative behavior. This phenomenon has been called the “fourth
grade slump” (Torrance, 1967, p. 3). According to developmental psychologists such as
Piaget and Bruner, this is the time when students are shifting from the preconventional
stage of development to the conventional stage where they become more likely to
conform rather than diverge in their thinking and behavior (Runco, 2007). The
researcher hypothesized if students around this age were exposed to makerspaces and
given the chance to enhance their creativity, perhaps the slump might be avoided.
The researcher in this action research study was the media coordinator. The
student sample selected was a convenience sample consisting of all fifth-grade students in
the school. The teacher sample population consisted of each teacher assigned to a fifthgrade class. There were five fifth-grade classes in the school. A convenience sample is a
group available for the treatment without having to alter the normal routine to participate
in the study (Creswell, 2014).
Independent Variable
The treatment in this case was the exposure to makerspaces which served as the
independent variable. According to Creswell (2014), independent variables are the
variables that influence the outcomes. Makerspaces was the treatment variable in the
study because there was the potential for exposure to influence the outcomes of student
creativity. Makerspaces was an experience all students in the school were exposed to
weekly as part of the normal routine. This routine continued for the duration of the study
without altering the schedule or amount of time the students were exposed to
makerspaces. All fifth graders participated in makerspaces during their media class once

60
per week for 45 minutes. Another 45 minutes per week was also provided for these
students to partake in makerspaces in addition to their special area media class. This was
accomplished by allowing the students to come to makerspaces during their extra recess
time on the day they had PE in the gym. The students did not lose any opportunity for
physical activity because recess on these days was in addition to PE in the gym.
Dependent Variable
Creswell (2014) described the dependent variable as depending on the
independent variable. These are the outcomes of the treatment. The quantitative scores
from the TTCT, the data collected from the SRBCSS, and the qualitative results of the
teacher questionnaire given to measure student creativity was the variable. The study
was mixed methods, so both quantitative and qualitative outcomes were considered.
Data Collection Instrumentation and Materials
Three forms of data were collected for the purposes of this study. The first two
data points were quantitative and the third was qualitative. The first type of data
collected assessed students’ creative potential using the TTCT. According to Scholastic
Testing Services (2016), the TTCT is one of the most well-known, highly reliable tests of
creative thinking ability in the world. The test has two equivalent forms that can be used
for pre and posttesting (Cramond et al., 2005; Scholastic Testing Services, 2016). The
test was developed Paul Torrance, a psychologist and one of the foremost theorists about
creativity (Runco, 2007). This test was given to students as a pre and postassessment
before and after their exposure to makerspaces for a period of 12 weeks. Permission to
use this instrument was granted by Scholastic Testing Services (Appendix B). The
researcher also followed all Board of Education policies regarding the access and use of
student records (Appendix C.)

61
The second type of data collected was from the homeroom teachers of the
students in the study. The teachers were asked to rate each of their students using the
creativity portion of the SRBCSS. Also known as the Renzulli Scales, this instrument is
designed as a rating scale for teachers to assess characteristics of students for
identification in gifted and talented programs (Fioriello, 2016). This test was purchased
from Prufrock Press and is copyrighted material. The portion of the scales related to
creativity was used for teachers to gauge their students’ creativity levels after the students
were exposed to makerspaces. These scales were developed by Joseph Renzulli, an
educational psychologist who is known for his work related to the study of creativity in
gifted and talented students (Runco, 2007). Within the scales, there is a section with nine
statements specifically rating creativity as a characteristic of students to be evaluated.
Teachers were asked to rate each student on these nine statements related to creativity.
The third data point for this study was qualitative. An open-ended questionnaire
was given to the teachers of the students. The questionnaire addressed teacher
perceptions of student creative experiences in the makerspaces. The instrument included
their assessment of the value of creative experiences for their students. A pilot of the
instrument was given to teachers of another grade level at the school to establish validity.
Results from the questionnaire were coded for themes (Creswell, 2014).
Quantitative Data
TTCT. The TTCT is available through Scholastic Testing Services. The test
used was a test of figural analysis. Students were asked to draw and write titles and
descriptions (Scholastic Testing Services, 2016). The test is published in two forms so
there is the capability for pre and posttesting (Scholastic Testing Services, 2016).
According to Scholastic Testing Services (2016), the figural portion of the test is

62
designed for all levels of students, kindergarten through adults. Three activities using
pictures were given to students to assess fluency, elaboration, originality, resistance to
premature closure, and abstractness of titles (Scholastic Testing Service, 2016). The
figural part of the TTCT took 30 minutes to administer and complete. The test was
professionally scored by Scholastic Testing Service. Standardized scores were provided
for mental characteristics including emotional expressiveness, internal visualization,
storytelling articulateness, extending or breaking boundaries, movement or action,
humor, expressiveness of titles, richness of images, synthesis of lines or circles, fantasy,
and unusual visualization (Scholastic Testing Services, 2016). Two different types of
norms were available: grade related or age related (Scholastic Testing Services, 2016).
Norm tables with standardized scores and national percentiles were provided. Also of
interest is the creative index that classified the five standardized scores and 13 creative
strengths (Scholastic Testing Services, 2016).
The process for collecting the TTCT data involved administration of a pre and
postform of the test to the 70 students involved in the study. Prior to administration of
the pretest (Form A), the researcher met with the students in homerooms and explained
the purpose of the study, what the study entailed, and requested their participation.
Students received both a student assent letter (Appendix D) and a parent consent letter
(Appendix E). The letters outlined the study and informed the students and their parents
that participation was totally voluntary with no penalty for not participating. Students
and parents were also oriented about makerspaces and were told despite their
participation in the data collection, students would still have access to makerspaces as
part of the regularly planned curriculum. The students were informed that their
participation would be anonymous and no one including their teachers would have access

63
to their scores on the TTCT unless the students wished for them to and informed the
researcher of this in writing. The students were also told the scores would not in any way
be reflected in their grades or other forms of regular school assessments. It was made
clear that students could withdraw from the study at any time without retribution. All
forms were distributed 10 days before the administration of the test per district policy.
Teachers of the students were also oriented regarding the project prior to the start of the
school year. Each signed an assent form (Appendix F) outlining the study, his or her
role, and that participation was voluntary.
The pretest was given during the third week of school before the makerspace
activities began with the students. The test was given to each homeroom separately. Test
security was maintained as the forms were kept locked in a secure location prior to
administration of the test. Students did not have prior access to the test nor coaching on
how to take the test. The test was administered by the school’s Academically and
Intellectually Gifted (AIG) teacher who had been trained to give tests of this nature. The
groups were also monitored by a proctor. The test administrator read directly from the
manual, kept time accordingly, and handled all the procedural duties for giving the test.
The test was divided into three sections to test the components of fluency,
originality, elaboration, abstractness of titles, and resistance to premature closure. The
students were given 30 minutes to complete the test. The format of the test involved
drawing and writing (Scholastic Testing Service, 2016).
After the completion of the pretest, the students were then exposed to 12 weeks of
makerspaces as the treatment phase of the study. Twice weekly, the students had 45
minutes to engage in open-ended activities designed to promote higher order thinking
(Marzano & Kendall, 2007). The STEM-related theme activities connected to the fifth-

64
grade academic content standards. No specific projects were assigned, and grades were
not given. Students did receive oral feedback based on their participation and behavior as
they worked collaboratively and made products. Student work was displayed in the
makerspace area and students were encouraged to reflect on their experiences and share
ideas with others. Students created works of kinetic art, cardboard sculptures, simple
cars, machines, coding programs, videos, games, Lego robots, mazes, marble runs,
puzzles, models, toys, jewelry, and murals. At the end of the semester (and the
completion of the 12-week period), the students were given Form B of the TTCT as the
posttest to see whether there had been growth in creativity measured by this instrument
since the administration of Form A (the pretest). Forms A and B are aligned and parallel
in tested constructs related to creativity (Scholastic Testing Service, 2016). The tests
were then shipped to Scholastic Testing Services for professional scoring by trained
assessors. Scholastic Testing Services published the test and provided scoring services.
The results were tabulated, and the testing materials and data were returned to the
researcher. The results included individual and group score reports for both Forms A and
B. These score data are included as Appendix G. The researcher then performed a
statistical analysis of the TTCT data using a paired sample t test to determine if there was
a statistically significant difference between the pre and postassessment.
SRBCSS. The SRBCSS is a rating scale for teachers generally used for the
evaluation of students for gifted and talented programs in schools (Fioriello, 2016). The
SRBCSS examined teacher opinions of their students’ abilities in the areas of learning,
motivation, creativity, leadership, art, music, drama, communication, and planning
(Renzulli et al., 2010). For the purposes of this study, the section with nine statements
related to creativity was used and analyzed. The scales were completed by the five

65
teachers of the fifth-grade students who were exposed to makerspaces.
The second data point was the perceptions of the homeroom teachers of the fifth
graders involved in the study. Teachers were asked to assess student creativity based on
the SRBCSS. At the end of the 12-week treatment period, each teacher completed a
rating scale for each of her students using the section of the SRBCSS related to creativity
characteristics. This instrument was developed by Renzulli et al. (2010) and is often used
as a screening instrument for gifted education programs (Renzulli et al., 2010). The
format was a Likert-like rating scale that posed statements for which the teacher gave
each student a rating of the behavior demonstrated as never, very rarely, rarely,
occasionally, frequently, and always. Each child’s rating was scored separately by
adding the column totals and assigning a weight to each column. The sum of the
weighted column totals was determined to obtain the score for each dimension of the
scale. The statements related to imagination, sense of humor, nature of responses, risktaking, diverse perspectives, flexibility, mental activity, and conformity (Renzulli et al.,
2010). Groups score data from the SRBCSS was tabulated (Appendix H). The statistical
analysis of this data set was completed by determining if there was a correlation between
student posttest results of the TTCT Form B when compared to their teachers’ assessment
of each student on the creativity section of the SRBCSS.
To complete the comparative analysis of the TTCT Form B and the SRBCSS, a
Pearson’s R correlation was determined. The researcher chose to use these two
instruments based on the similarity of the constructs each evaluates within the students.
Table 8 highlights the connections between the instruments.

Qualitative Data
The final data point was the qualitative component. The embedded mixedmethods QUAN(qual) design of the study allowed for the qualitative data to add
description, explanation, and support to the quantitative results (Creswell, 2014). The
researcher coded responses from an open-ended questionnaire for themes related to
creativity. The questionnaire was developed by the researcher and piloted with a group
of teachers whose students had been exposed to makerspaces prior to the study.
Predetermined themes were considered prior to the development of the open-ended
questionnaire. The predetermined themes were developed based on the key components
of creativity defined and described by the Partnership for 21st Century Learning (2016).
These themes were communication, collaboration, novelty, and value. The questions
sought to get teachers to elaborate on their perceptions of their students’ creative
capabilities. Four open-ended questions were crafted to elicit the responses from the five
homeroom teachers involved in the study. The questions are displayed in Table 9.

The qualitative questionnaire was coded for themes using Tesch’s eight steps in

the coding process to analyze and code the data (Creswell, 2014). The researcher began
by reading the questionnaires and recording words and phrases which repeated and
related to one another. This was done to get a sense of the descriptions (Creswell, 2014).
The second step in the process was to re-read each document word by word (Creswell,
2014). The researcher went through each document word by word and considered the
underlying meaning. These thoughts were recorded and can be found in Appendix I.
Next, the researcher developed a list of topics and clustered similar ones together. The
topics were then grouped by frequency, uniqueness, or lack of fit. The list of topics was
abbreviated as codes and written next to the corresponding units as described in Tesch’s
eight steps of the coding process (Creswell, 2014). Categories were developed based on
the frequency of times they were coded. Similar topics and overlap between them were
considered. A list of final categories was determined by grouping related topics.

68
The questionnaire was comprised of questions to help gauge the perceptions of
the teachers with regard to the level of creativity they found in their students after their
exposure to makerspaces. These questions were developed based on the key components
of creativity as defined and described by the Partnership for 21st Century Learning
(2016): communication, collaboration, novelty, and value. The questions also related to
Torrance’s key constructs of fluency, flexibility, elaboration, originality, and resistance to
premature closure (Torrance, Ball, & Safter, 1992). These are the key ideas that are
covered on the TTCT.
The responses to the questions were coded for themes related to creativity
consistent with the quantitative assessments. Coding the data involved looking for key
ideas represented by the responses. Creswell (2014) stated that as categories emerge, the
researcher can analyze the data to look for codes on topics that fit naturally, codes that
are not expected, and codes that are unusual. Creswell also mentioned that the researcher
can approach coding in three ways. The first was is to let the codes emerge as the
information is collected. The second way is to use predetermined codes and then fit the
data to them. The third way is to use a combination of the emerging and predetermined
codes. The researcher used a combination of emerging and predetermined codes because
the constructs in the questionnaire were specifically aligned to the constructs in the TTCT
and the SRBCSS.
The overall goal of the questionnaire was to determine if teachers thought
makerspaces were a worthwhile endeavor for their students. A pilot questionnaire was
given to teachers of a different grade level of students also participating in makerspaces
not included in the quantitative data analysis. A copy of this questionnaire is available in
Appendix J.

69
Validity and Reliability
Creswell (2014) stated steps should be taken to insure the process of research is
both valid and reliable. Data were triangulated from three data points as one way to meet
this goal. The first two measures of data were quantitative and measure the creative
behaviors of students from two different perspectives (student and teacher) before and
after the exposure to makerspaces. The third measure was qualitative and sought to
expand on teacher perceptions of the students to descriptively determine what kind of
impact makerspaces had on students.
The instruments chosen have documented reliability and validity. One reason the
TTCT is considered a highly valid and reliable measure is due to the results of a 40-year
longitudinal study that Torrance began in 1958. Torrance tracked the students over
several decades. He administered the TTCT to students in Minnesota between 1958 and
1964. He followed their progress in high school and beyond through follow-up
questionnaires to see if students who scored high on the test demonstrated creative
behaviors later in life. He found that there was statistically significant impact proving the
predictive value of the instrument. His first follow-up of students found
all of the creativity predictors . . . to be significant at the .01 level. By combining
the scores on the creativity test battery administered in 1959 into a total creativity
score to predict the combined creativity criteria derived in 1971, a canonical
correlation of .51 was obtained for the full sample. (Cramond et al., 2005, p. 285)
Administration of the TTCT was handled in a secure fashion. A qualified administrator
handled the administration and scoring of the test at the school site. The researcher was
not involved directly in the administration and scoring of the testing.
The SRBCSS is also widely used and proven. Renzulli et al. (2010) analyzed the

70
components of the instrument using SPSS-S. Kaiser’s criterion for estimating
eigenvalues was used. The SSBCSS administration manual stated that four factors
comprise the constructs of the instrument: learning, creativity, motivation, and leadership.
The creativity factor described the degree to which students exhibited various
creativity characteristics. A student with a high rating on this factor would exhibit
characteristics such as the ability to generate many ideas (fluent thinking), the
ability to generate unique ideas (original thinking), and a willingness to fantasize
and manipulate ideas. (Renzulli et al., 2010, p. 13)
Renzulli et al. found
the item composition of the empirically extracted factors was nearly the same as
the item composition of the four a priori factors. We found minor differences on
three items. Items 14 and 19 loaded on both Factor 1 (learning) and Factor 2
(creativity). Item 36 loaded most strongly on Factor 4 (motivation), but loaded
almost as strongly on Factor 3 (leadership), which was judgmentally perceived to
be a Leadership item. In summary, the derived factors were nearly identical to the
judgmental factors, providing strong support for the construct validity of the
scales. (p. 13)
Table 10 displays the factors and their correlations.

Renzulli et al. (2010) also determined the instrument was reliable by computing
Chronbach’s alpha reliability estimates for the four scales: learning, creativity,
leadership, and motivation. The alpha reliability coefficients for the learning, creativity,
motivation, and leadership factors were r = .91, r = .84, r = .90, r = .87, respectively. The
alpha reliability for the instrument as a whole was r = .97. These coefficients provide
strong support for the internal consistency of the instrument.
The qualitative questionnaire that was given to the teachers of the students in the
study aimed to collect descriptive data that were coded for themes of the perceptions of
teachers and the impact that makerspaces have on their students. The questionnaire was
piloted with a group of teachers of another grade level whose students were also exposed
to makerspaces to establish validity. Each teacher’s responses were compared to the
predetermined themes as well the answers of each other. To insure the questions were
valid, the researcher asked the respondents if their ideas aligned with the themes. To
insure the themes were reliable, the researcher determined which questions had at least a
rate of 75% related responses (or three of the four teachers answering the pilot
questionnaire with consistent ideas). This helped the researcher to determine interrater
reliability (Creswell, 2014). Table 11 shows the results of the interrater response analysis
and how the four questions used in the final questionnaire were chosen.

Data Collection
The researcher used a convergent methods design involving embedded mixed
methods. According to Creswell (2014), this method involves combining both
quantitative and qualitative data collection methods and then analyzing them to see if the
results confirm or disprove each other.
The key assumption of this approach is that both qualitative and quantitative data
provide different types of information—of then detailed views of participants
qualitatively and scores on instruments quantitatively—and together they yield
results that should be the same. (Creswell, 2014, p. 219)
The quantitative data collected were pre and posttest scores from the TTCT. Prior to the
exposure to makerspaces, the test was administered to the sample population. The figural
analysis instrument was administered by a qualified test administrator and proctor. After
the completion of the preassessment using the TTCT, the students were exposed to
makerspaces in the school library twice per week for 12 weeks. After 12 weeks (24

73
sessions), the students were given another form of the assessment. The assessment
provided two mirrored versions for pre and postanalysis Forms A and B (Scholastic
Testing Services, 2016). In addition, quantitative data from the teachers of the students
were gathered using the SRBCSS. The teachers completed the rating scale which was
scored yielding a numerical ranking.
The qualitative data collected an open-ended questionnaire to share data related to
their perceptions of how makerspaces influenced their students’ creativity. This
qualitative measure was intended to gauge teacher impressions about the impact of
makerspaces on the creative output of their students. The researcher developed the
questionnaire to align with the skills identified as essential by the Partnership for 21st
Century Learning (2016). Under the section on creativity, these categories were
identified: thinking creatively, working creatively with others, and implementing
innovations. The questions also related to fluency, elaboration, originality, and flexibility
of ideas (Torrance, 1992).
Data analysis
According to Creswell (2014), “the challenge in a convergent mixed methods
design is how to actually converge or to merge the data” (p. 222). In the case of this
study, there were two quantitative databases analyzed and compared to the qualitative
data in a side-by-side comparison. The data from the TTCT and the SRBCSS were
compared first. Then the data from the teacher questionnaire were compared to the
quantitative results. “Mixed methods writers call this a side-by-side approach because
the researcher makes the comparison within a discussion, presenting first one set of
findings and then the other” (Creswell, 2014, p. 222).
The quantitative data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel software. The pre and

74
postscores from the TTCT were analyzed using a paired sample t test. The purpose of
this dependent sample t test was to compare the means on a single dependent variable
(Urdan, 2011). The paired sample was the data from the pre- and post-TTCT
administrations. The researcher looked for differences in the results of student scores that
could possibly be linked to the treatment of makerspaces.
The data from the SRBCSS were analyzed using the Pearson product-moment
correlation coefficient (Pearson’s R). The researcher looked for the population sample’s
scores on two variables at the same time. The first data point variable was the scores
from the post-TTCT (Urdan, 2011). The second variable was the scores for each child on
the SRBCSS the teachers completed for the students in their homerooms after the
exposure to makerspaces. The researcher wanted to know what kind of correlation might
have existed between student performance on the TTCT and teacher perceptions on the
SRBCSS. The researcher determined whether there was a correlation by looking at the
direction and strength of the correlation coefficients (Urdan, 2011).
The qualitative questionnaire was coded for themes. The questionnaire was
developed to align with the concepts of creativity from the Partnership for 21st Century
Learning (2016), the concepts on the TTCT, and the four key areas identified on the
SRBCSS. According to Creswell (2014), researchers may use predetermined codes or
may look for codes which emerge. The researcher used a combination of both because it
seemed probable the open-ended responses of the teachers might elicit themes beyond
those predetermined by the alignment of the questionnaire. The researcher used Tesch’s
Eight Steps in the Coding Process to analyze and code the data (Creswell, 2014). The
steps are displayed in Table 12.

75
Table 12
Tesch’s Eight Steps in the Coding Process
Step 1

Get a sense of the whole. Read all the transcriptions carefully.
Perhaps jot down some ideas as they come to mind as you read.

Step 2

Pick one document (i.e., one interview)-the most interesting one, the
shortest, the one on the top of the pile. Go through it, asking
yourself, “What is this about?” Do not think about the substance of
the information but its underlying meaning. Write thoughts in the
margin.

Step 3

When you have completed this task for several participants, make a
list of all topics. Cluster together similar topics. Form these topics
into columns, perhaps arrayed as major, unique, and leftover topics.

Step 4

Now take this list and go back to your data. Abbreviate the topics as
codes and write the codes next to the appropriate segments of the
text. Try this preliminary organizing scheme to see fi new categories
and codes emerge.

Step 5

Find the most descriptive wording for your topics and turn them into
categories. Look for ways of reducing your total list of categories by
grouping topics that relate to each other. Perhaps draw lines between
your categories to show interrelationships.

Step 6

Make a final decision on the abbreviation for each category and
alphabetize these codes.

Step 7

Assemble the data material belonging to each category in one place
and perform a preliminary analysis.

Step 8

If necessary, recode your existing data.

(Creswell, 2014, p. 198).

The researcher used the information gathered from the coding to look for
connections between the open-ended questionnaire and the findings of the TTCT and the
SRBCSS data to provide more description and explanation of the results.
Measures for Ethical Protection
Creswell (2014) outlined the types of ethical issues that occur in mixed-methods
research and cautioned researchers to anticipate issues and plan how they might be

76
addressed appropriately. Prior to the study, the researcher obtained permission to use the
site where the researcher works with the population to be studied. The study took place
during regularly scheduled classes and did not go beyond the scope of activities normally
planned for the students. Makerspaces were implemented in the school prior to the study
and most likely will remain in place in some form or fashion for some time. The
researcher informed the parents of the fifth-grade students as well as the teachers, faculty,
and staff at the school regarding the purpose of the study. The informed consent form for
parents outlined the purpose, procedures, and description of the pre and posttest
experience. The student assent form also ensured confidentiality and privacy (Efron &
Ravid, 2013).
The researcher also submitted an application to the university’s Institutional
Review Board (IRB). The standards set forth for ethics and professionalism were
adhered to. The researcher reviewed the policies set forth by the school district regarding
standards for research ethics and collection of data from students. Students signed a
letter of assent. Letters of permission were obtained to use the testing instruments
selected in line with policies set forth by the school’s Board of Education. The students
involved gave written assent, and their parents were asked to complete an informed
consent form. The teachers of the students also signed an assent to participate.
Summary
This embedded mixed-methods action research study was used to determine the
creative impact of makerspaces in an elementary school media center. The sample group
consisted of fifth-grade students enrolled in a Title 1 elementary school. The feedback
from the study was used to inform future decision making related to the use of
makerspaces in the school. Two quantitative instruments were compared with qualitative

77
responses from a teacher questionnaire to determine the effectiveness of the makerspaces.
Chapter 4 reviews the data collected and presents the findings from their analysis.
Results from the dependent variable t test, the Pearson’s R test, and the coded data from
the teacher questionnaire were synthesized to look for patterns and themes.

78
Chapter 4: Results
Introduction
This chapter provides the results of an action research study on the impact of
makerspaces in an elementary school media center. This mixed-methods study
investigated the use of makerspaces and how creativity of the fifth-grade students
involved in the study was impacted. The study was an embedded mixed-methods design
and included three different data points within the larger design (Creswell, 2014).
The mixed-methods approach included two quantitative data collection
instruments and one qualitative instrument. The instruments used were the TTCT and the
SRBCSS. The TTCT was given to students participating in the study as a pre and
postassessment. A statistical analysis using a paired sample t test calculated the pre and
postdata using Microsoft Excel. The SRBCSS was given to the teachers of the students
after they participated in makerspaces in the school media center twice weekly for 12
weeks. A Pearson’s R correlational analysis was used to compare the postassessment
scores from the TTCT with the data from the SRBCSS. The qualitative instrument was a
questionnaire developed to examine perceptions of the teachers of the students involved
in the study. This was done to determine whether teacher perceptions and feedback
supported the use of makerspaces as a means for helping students become more creative.
The questionnaire was piloted with a group of teachers (whose students had been exposed
to makerspaces prior to this study) during the semester before the treatment for this study
began. After refinement, the questionnaire was given to the teachers of the students in
the study upon completion of the 12-week treatment. Tesch’s Eight Steps in the Coding
Process (Creswell, 2014) was used to analyze the questionnaire data and code for themes
to further explain the quantitative data. This chapter includes descriptions of the

79
participants in the study, the setting for the study, and the data collection methods. This
is followed by an analysis of results based on the research questions which framed the
study.
Data Analysis Strategy
The strategy for data analysis was to use both quantitative and qualitative data to
determine if any or all had positive results in terms of the effectiveness of makerspaces.
The quantitative results focused on two dimensions: growth of student creativity and then
the association of that growth with teacher perceptions of student creativity. Microsoft
Excel spreadsheets were used to statistically analyze the data and complete calculations
for a paired sample t test and a Pearson’s R correlational analysis. The qualitative results
were then used to add further descriptions to either support or rebuke the quantitative
finding. The researcher used Tesch’s Eight Steps in the Coding Process to analyze an
open-ended questionnaire completed by the teachers.
Findings
The results of each data point were analyzed by their application to each of the
three research questions that framed the study. Each data point aligned with one of the
research questions. Using the embedded mixed-methods QUAN(qual) allowed for the
qualitative data to further describe and explain the quantitative results (Creswell, 2014).
The research questions and the analysis of results are presented in the following section.
Research Question 1: To what extent does student exposure to makerspaces
in an elementary school media center have an impact on student scores on the
TTCT? Table 13 shows the results of a paired sample t test for differences in student
scores on the pre- and post-TTCT. The statistical analysis compared the results of Form
A and Form B. The test was administered to the students in the study using Form A

80
before the first week of their participation in makerspaces. Form B was given to the
students after 12 weeks of participation in makerspaces.

The statistical analysis of the data showed the students taking similar forms of the
TTCT as a pre and postassessment scored a higher mean on Form B, the postassessment;
however, the two independent samples did not differ from each other significantly in their
average scores on the TTCT. This means that the difference was not greater than what
one would expect to see between two samples or the standard error (Urdan, 2011).
According to Urdan (2011), if the P value is less than an alpha value of .05, the null
hypothesis is rejected. In this case, the P value using a two-tail analysis .08 was greater
than .05, so the null hypothesis was true and the difference in the mean of the pre and
postsample was not considered statistically significant.
The researcher reviewed the individual test scores of the students and noted one
outlier score that seemed to skew the data. The student in question dropped 43 points
from the pretest to the posttest. The researcher also noted that this student was absent for
four of the sessions when the class had opportunity to participate in makerspaces. When

81
the researcher completed a paired sample t test for the group again excluding the outlier
score, the P value changed; and the two-tail analysis resulted in a P value of .03 which
would qualify the difference as significant because the value is less than the alpha value
of .05. The results of the second t test are reported in Table 14.

In addition to analyzing the data of the entire group, the researcher also
disaggregated the data by gender and ethnicity. Tables 15 and 16 show the pre and
postresults of the students when grouped by gender. Tables 17, 18, and 19 show the
analysis of the data based on the ethnicities of the group.

Research Question 2: To what extent is there an association between student
scores on the TTCT and teacher ratings of creativity on the SRBCSS? Table 20
shows the correlation values when comparing student postassessment scores from the
TTCT and their teachers’ ranking of each child’s creativity characteristics on the
SRBCSS. Each homeroom teacher filled out a ranking form resulting in an individual
score for each child. That score was compared with the TTCT Form B to note any
correlation.

The TTCT scores were compared to the SRBCSS scores using Pearson’s R test.
Using the correlation value of r>+/-0.05, the statistical analysis showed a value of

85
r=.395783608 denoted a positive correlation between teacher rankings of students on the
SRBCSS and students postassessment scores on the TTCT (Urdan, 2011).
Research Question 3: What are teacher perceptions of student creativity
after student exposure to makerspaces in an elementary school media center?
The qualitative questionnaire was coded for themes using Tesch’s eight steps in the
coding process to analyze and code the data (Creswell, 2014). Those steps were
described in Chapter 3. Categories were developed based on the frequency of times they
were coded. Similar topics and overlap between them were considered. A list of final
categories was determined by grouping related topics. The researcher determined there
were three major categories, and the codes were denoted by the first three letters of each
category. These categories are displayed in Figure 2.

Figure 2. Major Coded Themes from the Open-ended Teacher Questionnaire.

86
The researcher reviewed each teacher’s questionnaire carefully and looked for
themes which seemed to repeat themselves among the five teachers’ responses. The
researcher then went back and determined whether the responses included ideas in
alignment with the predetermined themes that framed the questions on the questionnaire.
Specifically, the theme of communication seemed to appear the most. While the
predetermined themes of collaboration, value, and novelty were not explicitly stated in
the raw data, indirect connections can be made to these themes. The comments directly
related to the three themes (communication, engagement, and motivation) are reported in
Tables 21, 22, and 23.

“Some students can clearly communicate with others now. The listening
skills of many students have improved. They also take turns talking and
validating each other’s ideas and thoughts.”

5

“Students are better able to communicate new ideas effectively in problemsolving during Math. They are now more confident in trying new attempts
at approaching problems knowing that it is okay to fail and learn from
mistakes.”

Summary
Action research data were collected to determine if makerspaces in an elementary
school media center had an impact on student creativity. To measure this, a mixedmethods approach was used. Two quantitative data sets were collected followed by a
quantitative collection of data using an open-ended questionnaire with the teachers of the
students in the study. The first quantitative data point was to determine if there was
growth on a creativity test given pre and posttreatment phase. The instrument used was
the TTCT. The statistical analysis used was a t test to determine if there was a significant
difference in the pre and posttest. The researcher noticed an outlier score from one
student in the data and decided to complete the t test twice: the first time including all
students in the sample, and the second time excluding the outlier score. The results of the
first t test including all students in the sample showed there was growth; however, the P
value was greater than the alpha score of .05, so the null hypothesis was true and the
difference in the means of the pre and postsamples is not considered statistically
significant. The second t test was completed without the outlier score and resulted in the

89
P value of .03 which is less than the alpha score of .05. The null hypothesis in this case
was false, and the results would be considered statistically significant when the outlier
score was excluded.
Further disaggregation of the data showed no significance in growth comparing
the pre and posttest scores based on gender. There were also no significant gains in
scores when comparing ethnic groups individually except for the Hispanic group. The
mean of the pre-TCTT scores for the Hispanic group was 102.3125. The mean of the
post-TCTT scores for the same group was 108.125. The results of the paired sample t
test for this data set resulted in a P value of .043353329 which is less than the alpha of
.05. This showed significant growth in creativity scores on the TTCT for the Hispanic
group.
The second quantitative data point was a comparison between student scores on
the postadministration of the TTCT and their teacher’s ranking of them on the SRBCSS,
an instrument used by teachers to rank student creativity. The statistical analysis for this
data set was completed by using a Pearson’s R test for correlation. Using the correlation
value of r>+/-0.05, the statistical analysis showed a value of r=.395783608 denoting a
positive correlation between teacher rankings of students on the SRBCSS and student
postassessment scores on the TTCT.
The final set of data considered was the descriptive information provided by
teacher open-ended responses on a questionnaire related to their students’ creativity. The
descriptive data were coded for themes using Tesch’s Eight Steps for Decoding Data
(Creswell, 2014). Three themes emerged from teacher examples of how their students
displayed creativity. They found examples of their students’ creativity to be related to
student communication, engagement, and motivation. The embedded mixed-methods

90
design enabled the researcher to use the qualitative data to further support and explain the
results of the quantitative analysis. In this case, the descriptive data offered insight into t
teacher perceptions of their students’ creativity in the areas of communication,
engagement, and motivation. The results of these data are further discussed in Chapter 5.

Chapter 5: Discussion
Introduction
The purpose of this chapter is to discuss the results of an action research study
completed to determine if makerspaces in an elementary school media center had an
impact on student creativity. Makerspaces in this study involved space and materials in a
communal environment where students could freely imagine and make at will (Lamb,
2015). Constructionist theory suggests students learn through physical construction and
ideas evolve through hands-on, real-world processes (Papert & Harel, 1991). The
researcher used a mixed-methods action research model to investigate the creative impact
makerspaces had on students in a maker environment. The study involved 70 fifth
graders at a Title 1 school in the southeastern United States. The students were exposed
to makerspaces twice weekly for 12 weeks as part of their regularly planned curriculum.
The embedded mixed-methods design used three data points: two quantitative and one
qualitative. These methods were used to investigate how makerspaces impacted the
students.
Interpretation of the Findings
The researcher interpreted the findings of the study by analyzing student growth
in their creative capacity as well as teacher perceptions of student creativity. The
researcher looked at the students individually and as a group. The researcher also
considered the ratings and comments of the teachers with regard to student creativity.
Data collected addressed the three research questions from the study. Discussion of these
findings are reported here.
Research Question 1: To what extent does student exposure to makerspaces
in an elementary school media center have an impact on student scores on the

92
TTCT? Seventy students were assessed on Form A of the TTCT prior to their 12-week,
twice weekly exposure to makerspaces. The students also took Form B of the test after
the treatment to determine if there were gains in student creativity as measured by the
TTCT. A paired sample t test was used and found the mean score to be higher for Form
B (the postassessment); however, the two independent samples did not differ from each
other significantly. In this case, the P value using a two-tail analysis was .08, which is
greater than .05. This meant the null hypothesis was true, and the difference in the mean
of the pre and postsample was not considered statistically significant. Upon review of the
individual student data, the researcher found that one student’s score was an outlier. The
student in question dropped 43 points between the pre and postassessment which may
have distorted the range of the scores. After investigating further, it was also noted that
the student was absent for four of the weekly sessions. When considering the data
excluding this one student’s scores, the t test resulted in a significant P value using a twotail analysis, P=.03, which meant the gains were considered significant.
The researcher also disaggregated the data by gender and ethnicity to gain further
insight into specific groups of students. The results of the paired sample t tests for girls
and for boys independently did not show significant gains; neither did the results of the
same type of analysis when considering the ethnic groups for African-Americans and
Whites. There was however a significant result for growth between the pre and posttest
results for Hispanic students. The P value using a two-tail analysis was P=.04, meaning
the growth was considered significant for the Hispanic subgroup.
The analysis of the growth in student scores suggests students can grow creatively
when provided with scheduled makerspace time. Environments such as the makerspaces
in the media center involved in this study can provide opportunity for students to engage

93
in activities such as those described in the literature review and methodology. The
environment in this study allowed time, space, and materials where students could
construct not only products but also grow creatively. This thought aligns with
constructionist philosophy also described in the literature review (Ackermann, n.d.;
Blikstein, 2013; Donaldson, 2014; Hjorth & Wilensky, 2014; Papert, 1993; Papert &
Harel, 1991; Whitehouse, 2009). Further evidence of the connection to constructionism
lies in the fact the students were given the opportunity to participate in creative making
activities with others (Hruby, 2001). This is important because it represents a shift in the
traditional role of the media center from quiet storehouses of information to active
learning centers. The media center in the study became an environment where creativity
had a chance to incubate through makerspaces. The creative growth of the students
involved was positive.
Research Question 2: To what extent is there an association between
student scores on the TTCT and teacher ratings of creativity on the SRBCSS?
Upon completion of the 12-week treatment period, the five homeroom teachers of the
students in the study completed a ranking of each student using the SRBCSS. The
section the teachers completed was a Likert-type rating scale. The scale scores were
tabulated and the means of the SRBCSS and the TTCT posttest were analyzed using
Pearson’s R test for correlation. Using the correlation value of r>+/-0.05, the statistical
analysis showed a value of r = .395783608 and denoted a positive correlation between
teacher rankings of students on the SRBCSS and student postassessment scores on the
TTCT (Urdan, 2011). This meant there was a relationship between how the teachers
rated student creativity and how they performed on the post-TTCT. This is important
because creativity tests have been criticized for their subjectivity (Kim, 2010; Plucker et

94
al., 2004). The positive correlation between the opinions of the teachers on the SRBCSS
and the results of the students on the TTCT support the idea that the teachers had related
understanding of their students’ creative capabilities. This means that the growth
evidenced by the TTCT is supported by teacher scores on the SRBCSS.
Research Question 3: What are teacher perceptions of student creativity
after student exposure to makerspaces in an elementary school media center? An
open-ended questionnaire was used to explore the five teachers’ perceptions of their
students’ creativity after the students had been exposed to makerspaces in an elementary
school media center twice weekly for a period of 12 weeks. The questionnaire probed
into teacher ideas related to how makerspaces had impacted their students’ creativity.
The questions were structured around themes from the research used to evaluate
creativity: communication, collaboration, novelty, and value (Partnership for 21st
Century Learning, 2016). Teacher responses from the questionnaires were coded for
themes using Tesch’s Eight Steps for finding coded data themes (Urdan, 2011). The
three major themes that evolved from teacher data as they described their students were
communication, engagement, and motivation. Teacher comments added descriptive
support for the quantitative data.
Communication. The Partnership for 21st Century Learning described
communication as one of the four important skills needed to be successful in the future.
The (P21) Framework emphasizes effectively using oral, written, and nonverbal
communication skills for multiple purposes (e.g., to inform, instruct, motivate,
persuade and share ideas); effective listening; using technology to communicate;
and being able to evaluate the effectiveness of communication efforts – all within
diverse contexts. (Dilley, Fishlock & Plucker, n.d., p. 1)

95
Communication was also cited as a critical component of the makerspaces environment
and is a key element in what distinguishes makerspaces from other creative environments
such as workshops and studios (Fleming, 2015; Hlubinka et al., 2013; Koh & Abbas,
2015). Responses from each of the five teachers on the questionnaire addressed
communication in relationship to their students’ creativity. The researcher noticed
teacher comments related to communication and the application of creative practices such
as fluency of ideas. Teacher 5 shared the following comment on the questionnaire:
“Students are better able to communicate new ideas effectively in problem-solving during
Math. They are now more confident in trying new attempts at approaching problems
knowing that it is okay to fail and learn from mistakes.” The makerspaces environment
in the study encouraged communication and communal effort. This aligns with
constructionist theory which emphasizes that students can gain insight from working with
others (Donaldson, 2014; Papert,1993; Papert & Harel, 1991; Whitehouse, 2009).
Engagement. The Glossary of Education Reform (2016) stated, “student
engagement refers to the degree of attention, curiosity, interest, optimism, and passion
students show when they are learning or being taught, which extends to the level of
motivation they have to learn and progress in their education” (para 1). Teacher 5 made
the following comment on the questionnaire: “When given the opportunity, students
follow through on their ideas. Having materials gives them both ideas and a means for
completing their ideas.” According to this teacher, the materials gave the students the
means for development of creative ideas. This is an essential component of
constructionist theory (Halverson & Sheridan, 2014; Papert & Harel 1991). The physical
making is the catalyst for inquiry in makerspaces. This leads to the development of new
knowledge. Teachers affirmed this as they reported how students were driven to research

96
about the things they were making.
Motivation. Motivation can be defined as the cause for why someone does
something (Center on Education Policy, 2012). Motivation can be considered in at least
four different dimensions according to the Center on Education Policy (2012).
Motivation may be influenced by a person’s belief that he or she is capable of something,
his or her sense of control or autonomy, whether there is interest or value in completing a
task, and whether there are rewards (internal or external) for doing something (Center on
Education Policy, 2012). Teacher 1 commented, “I had a group that got very excited
when they had to figure out how to create a pond as part of our ecosystem unit. They
seemed motivated by the task itself.” According to this teacher, the joy of the process
motivated some of her students to come up with creative ideas. The researcher in this
study often used design challenges to motivate students. The researcher found trial and
error as the primary method the students used for problem solving such challenges when
working in makerspaces. Without the physical materials, the process would have been
difficult for the students. The students developed their plans based on the supplies
available. When their ideas did not work, they then began to think beyond what was in
front of them and request additional items because they were motivated by the challenge.
The three emerging themes do overlap. As Teacher 1 commented, “The students
are more verbal with creative ideas. I have noticed that they are more in character when
we do Social Studies simulation diaries.” This comment pointed to the theme of
communication through student verbal participation, yet also related to engagement
because the students seemed to be interacting on a more intense level by getting in
character with the subjects of the historical diaries they were creating. Engagement as a
theme also overlapped with motivation and was evidenced by the comments of Teacher

97
3: “I’ve loved hearing how excited they get when they know they can offer other
possibilities to the group. The talking gets loud and animated, but in a productive way.”
The noise level reflected student excitement, and the teacher valued the productivity and
engagement.
Implications for Practice
The results of this study suggest there are reasons to consider implementing
makerspaces in media centers to promote creativity in students. The quantitative results
of the comparison between the pre- and post-TTCT scores showed with the exclusion of
one outlier score, there was statistical significance in the growth of creativity scores
before and after exposure to makerspaces. Students with opportunities to construct and
build may find their creative ideas develop when physical resources are available for
them to work with (Papert & Harel, 1991). Papert (1993) suggested construction of ideas
relies on something tangible, but it is more than that. Papert also wrote about how
students he observed in a junior high school art class might approach other tasks such as
mathematics in a constructionist environment: “It allowed time to think, to dream, to
gaze, to get at new idea and try it and drop it or persist, time to talk, time to see other
people’s work and their reaction to yours” (Papert & Harel, 1991, para 10). This kind of
environment is the embodiment of makerspaces. Makerspaces in media centers have the
potential to positively impact student creativity. This notion suggests new and
unconventional uses of traditional library space.
The inclusion of makerspaces in school media centers and libraries may support
connections to the growth of 21st century skills such as the Four Cs: communication,
collaboration, critical thinking, and creativity (Partnership for 21st Century Learning,
2016). Makerspaces provide opportunities for all four of these skills to be enhanced.

98
Communication in the media center can be accessed through print, digital, and human
interaction when students research and share their creations. In order to collaborate, the
communal aspect of makerspaces must be present. Critical thinking is used as students
work on challenges or engage in problem solving or refining innovations. All of this
supports creative expression (Bowler, 2014).
The second body of quantitative data collected showed a positive correlation
between student scores on the TTCT and teacher perceptions of their creative abilities
evidenced on the SRBCSS. This showed teacher perceptions aligned with the results of
the TTCT. This speaks a case for the reliability and validity of the results of the TTCT.
It also gave the teachers a new tool to use for formative data collection. Another
recommendation is for teachers to use tools such as the SRBCSS to evaluate their
individual students so they might know them better as creative learners. The type of data
teachers may gain from this form of assessment could give a better picture of each
student holistically versus relying solely on more traditional, summative forms of
assessment. According to Robinson and Aronica (2015), the challenges of the future
demand a different kind of schooling and this includes how we prepare and assess
children.
The final set of data was qualitative and gathered for gaining more descriptive
information regarding student experiences with makerspaces from the perspective of their
teachers. The feedback from an open-ended questionnaire was coded for themes that
emerged based on teacher observations of students involved with makerspaces. Three
major themes were communication, engagement, and motivation.
The first theme involved was communication. Papert and Harel (1991) suggested
learning happens by making in a way that is communal. This aligns with constructionist

99
theory that learning is a social process focused around something physical. In
makerspaces, the activity can be social. The making can be discussed, questioned, talked
about, and commented on. This involves communication. The recommendation is to
implement makerspaces in libraries and media centers that have traditionally been quiet
spaces. This nontraditional use of libraries and media centers may bring about new ways
of looking at such common areas in schools. Advances in technology, digitalization, and
less dependency on print materials have changed the physical needs of media center
environments. Less space is needed for stacks of books, and more space is needed for
collaboration (Sobolik et al., 2014; Stanley, 2011). To meet the needs of students and use
space effectively, the recommendation is to transform dead space into active learning
environments facilitated through makerspaces.
The next two themes the teachers suggested in the qualitative data were
engagement and motivation. The recommendation regarding these themes is to allow
learning to be student driven. The teachers commented on how the students transferred
their inquiry to engagement related to classroom projects. In makerspaces, the activities
were both student centered and based loosely on content by means of themes, scenarios,
and challenges presented by the facilitator. In this way, curricular needs were met while
still providing tools for students to use for their own inquiry. When students were given
the physical tools, materials, and opportunities needed right there in front of them, it
sparked ideas, interest, and engagement (Papert, 1993).
This tied directly into the third theme of motivation. The teachers commented on
changes in student energy levels and how excited they got about what they were creating.
The power of engagement was fueled by the motivation of the students.
Csikszentmihalyi (1997) would call this creative flow. This is the term described an

100
optimal experience because of deep task engagement coupled with the feeling of wellbeing. The experience of the work intrinsically motivates the students to stick with the
task (Csikszentmihalyi, 1997).
The positive results of the study suggest media coordinators, teachers, and others
who work with students at this level might incorporate the types of activities students
were exposed to in makerspaces to see similar gains. The constructionist methods used
in the makerspaces enabled students to grow creatively. Specific recommendations for
those working to incorporate makerspaces based on the researcher’s experiences would
be
1. Find support within the building or organization among peers and colleagues
who share the same vision and enthusiasm for constructionist learning
methods. This includes administrative support.
2. Designate an adequate space for the activities to occur. This includes storage
and room for equipment.
3. Start with small groups or grade levels.
4. Gather materials and resources.
5. Communicate with classroom teachers regarding curriculum connections,
ideas, and projects that may carry over from the makerspace to the regular
classroom.
6. Provide students with time for their own inquiry-based research to occur.
7. Document the process of implementing the makerspace through reflective
writing, photography, and videography highlighting what works and does not
work.

101
Limitations
Limited time for makerspaces was the major limitation the researcher faced. The
schedule for the school was set in advance by the administration and was beyond the
control of the researcher. The students in the targeted population initially were to only
have media once weekly as a special area class for the first semester of the year. This
limited the study to 12 weeks. The researcher worked proactively with the teachers to
find an extra 45 minutes in the schedule each week for students to participate on the day
they had PE as a special area class. This freed up student recess time for an additional
weekly session for each class in makerspaces. This resulted in 242 sessions instead of
12. There were also scheduled and unscheduled interruptions such as assemblies, fire
drills, and practice for a program that occurred during the same time block on a few
occasions. In these cases, time missed was rescheduled.
Recommendations for Further Study
This study focused on the impact of makerspaces on student creativity in an
elementary school environment. The following recommendations are presented for
future research based on the conclusions of this study.
1. The treatment phase of the study could be lengthened to give students more
time to engage in makerspaces. Increasing the session time to 1 hour instead
of 45 minutes may give students more time to complete activities and allow
incubation time for creativity. Additional sessions could be added to give
students more opportunities to participate. The schedule constraints at the
school involved were noted as a limitation of this study.
2. The study could be replicated with focus on different variables. Schools of
varying demographic and socioeconomic status might be compared to provide

102
further insight. The study could also be done at the secondary level to see if
age or maturity level comes into play. In addition, the study could be looked
at from the context of gender.
3. Research related to makerspaces and creativity in settings other than
educational venues could be done to see if location or context makes a
difference in the creative abilities of the makers.
4. Research could be done to determine if the amount of formal structure present
within the makerspace setting impacts creativity. Formal structure would
mean that activities were predetermined by a teacher or facilitator versus an
open-ended environment where students are totally self-directed.
5. The results of disaggregation of scores based on ethnicity showed that the
Hispanic subgroup made significant gains on the TTCT, while the other two
subgroups (African-American and White) did not. Further research to
investigate how creative teaching practices and makerspace environments
impact Hispanic learners may prove insightful.
Reflection
The need for creative thinkers in our world is rarely disputed as evidenced by the
abundance of literature related to creativity and learning (Benton et al., 2013; Brecknock,
2003; Partnership for 21st Century Learning, 2016; Robinson & Aronica, 2015).
Creative thinkers are needed to solve problems, develop innovations, and allow
prosperity (Florida, 2007; Robinson & Aronica, 2015). Traditional school models based
on 19th and 20th century scenarios are mismatched when applied to life in the 21st
century (Robinson & Aronica, 2015). Makerspaces represent a different model of
learning based on constructionist learning theory (Hruby, 2001; Papert, 1993; Papert &

103
Harel, 1991). Makerspaces may be one way to address the problem of supplying our
world with more creative thinkers by providing an environment where creativity can
flourish.
Makerspaces are a growing trend in libraries and media centers. According to
Moorefield-Lang (2015), makerspaces are encouraging us to think about the use of space
in libraries in new ways. Library and media center services are constantly changing in
purpose and methods of delivery; this brings about new challenges for media
coordinators (Moorefield-Lang, 2015). Makerspaces fit well in the media center
environment because they make use of physical space once was used for other purposes.
Media centers also provide a knowledge pool of resources for inquiry (Fleming, 2015;
Moorefield-Lang, 2015;). Thinking of libraries in new ways means changing mindsets.
Libraries are not what they used to be. State-of-the-art media centers no longer
resemble the quiet, whispering environments of yesterday. Many have
transformed into bustling workrooms utilizing every form of technology
available. Well-planned media centers can help prepare students for the changing
world of technology they will soon enter. (Horner, 2000, p. 48)
Makerspaces can be much more than spaces for crafts and technology.
Makerspaces in libraries can encourage collaboration, problem solving, building,
investigations, and playful learning (Moorefield-Lang, 2015). These types of activities
are aligned to constructionist theory (Papert, 1993; Papert & Harel, 1991). Hooper
(1998) noted that as students construct their own procedures, objects, and processes, their
grasp of new ideas develops. Students engage their thinking as they physically build
things. In addition, when done in community with others, student ideas are reinforced
and refined in the process (Hooper, 1998).

104
Makerspaces naturally lend themselves to constructionist theory and the
development of creative ideas. Lemons (2011) noted that creativity cannot be studied in
isolation. “External variables such as social, cultural, and economic factors must be
considered when explaining why, when, where, and how new ideas are created”
(Lemons, 2011, p. 756). Thomas (2014) wrote about the communal power of
makerspaces and stated,
the final form of the artifacts, be they robots or clothing, wasn’t where the power
was coming from. Rather, it was through the community that was forming as
people got together to make things, help each other, and then show off what they
had made. (p. 3)
Makerspaces can be constructionist environments if physical making of products
spark the learning process in a communal environment. The processes involved in the
makerspaces environment analyzed in this study support creative practices described in
research related to the Four P approach to creativity. As described in Chapter 2, the Four
P approach refers to creativity as evidenced through the person, the process, the press
(environment), and the product (Rhodes, 1961). Kaufman (2009) stated most of the time
the product is what is emphasized in how we look at creativity, but the other areas are just
as important. In makerspaces, all components of the Four P model of encouraging
creativity are supported.
The results of this study support the emphasis on the person, process,
environment, and the product through activities students may engage in during
makerspace time. The students were given opportunities to their own creative thinking as
individuals and as members of a group. This refers to the development of the creative
person. The process was foundational for allowing this. Students were guided to solve

105
problems through a process of questioning, gathering of information or materials, trying
out their ideas, reflecting, and then refining them. This process was facilitated through
the environment where materials such as Legos, littleBits, cardboard, and arts and crafts
items were accessible and choices were given. The materials not only enabled the
students to complete products but also helped motivate them to try new things (Kaufman,
2009).
An interesting result of this study showed a significant difference in the pre- and
post-TCTT results for Hispanic leaners while no statistical significance for the other two
groups. Further exploration of this result may develop into new research to investigate
why. The researcher-inferred differences in the form of the test may have been a factor.
The form of the TTCT given was the figural analysis and did not rely as heavily on
language. This form of expression may have been to the benefit of students with English
language deficits. This result was noted in the prior section of this chapter as a topic for
further research.
Conclusion
Makerspace environments are a potentially powerful tool for the incubation and
fruition of creativity in our students. According to Moorefield-Lang (2015), makerspaces
bring together innovation, creation, and critical thinking within a communal learning
environment. Makerspaces provide a place where students can develop critical thinking,
collaboration, communication, and creativity (Partnership for 21st Century Learning,
2016).
Finally, makerspace environments provide a shift from traditional classroom
experiences toward ones that may ready students for the challenges of the future. Sawyer
(2015) discussed economic competitiveness as a motivator as to why schools should

106
foster creativity.
Increasingly sophisticated information technology is spreading the scope of
automation into sectors of the economy that formerly required active human
involvement, including increasingly advanced service and knowledge work. This
development is making obsolete those job categories that do not involve active,
daily creativity. (Sawyer, 2015, p 3.)
This study showed the value in one type of makerspace environment at the
elementary school level. The researcher of study found through action research that
makerspaces are positive learning environments for supporting the creative development
of students. The positive growth of the students was statistically significant except for
one outlier score. There was a positive correlation between the creative potential of the
students evidenced on the TTCT and the perceptions of the teachers in the study. The
comments of the teachers supported the use of makerspaces as a creative learning
environment. In moving forward, makerspaces should be considered as an option in
school media centers. The findings of this study suggest schools and districts might
consider implementing makerspaces as a venue to promote creativity.

Board of Education Policy Regarding Student Records

123

STUDENT RECORDS 4-14
Page 1 of 8
All student records will be current and maintained with appropriate measures of security
and confidentiality. The principal is responsible for meeting all legal requirements
pertaining to the maintenance, review and release of records retained at the school.
A. Annual Notification of Rights
The superintendent/designee is responsible for providing parents or eligible students
(those at least 18 years old or married) with annual notification of their rights under the
Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). The notice must contain all
information required by federal law and regulations, including the following:
1. the right to inspect and review the student’s educational records and the procedure for
exercising this right;
2. the right to request amendment of the student’s educational records that the parent or
eligible student believes to be inaccurate, misleading or in violation of the student’s
privacy rights, and the procedure for exercising this right;
3. the right to consent to disclosures of personally identifiable information contained in
the student’s education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure
without consent;
4. the type of information designated as directory information and the right to opt out of
release of directory information;
5. that the school district releases records to other institutions that have requested the
information and in which the student seeks or intends to enroll;
6. the right to opt out of releasing the student’s name, address and phone number to
military recruiters or institutions of higher education that request such information;
7. a specification of the criteria for determining who constitutes a school official and
what constitutes a legitimate educational interest if the school discloses or intends to
disclose personally identifiable information to school officials without consent;
8. notification if the school system uses contractors, consultants, volunteers or similar
persons as school officials to perform certain school system services and functions that it
would otherwise perform itself; and
9. the right to file complaints with the Family Policy Compliance Office in the U.S.
Department of Education.

124
STUDENT RECORDS 4-14
Page 2 of 8
The school district does not have to individually notify parents or eligible students of
their rights, but must provide the notice in a reasonable manner likely to inform the
parents and eligible students of their rights. Effective notice must be provided to
parents or eligible students who are disabled or whose primary or home language is not
English.
B. Review, Release of Records to Parent, Guardian or Eligible Student
A parent or eligible student will be allowed access to the student's records upon proper
request. A formal review of a student's complete records will be conducted only in the
presence of the principal/designee and must be conducted within 45 days of the written
request. School personnel will not destroy any educational records if there is an
outstanding request to inspect or review the records.
A parent or eligible student has the right to challenge an item in the student record
believed to be inaccurate, misleading or otherwise in violation of the student’s privacy
rights. The principal shall examine a request to amend the student record and respond in
writing to the person who challenges the record. If the final decision is that the
information in the record is not accurate, misleading or otherwise in violation of the
privacy rights of the student, the principal shall inform the parent or eligible student of
the right to place a statement in the record commenting on the contested information in
the record or stating why s/he disagrees with the decision of the school system.
C. Release of Records to Others
Student’s records will be released promptly when a student transfers to another school
and in other circumstances specifically permitted by law. Student’s official record will
also include notice of any suspension for a period of more than 10 days (6 days for
Condensed Academic Terms) or of any expulsion under General Statute 115C-391 and
the conduct for which the student was suspended or expelled. Written permission by a
parent or eligible student is required for the release of a student's records in any other
circumstance. Such release must specify the records to be released, the purpose of the
release and to whom they are to be released.
Directory information on students may be utilized by the school district, individual
schools or organizations and parental permission is not required for the release of
directory information provided that the parent or eligible student has received proper
notice and opportunity to object. The following information is considered to be directory
information:
1. student's name 2. address 3. telephone listing 4. date and place of birth
5. participation in officially recognized activities and sports

125
STUDENT RECORDS 4-14
Page 3 of 8
6. weight and height of members of athletic team 7. dates of attendance
8. diplomas, certification and awards received 9. electronic mail address
10. photograph 11. grade level
12. most recent previous school or education at institution attended by the student
13. pictures or videos taken on buses, school grounds, in school buildings and at school
activities unless the picture or video may reveal confidential information about a student
The board strongly discourages the release of directory information to any outside
organizations which have requested the information for their own purposes, including
commercial organizations. Decisions to provide directory information to outside
organizations must be approved by the superintendent/designee.
As required by law, the names addresses and telephone numbers of secondary school
students shall be released, upon request, to military recruiters or institutions of higher
learning, whether or not such information is designated as directory information by the
school system. Students and/or their parents, however, may request that the student’s
name, address and telephone number not be released without prior written parental
consent. Through the provision of a copy of this policy parents are notified of the option
to make a request and that the school system shall comply with any requests made.
Students with recognized exceptionalities will be accorded all rights in regards to their
records as provided by state and federal law, including the Individuals with Disabilities
Act.
Records cannot be withheld from a valid request by a parent, eligible student or school
for any reason, including in order to collect fines assessed to the parent or student.
Students or their parents, however, may request that the student’s directory information
not be released without parental consent. Such request should be made in writing
annually to the school principal within the first month of school.
D. Procedures to Expunge a Discipline Record
To have a suspension of greater than ten days (6 days for condensed academic terms) or
an expulsion expunged from a student’s official record, one of the following persons
must submit a written request to the Superintendent or his/her designee:

126
STUDENT RECORDS 4-14
Page 4 of 8
1. The student’s parent, legal guardian, or custodian; or
2. The student, if the student is at least 16 years old or is emancipated.
The Superintendent/ designee shall expunge from the record the notice of suspension or
expulsion if the following criteria are met:
1. The student either graduates from high school or is not expelled or suspended again
during the two year period commencing on the date of the student’s return to school after
the expulsion or suspension.
2. The Superintendent/designee determines that the maintenance of the record is no
longer needed to maintain safe and orderly schools. 3. The Superintendent/designee
determines that the maintenance of the record is no longer needed to adequately serve the
child. In the absence of a request as outlined above, the Superintendent may expunge
from a student’s official record any notice of suspension or expulsion provided all of the
above criteria are met.
E. Surveys
The school system must obtain prior consent of a parent or eligible student before the
student is required to participate in any Department of Education-funded survey, analysis
or evaluation that reveals information concerning the following “protected topics”:
1. political affiliations or beliefs of the student or the student’s parent;
2. mental or psychological problems of the student or the student's family;
3. sex behavior and attitudes;
4. illegal, antisocial, self-incriminating and/or demeaning behavior;
5. critical appraisals of other individuals with whom respondents have close family
relationships;
6. legally recognized privileged or analogous relationships, such as those of lawyers,
physicians and ministers;
7. religious practices, affiliations, or beliefs of the student’s parent; or
8. income (other than that required by law to determine eligibility for participation in a
program or for receiving financial assistance under such program).
Parents will be informed by the school at the beginning of the year of any survey
instrument being distributed to students of which they are aware, however at the very
least no fewer than ten-10 days in advance. Such notification will include information
regarding students’ rights in not answering questions related to the eight-(8) above items
and safeguards to protect student privacy should the survey instrument include any of
those items. Collection, disclosure, or use of directory information of students and/or
parents will not be for purposes of marketing or

127
STUDENT RECORDS 4-14
Page 5 of 8
selling beyond the school community (i.e. PTSA, Booster Clubs, Student Council, etc.).
The school system will take measures to protect the identification and privacy of students
participating in any survey concerning any of the protected topics.
Parents may inspect, upon request, any survey instrument created by a third party before
the survey is administered or distributed to students. Parents may opt for their students
not to participate in such surveys. Parents may also inspect such survey instruments after
they are administered.
F. Definition of Parent and Eligible Student For purposes of this policy, the term parent
includes a natural parent or guardian or an individual acting as a parent in the absence of
a parent or guardian.
If the parents of a student are separated or divorced, both parents have access to the
student’s records as provided in this policy, unless the school district has been provided
with evidence that there is a court order, state statute, or legally binding document that
specifically revokes these rights.
For purposes of this policy, an eligible student means a student who has reached 18 years
of age or is attending an institution of postsecondary education. The rights afforded to
parents under this policy transfer to an eligible student. However, parents may still have
access to the records as long as the student is “dependent” (i.e., claimed by the parent for
federal income tax purposes). Eligible students wishing to prevent access to records by
their parents must furnish to the principal information verifying that the student is not a
dependent of his/her parents. If a parent of a student who is at least 18 and no longer
attending a school within the district wishes to inspect and review the student’s records,
he/she must provide information verifying that the student is a dependent for federal
income tax purposes. A student under age 18 may have access to student records only
upon consent of his/her parents.
G. Records of Missing Children Upon notification by a law enforcement agency or the
North Carolina Center for Missing Persons of a child’s disappearance, the school shall
flag the record of any child who is currently or who was previously enrolled in a school
and who is reported as missing. If the missing child’s record is requested by another
school system, the principal shall provide notice of the request to the superintendent and
the agency that notified the school that the child was missing. The principal shall provide
the agency with a copy of any written request for information concerning the missing
child’s record. Any information received indicating that a student transferring into the
system is a missing child must be reported to the superintendent and the North Carolina
Center for Missing Children.

128
STUDENT RECORDS 4-14
Page 6 of 8
H. Records Received from the Department of Social Services The Department of Social
Services may disclose confidential information to the school system in order to protect a
juvenile from abuse or neglect. Any confidential information disclosed under these
circumstances must remain confidential and may only be redisclosed for purposes
directly connected with carrying out the school system’s mandated educational
responsibilities.
I. Records of Students Participating in the North Carolina Address Confidentiality
Program
Records of students participating in the North Carolina Address Confidentiality Program
must show only the substitute address provided by the Address Confidentiality Program
and must not be released to any third party other than a school to which the student is
transferring, or as otherwise provided by law. When transferring the record of a student
participating in the North Carolina Address Confidentiality Program to a school outside
of the system, the transferring school may send the files to the Address Confidentiality
Program participant (parent or guardian) via the substitute address provided by the
Address Confidentiality Program.
J. Record of Access
The principal or designee will maintain a record in each student’s file indicating all
persons who have requested or received personally identifiable information from a
student’s record and the legitimate reason(s) for requesting or obtaining the information.
This requirement does not apply to requests by or disclosure to parents, eligible students,
school officials, parties seeking directory information, a party seeking or receiving the
records under a court order or subpoena that prohibits disclosure, or those individuals
with written parental consent.
K. Destruction of Records
School officials may only destroy student records in accordance with state and federal
law and the Records Retention and Disposition Schedule for Local Education Agencies.
Upon notifying parents, student records may be destroyed when they are no longer
needed to provide educational services to the student or to protect the safety of the
student or others. Student records must be destroyed if the parent or eligible student
requests their destruction and such records are no longer needed to provide educational
services to the student or to protect the safety of the student or others. Student records
may not be destroyed if there is an outstanding request to inspect the particular records.

129

STUDENT RECORDS 4-14
Page 7 of 8
L. Records of Military Children
School administrators shall comply with any regulations pertaining to the records of
military children developed by the Interstate Commission on Educational Opportunity for
Military Children.
In addition, children of military families, as defined by law, are entitled to the following:
1. For Students Leaving the School System In the event that official educational records
cannot be released to the parents of military children who are transferring away from the
school system, the custodian of records shall prepare and furnish to the parent a complete
copy of unofficial educational records containing uniform information as determined by
the Interstate Commission. When a request for a student’s official records is received
from the student’s new school, school officials shall process and furnish the official
records to the new school within 10 days or within such time as is reasonably determined
by the Interstate Commission.
2. For Students Enrolling in the School System Upon receiving an unofficial education
record from the student’s previous school, school administrators shall enroll the student
and place him/her in classes as quickly as possible based upon the information in the
unofficial records, pending validation by the official records. Simultaneous with the
enrollment ad conditional placement of the student, school administrators shall request
the official records from his/her previous school.
M. Juvenile Records Any information received from law enforcement or the Department
of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention regarding a felony charge or placement
on the sex offender registry will be maintained in a separate, confidential location by the
school principal and shall be destroyed once the principal is notified that the court no
longer has jurisdiction over the student or if the court grants a petition for expunction of
the records. The principal may share juvenile records with individuals who have (a)
direct guidance, teaching or supervisory responsibility for the student and (b) a specific
need to know in order to protect the safety of the student and others. Persons provided
access to juvenile records must indicate in writing that they have read the documents and
agree to maintain confidentiality of the records.

N. Longitudinal Data System
School system administrators will comply with the data requirements and implementation
schedule for the North Carolina Longitudinal Data System (NCLDS) and will transfer
designated student record data to the system in accordance with the NCLDS data security
and safeguarding plan and all other requirements of state law, provided that doing so does
not conflict with the requirements of FERPA.

Appendix D: Student Assent
To: Fifth Grade Students
From: Mrs. Austin, Media Coordinator
Date:
Welcome back to school! I’d like to take time to tell you about a project that you will
have the chance to be involved in this year if you chose. Currently, I am working on my
doctoral degree at Gardner-Webb University. I am inviting you to participate in a project
I am doing through the university. I am doing a study about makerspaces in our media
center. A study is a big project where a researcher tries to solve a problem or answer
questions. I am going to be the researcher. My questions are about makerspaces and
how kids learn. This year all kids in fifth grade are going to be using makerspaces when
they come to the media center for their special classes. Makerspaces are centers in the
library where you will be working with Legos, computers, science and art materials.
Even if you don’t want to be a part of the study, you class will still be using makerspaces
this year.
If you agree to be in the project, you will be asked to take an assessment before
we start makerspaces in September and then again in December. The test is a picture and
word test called the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking (TTCT). You will be asked to
draw and describe pictures. You will be asked to write some words. The test takes 45
minutes to take and it will be during your media time. You will get a number score on
the test, but it will not count for a grade. You and your parents can ask me how you did
on the test if you would like to know, but otherwise the information is only used to help
me with the study. Your teachers will not use the score for your grades.
If you do not want to take the test you do not have to. You will not get in trouble
if you don’t take the test. At any time during the test you may stop without penalty. I
will use the information to help me with my study about makerspaces, but nothing I use
will have your name on it. If you want to know more about this research project, please
email me at jaustin5@gardner-webb.edu. This project has been approved by the
Institutional Review Board at Gardner-Webb University. Information on Gardner-Webb
University’s policy and procedure for research involving human subjects can be obtained
from Dr. Doug Eury at aeury@gardnerwebb.edu or Dr. Jeffrey Rogers, IRB institutional
administrator at Jrogers3@gwu.edu. You will get a copy of this consent form.
Please sign this form if you would like to be part of the project.

Re: Research Study
Date:
I am conducting an action research study to determine the impact of makerspaces
impact on creativity in the media center at our school. Makerspaces are creative
activity centers where all students will have access to a variety of creative
materials where they may imagine, create and build projects based on their own
interests. The materials in the makerspaces at our school include:
• Lego WeDo kits and software
• Legos and other blocks
• littleBits magnetic circuitry
• Cardboard, construction paper and Styrofoam
• recycled plastics and other materials
• fabric
• clay
• a variety of arts and crafts materials
The centers are currently stationed in the media center. All students will have
experiences using makerspaces throughout the school year, but for the purposes of
this study, fourth grade students have been selected to participate. To determine
the impact of makerspaces on fourth grade students, a pre and post-creativity
assessment will be given. The pre-test will be given in September and the posttest
will be given after twelve weeks of exposure to the makerspaces. This study
follows a mixed-methods research design. Quantitative data will be collected
from students and qualitative data will be collected from their teachers. The
quantitative data collection from the fourth-grade students includes the
administration of the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking: Thinking Creatively
with Pictures, Figural Edition Form A and Form B.
•
•
•
•
•

This is a highly valid and reliable test of creative potential.
The test was developed by renowned researcher and psychologist, Paul
Torrance and has been used in schools for over forty years.
The test is appropriate at all levels, kindergarten through adult.
It uses three picture-based exercises to assess five mental characteristics
that relate to creativity: fluency, elaboration, originality, resistance to
premature closure, abstractness of titles.
Typically, students are asked to identify what pictures of figures represent
or to finish drawings that have been started.

135
•
•
•
•

This is a paper/pencil test and lasts approximately 45.
It is a secure document and not available for review.
It will be administered by a trained test administrator at the school site
during the regular school day.
Test results will be available to parents upon request.

There are no risks to students in this study. All information is confidential, and no
person or school will be identified in the study. All test data will be used by the
researcher for the purpose of group analysis. No individual information will be
shared or used for any reason beyond the research study, nor will it be shared with
school personnel. Makerspaces is currently part of the regularly planned media
center curriculum. All fifth-grade students will have the chance to use
makerspaces weekly. The only activity beyond the scope of normal school
activities involves your child’s participation in the Torrance Test of Creative
Thinking (TTCT). If your child does not take the TTCT, this will not change your
child’s opportunity to use makerspaces. Each child will have makerspaces
opportunities during their regularly scheduled media center time each week
regardless of participation in the tests. If your child takes the TTCT, he or she will
have the opportunity to help supply data regarding how makerspaces impacts
student creativity. Your child’s participation in the TTCT is entirely up to you,
there is no advantage and no one will hold it against your child if you decide not
to allow your child to participate in the TTCT. If your child does take part, he or
she may stop at any time without penalty. In addition, you may ask to have your
child’s data withdrawn from the study after the research has been conducted. If
you want to know more about this research project, please email me at
jaustin5@gardner-webb.edu. This project has been approved by the Institutional
Review Board at Gardner-Webb University. Information on Gardner-Webb
University’s policy and procedure for research involving human subjects can be
obtained from Dr. Doug Eury at Gardner-Webb University. You will get a copy
of this consent form.
Consent Statement:
I agree to let my child take the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking: Thinking
Creatively with Pictures, Figural Edition Form A and Form B. I understand my
child can withdraw from the study at any time. Blair Austin and other researchers
approved by Gardner-Webb University may use the data collected from the test
administration for this research project, teacher education, and presentations at
professional meetings. I understand that there will be no link to my child’s
identity.

To: Fifth Grade Teachers
From: Blair Austin, Media Coordinator
RE: Consent to participate in research study- “Making It Matters: Makerspaces’ Impact
on Creativity in an Elementary Media Center”
Greetings Colleagues:
As part of a research study for my work in the doctoral program at Gardner-Webb
University, I am asking for your assistance. This year the media program is going to
include makerspace experiences for all fifth-grade students. In order to determine the
creative impact these experiences may have on your students, I am asking you assist me
in evaluating them. You are the best ones to do this because of the close relationships
you build with your students and the work you see them do daily.
Description of the study:
The study is a mixed-methods, action research study. I will be gathering both
quantitative data and qualitative data.
Quantitative Data –
• The students that participate will take a pre and post-written creativity
assessments. This will be administered during media special area time. The test
is called the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking (TTCT).
• I will also ask you to assess each student using the Scales for Rating the Behavior
Characteristics of Superior Students. (SRBCSS). This is a Likert ranking scale
that asks for the evaluator to rank the students based on specific attributes related
to creativity.
Qualitative Data• I will ask you to assess each student on an open-ended questionnaire.
The study will begin in September and will last 12 weeks. You will not be asked to
assess your students until after this time. Your participation is entirely voluntary. If you
agree to help me, I will train you on how to complete the SRBCSS. You will only need to
evaluate the students who return written student assent and parental consent. This is
completely voluntary for students. All student, teacher, school and district data will be
anonymous. Pseudonyms will be used and students will only be identified by number. I
will share my findings with you at the conclusion of the study. All data collected will be
disposed of in accordance with district policies. You may withdraw from the study at any
time.
I really appreciate your consideration of participation in the study. This study has to
potential to give us insight on the impact of makerspaces in school media centers.
Teacher Consent Statement:

138

I agree to participate in the research study entitled: Making It Matters- Makerspaces’
Impact on Creativity in an Elementary School Media Center. I will be evaluating

Appendix I
Tesch’s Eight Steps in the Coding Process Applied to Open-end Questionnaire Examples

146
Step
1. Get a sense of the whole. Read all
the transcriptions carefully. Perhaps
jot down some ideas as they come to
mind as you read.

2. Pick one document (i.e., one
interview)-the most interesting one,
the shortest, the one on the top of the
pile. Go through it, asking yourself,
“What is this about?” Do not think
about the substance of the
information but its underlying
meaning. Write thoughts in the
margin.

Step as Applied to
Questionnaire Data
The researcher read the five
teacher questionnaires and
recorded words and phrases
related to the responses.

3. When you have completed this task
for several participants, make a list of
all topics. Cluster together similar
topics. Form these topics into
columns, perhaps arrayed as major,
unique, and leftover topics.

A list of topics was made and
clustered together in terms of
similarity. The topics were
then grouped according to
frequency, uniqueness or
other.

4. Now take this list and go back to your
data. Abbreviate the topics as codes
and write the codes next to the
appropriate segments of the text. Try
this preliminary organizing scheme to
see fi new categories and codes
emerge.

The list of topics was
abbreviated as codes and
written next to the
corresponding units of text.

Communication = COM
Engagement = ENG
Motivation = MOT
Risk-taking = RIS
Problem-solving = PRO

5. Find the most descriptive wording for
your topics and turn them into
categories. Look for ways of
reducing your total list of categories
by grouping topics that relate to each
other. Perhaps draw lines between
your categories to show
interrelationships.

Categories were developed
based on the frequency of
times they were coded.
Similar topics and overlap
between them were
considered. A list of final
categories was determined
by grouping related topics.

Communication
Engagement
Motivation

6. Make a final decision on the
abbreviation for each category and
alphabetize these codes.

The researcher determined
there were three major
categories and the codes
were determined by the first
three letters of each category.
The data was assembled and
organized.

COM, ENG, MOT

It was not necessary to
recode the data

It was not necessary to
recode the data.

7. Assemble the data material belonging
to each category in one place and
perform a preliminary analysis.
8. If necessary, recode your existing
data.
