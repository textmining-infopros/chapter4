Leading Across Boundaries: Collaborative Leadership and the Institutional Repository in
Research Universities and Liberal Arts Colleges

David M. Seaman

Candy Schwartz, PhD, Committee Chair
Simmons College School of Library and Information Science

Abstract

Libraries often engage in services that require collaboration across stakeholder
boundaries to be successful. Institutional repositories (IRs) are a good example of such a service.
IRs are an infrastructure to preserve intellectual assets within a university or college, and to
provide an open access showcase for that institution’s research, teaching, and creative
excellence. They involve multiple stakeholders (librarians, IT experts, administrators, faculty,
and students) and are typically operated by academic libraries. They have existed since the early
2000s.
Collaborative leadership has been studied in areas such as health care and business, but it
has received little attention in studies of library leadership and management. Collaborative
leadership has been shown to be an effective leadership style for an increasingly networked
world; it is an interactive process in which people set aside self-interests, share power, work
across boundaries, and discuss issues openly and supportively. Collaborative leadership moves
organizations beyond mere cooperation towards a state of interdependence; it empowers all
members of a team to help each other to achieve broader goals, find personal satisfaction in their
work, and sustain productive relationships over time. A better understanding of collaborative

iii

leadership can inform both IR development and future complex multi-stakeholder campus
services.
Two methodologies – content analysis of IR web pages and surveys of library directors
and IR developers – were employed to determine if IRs revealed evidence of collaborative
leadership. The study populations were those members of the Association of Research Libraries
(ARL) and the Oberlin Group of liberal arts colleges that operated IR services by July 2014 (146
institutions overall). The research examined if IR format, size, age, nomenclature, or technology
platform varied between ARL and Oberlin Group members. It asked if there is any difference in
the perception of collaborative leadership traits, perceived IR success, or collaborative
involvement with stakeholder communities between ARL and Oberlin Group members or
between library directors and IR developers. The study found evidence of all six collaborative
leadership traits being examined: assessing the environment for collaboration, creating clarity,
building trust, sharing power, developing people, and self-reflection.

Acknowledgements

I would like to offer my sincerest thanks to my PhD committee members, Michèle
Cloonan, Martin Halbert, and Candy Schwartz, whose commentaries, insights, and enthusiasm
helped me enormously, and enriched this work. Without the steadfast support of my advisor
Candy Schwartz over a number of years, and her belief that I could finish this work even when I
doubted it, I would not be writing this PhD dissertation acknowledgements page. Thank you,
Candy, for not giving up on me!
I benefited significantly from all three stages of this Simmons College PhD program: the
coursework, undertaken with an amusing cohort of colleagues (all library leaders in their own
rights); the comprehensive examinations that demanded the synthesis of leadership theory and
practice; and finally, this long-form piece of research writing. I am grateful to all the Simmons
faculty and the “professors of practice” – senior leaders in the library professions – who shared
their time, enthusiasm, and expertise to make the coursework portion of the PhD so beneficial,
and in many cases directly applicable to my daily work life. This course of study was partially
funded by the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), through a grant to Simmons
College to create a new PhD program in managerial leadership in the information professions. I
am grateful for this federal investment in library leadership, and would not have had this
opportunity without the good work of IMLS.
I have had the rare luxury of being a doctoral researcher in the library that I direct,
allowing me to experience the collections, staff, and services from a user’s perspective. I have
made full use of the Syracuse University Libraries and have been grateful to all those who work
there for making the life of a busy researcher as productive as possible. My experience was a

v

very positive one: the books I needed to consult were on the shelves of Bird and Carnegie
libraries where the catalog said they would be, and were in good condition; the electronic
holdings were comprehensive and easy to discover and navigate; items from the storage facility
arrived with impressive speed, typically the same day; and when I needed to use InterLibrary
Loan to fill in the gaps, the service never let me down. I owe a special thanks to Syracuse
University librarians Paul Bern, Research Data Services Librarian, for advice on statistics and for
guiding my use of the SPSS software, and to Michele Combs, Lead Archivist, Special
Collections Research Center, whose expert copyediting saved me from many a clumsy phrase
and APA citation format error.
And finally, I would like to thank my wife Kelly and my children Eleanor, Juls, and Ben,
for their love, patience, and motivational choruses of “aren’t you done yet?” over the years that it
took to complete this course of study. I’m proud to say that I’m done, and am a better library
leader and researcher for the experience.

showed me the value of education and inquiry, and supported unfailingly my interest in a life in
academia.

Chapter One
INTRODUCTION

Academic libraries provide services, collections, and spaces designed for the
communities they serve, and increasingly these activities involve various forms of collaboration.
Collaborative networks are deeply embedded in contemporary library culture, and exist to
improve such services as cataloging, interlibrary loan, and the licensing of electronic content.
These networks can even extend to the sharing of library staff members across institutions (Oder,
2010). Successful collaborative library services in areas such as digital scholarship and scholarly
publishing increasingly require a range of skills, including subject knowledge, technology
expertise, interface design, promotional abilities, and publishing acumen. They also need staff
who understand the workflows, processes, and requirements that are integral to 21st century
teaching, learning, and research. Librarians may now find themselves as equal participants on
collaborative teams that include experts from disparate communities of practice, including
computer programmers, compliance specialists, grants professionals, students, and faculty.
These campus-wide collaborations often display diffuse power relationships, and the leadership
they require needs to be better understood. If undertaken carelessly, these endeavors are
susceptible to miscommunication, lack of shared assumptions, budgetary issues, misaligned
goals, or even mistrust. Ongoing work by the Center for Creative Leadership (CCL) points to
the importance of understanding such boundary-spanning leadership activities, “where disparate
groups collide, intersect, and link” (Ernst & Chrobot-Mason, 2011, p. xxii). Ernst and ChrobotMason conclude that “in a world that spans boundaries, so too must leadership. Therein lies the
challenge and the opportunity of a more interdependent, collaborative future” (p. 253). The

1

institutional repository (IR) provides an excellent example of a campus-wide boundary-crossing
initiative, centered in the library, which requires deep collaboration to succeed.
The Institutional Repository
An institutional repository is both an infrastructure and a set of governance policies for
the long-term archiving of scholarship produced at an academic institution, and its delivery
online. The planning and implementation of such repositories depends on expertise in a range of
technological, curatorial, content delivery, and marketing areas. Their success requires content
owners who are motivated to use the service to preserve and disseminate their material, and their
sustainability presupposes a host institution willing to support, value, and reward these activities.
Indeed, their long-term success may also require institutional agreements encouraging faculty to
deposit their work, and new services from libraries to facilitate these actions.
Institutional repositories were first introduced in the United States in the early 2000s, as
infrastructures to preserve and disseminate the intellectual output of an academic institution.
Over the past 15 years, IRs have become commonplace services in research universities
worldwide, and these services are also appearing more frequently in liberal arts colleges in the
United States. Institutional repositories serve multiple needs, including those of the scholars
who create the content, the public who use the content, the librarians who curate it, and the
institutional leaders who use the IR to promote the research and teaching excellence of the
university or college.
IRs have also become central to the predilection in academic libraries for the free, global
sharing of scholarship – the Open Access movement – where academic articles are made
available on the internet without the constraints placed on them by commercial publishers.
Duranceau (2008), for example, described IRs as part of an emerging “scholarly commons: [an]

2

open, network-based sharing of the intellectual output of universities” (p. 244); she further
asserted that they support “a new social practice of direct sharing of scholarly information,
unmediated by a market, in a commons-like environment” (p. 245). More recently, IRs have
also provided an infrastructure through which academics can comply with new regulations that
require publicly funded research to be made freely available online (McIntire, 2015).
The development of institutional repositories is well-suited to being examined through
the theoretical framework of collaborative leadership. This type of leadership
embraces a process in which people with different views and perspectives come together,
set aside narrow self-interests, and discuss issues openly and supportively in an attempt to
find ways of helping each other solve a larger problem or achieve broader goals.
(Turning Point, 2004, What is Collaborative Leadership? section)
The present study will examine collaborative leadership in relation to IR development, it will
determine what collaborative leadership traits are present in the building and operating of an IR,
and it will ask how inclusive of the stakeholders those collaborations are perceived to be.
Library Leadership
The study of leadership traits came late to the library profession, especially when
compared to the business, healthcare, and education communities. Riggs, in editing Library
Leadership: Visualizing the Future in 1982, could find no previous books on the subject (p. v)
although he found an abundance of literature dealing with library administration and
management (p. vii). A more careful examination of the literature shows that the discussion of
library leadership is not as recent as Riggs suggests, although his general point holds. For
example, Morgan published on librarians exerting leadership in 1940 and Haines in 1945; the
1940s also saw reports published from library leadership training events in Florida and Texas

3

(Library Leadership Work Conference, 1947; Library Leadership Workshop, 1948). Calls for
library leadership studies appeared in the Wilson Library Bulletin in 1950 (Duff), and in 1960
there were two articles on the topic (Moody, 1960; Dix, 1960). A 1955 dissertation discussed at
length the influence of strong library leadership in the development of the University of Illinois
library from 1900-1930, repeatedly presenting the library director as being well-integrated into
the senior leadership at the university (Yenawine, p. 36, p. 76, p. 152, p. 178), and extending
leadership roles to the staff:
The Librarians were not the only source of professional leadership; members of the staff
made significant contributions also. Services for readers and a complete dictionary
catalog of library resources were the work of women who achieved national standing in
the profession. (p. 180)
Hamlin (1981), in his history of the university library in the United States, also pointed to Illinois
among other places in a discussion of mid-20th century library directors who displayed leadership
qualities, which included mention of several notable women library directors (pp. 117-118).
Euster (1987), writing on the role of the academic library director, included a literature review on
leadership theories relevant to her topic, and pointed to three previous “applications of leadership
theory to the study of libraries” (p. 18), citing Sparks (1976), Dragon (1982), and Holmes (1983).
It is only after the mid-1980s, however, that the study of library leadership really
developed, to include several books and journal articles per year, and in 1988 the American
Library Association adopted “Leadership” as their annual theme (Riggs & Sabine, 1988, p. 127).
By 1994, Suwannarat was able to provide a literature review of eight library leadership studies in
her dissertation, drawing on the Dissertation Abstracts International and ERIC databases (pp. 5053).

Expressions of library leadership are also found in the library management literature. A
1983 book on library management had a section titled “Directing” that included an overview of
common leadership theories, although it did caution that “the manager should not overemphasize
the importance of leadership activities, especially if this causes other functions to be neglected”
(Schriesheim, Tolliver, & Behling, p. 361). A 1997 guide for library managers was more
insistent on the importance of collaboration and leadership skills (Carson, Carson, & Phillips, p.
44), and noted that “transformational leaders help staff collaboratively search for the right
answers” (p. 47). This same book presented collaborations as essential for effecting change (p.
10), for creating high-functioning teams (p. 19), and for the resolution of conflict (p. 146). By
the publication of Mech and McCabe’s collection of essays Leadership and Academic Librarians
in 1998, the notion of library leadership – as opposed to library management and administration
– had become well established. However, in that volume Karp and Murdock pointed out that in
1998 “leader” was still not a subject heading in Library Literature, the principal bibliography for
the field, and concluded that “leadership as a concept in the profession of librarianship [is still
not] a legitimate entry that merits clearly identified discussion and definition” (p. 251). Library
Literature, now re-named Library Literature & Information Science, today has many leadership
subject headings and thousands of entries extending back to 1985.
Collaborative Leadership
Since the mid-1990s, discussions about collaborative leaders and leadership qualities
have appeared often in the general press, in business journalism, and in scholarly articles,
especially in the fields of education, health, and business. Rubin (2009) provided one general
definition for collaborative leadership as “the skill-full and mission-oriented facilitation of
relevant relationships. It is the juncture of organizing and management” (p. 2). Archer and

5

Cameron added to this statement the concept of collaborative leadership as a boundary-spanning
activity:
At its most basic, collaborative leadership is about delivering results across boundaries.…
And as a leader, you need to be clear about where the boundary lies and how to use the
different capabilities on either side of it to build a positive and efficient relationship.
(2009, pp. xv-xvi)
In a university setting, for example, those boundaries could lie between faculty member and
librarian, or computing expert and senior administrator, or the institution and the individual.
Chapter Two: Literature Review contains a fuller discussion of these collaborative leadership
definitions.
While such general definitions of collaborative leadership may help to differentiate it
from other forms of leadership, they do not offer a clear articulation of specific traits for which
one can test in an analysis of the development of an institutional repository. However,
leadership teaching materials created by the Turning Point Leadership Development National
Excellence Collaborative (1997-2005) do give useful trait definitions, and list six practices of
effective collaborative leaders (n.d., p. 1):
1. Assessing the environment for collaboration
2. Creating clarity: visioning and mobilizing
3. Building trust and creating safety
4. Sharing power and influence
5. Developing people: mentoring and coaching
6. Self-reflection

6

It is these six leadership traits that the present study will use to recognize collaborative
leadership in the planning and building of institutional repositories.
Study Populations
This study examined the presence or absence of collaborative leadership traits in
institutional repository development in two distinct types of North American educational
institution: the doctorate-granting university and the baccalaureate or master’s college/university.
American research universities were the birthplace of IRs, but research by Markey, St. Jean,
Rieh, Yakel, and Kim (2008), Xia and Opperman (2010), and Nykanen (2011) showed IRs rising
in strategic importance for liberal arts colleges, which makes this group a useful one to examine
alongside of research universities.
The definitions for these two groups of North American educational institutions are
drawn from the Basic Classification Description section of the 2015 edition of The Carnegie
Classification of Institutions of Higher Education. According to these classifications, Doctoral
Universities are those “institutions that awarded at least 20 research/scholarship doctoral degrees
during the update year;” Master's Colleges and Universities include “institutions that awarded at
least 50 master's degrees and fewer than 20 doctoral degrees during the update year;” and
Baccalaureate Colleges include “institutions where baccalaureate or higher degrees represent at
least 50 percent of all degrees but where fewer than 50 master's degrees or 20 doctoral degrees
were awarded during the update year” (The Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher
Education, 2016). The name of the institution itself is not always a reliable indicator of its
status: Dartmouth College, for example, is a major research institution (Doctoral Universities:
Higher Research Activity); Bucknell University, however, is a predominantly undergraduate
college (Baccalaureate Colleges: Arts & Sciences Focus).

7

To delimit these two groups further, the study population for the first – Doctoral
Universities – was made up of universities in North America whose libraries were members of
the Association of Research Libraries (ARL) and who had IRs in production by July 2014. As of
that date, the ARL had 124 members (http://www.arl.org/membership/). Examples of ARL
libraries included Columbia, Duke, Florida State, Harvard, Johns Hopkins, New York, Rice,
Toronto, Utah, and Virginia Tech universities. The study population for the second group –
Master's or Baccalaureate Colleges and Universities – was made up of liberal arts colleges in the
United States who were members of the Oberlin Group and who had IRs in production by July
2014. As of that date, the Oberlin Group had 80 members. Examples of Oberlin Group libraries
included those at Amherst, Carleton, Middlebury, Oberlin, Rhodes, and Williams colleges
(http://www.oberlingroup.org/group-members). Both the Association of Research Libraries and
the Oberlin Group have promoted open access practices to their members and have presented
institutional repositories as the infrastructure through which to provide services for the
preservation and access of their scholarship. This makes these two organizations better suited
for this study than other groups of universities and colleges, such as the 62-member Association
of American Universities (https://www.aau.edu/) or the 130-member Annapolis Group of liberal
arts colleges (http://annapolisgroup.org).
The Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education divides doctoral
institutions into three categories of research activity: highest, higher, and moderate. All but five
of the US ARL institutions in the study population were categorized as highest research activity,
with the remaining five in the higher research activity category. The Carnegie Classification
only covers institutions in the United States, but Statistics Canada has categories for Canadian
universities that are informed by those used in the Maclean’s Magazine University rankings

8

(http://www.macleans.ca/education/university-rankings-2017), which are in turn modeled on The
Carnegie Classification (Orton, 2009, p. 16; pp. 39-41). The Canadian universities are divided
up into three categories by Maclean’s and by Statistics Canada: Medical/Doctoral,
Comprehensive, and Primarily Undergraduate. All but three ARL Canadian institutions in the
study population were categorized in the first category (Medical/Doctoral), with the others being
in the Comprehensive category. All but three of the Oberlin Group liberal arts institutions are in
the Carnegie classification of Baccalaureate College, two are categorized as Master's Colleges
and Universities, and one is in the category of Doctoral Universities: Moderate Research
Activity.
Significance
Institutional repositories are an increasingly prominent part of the academic landscape at
large research institutions and – more recently – at liberal arts colleges. They are the
infrastructure through which these institutions seek to share their faculty and student research
with the world and to promote their reputation. IRs are inherently collaborative endeavors
because power relationships across stakeholder groups in academia are diffuse; when different
campus units work together, they operate in complex networks of influence, respect, and
ambition, and they experience an interplay of individual, departmental, and institutional needs.
Rarely do the interested parties in an IR have direct, hierarchical reporting relationships to one
another, even if they do all report ultimately to the same Vice President or Provost. Therefore, a
study of the planning and implementation of institutional repositories should provide a rich
context in which to explore patterns of collaboration and leadership.
Collaborative endeavors are increasingly commonplace across academia, as research
becomes more interdisciplinary and cross-institutional, and as networked communications

9

become ever more pervasive. ProQuest’s Summon Service gives a good indication of the rise in
scholarly interest in the study of collaborative academic practices, as it showed that peerreviewed journal articles including the terms “university” and “collaboration” grew more
numerous in the decade from 2006-2015 (from 49,911 in 2006 to 60,231 in 2015 – a 20.68%
increase). A similar trend can be seen with articles containing the terms “academia” and
“collaboration” (from 2,526 in 2006 to 3,533 in 2015 – a 39.86% increase), and “library” and
“collaboration” (from 25,553 in 2006 to 28,951 in 2015 – a 13.3% increase).
A focus on library collaboration can also be seen in the future-thinking exercises
undertaken by the Taiga Forum, a group of senior library administrators who released so-called
provocative statements as discussion documents from 2006-2011. In 2011, their top 10 trends
included “radical cooperation” between institutions and the need to open library space “to
complementary programs” (Taiga Forum Steering Committee, 2011). Earlier provocative
statements pointing to the importance of cross-campus collaborations included the fact that
“successful libraries will … work at the intersection of librarianship, information technology and
instructional technology” (Taiga Forum Steering Committee, 2009) and that “the library will be a
partner in the Learning and Research Support Services infrastructure” of the institution (Taiga
Forum Steering Committee, 2006).
Despite the prevalence of collaborative decision-making in the provision of major new
library or IT services on campus, no study has examined academic institutions to understand how
collaborative leadership functions in IR planning and implementation. This research will
examine IRs in research universities and liberal arts colleges through the theoretical frame of a
defined set of collaborative leadership characteristics. It will seek to discover what collaborative
leadership traits manifest themselves in IR planning and implementation, and what

10

collaborations are perceived to exist among key stakeholder groups such as librarians, IT experts,
faculty members, and students. Knowledge of how the constituent traits of collaborative
leadership influence IR development can inform future IR implementations at research
universities and liberal arts colleges. More broadly, these findings should help our
understanding of other large-scale institutional partnerships that involve stakeholder
communities such as librarians, technologists, campus leadership, and faculty members. Such
collaborative work is becoming more prevalent in academia, as teaching, research, student life,
recruitment, and collections make increasing use of global networks, cloud-based storage, and
software solutions, and then require new services and infrastructures to sustain them.
This study does not try to quantify the value of IRs to the scholars they serve, their
success in attracting content, or their impact on the reputation of the institution. Earlier attempts
to do this show the complexity of this task, with multiple variables that need to be defined and
tracked. For example, Sale (2006) looked at the total annual publication output for three
institutions that had mandatory deposit policies into their local IRs (University of Southampton,
Queensland University of Technology, and the University of Tasmania) and compared their total
scholarly outputs with their IR submission rates. Thomas and McDonald (2007) measured the
“distribution of a repository's total content, per contributor” (Research Questions section, para. 2)
for nine institutions to uncover how many items individual scholars deposited. What can be
determined more readily with the data collection methodologies used in this research is the
perception of collaboration and leadership that are revealed in IR planning and implementation.

11

Research Questions
1) Study Population: ARL and Oberlin Group
a) Do IR format, size, length of operation, nomenclature, or technology platform vary
between ARL and Oberlin Group members?
b) Is there any difference in the perception of collaborative leadership traits between
ARL and Oberlin Group members?
c) Does the perception of the success of the IR, or of the collaborative involvement with
stakeholder communities, vary between ARL and Oberlin Group members?
2) Leadership Frame: Collaborative Leadership
a) Does IR planning and development reveal evidence of collaborative leadership?
b) If so, which collaborative leadership traits are present or absent?
3) Study Groups: Library Directors and IR Developers
a) Is there any difference in the perception of collaborative leadership traits between
library directors and IR developers?
b) Does the perception of the success of the IR, or of the collaborative involvement with
stakeholder communities, vary between directors and developers?

Conclusion
The institutional repository is an infrastructure for the preservation and access of
intellectual assets. IRs are well established in both research universities and liberal arts colleges
after fifteen years of activity, and new IRs continue to be created. However, we know too little
about what characterizes effective IR planning and implementation. IRs are led by librarians,
and the library and information science literature is increasingly interested in discussing library

12

activities in terms of leadership practice and theory. Examining collaborative leadership traits in
the context of the IR should tell us more about whether deep and conscious collaboration
contributes to the successful planning and development of this relatively new type of information
service. With increasing frequency, collaborations across disciplinary and expert-group
boundaries are supporting teaching, research, and scholarly communication in an academic
institution. A recent example would be the development of various forms of asynchronous
online instruction, which also need content, technology, and pedagogical skills working in
concert to succeed. The insights and lessons learned from an examination of IRs can inform
other cross-campus, multi-stakeholder, technology-driven endeavors.

LITERATURE REVIEW

The Institutional Repository
History of IRs
Institutional repositories are an increasingly common infrastructure through which
research universities and liberal arts colleges promote and safeguard their research, scholarship,
conference papers, and (in some cases) creative works. They are recent enterprise-wide services
when compared to other campus technology platforms such as email, websites, or integrated
library systems, and they were long predated by online collections of scholarship organized by
academic discipline, and by libraries creating archives of electronic theses and dissertations
(ETDs). Online collections of scholarly materials first appeared in the literature under the
nomenclature “institutional repository” in 2002, 1 most notably in a July 2002 position paper
from the Scholarly Publishing & Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC) (Crow, 2002a).
Despite their relatively recent provenance, institutional repositories respond to a
foundational use case for the Internet: the desire to put information resources on a network and to
share them with a global community. This point is well demonstrated by King and Chvany’s
1972 documentary Computer Networks: The Heralds of Resource Sharing, which examined the
potential of the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) to share knowledge,
and was produced just prior to the 1974 coining of the term “Internet” (Cerf, Dalal, & Sunshine,
1974). The sharing of research across computer networks was also central to the development of
1

There are earlier references to an “institutional model” for repositories and archives coming out of the October
1999 Santa Fe convention of the Open Archives Initiative (Van de Sompel & Lagoze, 2000; Tansley & Harnad,
2000). These early references do not use the term “institutional repository” or define it in the manner that it was
being discussed by 2002.

19

the World Wide Web in the late 1980s, which accelerated the use of the Internet in the 1990s.
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), the underlying code for all World Wide Web pages, was
invented by Tim Berners-Lee at a research institution – the Centre Européen de Recherche
Nucléaire (CERN) in Geneva, Switzerland – precisely to transmit scholarly documents across the
Internet (1989). Just prior to his coining of the term “World Wide Web,” Tim Berners-Lee wrote
Information Management: A Proposal (1989), which described to his colleagues at CERN a
system for preserving their research and allowing wide access to it. The aim of this proposed
system, serving a distributed set of scientists at a single institution, was remarkably similar to a
contemporary IR: “This proposal concerns the management of general information about
accelerators and experiments at CERN. It discusses the problems of loss of information about
complex evolving systems and derives a solution based on a distributed hypertext system” (para.
1). Information Management: A Proposal also imagined a global audience being served by this
scholarly repository, just as the current Open Access movement does: “In general, it will be more
important to allow read access to the general public: it may be that there is a limited number of
people who are providing the information” (Accessing Existing Data section, para. 4). BernersLee was prescient in recognizing that the hypermedia solutions outlined in his proposal would
have “much support from the publishing industry, and from librarians whose job it is to organise
information” (Incentives and CALS section, para. 2).
The arrival of the institutional repository in the early 2000s as a mechanism to share
scholarship was preceded by the development of the disciplinary repository a decade earlier,
especially in academic departments such as physics that relied heavily on the circulation of prepublication versions of scholarly articles. Researchers in the 1990s were quick to see the
advantage of the World Wide Web for document storage and transmission, and they created

20

discipline-specific services including arXiv.org for physics (https://arxiv.org/), CogPrints for the
cognitive sciences (http://cogprints.org/), RePEc for economics (http://repec.org/), and the
Networked Computer Science Technical Reference Library (http://www.ncstrl.org/) (Van de
Sompel & Lagoze, 2000, The Growth of E-Print Archives section, para. 4). These disciplinebased repositories continue to be a major benefit to the scholarly communities they serve and a
significant source of publicly available scholarship. In April 2017, for example, ArXiv.org
contained 1,266,940 open access e-prints, and since its founding it has broadened its disciplinary
scope to include work from mathematics, computer science, quantitative biology, quantitative
finance, and statistics.
As networked scholarly information proliferated in the mid-1990s, computer developers,
academics, librarians, and publishers debated the form and economics of academic publishing,
and the new ability for scholars to disseminate their own research findings electronically. In a
seminal Usenet statement in June 1994 on VPIEJ-L: An Online Discussion Group for Electronic
Journal Publishing Concerns, Stevan Harnad declared “that all scholarly authors should have
public FTP or web sites from which to publish their scholarship freely and electronically”
(Okerson & O’Donnell, 1995, pp. 11-12). As Jones (2006) later noted,
Nobel Prize winner Joshua Lederberg introduced into the [VPIEJ-L] discussion the idea
of institutional rather than disciplinary archives: “instead let each institution set up its
own ftp-able archives for all of its scholars. That way, each place can also set up its own
ground rules.” (pp. 111-112)
This remarkable exchange on the future of scholarly publishing also included librarians who
made the point that the library was the appropriate part of the academy to provide an institutional
archiving function. Peter Graham, then of Rutgers University Libraries, observed that “libraries,

21

unlike publishers, individual scholars, and scholarly societies, are explicitly in this for the long
term. I think it is our responsibility in the library community to determine what is necessary for
long-term preservation of information” (Okerson & O’Donnell, 1995, p. 47). Graham went on to
specify criteria for the digital curation of scholarship by academic libraries that closely
resembled an early specification for an IR, including such functions as backup of data, format
migration, repository-wide search, checks of authenticity and completeness, and institutional
policies to ensure long-term commitment (Okerson & O’Donnell, 1995, p. 48). Jones (2006)
proposed another early influence on IRs: “It is worth noting that by [2002-2003] the idea of
archiving e-theses institutionally was already well under development” (p. 112). He suggested
that “the role of the e-theses efforts should not be underestimated in the development of the
institutional repository, since they provide the infrastructure to gather some institutional research
under a degree of control by the organisation” (p. 112).
By the early 2000s, then, the same information-sharing ambitions and opportunities that
gave rise to disciplinary and e-theses repositories led to the development of online scholarly
archives that were defined by the institution at which the content was created. These early
institutional repositories were aided by the release of software and standards designed to manage
and disseminate scholarly material online. The University of Southampton’s e-Prints (2000) and
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s DSpace (2002) were widely promoted early
examples of open source IR infrastructures. At a 1999 e-prints convention in Santa Fe, New
Mexico, the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) was
proposed, in part to provide a metadata standard to support interoperability of holdings records
between disciplinary and institutional e-print repositories (Van de Sompel & Lagoze, 2000, From
Individual Archives to an Interoperable Fabric section, para. 2). That same year (1999) also saw

22

the creation of the Berkeley Electronic Press at the University of California, Berkeley, “to
provide effective publishing and research dissemination services that keep control in the hands of
scholars and libraries” (About bepress, 2016). The Berkeley Electronic Press is now a
commercial company called bepress, and its Digital Commons institutional repository platform,
launched in 2004, has become a popular infrastructure in North America on which to operate an
IR for universities and (especially) for liberal arts colleges.
By 2003, the existence of IRs as a new component in the scholarly communications
infrastructure was being discussed regularly in conference papers, academic articles, and the
press: see Peters (2002), Tennant (2002), and Young (2002) for examples. Publications from
influential higher education organizations such as the Coalition for Networked Information
(CNI) and SPARC came out around the same time. Rayn Crow’s July 2002 position paper for
SPARC – “The Case for Institutional Repositories” – and a 2003 article by CNI’s Clifford Lynch
– “Institutional Repositories: Essential Infrastructure for Scholarship in the Digital Age” – are
much-cited seminal statements on IR definition, potential, and scope. Versions of both articles
were also published in the Association of Research Libraries newsletter, ARL: A Bimonthly
Report (Crow in August 2002 and Lynch in February 2003), further publicizing their ideas to
major North American research libraries. 2 The topic was also featured at both CNI and ARL
membership meetings early in the development of IRs, which brought their potential as a new
service to the attention of library technology experts and to library directors.

Early expressions of the importance of the IR were often positive and ambitious, seeing
this new service as offering “a strategic response both to the opportunities of the digital
networked environment and the systemic problems in today's scholarly journal system”
(Johnson, 2002, Conclusion section, para. 1). Yeates (2003) was unusual in these early
expressions of IR potential in considering some of their drawbacks, noting that:
They affect the balance of institutional power as some departments proceed faster than
others. They rely on unproven methods for long-term digital preservation. They may
need quick wins to sustain institutional support. Initial costs may be high as contributors
perceive high risks and duplicate effort to reduce them. (p. 98)
Lynch also voiced concerns in April 2003, including the danger that IRs would be “cast as tools
of institutional (administrative) strategies to exercise control over what has typically been faculty
controlled intellectual work” (p. 332), and that “many campus communities may expect and
demand that such services be made available rapidly” (p. 334), leading to poorly designed
services. The latter fear proved unfounded, as faculty did not clamor for these services (see the
Challenges Faced by IRs section later in this chapter).
In the years since the institutional repository was introduced, IRs have grown in number
and size, and have spread internationally. The Directory of Open Access Repositories
(OpenDOAR) listed 3,350 “quality-assured … open access repositories around the world” from
2,835 repository organizations as of July 2017 (About OpenDOAR, 2017), with 2,864 (85.5%)
of these repositories being institutional ones (as opposed to disciplinary, aggregating, or
governmental repositories). OpenDOAR’s chart of repository organizations by continent
showed Europe (44.3%), Asia (22.4%), and North America (16.5%) as the main locations by
July 2017. Repository66.org’s global repository map showed 3,045 IRs from 60 countries,

24

including Cuba, Iceland, Namibia, and Samoa, as well as the United States, Australia, Japan, and
most European countries when it was last updated in April 2014 (http://maps.repository66.org).
The Cybermetrics Lab of the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas (CSIC),
Spain’s largest public research institute, publishes a Ranking Web of Repositories
(http://repositories.webometrics.info/), and 10 of the 20 highest ranked institutions were from
outside North America by January 2017. This site ranks according to “a set of metrics based on
web presence, impact and usage” (Aguillo, Ortega, Fernández, & Utrilla, 2010, p. 477), and
initially considered size measured in number of pages (20% of the total rank), the number of
PDF files available (15%), the number of entries in Google Scholar (15%), and visibility
measured by the “number of external inlinks extracted from Yahoo and Exalead” (50%) (pp.
479-480). The 2017 edition of this quantitative ranking of IRs changed the weighting of the four
categories to size (10%), visibility (50%), presence in Google Scholar (30%) and PDF files
(10%). This latter category is now called “rich files” and measures the presence of formats such
as Adobe Acrobat, PostScript, MS Word, MS PowerPoint, and MS Excel. According to CSIC,
the most highly ranked IR from the study populations in this research is the University of
California eScholarship Repository, which is third in their ranking. 3
IR Definitions
Across their 15-year history, IRs have been infrastructures that combine information
policy, content, taxonomy, curatorial impulse, and institutional ambition: “an IR consists of
formally organized and managed collections of digital content generated by faculty, staff, and
students at an institution” (McCord, 2003). Initial definitions of IRs were expansive in their
assumptions about the range of materials that they would hold, including “pre-prints and other

3

have sections within eScholarship.

25

works-in-progress, peer-reviewed articles, monographs, enduring teaching materials, data sets
and other ancillary research material, conference papers, electronic theses and dissertations, and
gray literature” (Crow, 2002a, pp. 17-18). In his 2003 paper on IRs, Lynch also imagined a
broad array of materials produced by an institution and preserved over time:
Institutional repositories also have roles beyond disseminating and managing the works
of individual scholars that are part of the dialog of scholarly communications. … at least
a few institutions themselves are changing their culture and are making commitments to
globally disseminate extensive teaching and learning materials through the Net … or, at a
less systematic but still important level, to digitally capture and preserve many of the
events of campus life: symposia, performances, lectures. Institutional repositories offer a
framework for organized stewardship and accessibility of these materials. (2003b, p.
331)
Lynch and Lippincott’s 2005 survey of early IRs also reflected these ambitions:
One key result of our survey is that it seems clear a significant number of institutions are
committed to institutional repositories that go far beyond e-prints. We can see that both
in the kind of materials that are in repositories today and the kinds of materials that are
planned for inclusion in the near future – not only e-prints and electronic theses and
dissertations, but digitized special collections materials, multimedia, course materials,
and datasets. (Types of Materials in Repositories section, para. 1)
Other early definitions of IRs underscored the assumption that IR holdings would be fully
representative of the array of intellectual output that an academic institution produces:
x

“[an IR could contain] digital assets [such as] learning objects, data sets, e-prints,
theses, [and] dissertations” (De Rosa, Dempsey, & Wilson, 2003, p. 64).

26

x

an institutional repository could contain any work product generated by the
institution's students, faculty, non-faculty researchers, and staff. This material might
include student electronic portfolios, classroom teaching materials, the institution's
annual reports, video recordings, computer programs, data sets, photographs, and art
works – virtually any digital material that the institution wishes to preserve.
(Johnson, 2002, Scholarly Content section, para. 1)

In 2006, Jones, Andrew, and MacColl summarized the early expansive thinking on IR content by
characterizing core IR holdings as consisting of “research materials – peer-reviewed papers, eprints, theses, reports, conference papers, working papers and other types of documents” (p. 11),
but giving thoughtful attention to other types of institutional output, including:
x

Learning objects: “lecture notes, image collections, animated programs, assessments
as revision aids” (p. 12), seeing that “the value on learning objects lies in their
capacity to be re-used” (p. 13).

x

Corporate assets: “institutional records, including curricular descriptions (calendar,
prospectuses), examination results, annual reports from the institution and its sub
departments, and many other records” (pp. 14-15), recognizing that “some assets will
only be available to authorized staff” (p. 15).

The predictions that IRs would house a wide range of scholarly and cultural materials did not
come to pass, with journal articles, dissertations, and books predominating (see the IR
Development and Type of Content section later in this chapter).
Jones (2006, p. 115) concluded that IRs had six major characteristics, citing Crow
(2002a), Johnson (2002), Lynch (2003a), and Genoni (2004) as his sources. IRs were:

27

x

Institutionally defined

x

Scholarly

x

Cumulative and perpetual

x

Open and interoperable

x

Capturing and preserving events of campus life

x

Searchable within constraints

A survey of IRs today could make only a weak case for “interoperable” (across platforms at
least) 4 or for “capturing and preserving events of campus life” beyond dissertations and scholarly
materials.
Institutional Ambitions for IRs
Crow’s influential July 2002 position paper for SPARC proposed that institutional
repositories are strategic and transformative undertakings for the institutions that support them:
[The IR] is a strategic response to systemic problems in the existing scholarly journal
system – and the response can be applied immediately, reaping both short-term and
ongoing benefits for universities and their faculty and advancing the positive
transformation of scholarly communication over the long term. (2002a, p. 4)
Crow went on to advocate for a range of benefits that have resonated with library and university
administrators, but less so with the faculty who create the scholarship that the IR seeks to curate
and publish. In sections titled “New Scholarly Publishing Paradigm” (p. 6) and “Institutional
Visibility and Prestige” (p. 6), Crow outlined a model of scholarly communication in which
institutions publish their research directly and without charge to the user, rather than relying on

third-party commercial journal publishers to disseminate scholarship at a cost to the user. Such
publicly accessible scholarship was assumed to enhance the reputation of the institution to which
the scholar belongs: “an institutional repository concentrates the intellectual product created by a
university’s researchers, making it easier to demonstrate its scientific, social and financial value”
(p. 6). Crow further proposed that “institutional repositories represent an historical and tangible
embodiment of the intellectual life and output of an institution” (p. 16) and the “repository
becomes a significant indicator of the institution’s academic quality” (p. 17). Put another way,
“a university invests in an institutional repository to demonstrate the institution’s value and
impact to the community it serves” (Hall, 2014, p. 18). Swan (2008) was more hyperbolic about
the business and reputational benefits of the IR to its host institution:
The reasons for having a repository are so compelling, the advantages so obvious, the
payoff so potentially large, that no institution seriously intent upon its mission, and upon
enhancing its profile and internal functioning, will want to disadvantage itself badly by
not having one (or more). (p. 15)
Swan continued, “repository developments, through improved accessibility and communications,
are expected to lead to benefits in the environment, education, healthcare and economic wellbeing” of a region (p. 17). In the United States, at least, it would be difficult to illustrate these
societal and institutional payoffs in 2017, although Swan did go on to offer a less effusive list of
the advantages of the repository to the institution (p. 31), which included the benefits often
espoused for North American IRs:
x

improved visibility of the institution

x

improved impact of its outputs

x

more effective “marketing” of the institution

29

x

better management of the institution’s intellectual assets

x

easier assessment of what the institution is producing and creating

x

facilitation of workflow for researchers and teachers

x

facilitation of collaborative research

There is an increasing awareness that the value of IRs to the institution that hosts them is
not only bound up with the data they preserve and share, but also with the services that they
make possible. Swan (2008) pointed to two European national repository organizations – the
Dutch DAREnet, now incorporated into the National Academic Research and Collaborations
Information System (https://www.narcis.nl/) and the British SHERPA (http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/)
– as examples of institutional value being generated by a combination of the IR content itself and
the services that can be built on top of this well-curated data:
At the data level, institutions collect, store and retain control over their own intellectual
property in digital form. … At the service level, services may be developed at an
institution for that institution, or may serve a national audience or even a global one.
Some services may aid the ingest process: for example, there may be services that advise
on intellectual property issues, on metadata creation and enhancement, on technology, on
preservation, or offer repository hosting facilities. (p. 42)
Chavez et al. (2007) also highlighted the importance of services of differing types in the value of
a repository to an institution. They also specify two levels of service:
x

"high-level, or infrastructure, repository services that support sharing of data between
repositories, ingesting of data into repositories, and harvesting of content from
repositories" (Introduction section, para. 4).

30

x

"low-level, or content based, services such as natural language processing tools and
analysis services that support users in their interaction with materials that are already
within repositories" (Introduction section, para. 4).

Duranceau (2008) lists a comprehensive set of services that she thought would be desirable to
faculty, including automated submission to discipline-based repositories, online workspaces for
collaborative projects, and citation management (p. 247). Seaman (2011), in surveying the needs
of humanities faculty, also found that:
An IR can offer a range of services to humanities faculty that are desired by them,
especially the digitization, online storage, and curation of their research materials. Such
reliable networked storage is a real need, especially for those with large collections of
digital images, audio, video, and architectural datasets. (Conclusion section, para. 2)
IRs and Libraries
Crow (2002a) made a particular case for the benefits of IRs to academic libraries, arguing
that they will give the library “an extraordinary level of visibility within the university” (p. 21)
and an increased “relevance to the faculty” (p. 21). His message has resonated with librarians
because IRs address academic library values, including long-term preservation and open access
to scholarship. In 2003, Chang concluded “as the [IR] concept is implemented, the library's
visibility and importance would be elevated not only at the institutional level, but also at national
and global levels” (p. 79). A decade later, Burns, Lana, and Budd (2013) made similar claims
about the value of the IR to the library’s reputation and relevance:
An institutional repository extends an academic library's capability to participate in the
scholarly communication system, and this capability should be considered a source of
value, especially in a world that continues to migrate to the digital.… The argument made

31

is that academic librarians add value to the scholarly communication process when they
establish institutional repositories by, among other things, enhancing the discoverability
of work through robust metadata and providing a permanent URI for that work. (Value
section, para. 1)
The literature of library and information science shows the central role that librarians
have played in founding and operating institutional repositories. From their earliest
development, IRs have been predominantly planned and implemented by library directors and
staff (Baudoin & Branschosky, 2003; Dill & Palmer, 2005; Rieh, St. Jean, Yakel, Markey, &
Kim, 2008). Lynch (2003a), in outlining the collaborative team that is needed for a functioning
IR, put librarians at the head of the list: “an effective institutional repository of necessity
represents a collaboration among librarians, information technologists, archives and records
managers, faculty, and university administrators and policymakers” (p. 328). Cervone (2004)
also stressed that collaborative teams, led by librarians, are necessary for an IR implementation,
which “can include information technologists, archivists, records managers, faculty, and
university administrators, as well as local government officials and community members” (p.
44). Lynch and Lippincott (2005) observed that librarians readily assume leadership roles in the
development of institutional repositories (Administrative Responsibility and Policy-Setting
section, para. 1). This finding has been borne out by similar studies: “All respondents,
implementers and planners alike, indicated that the library has been a driving force in the
creation of or planning for an IR” (Bailey et al., 2006, p. 14); “librarians take the lead in IR pilot
testing and system implementation, assume most of the responsibility for the IR effort, and are
members of various IR committees” (Markey, Rieh, St. Jean, Kim, & Yakel, 2007, p. 2). Allard,

32

Mack, and Feltner-Reichert performed content analysis on early scholarly articles pertaining to
institutional repositories and concluded the following:
two-thirds of the articles mentioned libraries and librarians being involved with the
creation of the IRs. Somewhat fewer noted that libraries should be involved in the
maintenance of the IRs. About half of the articles discussed how a library can participate
to make the resources more accessible. (2005, p. 332)
Other writings underscored the development of new library skills needed for IRs (Chang,
2003; Horwood, Sullivan, Young, & Garner, 2005; Duranceau, 2008), and the impact of a
repository on specific library services, most notably reference (Bell, Foster, & Gibbons, 2005).
Over the years, new library positions have developed to support IR activities, including
repository coordinator, intellectual property specialist, and data research librarian, while
established roles such as liaison librarians “are taking on new, add-on roles as intermediaries
between faculty and the development team and their goals” (Palmer, Teffeau, & Newton, 2008,
p. 15). Buehler and Boateng (2005) described the effects of IRs on the work of reference
librarians, who they saw as taking on a “new role as change agents … marketing the IR and
persuading faculty to use it and to deposit materials in it” (p. 299). Jantz and Wilson (2008)
echoed the need for librarians to market the value of IRs to faculty. They concluded that “faculty
do not perceive any significant value of an IR to their scholarly endeavors” (p. 194), and called
for libraries to fill “an institutional vacuum [through the] articulation and marketing of IR
services and how IRs can advance scholarship” (p. 194). Kim (2008) studied self-archiving of
content in IRs by faculty and concluded that “increasing contributions by faculty may depend on
libraries taking more initiatives and determining sustainable and extensible strategies for
implementing services in [long-term digital archiving and copyright management]” (p. 220).

33

Simons and Richardson (2012) surveyed Australasian institutional repository staff and
highlighted a range of management, technical, and legal skills needed in IR staff, and mentioned
the difficulty in finding appropriate professional development.
By the 2013 edition of Institutional Digital Repository Benchmarks, a survey of 33
academic institutions operating repositories (21 in the USA, 12 elsewhere in the world), it was
clear that (in the institutions surveyed at least) libraries are the overwhelming source of support
for IRs, both in labor and in funding: “the mean percentage of overall skilled labor needed to
operate the depository that comes from the library is 96.03%” (Primary Research Group, 2013, p.
35); “across the entire sample, 87.88% of the digital repositories are funded largely from the
main library budget, 3.03% are funded largely through grants, and 9.09% are funded through
both grants and the library budget” (Primary Research Group, 2013, p. 35). 5
Challenges Faced by IRs
Despite the rapid growth in the number of IRs worldwide, many of these services were
lightly populated with content in their early years, and the problem of content attraction has been
a persistent one across the history of the IR. Unlike the earlier disciplinary repositories that were
created by communities of scholars, institutional repositories are not typically initiated by those
researchers who produce the content that IRs preserve and make accessible. Senior
administrators and librarians principally create IRs, and too often the services are based on
insufficient analysis of faculty needs: “many librarians and administrators are convinced that
repositories are important – so much so that most are, or will be, implementing repositories
before they do a needs assessment” (Markey et al., 2007, p. ix). Such a lack of stakeholder
engagement in their development, or a clear articulation of the problem they are solving in terms
5

Primary Research Group surveys, of which there are many, are of interest but their survey populations can be
small, and the wide variety of institutions who respond to their questionnaires can lead to an idiosyncratic set of
inputs. These surveys give little confidence that one can generalize from their findings.

34

that faculty understand, has hindered the adoption of IRs. This is a continuing issue, as this 2015
example from a liberal arts college makes clear:
The decision to implement the digital repository service was driven by [a] grant and was
not exclusively based on needs assessment and analysis. The essential mission of the
repository as determined at its outset – to collect, preserve, and provide access to the
intellectual output of faculty and students – was not well received by faculty as relevant
to teaching and student learning. This mismatch between the intended benefits of the
repository service and faculty expectations for it resulted in a low faculty participation
rate and slow scholarly content growth. (Wu, 2015, Overlooking Institutional Teaching
Needs: Lessons Learned section, para. 1)
Simple awareness of the existence of an IR has also been an issue: Kim (2011) surveyed
faculty at doctoral granting universities in the US, and of the “684 survey respondents, only 274
(40.1%) were aware of their university IRs” (p. 249). Another survey showed a similar result,
with only “59% of the [555] faculty in the sample understand[ing] the term ‘institutional
repository’” (Primary Research Group, 2009, p. 19). Kim’s survey even revealed 76 faculty
members who had content in their local IR but were unaware that the institution had such a
service (2011, p. 249). This fact indicates that the material had been deposited by a third party,
and neither that third party nor the IR developers had reported back to the faculty member, or the
faculty member received notice but did not recognize the term “institutional repository” as the
name for a digital archive of scholarly material.
IRs have also given rise to concerns about potential loss of intellectual property rights:
“most faculty members … did not consider their research materials as ‘institutional’ property”
(Markey et al., 2008, p. 176); “use of openly accessible IRs may be challenging for scientists

35

who are accustomed to traditional journal-based scientific communication, as IRs raise questions
about data ownership and intellectual property rights” (Brown & Abbas, 2010, p. 182). As a
result, faculty have been reluctant to submit content to their local IRs, or do not perceive the
benefits of taking the time to do so. Genoni (2004) proposed extending the core library
professional practices of collection development to the IR, including “negotiation of content
priorities with users” (p. 303), “description and definition of priorities” (p. 304), “evaluation of
the performance of the collection” (p. 304), “decisions related to access” (p. 304), and
“management of conservation and preservation” (p. 304). And he was prescient in seeing that
the library staff had to be active in marketing the benefits of the IR: “the process of ‘acquisitions’
in the context of institutional repositories is therefore transformed into the twin roles of
promoting the benefits to be achieved by contributing to a repository, and educating contributors
as to when and how this should be undertaken” (p. 305).
There was an early assumption that IRs would be successful because they were simply
formalizing and legitimizing faculty practices already underway:
Institutional repositories build on a growing grassroots faculty practice of posting
research online, most often on personal web sites, but also on departmental sites or in
disciplinary repositories. This demonstrates a desire for expanded exposure of, and
access to, their work. (Johnson, 2002, para. 2)
But this has not proved to be the case and Xia (2008) has concluded that “faculty authors are
indeed not enthusiastic about archiving their articles into their institutional repository even
though they are familiar with self-archiving practice” (Web 2.0 and User-Generated Content
section, para. 4). The current generation of scholars have grown up with the existence of open
disciplinary archives as a normal, expected, part of the scholarly communications landscape in

36

which they operate (at least in the sciences and social sciences), but the general lack of selfarchiving in IRs suggests that these authors remain unconvinced about the reputational benefits
or knowledge transfer efficacy of the institutionally-based repository. Finally, a recent survey of
203 Digital Commons IRs “asked IR administrators about the reasons/concerns cited by faculty
about why they do not participate or are reluctant to participate in their IR” (Dubinsky, 2014, p.
15), and the cited reasons were the following (p. 15):
x

lack of awareness of the repository

x

copyright questions

x

preference for a disciplinary repository

x

perceived difficulty of the submission process

x

fear of plagiarism

These survey results neatly summarize the persistent challenges that IR developers have faced
when trying to market the IR to their faculty.
Another potential challenge faced by institutional repositories are academic social
networks such as ResearchGate and Academia.edu, both founded in 2008. These commercial
sites allow researchers to build profiles, upload full-text documents, monitor use of their
scholarship, get newsfeeds on topics of interest, and connect with other scholars. The scale of
these social networks is impressive: Academia.edu claims to have over 50 million profiles of
academics, who have added over 18 million papers (About Academia.edu, 2017); ResearchGate
has over 12 million members and 100 million publications (ResearchGate, 2017). Both services
encourage article uploads, send out notifications, facilitate connections to other scholars, suggest
researchers whose work one may want to follow, and both now have job boards. The research
literature shows a growing interest in Academia.edu and ResearchGate and their impact on

37

scholarly communications, faculty rewards, and global scientific knowledge. By 2017, over 600
scholarly articles reference Academia.edu and over 700 reference ResearchGate according to the
ProQuest Summon discovery service, and 200 examine both.
Recently, Borrego (2017) studied Spanish researchers and their willingness to submit
articles to their university IRs and to ResearchGate. He cited earlier research that indicated a
high awareness of ResearchGate amongst scholars:
According to a survey of 3,500 researchers from 95 countries reported by Van Noorden
(2014), over 88% were aware of [ResearchGate], and just under half visited it regularly,
placing the site second only to Google Scholar and ahead of Facebook and LinkedIn. (p.
2)
Borrego identified 30,630 articles published in 2014 from 13 leading Spanish universities, and
generated a random sample of 1,031 papers that he then cross-referenced with the scholar’s
institutional repository and with ResearchGate. He found that only 114 of the 1,031 articles
(11.1%) were available from the IR at the author’s home institution, but that 565 of the 1,031
articles (54.8%) were freely accessible in ResearchGate (presumably uploaded there by their
authors). Moreover, ResearchGate held an additional 419 (40.6%) “in the form of a page with
information about the title of the article, author(s), abstract, bibliographic references, impact
factor of the journal, and number of reads, and citations” (p. 5), for a total of 984 of the 1,031
articles (95.4%) being represented in ResearchGate in some fashion. Borrego then sent an email
query to those authors who had contributed an article to ResearchGate but not to their local IR,
which yielded 31 replies that mostly “focused on two issues: ignorance about the existence of the
IR [at their institution] and awareness of the advantages offered by [ResearchGate]” (p. 8). The
stated advantages of ResearchGate expressed by these faculty members included greater

38

visibility, more citations, ease of use, speed of publication, and the ability to manage a profile
page (all features of the IR that librarians have tried to promote to their faculty for years).
Even more recently, Sci-Hub (https://sci-hub.cc), the largest pirated collection of
scholarly articles (claiming to have over 50 million items), has become popular thanks to its
comprehensive coverage, absence of cost, and its convenience. Users request an item by author,
title, or digital object identifier (DOI), and download a PDF without charge; if Sci-Hub does not
have the requested item, they will try to add it to their collection using the university log-in
credentials they have obtained (some of which, Sci-Hub claims, have been donated to them by
researchers in support of Sci-Hub’s mission to open up research to the world’s users). With the
aid of the Kazakhstani graduate student who created the service, Bohannon (2016) analyzed SciHub usage from September 2015-March 2016 and recorded 28 million article downloads. He
goes on to observe:
Sci-Hub users are not limited to the developing world. Some critics of Sci-Hub have
complained that many users can access the same papers through their libraries but turn to
Sci-Hub instead – for convenience rather than necessity.… The United States is the fifth
largest downloader after Russia, and a quarter of the Sci-Hub requests for papers came
from the 34 members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,
the wealthiest nations with, supposedly, the best journal access. In fact, some of the most
intense use of Sci-Hub appears to be happening on the campuses of U.S. and European
universities. (It's a Sci-Hub World section, para. 2)
A survey attached to Bohannon’s article “generated nearly 11,000 responses in the week it was
live” (Peet, 2016, Mixed Motivations section, para. 5), and of those who used Sci-Hub
“approximately 17 percent said they did so out of convenience, and another 23 percent said they

39

used Sci-Hub on principle – mostly to protest publishers’ profits from research users believe
should be accessible to all” (Peet, 2016, Mixed Motivations section, para. 6).
There are some features of the IR that are presented in the literature as being ones that
scholars do find attractive. Early in the history of IRs, Shearer (2003) concluded that “scholars
are more likely to use … an archive if it has significant input activity, and … they are more
likely to deposit their work if an archive is highly used, thus providing greater visibility to their
research” (pp. 254-255). Kim (2011) concluded that the major motivational factors for faculty to
contribute to IRs were issues of “preservation and copyright” (p. 253), and she posits that the
services they value the most are “long term preservation of IR materials” and the management of
copyright issues around the deposited materials (p. 253). More recently, Lagzian, Abrizah, and
Wee (2015) surveyed 295 IR developers to determine key success factors for repositories and
while they discovered six factors, including “management, services, technology, self-archive
practices, people, and resources” (p. 201), the top-ranking attribute was “The IR makes available
freely accessible full text documents” (p. 202).
IR Development and Volume of Content
If the relevance and value of an IR is measured by volume of content, as it sometimes is,
there is growing evidence that success requires a move away from the expectation that faculty
will self-deposit articles, even if they are willing to do so in a disciplinary repository such as
Arxiv or a social network such as ResearchGate. Thomas and McDonald showed this reluctance
on the part of faculty to deposit work in the IR in 2007, where 74% of depositing authors in the
eleven repositories studied only submitted one article (Voluntary-Deposit Institutional
Repository Findings section, para. 1). More recent surveys are only now beginning to show an
alternate trend. A 2009 survey of 555 faculty members at colleges and universities in the United

40

States and Canada found that “only 9.7% … have ever contributed a publication to their library’s
digital repository” (Primary Research Group, 2009, p. 17), although 56.7% of those surveyed
were aware that their institution had “a digital repository for faculty publications” (Primary
Research Group, 2009, p. 17). Schonfeld and Housewright (2010) provided only a slightly
higher percentage in their 2009 survey of 3,025 US faculty: “our national sample found only
15% of faculty members have deposited into an institutional repository” (p. 28). Cullen and
Chawner (2011) concluded from a 2011 survey of New Zealand academics that “the evidence
shows that despite a considerable investment on the part of academic libraries in these
repositories the scholars and researchers whose work it is intended to support have not shown the
same commitment to Open Access” (p. 460). Individual case studies sometimes show better
results, such as Giesecke’s 2011 account of the success of the IR at the University of NebraskaLincoln, but they also underscore that success was predicated on the library submitting articles
on behalf of the faculty rather than relying on self-archiving (p. 536).
The 2012 version of the well-regarded Ithaka S+R survey showed little change. When
faculty were asked if they make “a version of [their] research outputs freely available online in
addition to the formally published version” (Housewright, Schonfeld, & Wulfson, 2013, p. 62)
less than 20% responded affirmatively, although when asked how valuable this activity was to
them a higher share of respondents reported being “enthusiastic about services that make their
research feely available online, although even here less than 2 out of 5 rated it highly important”
(p. 63). The most recent Ithaka S+R survey, conducted in 2015, found a marked increase in the
availability of publicly accessible scholarly books (nearly a 40% increase) and articles (a 35%
increase) in institutional repositories, although disciplinary repositories and other online sources
such as a personal website had higher percentages (Wolff, Rod, & Schonfeld, 2016, pp. 48-49).

41

This 2015 faculty survey also underscored the impact of recent policies by federal granting
agencies such as the National Science Foundation (NSF) and National Institutes of Health (NIH)
to make publicly funded research freely available online, an activity which is supported by the
faculty members surveyed: “Seventy-two percent of respondents strongly support the policy,
with higher levels of support reported by medical faculty members (82%) as compared to
scientists (76%), social scientists (73%), and humanists (61%)” (p. 50). A decade earlier,
Allen’s 2005 master’s thesis analyzed why faculty submitted work to IRs and recorded a similar
hesitation about open access from humanities faculty, who were concerned about the “potential
for plagiarism, the apprehension of interfering with publishing their work elsewhere, and the
fragility of online means of dissemination” (p. 4).
There is steady growth in both the number of repositories and the amount of content they
hold, but at a slower pace than imagined in the IR discussions of the early 2000s. The Directory
of Open Access Repositories recorded about three hundred new IRs being added each year
worldwide between December 2005 and September 2015, with the rate of increase slowing in
2016 (Growth of the OpenDOAR Database: Worldwide, 2017). In 2014, Dubinsky published
the results of a survey of 203 Digital Commons IR sites and found that their mean growth rate
was 165 items per month, about twice the rate recorded by McDowell in 2007 (p. 15). Regarding
the median growth rate, Dubinsky stated that “McDowell reported an annual median growth rate
of one new submission a day [in 2007]. This study’s findings found a more moderate increase –
median monthly growth for all IRs ranged from 27 to 44 items.… or less than 2 items per day”
(p. 15). She speculated that “the disparity of mean growth rate and median growth rate reveals
that a small number of IRs may be growing rapidly (raising the mean) while a much larger
number of IRs are growing much more slowly (reducing the median value)” (p. 15). Regarding

42

the type of institution and IR growth rates, Dubinsky found that “academic institutions with a
Carnegie Classification of Research University/Very High Research showed the greatest total
increase in content, while those with classifications of Baccalaureate, Master, Doctoral/Research
University, or Special Focus grew by the fewest number of items” (p. 15).
Finally, growth in the usage of IRs can be seen in two international surveys of IRs: in a
2013 survey of 33 IRs the average number of downloads was 405,701 and the average number of
visitors was 74,586 in the past year (Primary Research Group, 2013, p. 32). The 2016
international survey of 36 IRs recorded an average of 1,016,175 downloads and an average of
856,712 unique visitors in the past year (Primary Research Group, pp. 29-30), which suggests a
significant increase in use, recognizing that (with three exceptions) these were different
international universities and colleges being surveyed in these two studies.
IR Development and Type of Content
McDowell’s 2007 survey of IR deployment in American universities and colleges
explicitly followed up on Lynch and Lippincott’s 2005 work, and was also informed by findings
from several other studies of IR development, including an ARL Spec Kit (Bailey et al., 2006)
and the MIRACLE survey (Markey et al., 2007). McDowell’s findings showed that while IRs
were growing slowly in number and in total holdings, the early assumptions that they would hold
a rich array of intellectual output had not been borne out, especially with regard to learning
objects and other pedagogical materials such as syllabi. Electronic dissertations and theses
predominated, accounting for “41.5% of all items in American academic IRs” (McDowell, 2007,
Composite results section, para. 1). Another 37% were “faculty scholarly output”; 13% were
photographic collections; 5% non-scholarly publications, and 3% historical texts (McDowell,
2007, Composite results section, para. 2-5). Only 1% of the faculty content “comes from other

43

non-published and non-peer reviewed materials related to faculty scholarship, including
conference presentations, learning objects, podcasts and other multimedia, and datasets”
(McDowell, 2007, Composite results section, para. 2). An international survey of 54 IRs in the
same year also found that the predominant content was scholarly journal articles (78%) followed
by dissertations and theses (72%); only a minority of IRs (14.8%) contain any teaching or
administrative records (Primary Research Group, 2007, p. 24).
A survey of 38 international IRs in 2012 showed a continuing trend towards the
predominance of scholarly articles, dissertations, and theses: 84% of the IRs contained journal
articles, 76% contained dissertations and theses, 18.4% held coursework and only 10.5% had
university records (Primary Research Group, 2013, p. 45). New Content in Digital Repositories
(Simons & Richardson, 2013) gave more attention to the minority holdings in art, multimedia,
web archiving, student-generated content, and faculty-generated web projects that move from
individual to institutional curation at some point, such as when a faculty member retires. As that
study made clear, however, these materials are in the minority, or for some institutions not
present in their IRs at all.
This situation with regard to types of content is still largely unchanged in 2017, when IRs
contain mostly scholarship (as opposed to course materials, textbooks, artwork, conference
papers, etc.). The 2016 collection of essays Making Institutional Repositories Work declared that
ETDs were “the most fundamental content of institutional repositories” (Callicott, Scherer, &
Wesolek, p. xx), and this volume contained little mention of the wide variety of scholarly,
pedagogical, and artistic content envisioned by IR pioneers in the early 2000s. As Figure 2.1
shows, the Directory of Open Access Repositories also records a heavy concentration of articles,
theses, and dissertations, followed by books, chapters, conference papers, and reports, with far

44

fewer IRs holding any audio-visual materials, learning objects, datasets, patents, or software
(Content Types in OpenDOAR Repositories: Worldwide, 2017).

Figure 2.1. Content types in OpenDOAR repositories, July 2017.
Finally, disciplinary repositories continue to be more impactful and rewarding than
institutional ones for faculty as places to share their research. The 2015 Ithaka S+R US Faculty
Survey, edited by Wolff, Rod, and Schonfeld, asked faculty who had indicated that their research
was freely available on the Internet “whether each is available through their institution’s
repository, an open access disciplinary repository, or elsewhere” (p. 48). The findings were that
“books or scholarly monographs had the largest share available at the respondents’ institutional
repositories, pre-prints of peer-reviewed journal articles had the largest share in open access
disciplinary repositories, and blog or microblog posts had the largest share elsewhere online” (p.
48). From this finding they concluded that “non-institutional channels, that is, those that the
institution doesn’t monitor or control, are driving a substantial share of open and free access
online” (p. 48).

45

The Role of the IR in Master’s and Baccalaureate Institutions
IRs have generally developed more slowly at master’s and baccalaureate institutions than
at research universities. The February 2005 survey by Lynch & Lippincott of IRs of CNI
institutions received “35 responses from the 81 liberal arts institutions surveyed (43.8%)”
(Survey of US Higher Education Institutions: CNI Members section, para. 2), demonstrating
considerable early interest in the topic, although “only 2 of those (6% of respondents) reported
operational institutional repositories” (Extent of Implementation of Repositories section, para. 1).
A 2006 census of library directors “about their activities planning, pilot testing, and
implementing the institutional repositories on their campuses” (Markey et al., 2008, p. 157) also
found much interest but little activity: “Out of 446 respondents, 289 (64.8 percent) were from
master’s and baccalaureate institutions (M&BIs) where few operational institutional repositories
(IRs) were in place but where interest in learning more about the M&BI experience pertaining to
IRs was high” (Markey et al., 2008, p. 157). In the 2013 Ithaka S+R US Library Survey, library
directors at master’s and baccalaureate institutions responded at a much lower rate than their
colleagues at doctoral institutions to the question “How much of a priority is … providing an
institutional repository?” with less than 40% rating it a high priority, as opposed to nearly 70%
for directors at doctoral institutions (Schonfeld & Long, 2014, p. 57).
IRs at master’s and baccalaureate institutions typically hold considerably fewer items
than those at research universities. In 2005-6,
half of [the] smallest repositories were at institutions classified as Baccalaureate, and in
fact every one of the Baccalaureate colleges with an IR fell into this category. In
addition, not a single Baccalaureate college, Masters university, or [Doctoral/Research
university] had more than 500 items in its repository. (McDowell, 2007, Size of

46

Repositories section, para. 3)
In the 2013 Institutional Digital Repository Benchmarks survey (including eighteen BA/MA
granting institutions and ten research universities) the mean average for numbers of books in the
IR for BA/MA granting institutions was 460.15, as compared to 955.43 for research universities;
for journal articles for BA/MA institutions it was 1,390.43, as compared to 5,322.43 for research
universities (Primary Research Group, pp. 107-108).
IRs at master’s and baccalaureate institutions also have a different content profile than
those at research universities: Lynch & Lippincott noted in 2005 that liberal arts college IRs
focused more on “locally created materials for teaching and learning or [materials] that
document student research” (Survey of US Higher Education Institutions: CNI Members section,
para. 4). The focus on student research continues to be evident in subsequent studies:
At M&BIs, undergraduate students are much more likely to be active contributors …
(27.3 percent) of respondents at M&BIs singled out undergraduates. In fact, at M&BIs,
undergraduates are as likely as faculty to be contributors to the IR. This is a major way
in which the nature of M&BIs – teaching-focused institutions – is reflected in the IRs’
collection. (Markey et al., 2008, p. 167)
Xia & Opperman added in 2010 that “because of a dissimilarity in goals and mission, the
repositories implemented by master's and baccalaureate institutions tend to emphasize teaching
materials and student works more than research universities do” (p. 10). They demonstrated that
“students have contributed nearly half of the total content of the repositories in the forms of
student works or student journals…. One of the most popular forms of student works found in
the repositories is senior theses” (p. 12). A 2017 Coalition for Networked Information strategic
report commented on the inclusion of such student work in IRs at a liberal arts college, and

47

pointed to its value in promoting the institution to incoming students:
In a liberal arts college that has a program of curricular grants for incorporating digital
humanities methods into student assignments, the library has curated many of the student
materials created in those courses as well as syllabi in their repository. They would like
to promote this type of student collaboration with faculty to newly accepted students in
order to demonstrate the kinds of opportunities students have at their institution.
(Institutional Perspectives section, para. 18)
Wu (2015) observed that in BA/MA institutions teaching excellence is a more significant
component in promotion and tenure, and science faculty are less commonly found than in
research universities, so their faculty profile is not one that allows for the ingest of large numbers
of science journal articles as can happen at larger institutions (Unique Challenges for Small
Academic Institutions section, para. 2). Miller (2011), in discussing the repository and open
access policy at Rollins College, also commented on the nature of his faculty’s publications,
observing that
faculty … wanted a policy that recognized the diversity of their work … (fully half of the
publishing output of Rollins faculty is something other than the classic peer-reviewed
scholarly article, such as books, textbooks, creative works, or non-scholarly professional
or applied publications). (p. 18)
BA/MA granting institutions may also be consumers of their own IR content at a greater
rate than research universities. In the 2016 Institutional Digital Repository Benchmarks survey
(including thirteen BA/MA granting institutions and seven research universities) the mean
average for the percentage of IR downloads that come from within the institution was 38.41% for
BA/MA granting institutions, as compared to 11.20% for research universities (Primary

48

Research Group, p. 87). Another reflection of the student-focused nature of the content in a
liberal arts college IR is that 30.77% of BA/MA institutions in this survey used Facebook and
Twitter feeds to promote their institutional repositories – social media channels very heavily
used by students – while none of the research universities in the survey did so (Primary Research
Group, 2016, pp. 47-53).
IRs at master’s and baccalaureate institutions compare favorably to those at research
universities in studies that focus on IR holdings in terms of quality rather than quantity of
material. In such a study, Wacha and Wisner (2011) used the citation database Scopus to
cull author and title information for the top five most cited articles affiliated with each
institution [and] then searched the contents of the repositories and recorded the number of
highest impact articles available through the institutional repository and the number of
highest impact authors that included other items of intellectual output in the repository.
(p. 380)
The findings were that of the forty-five repositories examined, “only three contained the highest
impact articles generated by faculty at their institution, although sixteen repositories (36% of the
sample) included some form of intellectual output from these same faculty” (p. 381). Of these,
Masters level institutions fared better by comparison: “the Master’s level institutions contained
the most high-impact articles in their repositories” (p. 381); and “private not-for-profit colleges
and universities held significantly more high-impact articles and high-impact authors than their
public counterparts” (p. 381). Furthermore, Wacha and Wisner (2011) concluded that “if one
calculates the average number of articles contained per repository, institutions with Master’s M
classification and private not-for-profit status have repositories of the greatest value” (p. 382),
containing a higher proportion of high-impact articles and high-impact authors.

49

Master’s and baccalaureate institutions are also more likely to develop IRs as part of
consortia and cross-institutional partnerships (Xia & Opperman, 2010, p. 11). And as with
research universities, M&BI institutions fund their IRs from the library: “Costs are absorbed in
the library’s routine operating costs, by a special initiative supported by the library, a regular line
item in the library’s budget, or a grant awarded by an external source” (Markey et al., 2008, p.
161).
Collaborative Leadership
Collaborative Leadership: History
Recent academic study has traced the concept of collaborative leadership back at least to
the earlier part of the 19th century. Mendenhall and Marsh hold up Joseph Smith (1805-1844)
and his organization of the leadership of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints into
small governing groups of lay members as an enduring example of collaborative leadership:
Smith believed that others could receive inspiration to lead the church just as well as he
could, and he institutionalized a system of councils wherein the members of the councils
were taught to follow specific group process principles … that today would be described
as being characteristic of collaborative leadership. (2010, p. 287)
Mendenhall and Marsh (2010) also make the case that Mary Parker Follett (1868-1933)
articulated collaborative leadership tenets in her writings on organizational design, even though
she did not use the term. Follett was an early management consultant and social critic rediscovered in the 1990s by leadership theorists such as Peter Drucker (Graham, 1995), and
Mendenhall and Marsh observed that “the aspect of her work that has attracted the most attention
by current management scholars and practitioners … is that of integration: the collaborative
combining of differences among group members to invent new realities” (2010, p. 286). Both

50

Smith and Follett saw power sharing as essential to leadership (2010, p. 295), and saw
collaboration as fundamentally transformative:
According to Follett and Smith, the core elements of transformation associated with
collaborative leadership are worldview shifting, covenant making, and the philosophical
and emotional embracing of differences. It is only when these transformative processes
are well underway within individuals that the effects of collaborative leadership skills and
competencies begin to be efficacious. (Mendenhall & Marsh, 2010, p. 301)
Pearce and Conger, in a 2003 history of what they term “shared leadership,” also pointed to
Follett’s belief that “rather than simply following the lead of the person with the formal authority
in a situation, one should follow the lead of the person with the most knowledge regarding the
situation at hand” (p. 6).
Other early theories on leadership point the way to what we now know as collaborative
leadership. Jones, in a 1992 book on collaborative leadership and human relations, cited
experiments in the 1920s at the Hawthorne Works of the Western Electric Company in Chicago
(p. 9; p. 17) and concluded from them that “collaboratively involving people equally in the
decision-making process, giving them control and autonomy, has been shown to be a key factor
in employee health, morale, and efficiency” (pp. 34-35). In addition, Smith’s 1937 dissertation
on socially creative leadership stated that “encouraging people to work out something specific
for the group, and also participating in the work of the group, is the safest and surest way for
dissolving conflict and striking an harmonious working balance between self-interest and groupinterest” (p. 64).
The use of “collaborative leadership” as a term in the mid-20th century was uncommon
and may have been influenced by the fact that “collaboration” could be a loaded term then,

51

existing often in the context of an act that lent aid to an enemy, or was treasonous (Kraus, 1980,
pp. 21-22). Biderman noted that “The word ‘collaboration’ acquired very definite evaluative
images during World War II due to its application by resistance fighters in Nazi-occupied France
to those who cast their lot with the Germans out of opportunism, ideological sympathy, or both”
(1964, p. 60). He went on to offer a further example of collaborative leadership being referred to
in negative terms, as a form of collaboration with the enemy: “Communist prisoner-of-war
exploitation in Korea, as everywhere, involved isolating the mass of prisoners from its formal
leaders … and punishing any overt, non-collaborative leadership that emerged subsequently”
(1964, p. 265). Nevertheless, there were uses of the term “collaborative leadership” as a positive
force by the 1950s in book-length studies such as Gordon’s Group-Centered Leadership (1955,
p. 322; p. 341), and the term was in evidence in the American popular and business press by the
early 1960s, appearing in a New York Times article about the World Conference on Jewish
Education (Cooperation urged in Jewish studies, 1962, p. 6) and in a Nation’s Business article on
management trends (Executive trends, 1964, p. 16).
Collaborative leadership appeared in the professional literature by the end of the 1960s in
a limited manner in the field of education: Michael (1968), citing Dunn and Stafford (1968),
proposed collaborative leadership as an alternative to “negotiations or collective bargaining”
between teachers and their school districts (p. 108), as did Dunn again in February 1969:
One alternative to negotiations or collective bargaining, as presently constituted, is
collaborative leadership, which may be defined as the process of intergroup interaction
and involvement whereby representatives of the educational hierarchy cooperatively
accept the responsibility for policy and program decisions thereby. (p. 19)

52

Stafford & Dunn (1969) went on to promote “collaborative leadership on a multi-school district
basis” through the creation of a “Center for Study in Educational Personnel Policies to serve
board members, teachers, administrators, and participating districts across the nation” (p. 296).
Karpel’s 1973 master’s thesis Patterns of Leadership and Facilitation in a Collaborative
Task-Oriented Group appears to be the first masters or doctoral work focused on collaborative
leadership itself. This work is not previously cited in the literature, perhaps because the
ProQuest Dissertations and Theses database is less complete in its coverage of master’s theses
than of doctoral dissertations, and does not list it (although it does list Karpel’s 1977 Ph. D.
dissertation on another topic). Karpel’s 1973 thesis is more easily discoverable now because it
was added in 2015 to ScholarWorks@UMass Amherst – an institutional repository – by the
University of Massachusetts Amherst Libraries, and is now discoverable via a Google search,
through the Digital Commons Network (the aggregation of all Digital Commons IRs), and in
OCLC’s WorldCat. Karpel discussed examples of collaborative leadership that he observed in a
group that was “small (ranging in size from 10 to 15 members), informal, volunteer, [and] taskoriented” (p. 4). His study centered on “the patterns of leadership that emerge in the group … in
the absence of formal hierarchical leadership” (p. 7). By placing collaborative leadership in a
framework of “the larger theoretical issue of leadership in all collaborative groups” (p. 7), Karpel
provided what may be the earliest attempt to locate collaborative leadership in the context of the
wider leadership literature. In his literature review he highlighted its relationship to situational
leadership (Hemphill, 1949), followership (Sanford, 1950; Bass, 1960; Petrullo & Bass, 1961),
the emphasis on the functions of leadership rather than the personal traits of the leader (Hinton &
Reitz, 1971; Bowers & Seashore, 1966), and Hersey and Blanchard’s 1969 “‘life cycle theory of
leadership,’ in which different leadership styles or functions are more or less effective depending

53

on the resources of followers and the stage of development of the group” (Karpel, 1973, pp. 1922). Of this literature review, Karpel observed the following:
all of these recent developments in leadership theory help clear the way for a
collaborative theory of leadership.… The collaborative theory of leadership presented
here was developed almost entirely from observation of the group being studied and is
therefore felt to be more appropriate to the study of non-hierarchical groups. It was only
afterwards that it was found in many ways to resemble some of the more recent trends in
leadership research. (p. 23)
He goes on to refer to collaborative leadership under a different name in his study – “The term
‘Facilitation’ will be used to refer to the functional equivalent in collaborative groups of
leadership in hierarchical groups” (p. 24) – and in examining the behaviors of the group
members he was studying he concludes that there are defining traits of facilitation:
x

Power sharing and participation: “leadership in collaborative groups ideally involves
some notion of shared responsibility and influence, accomplished through the
voluntary and maximal participation of each member” (p. 14); “the most important
lesson any individual or group must learn if they wish to employ a collaborative
approach is that their own willingness to share all responsibility and to participate as
fully as possible is the only base upon which real collaboration can succeed” (p. 177).

x

Developing people: “[leadership in collaborative groups] tries to be conscious of the
processes of the group in the pursuit of its goals, and is concerned with maximizing
the satisfaction, development and self-esteem of its members through their
participation in the group” (p. 14).

x

Creating clarity: Karpel thought the group he was studying failed to create clarity,

54

leading to a lack of progress: “the clear definition of the goals of the group would
constitute one major criterion of movement” (p. 94).
x

Working with others/relationship building: “success depends not just on the
performance of the initiator, but on the participation of every group member” (p. 96);
it must encompass “a two-way influence process, a reciprocal relationship” (p. 96).

x

Non-hierarchical leadership: “to succeed collaboratively, members must feel that it is
their own responsibility to get things done; they must be willing to take risks and
assume responsibility to a much higher degree than if they were in a hierarchical
group” (p. 178).

These leadership characteristics echo the more thoroughly developed collaborative leadership
traits described later in this chapter (Collaborative Leadership: Definitions section).
More often cited in the literature as an early study specifically centered on collaborative
leadership is Finch’s 1977 article “Collaborative Leadership in Work Settings,” in which he
proposed collaborative leadership as an alternative to “traditional authority-based leadership
[which] diminishes the full utilization of human resources in organizations, largely by
centralizing problem solving and decision making and control over work in the leader rather than
in the people doing the work” (p. 292). Finch cited considerable prior literature on
“collaborative group functioning” (p. 297) and on managerial resistance to it (p. 298), but no
prior scholarship on collaborative leadership itself in his fields of organization behavior, business
administration, and applied behavioral science.
The 1980s saw growing attention to collaboration in the workplace (Kraus, 1980;
Loughran, 1981), and Vivian (1983) found that her “study supports previous research that
concluded there was a relationship between job satisfaction and the collaborative style of

55

perceived leadership style” (p. 48). Devine (1983) examined Teacher Corps 6 and found that a
collaborative leadership style predominated between trainers and interns (p. 189). The first
dissertation to use collaborative leadership in its title appeared in 1988 (Wragg), with only one or
two more before 1994, after which there are multiple entries per year. By the early 1990s, Rost
concluded that
the trend … is quite clearly toward shared or collaborative leadership. As the
postindustrial paradigm becomes more and more accepted in mainstream thought and
practice, leadership will lose its Lone Ranger or Pied Piper of Hamlin [sic] image [and
that] such leadership relationships – those involving one leader and numerous followers –
become less and less possible and more and more improbable as we move to a
postindustrial era. (1991, pp. 111-112)
The first books to use collaborative leadership in their titles were published in the early 1990s,
including The Human Factor: Maximising Team Efficiency through Collaborative Leadership
(Jones, 1992) and Collaborative Leadership (Chrislip & Larson, 1994).
Collaborative leadership became more widely used as a name for a leadership theory
from this point in the mid-1990s onwards. Ulhøi and MXࡇller’s 2014 literature review concerning
shared leadership focused on journals from 1966-2008 that were represented in ISI’s Web of
Science, and checked against the EBSCO, JSTOR, and ELIN databases. This review showed
that from the middle 1960s to the early 1990s articles on shared leadership, under any of its
various names (including collaborative leadership), numbered less than ten a year (and some
years less than five), but saw a sharp rise in annual frequency after the early 1990s (p. 72).
These findings are borne out by other studies. Bolden, looking at literature on distributed

improve teaching in low-income areas.

56

leadership from 1980-2009 using Elsevier’s Scopus database, recorded similar findings when
searching for the terms “distributed leadership,” “shared leadership,” “collective leadership,”
“collaborative leadership,” and “emergent leadership” (2011, p. 255). He found fewer than five
articles a year were published until the early 1990s, with a sharp rise in annual frequency after
that.
A June 2016 search by the researcher of ProQuest’s Summon specifically for the term
“collaborative leadership” in journal articles of the scholarly and peer review type also showed
between zero and ten articles a year from 1968 to 1992, and then a rapid increase: 18 in 1994 up
to a peak of 224 in 2013. A search for “collaborative leadership” limited to books rather than
articles showed a similar pattern, as did a search limited to dissertations. Figure 2.2 shows
graphically the trends for articles, books, and dissertations and illustrates the point in the 1990s
at which references to collaborative leadership increase rapidly.

“collaborative leadership” from 1960-2014.
57

Ulhøi and MXࡇller noted in their review of the literature on shared leadership that “a
variety of concepts have been used interchangeably in the literature, which tends to cause
confusion rather than clarity” (2014, p. 72). They demonstrated this (see Table 2.1) with
references to representative studies from the 1960s to the 2000s (2014, p. 72). Bolden observed
about these related types of leadership that “while there are some common theoretical bases the
relative usage of these concepts varies over time, between countries and between sectors” (2011,
p. 251).

Collaborative Leadership: Breadth of Use
Collaborative leadership practice has been widely applied across business and
management, and has also been seen in studies of schools (Williams, 1979; Wragg, 1988; Clift,
Veal, Holland, Johnson, & McCarthy, 1995; Heck & Hallinger, 2010), higher education (Geiger,
1989; Keiser, Kincaid, & Servais, 2011), religion (Flemister, 1989; Krueger, 2011), healthcare
(Johnson, 1996; Nickitas, 2012; VanVactor, 2012), community development (Chrislip, 2002;
Rubin, 2009), law enforcement (Dewald, 2002), public affairs (O'Leary, Bingham, & Choi,
2010), financial services (Ullah, 2011), and national security (Shanahan, 2011). It has also been
promoted as a theory that responds well to the contemporary realities of globalization in business
(Wu & Lee, 2001), including business negotiation (Grover & Lynn, 2012). It has been seen as a
leadership style that is particularly relevant in an increasingly connected and networked world
(Tapscott & Williams, 2006; Middleton, 2007; Archer & Cameron, 2009b), and as a leadership
style that works well in complex situations (Sirman, 2008; Archer & Cameron, 2009a). The
rapid increase in literature on collaborative leadership from the early 1990s onwards lends
credence to its value for networked and globally distributed 21st century organizations and
businesses. Rost (1991) gave a short general definition of 21st century leadership that comes
close to a definition of collaborative leadership itself: 21st century leadership is “an influence
relationship among leaders and followers who intend real changes that reflect their mutual
purposes” (p. 102). Penney and Neilson’s 2010 study of emergent leaders showed that they
valued collaborative leadership in others, and seek to practice it themselves (p. 48).
Recent work on diversity leadership focused on gender and collaboration has posited that
“collaborative decision-making [is] often seen as the hallmark and the fundamental tenet of a
feminist leadership style … [affirming] feminist principles of inclusion, egalitarianism, and

59

sharing of power” (Rice, 2007, p. 127). Chin & Trimble, writing on diversity leadership in 2015,
claimed that “collaborative leadership … became more prominent as we saw more women in the
workforce” (p. 46), and that women “adopt a more collaborative, cooperative, or democratic
leadership style” (p. 125) than men do.
Collaborative Leadership: Definitions
There is no single definition of collaborative leadership to which the majority of the
literature subscribes, but rather a range of statements that define various traits that individuals
display when engaging in collaborative activities that go beyond “communication, cooperation,
and coordination” (Chrislip & Larson, 1994, p. 5). Collaborative leadership can be seen as a way
of working that fits well with the general transition from transactional to transformational
leadership theories in contemporary culture. Giesecke (2006) compared the two, stating that
in transactional leadership the leader motivates followers by appealing to the follower’s
self-interest and sets up a series of transactions or exchanges to accomplish goals.…
Leaders and followers in a transactional relationship are not seeking joint efforts or
collective interests, but rather bargain to advance individual interests. (p. 54)
She went on to contrast this with transformational leadership, in which “the leader and followers
are united in pursuit of common goals.… Transformational leadership is an active leadership
model, with both the followers and the leader engaged in the transformation process” (pp. 5455). Riggs, in an afterword to Libraries in the '90s: What the Leaders Expect, also stressed this
same point: “The type of leadership required in the `90s and beyond will not be that of a
transactional nature…. Thriving libraries in the `90s will demand transformative leadership”
(Riggs & Sabine, 1988, p. 191).

60

Definitions of collaborative leadership focus typically on power-sharing, group
dynamics, shared aspirations and vision, a commitment to work with others, relationship
building, boundary crossing, and on the replacement of the traditional, hierarchical role of
manager and leader.
Power sharing.
x

Stafford and Dunn (1969) declared collaborative leadership to be a “process of
intergroup interaction and involvement whereby representatives of the … hierarchy
cooperatively accept the responsibility for policy and program decisions, thereby
producing an integrated power equalization structure” (p. 296).

x

Kraus (1980) thought collaboration to be “a cooperative venture based on shared
power and authority. It is nonhierarchical in nature. It assumes power based on a
knowledge or expertise as opposed to power based on role” (p. 19).

x

Chrislip and Larson (1994) saw collaborative leadership “as a mutually beneficial
relationship between two or more parties who work towards common goals by
sharing responsibility, authority, and accountability for achieving results” (p. 5)”; it is
“focused primarily on the success of the collaborative endeavor. Differences in
power and authority among participants are almost ignored” (p. 125).

Group dynamics/empowering the individual.
x

Karpel (1973) stated that
leadership in collaborative groups ideally involves some notion of shared
responsibility and influence, accomplished through the voluntary and maximal
participation of each member. It is informal and flexible in its response to the
changing needs of the group. It tries to be conscious of the processes of the

61

group in the pursuit of its goals, and is concerned with maximizing the
satisfaction, development and self-esteem of its members through their
participation in the group. (p. 13)
x

Loughran (1981) stated that
the purpose of leadership in the collaborative small group is to empower the
total group and to empower each individual member. Collaborative
leadership increases the total power in the group and enables that power to be
widely shared.… Ideally each person is a leader in some way; she/he is
manager or supervisor or quality control expert or social-emotional leader or
visionary. (p. 140)
Leadership in collaborative groups is highly differentiated with the various
leadership functions carried out by different people; additionally,
collaborative leadership releases, facilitates, enables, empowers the skills,
talents, and interest in the group to be used effectively in working towards the
group's purpose. (p. 158)

x

Raelin (2006) concluded that “collaborative leadership requires true participation in
leadership and decision-making at all levels and in multiple decision processes” (p.
155), and that “collaboration begins any dialogue with a stance of nonjudgmental
inquiry … [i]t requires submitting one’s own ideas and views to the critical scrutiny
of others” (p. 155).

62

Non-hierarchical leadership.
x

Finch (1977) suggested that
collaborative leadership … is a situation in which the workgroup provides its own
leadership behaviors (task, relationships, and decision making) and functions
according to individual and group capacities and task requirements. The
traditional functions of the manager, such as planning, organizing, directing, and
control of work, is vested in the workgroup. (p. 297)

x

Raelin (2003) saw collaborative leadership as an integral part of what he terms
“leaderful” organizations, alongside concurrent, collective, and compassionate
leadership qualities (pp. 13-16), opposing these qualities to the serial, individual,
controlling, and dispassionate traits he identifies as characteristic of pre-21st century
conventional leadership (pp. 10-11).

Working with others/relationship building.
x

Wood and Gray (1991) defined collaboration as occurring “when a group of
autonomous stakeholders of a problem engage in an interactive process, using shared
rules, norms and structures, to act or decide on issues related to that domain” (p. 146).

x

Rubin (2009) thought collaborative leadership was “the skillful and mission-oriented
facilitation of relevant relationships” (p. 2) and that “collaborative leaders [build]
structures to support and sustain these productive relationships over time” (p. 3).

Boundary crossing.
x

Archer and Cameron (2009b): “At its most basic, collaborative leadership is about
delivering results across boundaries.… And as a leader, you need to be clear about

63

where the boundary lies and how to use the different capabilities on either side of it to
build a positive and efficient relationship” (pp. xv-xvi).
The definition of collaborative leadership used in Chapter One, from the Turning Point
Leadership Development National Excellence Collaborative, was as follows:
[Collaborative leadership] embraces a process in which people with different views and
perspectives come together, set aside narrow self-interests, and discuss issues openly and
supportively in an attempt to find ways of helping each other solve a larger problem or
achieve broader goals (Turning Point, 2004, What is collaborative leadership? Section,
para. 1).
Using this as the basis for a new definition, and augmenting it with reference to the many
definitions above, this study proposes the following definition of collaborative leadership:
Collaborative leadership is an interactive process in which people with different
perspectives come together, set aside self-interests, share power, work across
boundaries, and discuss issues openly and supportively. Collaborative leadership moves
us beyond mere cooperation towards a state of interdependence; it empowers all
members of a team to help each other to achieve broader goals, find personal satisfaction
in their work, and sustain productive relationships over time.
Collaborative Leadership: Characteristics
In addition to offering a definition, some leadership theorists have also enumerated in
detail the characteristics of collaborative leadership. Chrislip and Larson (1994) identified four
principles of collaborative leaders (pp. 138-140):

64

1. Inspire commitment and action: “Collaborative leaders … catalyze convene, energize,
and facilitate others to create visions and solve problems.”
2. Lead as peer problem solver: “Collaborative leaders help groups … solve problems.
They do not do the work of the group for the group.”
3. Build broad-based involvement: “Collaborative leaders … make a conscious and
disciplined effort to identify and bring together stakeholders who are necessary to
define problems, create solutions, and get results.”
4. Sustain hope and participation: “Collaborative leaders …convince participants that
each person’s input is valued. They help set incremental and obtainable goals and
encourage celebrations of achievement along the way.”
Mattessich and Monsey (1992) also elucidated the “factors that influence the success of
collaborations” (p. 11), breaking them out into six areas containing 19 factors (pp. 12-14):
1. Environment: history of collaboration; collaborative group seen as leader; favorable
political/social climate
2. Membership: mutual respect, understanding, and trust; members are representative of
community; members see collaboration as in their self-interest; ability to compromise
3. Process/structure: members share stake in process and outcome; multiple layers of
decision-making; flexibility; development of clear goals and policies; adaptability
4. Communications: open and frequent discussion; formal and informal channels of
communication
5. Purpose: clear and attainable goals; shared vision; unique purpose
6. Resources: sufficient funding for group; skilled convener

65

This study employed similar concepts to look for collaborative leadership traits in the planning
and building of institutional repositories, drawing from a curriculum in collaborative leadership
developed by the Turning Point Leadership Development National Excellence Collaborative,
located at the University of Washington’s School of Public Health & Community Medicine from
1997 to 2005. Turning Point developed and tested its definitions and curriculum over several
years and was sufficiently well regarded in the public health field that The Journal of Public
Health Management & Practice devoted an issue to its impact in January 2002.
The Turning Point Leadership Development National Excellence Collaborative included
“the development of National Excellence Collaboratives, groups of states, communities, and
national organizations, focused on improving the public health system” (Nicola, 2006, pp. 337338). Of the five Collaboratives, one was focused on collaborative leadership and created a
Collaborative Leadership curriculum to “improve the capacity of clinical governance teams to
work with diverse partners in improving systems” (Nicola, 2006, p. 343). As part of that
curriculum, Turning Point defined six practices of effective collaborative leaders (n.d., p. 3):
1. Assessing the environment for collaboration: understanding the context for change
before you act
2. Creating clarity – visioning and mobilizing: defining shared values and engaging
people in positive action
3. Building trust: creating safe places for developing shared purpose and action
4. Sharing power and influence: developing the synergy of people, organizations, and
communities to accomplish more
5. Developing people: committing to the development of people as your key asset
through mentoring and coaching

66

6. Self-reflection: personal continuous quality improvement; understanding your own
leadership, engaging others
These are the categories used in this study to identify the presence of collaborative leadership in
the planning and development of institutional repositories.
Collaborative Leadership in Libraries
The literature on collaborative leadership in academic libraries is sparse compared to that
in other disciplines. As recently as 2007, Butler noted that
collaborative leadership and collaborative management are topics that have been studied
in for-profit environments throughout the twentieth and into the twenty-first century.…
However, within higher education environments, limited research has explored the
measured existence of collaboration regarding staff or administrative employees apart
from their interactions with faculty. (p. 1)
In a chapter on leadership in libraries, Riggs and Sabine (1988) quoted interviewee Robert
Wedgeworth, then Dean of the School of Library Service at Columbia University and a previous
executive director of the American Library Association, who stressed that “the field is grounded
on elaborate cooperative and collaborative ventures” (p. 101) and that “leadership in our field
revolves around the ability to lead in collaborative arrangements” (p. 102). Early attention to
collaborative leadership in libraries also centered on the activities of library liaison, instruction,
and reference services. Raspa and Ward’s collection of essays The Collaborative Imperative
(2000) provided analyses and case studies of librarians and faculty members working
collaboratively. Crowe (2003) also thought that collaborative leadership should be central to
library reference services:

67

like their teaching faculty colleagues, reference librarians are often very independent and
creative thinkers. Collaborative leadership can take advantage of such minds and result
in better services and programs for users as well as increased job satisfaction for all
members of the unit. (p. 65)
Dewey (2003) saw collaborative leadership as an opportunity for emerging library
endeavors, predicting “a new era of leadership [that] demands a collaborative, creative, and
strategic approach for advancing higher education in the complex global twenty-first century” (p.
210). Frank (2004), observing changes in the research habits of faculty working in science and
technology disciplines, concluded that such collaborative working relationships were going to
become much more common across all library services:
Librarians are increasingly likely to be working with other librarians as well as faculty
who are more comfortable with ambiguity, integration, collaboration, deconstruction,
uncertainty, chaos, and fluid systems. These postmodern professionals are integrators
and synthesizers, focused on learning, and uncomfortable with control and rigid or
inflexible boundaries. (p. 411)
Gilchrist (2007) observed that “library instruction has formed the foundation of the majority of
faculty and librarian collaboration” (p. 37) noting that these activities “could be classified as
coordination or as collaboration depending on the extent of the planning, cooperation,
integration, and listening” (p. 37). Rowley (2011), in an argument for more collaborative
innovation in the creation of library services, concluded that
the success of any collaborative innovation is dependent not only on the membership of
the innovation network and the resources that members can bring to that network but also
on the leadership and management of innovation teams, an appreciation of the challenges

68

of collaborative knowledge creation, and the successful negotiation of organizational
barriers to innovation. (p. 223)
In 2009, a new peer-reviewed journal called Collaborative Librarianship launched as an
open access publication (http://digitalcommons.du.edu/collaborativelibrarianship/). The journal
is published from within the University of Denver’s institutional repository and, while it is not
fundamentally a leadership journal in scope, it does indicate a rising focus on the study of
collaborative working patterns in libraries. This journal has published on collaboration in open
source computer code, library consortia, scholarly communication, digitization projects, libraries
in developing countries, chat reference services, experiential learning, collection development,
and information literacy instruction, as well as on collaborative leadership.
Baird (2010) surveyed academic deans and library deans from land grant universities in
the United States and concluded that while both sets of deans “took administrative leadership
actions (defined as planning, prioritizing, budgetary control, and personnel management)” (p.
156), the library deans “were also engaged in actions that are enabling (working in collaborations
across organizational boundaries, building personnel capacity through team management, and
engaging stakeholders in the process)” (p. 156). The academic deans “noted the difference in
libraries and acknowledged the enabling leadership actions which librarians have taken within
their organizations” (p. 156). Most recently, Meier (2016) summarized a series of conversations
with 44 university librarians and deans from Association of American Universities (AAU)
institutions, and concluded that the “results indicate that collaborative decision-making is key to
academic library leadership” (p. 263), and that “collaborative leadership is the overwhelming
way decisions are made in large academic libraries” (2016, p. 283).

69

Finally, there is some literature on collaborative leadership in libraries at liberal arts
colleges. Carriveau, Viers, and Ziebell (2008) reported on the decision to replace the role of
library director at Ripon College Library in 2002 with “a library council, without a director” (p.
303), a situation that persists according to their website, where no director is listed. They
pointed to other small academic institutions, including St. Olaf College, Dickinson College,
Gustavus Adolphus College, and Bethel College, which have had similar collaborative
leadership arrangements in the recent past (p. 304). They noted that “collaborative leadership is
also an excellent way to prepare librarians for the changes ahead in our profession. By putting
more librarians into leadership roles, we are empowering ourselves to affect those changes that
will keep our profession relevant” (p. 307), and that “our collaborative leadership model brings
all the issues facing the library to the table, creating deliberate and participatory movement
towards the library and college’s goals” (p. 312).
Collaborative Leadership and Institutional Repositories
The literature also included a limited number of studies of collaborative leadership
displayed in the creation of institutional repositories. For example, in reporting on an early
repository implementation at Ohio State University, Rogers (2003) observed that “the library
director discussed the knowledge bank concept 7 with several representative faculty groups and
asked for their input” (p. 129), leading to the recommendation “that the University Libraries and
the Offices of the CIO jointly lead a campus-wide effort to develop the Knowledge Bank” (p.
130). Walters (2007) also saw deep collaboration between library departments as part of “the
organizational changes and internal partnerships necessary to strengthen IR programs” (p. 214).
Bruns, Knight-Davis, Corrigan, and Brantley (2014) offered an example of this in action:

7

The Knowledge Bank is Ohio State University's implementation of an institutional repository.

70

A culture of shared responsibility and working for the mutual benefit of the organization
is often an implicit assumption of library work.… The history of successful multi- and
cross-departmental projects at [Eastern Illinois University] demonstrates that this
supportive and collaborative culture can succeed, and it is in no small part due to this
organizational culture that [the Institutional Repository] owes its success. (p. 247)
Boundary-Spanning Leadership
Recent work on collaborative leadership at the Center for Creative Leadership (CCL) has
focused on the challenges of leading across organizational, cultural, and spatial boundaries, and
is relevant to the types of cross-campus collaborative work that are needed for a successful IR.
Ernst and Chrobot-Mason (2011) conducted a survey through CCL of 128 senior executives (p.
17) and identified five boundaries that need negotiating by collaborative leaders (pp. 21-31):
1. Vertical boundaries: leading across levels, rank, seniority, authority power
2. Horizontal boundaries: leading across functions, units, peers, expertise
3. Stakeholder boundaries: leading at the interchange of an organization and its external
partners, such as alliances, networks, value chains, customers, shareholders, advocacy
groups, governments, communities
4. Demographic boundaries: leading between diverse groups, including the full range of
human diversity from gender and race to education and ideology
5. Geographic boundaries: leading across distance, locations, cultures, regions, markets
All of these boundaries, with the possible exception of geographic boundaries, are present in the
creation and management of an institutional repository, and Ernst and Chrobot-Mason offer a
collaborative, boundary-spanning leadership model containing six practices that allow a leader to

71

“manage boundaries,” “forge common ground,” and “discover new frontiers” (2011, p. 220). IR
leaders and developers would be well advised to study these practices.
Most recently, the concept of boundary-spanning leadership has been brought to bear on
leadership in libraries, archives, and museums by the Educopia Institute, also working with the
Center for Creative Leadership, as part of research into leadership development in cultural
organizations. The project – Nexus LAB: Leading across Boundaries – examined leadership
development programs in libraries, archives, and museums, and “is exploring curriculum and
evaluation tool and resource development for leadership trainers working with libraries, archives
and museums” (Educopia Institute, 2017). The work suggests two dimensions of boundaries
across which a leader must operate: the boundaries between different types of cultural
institutions, and the boundaries between the stages of a leader’s career. The latter is expressed in
a chart, Layers of Leadership: Key Roles and Challenges, which articulates six stages of
leadership development across a career (Educopia Institute, 2016, p. 1):
1. Leading self
2. Leading others
3. Leading the department
4. Leading multiple departments
5. Leading the organization
6. Leading the profession
The language of collaboration, influencing, and stakeholder engagement runs throughout the
descriptions of these six stages. Moreover, the skills that they identified as developing across
these career stages evoke the collaborative leadership traits examined in this research: they
reference mentoring, influencing without authority, appreciating strengths in self and others,

72

active observation and learning, building effective teams, leading innovation, and the importance
of persuasive and influential communication (Educopia Institute, 2016, p. 9).
The Nexus LAB boundary-spanning leadership model is new, but the concept of
negotiating boundaries and connections between collaborating groups is not. In discussing what
he terms boundary maintenance, Finch (1977) observed “that as technologies and organizations
become more complex it becomes increasingly necessary to manage the interdependencies
between the parts of the system” (p. 298). Gardner (1990) saw the ability to “reach and
influence constituents beyond their jurisdiction, beyond boundaries” as an important
characteristic of a leader (p. 4) and believed that leaders should “be introduced soon to the
boundary-crossing experience” (p. 175). Linden’s 2002 book Working Across Boundaries
examined collaborative leadership in governmental and nonprofit organizations, Archer and
Cameron (2009b) concluded that “leaders need to be clear about where the boundary lies and
how to use the different capabilities on either side of it to build a positive and efficient
relationship” (p. 98), Walsh and Kahn (2010) have an entire chapter on “Crossing boundaries in
collaboration” within higher education (pp. 103-130), and Wepner and Hopkins (2011) have a
chapter on how collaborative leaders cross boundaries in schools (pp. 145-165). Skinner, Horth,
and Drummond (2017) underscored the value of boundary spanning leadership in terms that are
directly relevant to IR services: “leaders are engaged in a critical moment of redefinition in
which they must reshape their services, technical infrastructures, staffing models and
partnerships” (p. 4).

73

Conclusion
While institutional repositories are a 21st century phenomenon, with disciplinary
antecedents from the 1990s, their fundamental use case – the curation and sharing of scholarship
across a network – harkens back to the founding of the Internet in the 1970s and the 1989
creation of the World Wide Web. IRs have grown steadily in number and size since the earliest
examples in 2002, and have spread from their genesis in US research libraries to research
institutions across the globe. In North America, at least, they have also spread to baccalaureate
and masters colleges that are more focused on undergraduate teaching than on fundamental
research. The IRs in Oberlin Group liberal arts colleges have many similarities with those at
ARL research institutions, even though they have developed more recently and have a different
content profile (containing student work and pedagogical materials more often than is found at
research universities): Oberlin Group IRs are library run, library promoted, campus services with
many of the same ambitions and challenges as their ARL counterparts.
An early expansiveness of definition suggested that IRs would routinely contain almost
all output from an institution: scholarship certainly, but also learning objects, corporate assets,
creative works, and more. This has not happened generally, and scholarly publications including
journal articles, theses, dissertations, and books predominate. IR development, at least as
measured by the rate at which faculty deposit content into them, has been uneven and the
literature has identified a variety of reasons for this situation, including confusion about the
nature and purpose of the IR, insufficient marketing, fears about the loss of intellectual property
rights, and the lack of institutional rewards for engaging in this activity.
IRs clearly appeal to an institution’s desire to highlight its research output, although there
is little indication that institutions have found a way to reward faculty members for sharing their

74

intellectual property openly. IRs also appeal to the library’s mission to preserve scholarship and
make it accessible to all. It is less clear, however, that they respond to a deeply felt need on the
part of the faculty and others who create the content they contain, which complicates their
marketing. This situation may be changing: IRs continue to grow in size and number, and the
recent popularity of academic social networks such as Academia.edu and ResearchGate suggest
that faculty can be motivated to share their scholarship with a global audience. In addition, some
faculty have readily embraced publicly accessible disciplinary repositories, although this does
not translate simply into a willingness to self-archive their content in their institution’s
repository. Increasingly, librarians are taking on the task of harvesting content to load into the
IR, given that reliance on faculty self-deposit has not been broadly successful as a strategy
through which to populate IRs.
Libraries continue to play a major – often the major – leadership role on campus in the
planning, implementation, and promotion of the IR. All the institutions in this study had IRs that
were operated by their libraries. The library is well placed to take on IR leadership: it often has
technology and intellectual property expertise, a strong reputation for service, and good, trusted
relationships with faculty. Libraries work across campus boundaries routinely, and operate in
partnerships where power sharing and collaboration are essential to success. They are wellsuited to the forms of collaborative and boundary-spanning leadership that would seem to be
necessary for IRs to thrive. Chrislip and Larson’s four principles of collaborative leaders –
inspire commitment and action, lead as a peer problem solver, build broad-based involvement,
and sustain hope and participation (1994, pp. 138-140) – are increasingly familiar topics in
contemporary discussions of library leadership, and are all leadership behaviors that would
contribute to IR planning and development.

Chapter Three
PROCEDURES

Introduction
The following procedures were chosen to provide the combination of qualitative and
quantitative data necessary to address the research questions presented in Chapter One. A close
examination and content analysis of IR websites, combined with a pair of questionnaires directed
to library directors and IR developers, satisfied the data-gathering aims of this study. These data
informed an understanding of the characteristics of institutional repository services within
Association of Research Libraries universities and Oberlin Group liberal arts colleges. They also
uncovered collaborative leadership traits demonstrated in institutional repository planning and
implementation. This research was exploratory in nature.
The sources for the content analysis were IR websites from the colleges and universities
in the study population. The websites that were captured as documents for examination in this
study were those that described the purpose and benefits of the IR, gave access to functions such
as search and browse, and outlined policies of use. The researcher did not capture separate help
pages that described how to use the site’s search functions, or pages outlining general university
or college policies on copyright, privacy, and intellectual property issues, even if they were
accessible from a link on the repository site.
This study involved the close examination of these IR web documents, which may
include definitions of the services, their value, and the collaborative partnerships and campus
leadership involved in their operation. Content analysis software was employed to find words
and phrases that might indicate the presence, frequency, and distribution of collaborative

98

leadership traits. Similar content analyses of academic library web sites include Gardner,
Juricek, and Xu (2008), Qutab and Mahmood (2009), Kannappanavar, Jayaprakash, and
Bachalapur (2011), and Aharony (2012).
Following an Institutional Review Board (IRB) review and approval from Simmons
College, an informed consent information sheet, a letter, and questionnaire were sent to the IR
developer/manager at each institution in the study population (see Appendices A, C, and E), and
the information sheet, a letter, and a shorter version of the questionnaire was sent to the library
director at each institution (see Appendices A, B, and D). The questionnaires inquired about six
characteristics of collaborative leadership:
1. Assessing the environment for collaboration
2. Creating clarity: visioning and mobilizing
3. Building trust and creating safety
4. Sharing power and influence
5. Developing people: mentoring and coaching
6. Self-reflection
The IRB review included the completion of the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative
(CITI) education program intended for students conducting research of no more than minimal
risk in social/behavioral fields. The curriculum of this online training program included an
introduction to research concepts, and modules that educated students in research, informed
consent in social/behavioral research, and the use of the internet in social/behavioral research.
After each module, the researcher completed an online quiz, and a passing grade was required
before moving on to the next part of the curriculum.

Research Design
Study Populations
The study populations for this research were derived from the membership of two
consortia of North American academic libraries, one made up of research universities and one of
liberal arts colleges. These two groups were mutually exclusive in their membership. The
researcher defined a process to identify which members of these organizations had operational
institutional repositories, and were therefore candidates for inclusion in the study.
Association of Research Libraries (ARL). ARL had 124 total members in the United
States and Canada in 2014 (http://www.arl.org/membership/list-of-arl-members/): sample
members included Auburn, Columbia, Duke, Florida State, Harvard, Johns Hopkins, the Library
of Congress, McGill, South Carolina, Tulane, and Yale. Ten members were national institutions
or public libraries rather than research university libraries and were excluded from the study:
1. Boston Public Library
2. Center for Research Libraries
3. Library of Congress
4. National Agricultural Library
5. National Archives and Records Administration
6. National Library of Medicine
7. National Research Council, Canada
8. New York Public Library
9. New York State Library
10. Smithsonian Libraries

100

The study population is the one hundred members of ARL that were university libraries and had
IRs in operation by July 2014. The geographic distribution of these universities can be seen in
Figure 3.1; they were predominantly in the eastern United States (the twenty-six states east of the
Mississippi river).

Figure 3.1. ARL: Geographic distribution.
The size of institutional enrollment ranged from relatively small (Dartmouth College, with about
6,500 students) to very large (Pennsylvania State University, with about 98,000 students). 1 The
mean size for ARL institutions was 32,323 students.
ARL provided an appropriate study population for collaborative leadership in
institutional repositories because it is a leadership organization whose mission is to “[influence]
the changing environment of scholarly communication and the public policies that affect
research libraries and the diverse communities they serve” (About the Association of Research
1

Schools web site.

101

Libraries, 2016, Mission Statement section). ARL has a long history of support for open access
publishing, and the promotion and coordination of digital library infrastructures. In 1990 ARL
founded the Coalition for Networked Information (CNI) in partnership with EDUCOM and
CAUSE (now EDUCAUSE), and in 1998 ARL established the Scholarly Publishing and
Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC). Both SPARC and CNI were early proponents of IRs,
producing foundational studies on the subject (Crow, 2002; Johnson, 2002; Lynch, 2003).
Furthermore, ARL has established open scholarship as an area of strategic focus, and their
proposed activities share many of the goals of an IR:
In order to promote wide-reaching and sustainable publication of research and
scholarship, ARL libraries will mobilize efforts to achieve collaborative infrastructure
and financial models for publishing. These efforts will ensure that the publications
produced retain and enhance rigor and quality, embed a culture of rights sympathetic to
the scholarly enterprise, and use financial models that are sustainable. These publishing
efforts will focus on the widespread and critical dissemination of scholarship as a
permanent record of research institutions. (Association of Research Libraries, 2014, p.
22)
Many ARL libraries were early adopters of institutional repositories. In a 2006 survey of ARL
members regarding IR activity, 87 institutions responded (71%), with 37 members reporting that
they had implemented an IR (43%), 31 reporting that they were planning one (35%), and only 19
reporting they had no plans for IR involvement (22%) (Bailey et al., 2006, p. 13).
The Oberlin Group. This organization is a consortium of liberal arts college libraries in
the United States. It had 80 member organizations in 2014, mostly individual liberal arts
colleges but also including the Claremont Colleges, a five-college consortium with a shared

102

library system (http://www.oberlingroup.org/group-members). Sample members included
Amherst, Bates, Colby, Davidson, Haverford, Middlebury, Oberlin, Simmons, and Wellesley
Colleges. The study population is the 46 members of the Oberlin Group that had operational IRs
by July 2014. The geographic distribution of these colleges can be seen in Figure 3.2, and they
are concentrated in the eastern United States (the 26 states east of the Mississippi river).

Figure 3.2. Oberlin Group: Geographic distribution.
The size of institutional enrollment ranged from 804 students (Harvey Mudd College, part of the
Claremont Colleges) to 3,640 students (St. John's University/College of St. Benedict). Five
Oberlin Group members had fewer than 1,000 students; only seven had an enrollment of more
than 3,000. 2 The mean size for Oberlin Group institutions was 2,153 students.
Few Oberlin Group libraries were early adopters of institutional repositories; a 2005
survey of CNI members received 35 responses from a population of 81 liberal arts institutions,
but only two of those (6% of respondents) reported operational institutional repositories (Lynch
& Lippincott, 2005, Extent of Implementation of Repositories section, para. 1). Since then, IRs

Schools web site.

103

have developed steadily within the Oberlin Group, with 57.5% of the membership having an IR
by July 2014. This growth in IRs in the Oberlin Group has continued since then, with several IR
services appearing in the period from August 2014-July 2017, including Williams College,
Augustana College, and Skidmore College. These recent IRs are out of scope for this research.
The Oberlin Group provided an appropriate study population for collaborative leadership
in new digital library services because it is a leadership organization whose mission “focuses on
library and scholarly publishing issues and related services that support our liberal arts missions.
Cooperative interlibrary lending agreements, consortia contracts with vendors, and support for
open access initiatives are all areas of recent activities” (About the Oberlin Group, 2016).
Candidate Selection
To determine which ARL and Oberlin Group institutions had IRs by July 2014 the
researcher referred to directories of online repositories and to individual library websites. The
institutions that were in scope were those that had an institution-wide repository for research
materials, which was maintained by that college or university. This included consortia that ran a
repository platform for their members. Out of scope were services that called themselves
repositories, digital archives, or some similar phrase, but only contained digitized library
collections, or dissertations and theses, 3 or were departmental archives, disciplinary repositories,
or collections of campus administrative records. The selection process can be summarized as
follows, with the results recorded in Table 3.1 and Table 3.2:

3

The researcher excluded sites that only contained electronic theses and dissertations even if they called themselves
a repository, a decision that has found some support in a 2017 Coalition for Networked Information report: “It is
clearly possible to reflect a nearly comprehensive and complete record of the theses and dissertations produced by a
university (ETDs) in an IR. ... But, by itself, it doesn’t seem to be an adequate justification for establishing an IR
service” (Institutional Perspectives section, para. 24).

For the ARL institutions, 93 of the 100 IRs were registered in OpenDOAR (93%) and so no
further discovery was necessary for these institutions. For the remaining seven, none were in
ROAR, and a Google search was needed to locate them. For the Oberlin Group institutions, 18
of the 46 IRs were registered in OpenDOAR (39.1%), 19 were in ROAR (41.3%), and a Google
search was needed to locate the remaining nine (19.6%).
Methodology
Content Analysis
In a book-length explication of content analysis, Krippendorff (2004) outlined the
characteristics and strengths of this methodology. Content analysis is “an empirically grounded
method, exploratory in process, and predictive or inferential in intent” (p. xvii); it can analyze
large amounts of unstructured data (pp. 41-42); it “entails a systematic reading of a body of texts,
images, or symbolic matter” (p. 3); and it is “a research technique for making replicable and

109

valid inferences from texts” (p. 18). As a research methodology one of its strengths is that it is
“nonreactive or unobtrusive,” with no ability “to interfere with the phenomena being assessed”
(p. 40), as can be the case with interviews, focus groups, and surveys.
Content analysis is known by various terms, including:
x

qualitative text analysis

x

qualitative content analysis

x

conceptual content analysis

x

qualitative data analysis

The latter term has given its name to a class of software that aids in the analysis of text and other
media: Computer-Assisted Qualitative Data Analysis Software (CAQDAS). Kelle (1995)
pointed out that computer programs had been aiding qualitative social scientists since the early
1980s, although computer programs to count and classify written texts have existed since the
1960s and “began a train of development in history, linguistics and literary studies that led to the
emergence of a whole scientific community concerned with computing in the humanities” (p. 2).
The researcher undertook computer-assisted qualitative data analysis using ATLAS.ti, a
software package that “facilitates the processes of segmenting, categorizing, annotating,
retrieving, and searching within and across documents and categories” (Analysis software, 2016,
What is Analysis Software for Qualitative Research? section, para. 2). This tool was of
considerable help in tracking occurrences of the terms and concepts under examination and in
summarizing the results. To find the relevant texts, the researcher visited the institutional
repositories for each of the 146 institutions in the study populations, and downloaded the web
pages introducing, defining, and promoting the IR. Copies were then saved to PDF format for

110

analysis, and printed out for ease of reading, with all the documents for an institution combined
into a single PDF file.
When saving to PDF, a process technically akin to the act of printing the web page onto
paper, some graphical material may have been lost and/or the layout of the page altered, as is
typically the case with “print friendly” website printing processes. The textual content was
preserved however, and this study makes no analytical use of the images on the page. Visual
inspection of the original web site and the print equivalent guarded against the unlikely event of
an item of textual interest being rendered in graphical form and therefore being lost to the
analysis: a block quotation displayed as an image of text, for example. The print and electronic
versions of these documents served different purposes. A comparison of features was often
speedier with the files in paper format, and the analysis of terminology contained in them was
more efficient with the digital files in a content analysis program.
The 146 documents were studied to record the size, length of operation, nomenclature,
and technology platform of the IRs, and to see if IR implementation revealed evidence of
collaborative leadership traits. This was achieved in part by looking for terminology derived
from a curriculum developed by the University of Washington’s Turning Point Leadership
Development National Excellence Collaborative between 1997 and 2005 (see Table 3.3),
especially the facilitators’ and participants’ guides (Turning Point, n.d.-a). Words were searched
for as the beginning of a string, not an absolute match, so searching for trust would find trust but
also trusted; searching for vision would also find visionary. For some terms, a truncated search
was performed on the root of the word, for example collaborat*, which ensured retrieval of
collaborate, collaborates, collaborating, collaboration, collaborations, collaborative,
collaboratively, and collaborators.

Then the researcher read the corpus closely to find additional occurrences that were not
identified during keyword searching. These two steps found all passages that held references to
collaborative leadership traits in the delivery of IR services.
The size of the repository was taken from the OpenDOAR record when possible, and
derived from the site itself when not. The age of the repository was often not easily determinable
from the website, as the About pages almost never conveyed this information. The most
consistent source for the founding year of the repository that the researcher could find other than
OpenDOAR was the Internet Archive (https://archive.org/). The Internet Archive harvests
content from university sites, and by submitting the site’s URL to the Internet Archive’s
Wayback Machine service, the Internet Archive’s first date of harvesting was determinable. To
guard against a site whose current URL has changed since the service was launched, the
researcher examined the earliest instance of the current URL in the Internet Archive to look for
any evidence that it was a re-launch of a service that had existed earlier. For example,
Vanderbilt University’s DiscoverArchive, launched in 2008, was previously the VU e-Archive,
launched in 2004, and the earliest instance of 2008’s DiscoverArchive in the Internet Archive
signals this fact: “Looking for the VU e-Archive? You are in the right place! The VU e-Archive
has taken a new name: DiscoverArchive” (Vanderbilt University, 2008).
The earliest instance of an IR’s web address in the Internet Archive would not be the
exact day the service was launched in all likelihood, but it should be relatively close. For
example, a press release on 11 April 2002 announced the 3 April 2002 launch of the
eScholarship repository that serves the University of California system (California Digital
Library, 2002), and the earliest date for this web service in the Internet Archive is 1 June 2002,
nearly two months later. Conversely, the Internet Archive was registering the URL for

113

Harvard’s DASH repository in February 2009, seven months before the official public launch in
September 2009 (Harvard University Library, 2009). As a 2017 Coalition for Networked
Information report, Rethinking Institutional Repository Strategies, noted, “there is still little
agreement about how to count, measure and compare or benchmark the contents, use, and roles
of repositories and digital collections” (Institutional Perspectives section, para. 7). This research
underscored the accuracy of that observation.
Having finished the close examination of the documents, the researcher “summarize[d]
the inferences from [the] text so that they are easily understood,” and “compare[d] the findings
with data obtained by other means” (Krippendorff, 2004, p. 191). In this research, the other data
source was a survey conducted through a pair of questionnaires.
Questionnaires
A detailed sense of collaborative leadership in institutional repository development and
implementation needed more data than a content analysis of web documents alone could provide.
Some collaborative leadership qualities such as self-reflection or mentoring are less likely to be
routinely expressed in web sites promoting a new scholarly publishing service. A survey, by
means of questionnaires, is “a particularly suitable tool for gaining quantitative data” (Walliman,
2011, p. 97); it is a “very flexible tool, that has the advantages of having a structured format, is
easy and convenient for respondents, and is cheap and quick to administer” (Walliman, 2011, p.
97). In this research, one questionnaire was designed for library leaders at the libraries from
which documents had been obtained, and a longer one was designed for IR developers at the
same institutions. The questionnaire to developers was a 6-section, 23-question instrument (see
Appendix E); the one to library directors was a subset of the first, with the same 6 sections but
only 14 questions (see Appendix D). Participants were permitted to skip questions if they felt

114

they could not answer them, or to answer “No Opinion.” Answers of “No Opinion” were
included in the response rate for a given question.
The questionnaires asked for information about the degree to which collaborative
leadership traits were present in the planning and implementation of an institutional repository.
These questionnaires were closely adapted from the collaborative leadership self-assessment
questionnaires (see Appendix F) created in the mid-2000s by the Turning Point organization
(Turning Point, n.d.-b). Respondents were presented with closed-format questions and
depending on the question either indicated where their opinions fell on an interval scale from 1
(never) to 5 (always), with the option to declare “No Opinion,” or answered yes or no to
questions about their perception of stakeholder involvement and IR success. Means were
calculated for those questions scored on a Likert scale to analyze their responses, and a t-test was
employed to compare means, to uncover any statistically significant differences within a
commonly accepted margin of error.
The library director and IR developer from each institution were selected to receive the
survey, according to his or her leadership role in the deployment of their institutional repository
and further by his or her availability during the survey period (fall 2014). The participants were
discovered by reference to the individual library web sites, which typically listed the library
director and the repository manager or other IR contact personnel. Individualized letters from
the researcher were sent via email (see Appendices B and C), soliciting their participation in the
online surveys, and follow-up emails were sent after an interval of several weeks. A PDF of the
survey was included with the emails and the participants could choose to print it out and return it
as a paper document.

115

Data Quality
A short multi-coder pre-test was employed to aid in the identification of core concepts in
the planning documents. A colleague with content analysis experience was provided with
several documents and followed the same instructions as the researcher, indicating the presence
of collaborative leadership traits. Inter-coder disagreement was examined and used to adjust the
procedure. The questionnaire was also subjected to a pre-test. An academic librarian who did
not otherwise participate in the study completed the survey, reviewed it for clarity of instruction
and terminology, and verified the estimate of the time it took to complete.
Threats to reliability and validity
There is a degree of subjectivity in the identification of terms denoting collaborative
leadership traits during the content analysis process, even after employing a pre-test, as the
presence of a term in a passage does not guarantee the existence of the collaborative leadership
trait being sought. The researcher needed to read the passage and make a judgment about the
presence or absence of that trait.
Threats also include a low number of survey responses due to the overuse of this
methodology and the consequent respondent fatigue: “response rates from surveys – whether
postal, telephonic or electronic – are rarely higher than 20 per cent” (Adams, Kahn, & Raeside,
2014, p. 96). A lower response would lead to non-generalizable results, which only pertain to
the institutions they describe. Finally, the lack of a random sample limited the statistical tests
that can be run on the data. There exists, therefore, a possibility of a false positive (a Type 1
error) due to the t-test employed (which ANOVA analysis would guard against if the sample was
random).

116

Study Limitations
The findings are limited geographically, with only a selection of North American
institutions being considered. The Directory of Open Access Repositories shows that North
American institutions only account for 16.5% of repositories who register with this international
directory (July 2017). Abrizah, Hilmi, and Kassim (2015) cited studies of IRs in developing
countries (p. 732), for example, and these have not been accounted for here. The findings are
limited temporally, with both the survey and the gathering of web documents occurring in 2014,
and with no re-harvesting of web sites, or any follow-up survey, or in-person interviews with
participants to see if the passage of time affects the opinions or statements in web documents.
Regarding the survey, the questions were asked only of library directors and IR
developers, and the researcher did not survey representatives from other stakeholder groups such
as information technology leaders, for example, or scholars, which could have given other views
of the collaborative leadership traits.
Conclusion
The analysis of, and data gathering for, some aspects of institutional repositories was
straightforward: service names were unambiguous, for example, and for many sites, their size
and technology platform was clear from the IR home page. The founding year of a service was
more difficult to obtain, however, as it was rarely stated in the text, although one ARL institution
noted that it “was registered with the Registry of Open Access Repositories (ROAR) in
September 2004” to make the point that this was a well-established service. Establishing the
founding year required considerable research, consulting OpenDOAR records or the Internet
Archive’s Wayback Machine to find earliest dates for the service.

117

Uncovering textual references that indicate the presence of collaborative leadership traits,
as listed in Table 3.3, was much more time-consuming and prone to some subjectivity. Even
with a content analysis tool, this stage required multiple passes through the corpus, the creation
of a “long list” of candidate passages, and their careful evaluation.
The questionnaire was a good methodology to solicit from a wider range of individuals
than could be achieved through an interview process their opinions on the presence of
collaborative leadership traits in IR planning and implementation. The survey also provided
some sense of how successful the participants thought their IR had been in attracting faculty
content, promoting open access, enhancing the institution’s reputation, and strengthening
collaborative relationships between the library and other parts of the organization.
The twin methodologies of a detailed analysis of a body of text with a pair of
questionnaires for library directors and IR developers were successful in generating a set of
findings for analysis and discussion.

FINDINGS

Introduction
These findings are based on both qualitative and quantitative data, combining an
examination and content analysis of IR web sites with a survey, using a pair of questionnaires, of
library directors and IR developers. Reading the web documents revealed the scope, names,
technology platforms, size, and length of service of IRs in the study population. The content
analysis revealed the terminology of the IR web sites, and allowed scrutiny of the public
statements that ARL and Oberlin Group institutions make about their repositories and the
partnerships that sustain them, in order to uncover collaborative leadership traits. The
questionnaires solicited a range of opinions about collaborative leadership in the planning and
building of IRs, and was also sufficient to identify the opinions of those surveyed concerning the
success of the IR and the collaborative partnerships and stakeholders that surround it. This
chapter contains the findings of the content analysis and the survey; Chapter Five: Discussion,
expands on these findings.
Content Examination
Web Pages for IR Services: Scope and Form
The 146 institutions in the study population produced 191 web documents from the 100
Association of Research Libraries institutions, and 90 web documents from the 46 Oberlin Group
institutions. These 281 documents provided a corpus of 129,664 words (9,423 unique words)
and yielded 560 pages of analyzable text when the web pages were converted to PDF documents:

122

422 pages (103,975 words) for the 100 ARL sites and 138 pages (25,689 words) for the 46
Oberlin Group sites.
Looking closely at the layout and content of these 146 IR web documents revealed that
they were highly formulaic textual structures, with much commonality of features from site to
site (see Table 4.1). All IR services examined had a home page, and 89.9% (89.6% Oberlin
Group and 90% ARL) had a separate document or a separate section of the home page with
additional information that included background on open access, value statements, and
sometimes policies for use, scope and content notes, and submission instructions. The following
elements were commonly found in ARL and Oberlin Group IRs:

For example, “[The IR] is a digital service that collects, preserves, and distributes digital
material.”
b
For example, “Repositories are important tools for preserving an organization's legacy;
they facilitate digital preservation and scholarly communication.”

Oberlin Group sites were more likely to have sample content and usage statistics highlighted on
the IR home page; ARL institutions were more likely to have contact information specific to the
IR service (not counting a general Library Help link) given on the IR web pages.

Table 4.2 shows that these documents ranged in length from less than 500 words to more
than 4,500 words, with the majority of sites being less than 1,000 words (72.6%): 66% for ARL
sites and 87% for Oberlin Group ones. For ARL sites, the most common size was between 5001,000 words, at 39 sites (39%); for the Oberlin Group, the most common size was less than 500
words, at 27 sites (58.7%).

The average document length was 888.1 words, with ARL IR sites at 1,039.7 words mean, and
Oberlin Group IR sites at 558.5 words mean.
Only 14.4% of sites had content of 1,500 words or more (19% ARL and 4.3% Oberlin
Group). An examination of these outlier sites revealed several reasons for their greater length,
including more detailed descriptions of the IR’s value, purpose, and intent, and better
promotional elements. Specific elements included:

124

x

Blogs or news sections that promote open access, or have detailed accounts of the
site’s purpose, organization, contents, background, and mission

x

Highlighting of popular content (measured by download statistics)

x

Highlighting of new additions

x

Detailed terms of use and submission criteria

x

Featured contributor communities, collections, and user profiles

x

Information about consortial members who jointly operate the IR service

x

Testimonials from users who are external to the institution, such as a journalist or
community college teacher

Terminology Used in IR Service Names
The names of IRs can be an important indicator of their purpose and ambitions, and are
typically the result of considerable discussion and thought, so they were worth examining for
indications of collaborative intent. An example of a service name would be DASH (Digital
Access to Scholarship at Harvard). Only one of the 146 sites specifically referred to
collaboration in the name of the service – SURFACE (Syracuse University Research Facility and
Collaborative Environment) – although many others evoked collaborative activities and places,
using terms such as “commons,” “community,” “space,” “exchange,” “sphere,” and “shares.”
Four terms – Commons, Repository, Space, and Archive – were used in service names in
more than half of the IR sites overall to describe the type of online community the IR aspired to
be. Table 4.3 summarizes this usage in descending order of frequency of use.

“Commons” was most heavily used of these four terms overall (Table 4.4), and occurred in
Oberlin Group institutions at a rate two and a half times that of ARL institutions.

As seen in Table 4.5, almost as many sites used “Repository” as “Commons” in their service
names (25 overall, or 17.1%) with the term being more heavily favored by ARL sites (19%) than
Oberlin Group ones (13%).

Nearly half of the institutions (48.6%) eschewed the terms Commons, Repository, Space,

their repository (Table 4.8). 1

The term “scholarship” was used often in these brand names, as was “research.” Not surprisingly
for an institutional effort, the name of the college or university is commonplace – Iowa Research

130

Online, or Haverford Scholarship, are good examples – or some other institutional reference such
as a nickname: University of New Mexico’s LoboVault, for example, or Occidental College’s
OxyScholar. In eight cases, the name was an acronym, such as Trace (Tennessee Research and
Creative Exchange) or SCARAB (Scholarly Communication and Research at Bates).
Web Pages for IR Services: Technology Platform
DSpace, an open source architecture developed by MIT and Hewlett Packard, was the
most popular choice overall as a technology platform on which to operate an institutional
repository (41.8%). However, the popularity of DSpace was much greater with ARL
institutions, where 52% used it, than with Oberlin Group institutions, where only 19.6% did.
Instead, Oberlin Group institutions heavily favored the commercial product Digital Commons,
from bepress (65.2%), while only 19% of ARL repositories used Digital Commons to deliver
their IR services. In the ARL and Oberlin Group communities combined, DSpace and Digital
Commons together accounted for 75.4% of the total IR infrastructure, echoing the findings of
Lynch and Lippincott more than a decade ago:
Of the 38 respondents to the question requesting information on the software the
institution was using for its repository, 22 (58%) indicated that they were using DSpace.
The next highest number was for [Digital Commons], with 8 institutions (21%). Other
software mentioned, used by less than five respondents each, included CONTENTdm, the
Virginia Tech-developed ETD software DigiTool, and locally developed systems.
(Repository Software Platforms section, 2005)

Web Pages for IR Services: Length of Operation
ARL universities were among the earliest institutions to announce and launch IRs, as
Figure 4.1 demonstrates. In 2002, ARL institutions already had seven operational IRs (some of
the earliest institutional repositories to be in service anywhere). ARL had fifteen by the end of
2004, at which point the Oberlin Group had one example, and only two by the end of 2005. The
real growth in Oberlin Group IRs came between 2010 and 2014; by contrast, eight or more IR
services opened every year in ARL institutions from 2005 to 2012. From 2012 to 2014 Oberlin
Group libraries opened more IRs per year than ARL institutions, as by this time most ARL
institutions already had one in operation.

132

Figure 4.1. IRs founded per year, 2002-2014

Web Pages for IR Services: Size of Holdings
The mean across ARL repositories for holdings was 19,111.94 items, with the median
being 12,820 items. ARL sites with less than 1,000 objects (4%) and more than 50,000 objects
(7%) were the outliers (see Figure 4.2). The mean across Oberlin Group repositories for
holdings was 2,212.3 items, with the median being 1,295.5 items. Oberlin Group sites with less
than 100 objects (11%) and more than 5,000 objects (13%) were the outliers (see Figure 4.3).

As Figure 4.4 makes clear, the relative size differential between ARL and Oberlin Group
institutions – about an order of magnitude – was reflected in the size of their institutional
repositories, as is evident from their averages. The median for ARL repositories was 12,820
items, and for Oberlin Group institutions it was 1,295.5; as previously stated, the mean across
ARL repositories was 19,111.94 items, and for Oberlin Group institutions it was 2,212.3.

Content Analysis
At its simplest, content analysis can count words in a corpus, and performing such a word
frequency analysis on these IR documents underscored that they were describing curated online
collections of research materials. The 100 words used most frequently (see Table 4.10) represent
1.1% of the 9,423 unique words in these documents, and range from research (975), university
(909), repository (738) and digital (703) at the top of the list to researchers (115), time (115),
archives (115), and journals (109) at the bottom. This list, generated by ATLAS.ti, was edited to
exclude stop words (such as and, or, but), technical terms (http, www), institutional names, and
platform names (Digital Commons, DSpace, and so on).

There was considerable similarity between the terminology used in ARL and in Oberlin
Group IR web documents, as about 70% of the 100 most frequently used words were shared
between the ARL and Oberlin Group top 100 lists. Few of these words, except for communities,
commons, and perhaps service, pointed towards collaborative endeavors, although the
stakeholder communities – author, faculty, student – were present.
Unique terms in the ARL top 100 list included articles (Oberlin Group top 200 list), data
(Oberlin Group top 300 list), preservation (Oberlin Group top 300 list), policies (Oberlin Group
top 400 list), sciences (Oberlin Group top 400 list), researchers (Oberlin Group top 500 list), and
school (Oberlin Group top 1,100 list). Unique words in the Oberlin Group top 100 list included
web (ARL Top 200 list), academic (ARL Top 200 list), format (ARL Top 200 list), history (ARL
top 500 list), and network (ARL top 500 list).
Evidence of Collaboration and Leadership
No web document in these study populations used collaborative leadership as a term
specifically, although language showing collaborative actions was found when searching for
collaborative, collaborate, collaboration, interact, partnership, conjunction, cooperate, manage,
exchange, and service. The rich set of collaborative engagements present in these web
documents included those between the library and different organizational entities or
stakeholders in an institution, between libraries within a consortium, and between scholars.
There was a clear sense that the IR was an infrastructure that could be shared collaboratively
across institutions in a consortial arrangement, and it was seen as presenting opportunities to
promote partnerships between the library and its stakeholders, including the faculty. These
collaborations were evident in both ARL and Oberlin Group institutions; only the use of an IR as
a collaborative structure across disparate campuses within an organization was absent from the

138

Oberlin Group IR descriptions (the smaller size of liberal arts colleges mean that they are rarely
multi-campus entities). The IR was seen as increasing the ability for scholars to collaborate with
each other too, and this was promoted as a benefit.
Collaboration with a wider community of institutions.
x

“As other universities, institutions, and organizations begin to provide this service for
their work as well, we will collaborate with them to create discipline specific
services.” [ARL]

x

“Intellectual output of the university includ[es] content from collaborative projects
with other institutions.” [ARL]

x

“Digital Grinnell is committed to using open-source software … [that] will allow us
to develop new functions over time and to collaborate with a large community of
other libraries, colleges, and universities.” [Oberlin Group]

Collaboration across campuses.
x

“Digital Commons@Kent State University Libraries promotes research, information
discovery, and collaboration for the scholarly output of all Kent State University
locations.” [ARL]

Collaboration between libraries in a consortial IR service.
x

“The intentions of this collaboration are to … coordinate digital access to these
works between the libraries of the systems.” [ARL]

x

“The Washington Research Library Consortium (WRLC) provides a shared digital
institutional repository for its member institutions.” [ARL]

139

x

“SHAREOK is the joint institutional repository for the University of Oklahoma
Libraries (OU) and Oklahoma State University Libraries (OSU). It serves as the
home for the intellectual output of both communities.” [ARL]

x

“The Digital Archives of Colorado College is … a joint effort by the Colorado
Alliance of Research Libraries to develop digital repository services for libraries in
Colorado and Wyoming.” [Oberlin Group]

Collaborative partnerships with campus stakeholders.
x

“The repository is a collaborative service of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln
libraries. Faculty, researchers, and students … are invited to deposit digital materials
for long-term preservation and world-wide electronic accessibility.” [ARL]

x

“JScholarship … is a partnership between Johns Hopkins scholars and the Johns
Hopkins Libraries.” [ARL]

x

RUcore develops services for the repository and in collaboration with RU
departments and individuals. [ARL]

x

“To support the use of digital materials in teaching and to facilitate online access to
the materials unique to Carleton, the Library collaborates with campus partners to
create Carleton College Digital Collections.” [Oberlin Group]

IRs facilitating collaboration between scholars.
x

“With scholarly content contributed by faculty, researchers and students associated
with the University, this repository … will also support efforts to increase
collaboration and cross discipline research within the University and with other
organizations.” [ARL]

x

“[The IR] stimulates serendipitous discovery and collaboration.” [ARL]

140

x

“[The IR] can also provide researchers with a private, secure workspace for
collaboration with researchers at and outside the university.” [ARL]

x

“The content of the repository is discoverable by Google, Google Scholar, and other
search engines, which makes it easy to share and collaborate with anyone connected
to the Internet.” [Oberlin Group]

In addition to evidence of collaborative activities there was some mention of leadership
in the process of building and operating these interdisciplinary campus infrastructures. Fewer
direct references to leadership were found than for collaboration, however, and they tended to
refer to the IR’s role in promoting institutional leadership.
Statements of leadership.
x

“Deep Blue … [provides] access to the work that makes Michigan a leader in
research, teaching, and creativity.” [ARL]

x

“The Canadian Association of Research Libraries (CARL) … supports the
implementation of institutional repositories by Canadian research libraries in order to
ensure and maintain Canada’s position at the leading edge of innovation in scholarly
publishing.” [ARL]

x

“Trace acquires, organizes, preserves, and provides access to the intellectual capital
that makes Tennessee a leader in research and teaching.” [ARL]

x

“As part of the Libraries’ strategic plan to provide leadership in facilitating access to
Holy Cross’s locally created content, CrossWorks serves to both promote the use of
the college's scholarly output and ensure its long-term preservation.” [Oberlin Group]

Finally, there was some evidence in the text that the IR promoted collaborations that were
expressed in boundary-spanning terms:

141

x

“Many faculty pursue interests beyond their departmental research boundaries with
as much interest and professionalism as in their primary academic subject area. This
collection provides our faculty with an opportunity to archive materials that fall
outside the subject scope of their home department.” [ARL]

x

“By offering a shared venue for the results of original research, literary and artistic
expression, teaching and learning … the Bowdoin Digital Commons supports
scholarly communications that reach across the boundaries of traditional academic
disciplines.” [Oberlin Group]

x

“CrossWorks supports scholarly communications that reach globally across the
boundaries of traditional academic disciplines.” [Oberlin Group]

Evidence of Collaborative Leadership Traits
This section reports on specific collaborative leadership traits that were discovered
through examination of the IR planning documents. The definitions of the traits themselves were
taken from the Turning Point Leadership Development National Excellence Collaborative
(Turning Point, n.d.), whose descriptions of the discrete behaviors that make up collaborative
leadership also informed the survey questions reported on later in this chapter. The terms
searched for in each category are found in Chapter 3, Table 3.3. Table 4.11 shows their
frequency of occurrence across the corpus. The presence of one of these terms did not
automatically imply the presence of the concept under consideration, and the researcher further
considered each text block to judge whether it represented an instance of the concept (which in a
number of cases it did not). In a minority of cases, a quotation was discovered not because it
matched one of the words assigned to a collaborative leadership trait, but while searching for
another trait.

1. Assessing the environment for collaboration. The ARL libraries showed good
appreciation for the working realities of their institutions, responding to the “policy and
workflow issues inherent in a multidisciplinary environment,” and stressing the ability to place
the individual in the wider context of the institution. ARL institutions were also explicit about
the changes in the scholarly publishing environment to which the IR was a partial response, and
they promoted library expertise as an asset in navigating this change. A dominant theme, again
in ARL institutions, was the role of the IR in response to new federal grants requirements to
share content openly and manage data.
Both ARL and Oberlin Group libraries presented the IR as an infrastructure with which to
promote collaboration within a community of institutions, and therefore showed an awareness of
an environment for collaboration that is wider than a single institution. Their assessment of the
environment in which they operated extended to an understanding of how a main stakeholder
community conducts its work: “Many faculty pursue interests beyond their departmental
research boundaries with as much interest and professionalism as in their primary academic
subject area” [ARL].
1a. Understanding institutional characteristics.
x

“UM is a destination for the best researchers and scholars, and Deep Blue places you
in the larger context of the UM environment, side-by-side with the scholarly and
artistic contributions of your colleagues and students.” [ARL]

x

“Trace places you in the larger context of the UT environment, side-by-side with the
scholarly and artistic contributions of your colleagues and students. Similar services
at other universities and among scholarly societies link your work to the global
community.” [ARL]

148

x

“YorkSpace places your work in the larger context of the York Libraries.” [ARL]

x

“The repository is organized to accommodate the varying policy and workflow
issues inherent in a multidisciplinary environment. Submission workflow and access
policies can be customized for each community's needs.” [ARL]

x

“QSpace content is organized around Communities which can correspond to
organizational entities such as schools, departments, labs, research centers, etc.”
[ARL]

x

“By contributing to the transcribing and captioning of the documents in Digital
Grinnell, you are adding to the context and enhancing the understanding of Grinnell’s
rich history for future generations of Grinnellians.” [Oberlin Group]

1b. Responding to a changing scholarly environment.
x

“The system of scholarship and scholarly publishing is going through a process of
change across the world.” [ARL]

x

“Scholarly communication … is rapidly changing. The University of Guelph Library
is also changing to better suit your needs as a researcher, academic, student and
published author.” [ARL]

x

“The system of scholarship and scholarly publishing is going through a process of
change across the world. Notions of authorship and scholarly publishing are rapidly
evolving in the digital age. [ARL]

1c. Responding to federal legislation.
x

“[The IR] may help fulfill dissemination and data-sharing requirements of federal
and other grants….” [ARL]

149

x

“The Digital Conservancy can satisfy requirements for open access to publiclyfunded research.” [ARL]

x

“Depositing research in DRUM can help you satisfy data management and sharing
requirements from the NSF, NIH, and other funding agencies and journals.” [ARL]

x

“Sharing your data through the UDC can satisfy data management planning required
by NSF or other funding agencies.” [ARL]

x

“[The IR] was driven both by anticipated federal funding agency requirements for
data management planning, and by researchers looking for better support for eresearch and e-science initiatives.” [ARL]

x

“[The IR] helps you satisfy a growing number of federal requirements concerning the
dissemination and preservation of research that has been conducted with public
money.” [ARL]

2. Creating clarity: visioning and mobilizing. Both ARL and Oberlin Group
institutions expressed the role of the IR in terms of the goals and vision of their institutions.
Some were at pains to show a clear connection between the vision of the institution and the
mission of the IR, and two explicitly pointed out to online statements of institutional values as
they promoted the IR as a new service in alignment with institutional ambitions.
2a. Sense of vision, mission, and goals.
x

MINDS@UW is designed to gather, distribute, and preserve digital materials related
to the University of Wisconsin's research and instructional mission. [ARL]

x

“Our goal is to showcase and preserve Boston College's scholarly output and to
maximize research visibility and influence.” [ARL]

150

x

“Making accessible the knowledge, creativity, research, and innovation of Syracuse
University is the very essence of ‘scholarship in action’ 2 and helps facilitate the
crucial mission of the university as a public good.” [ARL]

x

“The mission of the Atrium … is to promote scholarly communication by collecting
and preserving the University of Guelph's intellectual output and ensuring that it has
high visibility and accessibility.” [ARL]

x

“The purpose of the Scholarly Repository is to publicize, freely disseminate, and
preserve the work of UM scholars in keeping with the University’s mission to
educate and nurture students, to create knowledge, and to provide service to our
community and beyond.” [ARL]

x

“[The IR’s] purpose is to highlight, preserve, and provide unrestricted access to the
work of faculty, staff, and students, as well as the intellectual output of the university
in its land-grant mission to serve the Commonwealth of Virginia, the nation, and the
world.” [ARL]

x

“Making the knowledge, creativity, research, and innovation of Clark University
accessible is crucial to our mission as a contemporary and connected university.
Clark Digital Commons is a tool for us to use in achieving this aspect of our
mission.” [Oberlin Group]

x

“Works supports the Libraries' mission to foster an environment for scholarly
discovery and engagement, and the College's mission to create a community for
lifelong learning.” [Oberlin Group]

2

“Scholarship in Action” was Syracuse University's vision statement at the time.

151

x

“Digital Kenyon … supports the mission of Kenyon by: Contributing value to the
liberal arts education of our students through scholarship, job opportunities, and
enhancement of high-impact learning programs.” [Oberlin Group]

2b. Reflecting institutional values.
x

“Reflecting the core value of inclusion, innovation, and impact in the Penn Compact
(http://www.upenn.edu/president/penn-compact/penn-compact-landing),
ScholarlyCommons shares the exceptional works of Penn faculty, staff, and students
with a local, national, and global audience.” [ARL]

x

“The Cupola is organized and made accessible by Musselman Library in support of
Gettysburg College’s core value: (http://www.gettysburg.edu/about/college_history/
mission_statement.dot).” [Oberlin Group]

2c. Appealing to institutional ambitions
x

“Scholar Commons … will expand the visibility, access and influence of the
University.” [ARL]

x

“T-Space showcases and preserves the scholarly work of U of T faculty. T-Space is
faculty space, established by the Library to support the dissemination of knowledge
by the University community.” [ARL]

x

“ScholarWorks@UMass Amherst is a digital showcase of the research and scholarly
output of members of the University of Massachusetts Amherst community.” [ARL]

x

“uO Research … provides open and permanent access to uOttawa scholarship
thereby ensuring its wide dissemination and increased visibility on the web.” [ARL]

152

2d. Mobilizing contributors by appealing to their aspirations
x

“When you deposit your work in DASH, it becomes visible to colleagues around the
world by virtue of metadata harvesting, Google Scholar, and other indexing services.
Higher visibility leads to higher rates of citation and impact.” [ARL]

x

“Outstanding student work at the University of Alberta will gain widespread
visibility.” [ARL]

x

“SURFACE … increases the visibility of authors' works; maximizes research impact;
facilitates interdisciplinary research; and provides local, regional, and global
communities with immediate and permanent access.” [ARL]

x

“The intention is to bring together the Claremont Colleges’ scholarship into one
location to maximize visibility, influence, and benefit for the individual as well as the
school.” [Oberlin Group]

x

“We provide open access to the scholarly and creative works produced by Macalester
students, faculty, and staff to increase the visibility of our scholarship, and to
encourage collaboration and innovation in order to contribute to the ongoing
development of new knowledge.” [Oberlin Group]

x

“An additional feature of the Digital Commons is the ability to share information
about individual faculty members and their publications.” [Oberlin Group]

3. Building trust. The IRs repeatedly made the case that the libraries that ran these
services were trusted collaborators, experts in digital curation over time, and able to provide a
trusted and safe archival space. This was a dominant theme. Other trust-inducing qualities were
offered up, including the technological expertise of the libraries, their adherence to industry

153

standards, and the stability that came from partnerships between libraries and from the
relationships that libraries had with their stakeholders.
3a. Provision of a trusted and safe data location.
x

“If you want your research widely accessible to the academic community in a format
that recognizes your rights as an author, maintains or preserves your publication, and
is safe and easy to use, the Atrium will meet your needs.” [ARL]

x

“The Benefits of Posting an Item to MSpace … [include] long-term and safe
preservation.” [ARL]

x

“Deep Blue is the University of Michigan's permanent, safe and accessible service
for representing our rich intellectual community.” [ARL]

x

“We provide long-term access and safekeeping for scholarly works, datasets,
research materials, records, and audiovisual materials produced by the UNC-Chapel
Hill community.” [ARL]

x

“Libra makes publications available to the world and provides safe and secure
storage for the scholarly output of the U.Va.” [ARL]

x

“ResearchWorks is a permanent, safe service for providing access to articles,
technical reports, datasets, images and other file types produced at the University of
Washington by faculty and researchers.” [ARL]

x

“Repositories are important tools for preserving an organization's legacy; they
facilitate digital preservation and scholarly communication.” [ARL]

x

“[AUrora] is safer than keeping copies of your work on a collection of thumb
drives.” [ARL]

154

3b. Institutional commitment.
x

“As a strategic initiative launched by UK Libraries to support multidisciplinary
collaboration, UKnowledge is managed by specialists and sustained by dedicated
funding.” [ARL]

x

“ERA is a database with robust supporting storage and preservation infrastructure, as
well as a service commitment to the University of Alberta community.” [ARL]

x

“In April 2012, the Rice Faculty Senate passed an open access policy to make all
articles published by Rice faculty available as open access publications.” [ARL]

x

“UBC is committed to ‘developing a system for making UBC research accessible in
digital repositories, especially open access repositories’ and cIRcle is part of this
strategy. The Senates of UBC Vancouver and UBC Okanagan have both endorsed
UBC’s Open Access Position Statement which encourages faculty to deposit their
research in cIRcle.” [ARL]

3c. Longevity of service.
x

“The repository became the Knowledge Bank (KB) … and was registered with the
Registry of Open Access Repositories (ROAR) in September 2004. Between 2004
and January 2010, the KB grew to a repository of 44 communities and over 31,000
items.” [ARL]

3d. Stability through partnerships.
x

“The UGA Libraries manage Athenaeum for the University, and is a partner in the
state-wide GALILEO Knowledge Repository.” [ARL]

155

x

D-Scholarship@Pitt is supported by the Barco Law Library, Health Sciences Library
System, University of Pittsburgh Press, the Office of the Provost, and Computing
Services & Systems Development (CSSD). [ARL]

x

“The Digital Archives of Colorado College is Colorado College's local
implementation of the Alliance Digital Repository, a joint effort by the Colorado
Alliance of Research Libraries to develop digital repository services for libraries in
Colorado and Wyoming.” [Oberlin Group]

3e: Adherence to trusted standards.
x

“USpace content and is based on the Open Archival Information System model and
conforms to trusted digital repository requirements.” [ARL]

x

“UKnowledge recommends particular file types to increase the chances of safely
migrating files in the future.” [ARL]

x

“YorkSpace …showcases the scholarship of the York University community through
the use of a special standards-based software platform.” [ARL]

3f. Highlighting significant technology partners.
x

“QSpace uses DSpace software, developed jointly by MIT Libraries and HewlettPackard.” [ARL]

x

“DSpace software was jointly developed in 2002 by MIT Libraries and Hewlett
Packard. Fedora Commons and the DSpace Foundation, two of the largest providers
of open source software for managing and providing access to digital content, joined
together in 2009 to form the DuraSpace Organization.” [ARL]

156

3g. Engaging and respecting stakeholders.
x

“The York University Libraries institutional repository project (YorkSpace) is a
partnership between York University communities and the York University
Libraries.” [ARL]

x

“As in all partnerships, it is important that all Institutional Repository stakeholders
understand and agree to the policies, guidelines and procedures required to build an
institutional repository.” [ARL]

x

“A campus wide steering group developed guidelines and policies relating to the
Bowdoin Digital Commons and oversees the submission, organization, and
maintenance of accepted works.” [Oberlin Group]

x

“The DSA is designed to capture the intellectual output of Wellesley College and, as
such, all members of the College community may contribute to it, including faculty,
staff, and students with faculty sponsorship.” [Oberlin Group]

3h. Concern for faculty’s author rights.
x

“Authorship rights play an important role in open access to scholarly communication.
For information on retaining authorship rights for published works, please see
Copyright and ePrints.” [ARL]

x

“When you submit items to DRUM, you agree to the DRUM license and grant the
University of Maryland a non-exclusive right to retain, preserve, and provide access
to your material. The term "non-exclusive" means that you retain all copyright to
your work. You can still enter into agreements with other organizations (such as
publishers) granting them rights to use your material.” [ARL]

157

3i. Testimonials from users.
x

"I use ScholarSphere because it provides a way for me to place my data and analysis
in a location that is easy to access for other scientists. This encourages enhanced
review and further exploration of the data by collaborators and the community at
large." [ARL]

x

“I work as a clinical researcher in Toronto, Canada. Mainly working with genetic
disorders – we do have access through our institution to various publications, but
sometimes it is just too many hurdles to jump over in order to obtain a publication.
Open Access, on the other hand, provides easy access to crucial publications not only
to myself but also individuals who I may collaborate with and not have the same
ease in obtaining various articles.” [ARL]

3j. International reputation.
x

“cIRcle is currently ranked the number 1 repository in Canada and consistently ranks
in the top 5 of Canadian repositories in "The Ranking Web of World Repositories"
operated by the Cybermetrics Lab in Spain. In North America, cIRcle is ranked
number 11.” [ARL]

4. Sharing power and influence. References to partnerships with stakeholder
communities are often expressions of shared power, and were found throughout these
documents. Both ARL and Oberlin Group sites underscored the relationship between the library
and Information Technology Services, and the descriptions sought to show the depth of the
collaboration. Less often, other elements of the campus infrastructure are recognized, such as
the Provost or Vice President for Research, the Graduate School, and Alumni Relations. Finally,

158

some of the IR sites explained that the community had the power to control and influence what is
contained in the service, through shared collection development decision-making.
4a. Shared power between library and IT services.
x

“ScholarSphere … was collaboratively developed by two units at Penn State: The
University Libraries and Information Technology Services (ITS). The partnership of
these two units brought together the strengths of a large IT organization with those of
a large knowledge management organization….” [ARL]

x

“IUScholarWorks is … a collaborative effort of the IU Libraries and University
Information Technology Services.” [ARL]

x

“The Knowledge Bank is a collaborative service of the Ohio State University
Libraries and the Office of the Chief Information Officer.” [ARL]

x

“UBIR is managed by the University Libraries in cooperation with UB’s central

Group]

x

“This site is a service of Lake Forest College Library and Information Technology.”
[Oberlin Group]

159

4b. Acknowledgment of other collaborative partners.
x

“Core collaborators on the CDR: University Library; School of Information and
Library Science; Office of the Provost. Projects collaborating with the CDR:
International Council on Archives Programme Commission (Curator's Workbench);
JISC (Curator's Workbench); Policy-Driven Repository Infrastructure (PoDRI)
project; TUCASI Data Infrastructure Project.” [ARL]

x

“Digital Repository@Iowa State University is managed by the Iowa State University
Library, with funding support from the Office of the Vice President for Research.”
[ARL]

x

“uO Research is built through partnerships between the Library and uOttawa
academic and research communities to populate collections in the repository with
scholarly content. 7KH¿UVWSDUWQHUVKLSZDVEHWZHHQWKH/LEUDU\)DFXOW\RI*UDGXDWH

x

“Digital Grinnell is a college-wide collaboration of the Libraries, Curricular
Technology, Information Technology Services, the Faulconer Gallery, and the Dean's
Office, with support from Communications and Development and Alumni Relations.”
[Oberlin Group]

4c. Collaborative collection development.
x

“The Communities in collaboration with the Libraries define the kinds of material
they want to include. The Libraries encourages contributions from all communities
across the three campuses.” [ARL]

160

x

“University Collections are actively curated by the library, archives and museum,
sometimes in collaboration with other Willamette University faculty and staff.”
[Oberlin Group]

x

“Research and scholarly works included here are selected and deposited by the
individual university departments and centers on campus in partnership with the
Libraries.” [Oberlin Group]

5. Developing people: mentoring and coaching. There was no evidence of staff
mentoring or the development of staff skills through the act of developing or maintaining a
repository. There was a suggestion in some of these documents, however, that engagement with
the IR could have a positive effect on the faculty and others whose work is featured there, by
developing their professional reputations. References to this form of professional development
through the IR was strongest in the user testimonials that some sites include to promote their
value. Finally, there was a sense that the developers of IRs wish to encourage new Open Access
advocates in their stakeholder communities. Most of the references to the influence of feedback
from stakeholders refer to the development of the service, not of the people using it. There were
references to an IR as a team effort, but no explicit statement about the development of the
team’s technology, leadership, or collaboration skills.
5a. Developing open access participants.

“The University Libraries are committed to assisting faculty members interested in
having their scholarly work appear in the open access repository, and will do
everything that can be done by a third party on behalf of the faculty member.” [ARL]

x

“The Library provides guidance in establishing new Institutional Repository
communities and assistance to faculty and staff and other users of the system.” [ARL]

161

x

“The purpose of OA is to empower researchers to share their findings with a broader
audience, thus supporting the purpose of research: to share and grow knowledge.”
[ARL]

x

“Making your work available in more places to more people will extend the potential
impact of your research.” [ARL]

x

“According to some studies, open access articles are viewed and cited more
frequently than non-open access articles, thereby having the potential to increase an
article’s impact.” [ARL]

x

“The benefits of posting an item to MSpace: increased visibility and wider access to
your research higher rate of citations and greater impact.” [ARL]

x

“Publishing with eScholarship is very valuable, not only because we can share
research early to generate feedback and appropriate citations, but also because
eScholarship allows us to have a university and research center imprimatur for new
research.” [ARL]

5b. Developing better researchers and teachers.
x

“As a professional nurse doing research on global health issues or initiatives, I found
these articles relevant to my needs. Access to this site has help[ed] me
tremendously.” [ARL]

x

“I am looking for new approaches and information to teaching economics. Lacking
open access I wouldn’t have access to articles like this.” – Community College
Instructor [ARL]

162

x

“Our journal simply could not have succeeded in bringing our information to
scientists, the public, and policy makers during the past seven years without the open
access and high degree of professionalism provided by eScholarship.” [ARL]

6. Self-reflection. Self-reflection is seen in these documents in the user testimonials
cited above. And if not self-reflection, there is certainly commentary running through these texts
on the value of self-promotion and the highlighting of the individual.
6a. Encouraging professional growth.
x

"I found that placing self-published documents in cIRcle is a very effective way at
letting the world know about a publication…. I certainly take more pride in a few
thousand ‘hits’ in cIRcle than I do in a handful of references to a published journal
article.” [ARL]

x

“Participating in Aurora contributes to the university's research and outreach missions
– a point you might want to emphasize in your promotion and tenure (P&T) dossier.”
[ARL]

x

From Our Faculty: “eScholarship enhances our ability to disseminate our research so
that it has an impact on both scholarship and public policy. Since we started
uploading to eScholarship, the number of people accessing our publications has
grown exponentially.” [ARL]

6b. Highlighting and celebrating the individual.
x

“Presentation and promotion of your individual and department's research: Faculty
and researchers have the ability to create a customizable page highlighting their
research and interests.” [ARL]

163

x

“By representing our faculty, staff, and student scholars as individuals and as
members of communities, Deep Blue is where you will find and the Library preserves
the best scholarly and artistic work done at Michigan.” [ARL]

x

“The intention is to bring together the Claremont Colleges’ scholarship into one
location to maximize visibility, influence, and benefit for the individual as well as
the school.” [Oberlin Group]

x

“Promote the use of the products of campus research and thereby maximize their
impact for individual researchers and scholars.” [ARL]

x

“Expanded access for your to colleagues: You act in your own best interests by
taking part in the University’s mission share and preserve the knowledge produced
here.” [ARL]

x

“Increases citation impact: Provides increased visibility for your research and your
unit, bringing many new readers to your content; Provides world-wide accessibility
via search engines like Google or others. Your content is discoverable from a variety
of locations and methods with no extra work on your part; Provides sophisticated
searching, making your materials easy for readers to find.” [ARL]

Survey Using a Questionnaire
The survey had an overall response rate of 37.7%, with 110 of the 292 individuals invited
to take part in the survey responding. The overall response rate for the questionnaire was better
than is sometimes expected for survey results; leading survey software packages warn to expect
“an average 10-15% response rate for [an] external survey” (Fryrear, 2015, Typical Response
Rates for Common Survey Types section, para. 3), and suggest that “for a survey in which there

164

is no prior relationship with recipients … response rates can be as high as 20% to 30%” (Porter,
2017, What is the Typical Response Rate for a Survey? section). Baruch and Holtom (2008)
analyzed 490 surveys published in 17 refereed academic journals from 2000 and 2005 and found
that the “average response rate for studies that utilized data collected from individuals was 52.7
percent … while the average response rate for studies that utilized data collected from
organizations was 35.7 percent” (p. 1139). The sample size here – 110 from a population of 292
– was not large enough to give any confidence that one can generalize from these results; a
sample size of 167 would be needed to achieve a confidence level of 95% and a margin of error
of 5% from a population of this size.
Table 4.12 records the response rates by group. All participants who completed the
survey did so online, although they were all given the choice to complete the survey on paper
and return it to the researcher. An equal number (37%) of ARL directors and developers
responded, but there is no way to be sure that they were from the same institutions given the
anonymous nature of the survey. Considerably more variation is seen in the Oberlin Group, with
a much higher response from directors (45.6%) than from developers (32.6%).

being examined; Tables 4.33-4.36 summarize perceptions of success; Tables 4.37-4.46
summarize planning and implementation engagement and stakeholders; and Tables 4.47-4.51
record t-tests for equality of means.
Collaborative Leadership Traits
1. Assessing the environment for collaboration. On a scale of 1=never to 5=always,
the questionnaire showed a high level of agreement with the three questions in this section, with
no respondent scoring any question as 1=never. The mean for the section was 3.7, and for each
of the three questions most scores were either four or five. Many respondents could answer
these questions; there were only four responses of “no opinion” across the three questions in this
section, and only three respondents who skipped questions. The least agreement was with Q1.2
– The people working on the Institutional Repository at my institution act on information rather
than on assumptions – but even here the means for the responses from both ARL and Oberlin
Group developers were above 3.5.

2. Creating clarity: visioning and mobilizing. This section had the highest number of
1=never responses (seven) of any part of the questionnaire, and the lowest mean (3.2) of any of
the questions. Six out of ten of the standard deviations in this section were greater than 1 (more
than any other section), showing a broad spread of opinion either side of the mean value.

3. Building trust. This section of the questionnaire underscored that the collaborative
teams who built the IR were perceived to be safe, trusted spaces, with open communication;
there was less agreement from ARL developers that the teams allowed all members of the group
to exercise leadership, and that answer scored the second lowest mean in the questionnaire
(3.2647).

4. Sharing power and influence. This trait displayed the highest means and narrowest
standard deviations of any section in the survey, and is one of only two that have no scores of
1=never (the other being “Assessing the Environment for Collaboration,” above). This section
also recorded the two highest means – 4.2308 and 4.2667 – in the survey, both from answers
given by Oberlin Group developers.

5. Developing people: mentoring and coaching. This trait had the second largest
number of respondents who either skipped the question (12) or record no opinion (18).
However, for those who did answer questions about coaching and mentoring or helping others
take advantage of opportunities, the means were among the highest in the survey, ranging from
3.8571 to 4.1667. There was less agreement about the creation of “opportunities for others to
assess their leadership skills” with three respondents rating this question as 1=never, the only
time this number of respondents scored a category that high.

those who did answer generally scored these questions positively, with means ranging from
3.4483 to 4.1563. This section also has the only question – Q 6.2. The people working on the
Institutional Repository at my institution work to understand others’ perspectives – for which
both means are over 4 (4.1563 and 4.1538 respectively), showing unusually high agreement from
the ARL and Oberlin Group developers.

Perceptions of IR Success
This section asked about perceptions of success in four areas: attracting content,
promoting open access, enhancing academic reputation, and strengthening collaborations with
the library. The prevailing sense was that the IR sites did an average job at the first two, but the
IR scored higher as a mechanism to enhance the academic reputation of the institution, although
this question saw more “no opinion” (nine) choices than usual. There was greatest agreement
with the notion that the IR strengthened collaborations with the library on campus; this was
especially the case from ARL and Oberlin Group directors.

Engagement in Planning and Implementation
These two questions confirmed that directors were much more likely to be involved in the
planning of an IR than in its implementation. This was true by an especially wide margin for
ARL directors (75.7% planning, 45.9% implementation). As would be expected, the opposite
was the case for IR developers, more of whom implemented than planned, although by a much
smaller margin, and more than 70% of ARL and Oberlin Group developers took part in both
activities.

Perceptions of Collaborations with Stakeholders: Planning
There was a high degree of agreement between directors about their perceptions of
stakeholder engagement in the planning of IRs. Library staff of various sorts predominated as
collaborators, followed by faculty of various disciplines for the ARL and Oberlin Group
directors, with humanities faculty scoring noticeably higher in the Oberlin Group than in ARL
institutions. ARL directors thought that graduate students were noticeably more involved in the
process than Oberlin Group directors did, who ranked undergraduate involvement higher (as
would be expected from predominantly undergraduate institutions).
The same patterns were generally observable in the opinions of the IR developers, who
agreed that the predominant group in IR planning was library staff, although the Oberlin Group
developers thought considerably fewer library computing/IT staff (53.3%) were involved than
Oberlin Group directors did (71.4%). Both ARL and Oberlin Group developers saw a more
prominent engagement from senior campus administrators (Provost, Deans, etc.) and non-library
computing/IT staff than from faculty and students.

178

Developers generally thought there was less faculty and student involvement in IR
planning than their directors did, and the difference was striking in the case of the humanities
faculty in the Oberlin Group, where directors thought humanities faculty members were involved
at a rate of 61.9%, but developers estimated only 26.6% involvement: there was much closer
agreement about humanities faculty engagement from ARL directors (43.2%) and ARL
developers (37.8%). Similar wide disagreements are seen between Oberlin Group directors and
developers for science and social science faculty engagement in IR planning too. Tables 4.39
and 4.40 record the findings for directors; Tables 4.41 and 4.42 record the findings for
developers.

Perceptions of Collaborations with Stakeholders: Implementation
There was a high degree of agreement between directors about which stakeholders were
engaged in the implementation of IRs. Library staff predominated, followed by faculty of
various disciplines (humanities faculty scoring noticeably higher in the Oberlin Group than in
ARL institutions), then senior campus administrators (Provost, Deans, etc.), non-library
Computing/IT staff, and finally students (who were noticeably more involved in the process in
ARL institutions than in Oberlin Group ones). Tables 4.43 through 4.46 summarize the results
regarding implementation.

Independent t-test for Two Samples
Finally, a statistical software package, SPSS, was used to run an inferential statistical test
– the independent t-test (also called the two sample t-test or independent-samples t-test) – to
determine whether there was a statistically significant difference between the means of the
following groups, on those questions that were scored on a Likert scale (1-5):
x

Between ARL and Oberlin Group library directors

x

Between ARL and Oberlin Group library developers

x

Between all ARL respondents and all Oberlin Group respondents

And within ARL and Oberlin Group Institutions:
x

ARL: between library directors and developers

x

Oberlin Group: between library directors and developers

Results are summarized in Tables 4.47 through 4.51. The test was calculated using a p-value of
.05, the norm for social science research, which gives a 1 in 20 (5%) possibility that the
difference occurred due to chance. This would not be a suitable p-value for (say) medical
research, where a much lower threshold would inspire more confidence: a p-value of .01 would
give a 1% possibility that a difference occurred due to chance, for example, and a p-value of .001
would give a 0.1% (1/1,000) possibility that the difference occurred due to chance.
Only two questions showed a statistically significant difference between the means using
a p-value of .05. Both occurred between ARL directors and ARL developers (Table 4.49):
x

Q 1.1. The people working on the Institutional Repository at my institution assess the
needs of the community. The p-value was .012, and the means were 4.0286 for ARL
directors and 3.4324 for ARL developers

184

x

Q 2.1. The people working on the Institutional Repository at my institution explore
the diverse aspirations among community stakeholders. The p-value was .009, and
the means were 4.0278 for ARL directors and 3.3889 for ARL developers

In addition to the two questions that had p-values below the .05 threshold, two more had
responses that were between .05 and .09 (below a p-value of 0.10). These are statistically nonsignificant differences according to the best practices of social science research (given that the
difference could occur by chance 1 in 10 times), but there are guides such as that for the Minitab
17 statistical software that defend choosing “a larger alpha, such as 0.10, to be more certain that
you will not miss detecting a difference that might exist” (What value should I use for
significance level?, 2017). It is at least of interest that there may be a meaningful difference of
opinion about the degree to which the following questions were answered:

Open Ended Comments
The survey concluded with a text box that allowed for open-ended comments, whose
responses the researcher has organized into the categories below. There were 28 comments in
all, 19 from the ARL participants (10 directors and 9 developers) and 9 from the Oberlin Group
participants (4 directors and 5 developers). All groups commented on the planning and
implementation of the IR, and all but Oberlin Group directors had something to say about
stakeholder engagement. These two topic areas accounted for 19 of the 28 comments, with the
others touching on open access, IR definitions, consortial arrangements, challenges with
answering the survey (due to assumptions it made about their IR planning and implementation
processes), and references to library leadership displayed in the creation of the IR. Comments
are reproduced verbatim.

190

1. Planning and implementation teams.
a) Our IR was launched (2007) in close association with University Archives (part of
Libraries), which gives it authority to collect institutional and faculty works. It also
incorporated a pre-existing repository for applied econ (now almost 20 years old) and
is moving into data. Early on, I had some involvement in policy, but did not
participate in actual implementation – there's a management group for that. [ARL
director]
b) On questions 1 and 3 in this section, I was not involved in the planning or
implementation because I was not here when that happened. My predecessor was
very involved in both. [ARL director]
c) The planning and implementation of the IR were not single events. We involved
different groups at different times; for example, to support the OA policy, to support
ETDs, to support data management, etc. Each of these were separate planning and
implementation activities at different times in the IR evolution. Thus my answers are
inclusive of all planning/implementation activities. [ARL director]
d) The planning and implementation of the IR at [my institution] has been and continues
to be an informal process, so some of the questions are hard for us to answer, since
they assume a more formal structure than we have here. We don't have an IR
committee or even an IR librarian (although a reference librarian has voluntarily
added the IR to her job duties). In a word, the people who are involved in this at [my
institution] are those who want to be. [ARL developer]
e) The wording of this survey seems to imply that there is one dedicated consistent team
of people that work over time, and over the years with each other. Seems also to

191

imply that the libraries operate outside of the IR "teams". At my institution the
library is the home and driving force of the IR, although in the 10-11 years since its
planning started, and 9 years since its launch there have been partnering with units
outside of the library. Also, there is no one FTE dedicated to the IR. We have no IR
manager. There are bits of people's time, people who report up to different
supervisors and administrators, and we have been significantly understaffed. We
might say there is .5 FTE total working on the IR. We would also say that different
ad hoc groups are formed as needed, making it hard to answer very well some of your
"group dynamics" questions. It is almost as if the IR is an unfunded mandate
however desirable we are to have this and so unified action, vision, consistent
behavior and actions to run the IR has been weak. Not through lack of trying. I hope
the data we offer is useful to some degree however. [ARL developer]
f) Bless you, you think there's an actual team of people working on the IR at my
institution. [ARL developer]
g) While the planning & implementation teams were small and limited to the Library,
those teams consulted widely with all campus constituencies. [Oberlin Group
director]
h) I would distinguish between those who implemented the BEPress software and those
who supported, passed and promoted our OA policy. I answered the #3 questions re:
the policy side; #4 from software implementation side. [Oberlin Group director]
i) We are still in beta mode. We have no staff to devote to this. We try to fit it in but
with staff cuts, it's difficult. [Oberlin Group developer]

192

j) A lot of the questions ask about a "group" working on the Digital Repository. We
really only have a couple people working on it because we have a pretty small staff,
so it was hard for me to answer those questions because they seemed less applicable.
[Oberlin Group developer]
k) The senior campus administrator was head of library, who was on the planning
committee. Deans gave approval, but not involved in planning or implementation.
Faculty involvement is peripheral in planning stage, then formalized as member of
ongoing implementation team. [Oberlin Group developer]
2. Engagement with stakeholders.
a) The IR is but a part of our digital services which encompass support for publishing
ejournals and extensive archival programs. As the IR supports new programs e.g.
etheses, people from more areas of the campus are involved. [ARL director]
b) The Provost's Office of Faculty Affairs was particularly influential in these
deliberations. [ARL director]
c) I look forward to your results. The IR remains a work in progress even after many
years. We have had strong acceptance/engagement from some faculty, and minimal
response from others. It requires continuous education and outreach to sustain and
expand engagement. [ARL director]
d) Faculty were involved with the development of our open access policy and have
collaborated on several projects involving our institutional repository, but have not
been directly involved in IR planning and implementation efforts. I'm interpreting
"Library Computing/IT staff" to mean programmers/sys admin, even if they are part
of the library's digital scholarship group rather than its IT group. [ARL developer]

193

e) The library was charged by the Senior Administration and the Faculty Senate to
implement the envisioned institutional repository. We currently have a Faculty
Senate resolution that supports publishing in OA venues (including our repository)
whenever possible. We need to work to strengthen this to a policy. We just started
an OA fund so that may assist in getting more deposits and add to the OA
momentum. [ARL developer]
f) As a small institution, we primarily utilized existing faculty committees to
communicate and involve faculty with planning and implementation rather than
creating ad hoc groups for this purpose. The one faculty member involved in the
planning was the chair of one of the standing faculty committees involved. But the
real logistical work of the implementation was handled entirely by library staff.
[Oberlin Group developer]
g) The library has sought input from faculty in designing parts of the IR but overall the
planning and implementation process has been left to the library staff. There is some
faculty burnout over several failed attempts to create campus-wide DAMS in the past.
Ours is a hosted solution which has slowed communication and implementation getting responses has been slow and curtailed some efforts to engage others. [Oberlin
Group developer]
3. Open access.
a) Re answer to question on promoting open access: this is a hopelessly low priority
issue on our campus, so answer is more about that than library staff efforts. [ARL
director]

194

4. Consortia.
a) [My institution] did its IR as part of CDL and so activities on a particular campus can
be beside the point: we did it centrally. [ARL director]
b) The IR for faculty content, open access, campus collaborations, etc. was a happy
afterthought. We needed a space to put some content when our consortiallysupported platform was defunded. [ARL director]
c) We run an IR for 9 local libraries as a shared service. [ARL director]
5. IR definitions.
a) We have elements of an institutional repository, but we do not yet have a more
inclusive one. My answers reflect that. [Oberlin Group director]
6. Challenges with answering the survey.
a) In the first part of the survey, possible responses are somewhat problematic because
they seem to conflate the dispositions and actions of the people actually working on
the IR with those responsible for policy directives around the development of the IR.
For instance, whether or not IR team members “Explore the diverse aspirations
among community stakeholders,” with respect to the IR is determined by
administration directives in the launch of the IR, not the primary implementers. Also
in the case of my organization, the rationale for implementation was fairly narrow, as
a response to open access, so the possible response above does not seem applicable (a
response of neither agreement nor disagreement). Another possible response, “Create
processes for exercising collaborative leadership that are open to all stakeholders,” is
problematic in that, while collaboration in general may be a good thing, IRs in the
past have had issues with being populated by content of questionable value (largely in

195

response to unsuccessful self-deposit models). The need to maintain even a flexible
standard for content quality can be at odds with broad openness to all stakeholders.
This applies to the questions under section 5, “Sharing Power and Influence,” as well.
[ARL developer]
b) Many of these questions are difficult to answer as there is really no defined "team"...
a lot of the IR work is done by contract workers and students and there is a lot of
turnover ... I'm the only one that has been there throughout and there is no formal
training and little time to strategize, if ever. There is a broader digital advisory group
but the IR is a very small agenda point, and only when there are decisions to be made.
This broader advisory group set some of the initial IR policies, but they are in need of
updating. [ARL developer]
c) By library staff I assume that you mean library employees generically. We often
divide library employees into faculty and staff (i.e., non-faculty). [ARL developer]
7. Leadership.
a) Because this survey does not allow me to respond on my own account, or specify key
individuals within the group that is "working on the institutional repository", I was
not able to record the amazing leadership, collaborative skills, team building, and
outreach that characterize some individuals involved with the IR. In many ways, we
succeed because one or two people break away from the unorganized, opportunistic,
often critical, and sometimes hostile library leadership (with respect to IR). [ARL
developer]
b) No one had any interest in an IR here so the library filled the void. If you want to
interview someone articulate on this topic, talk to our head of reference … who got

196

the whole ball rolling. She led a committee of librarians. Her insights and leadership
would be possibly helpful to your research. [Oberlin Group director]
Conclusion
The analysis of the web documents showed a high degree of similarity in the content,
layout, and sometimes even the language used to express the IR from site to site, across both
groups. Service names showed considerable variation, with the term “institutional repository”
being uncommon as part of the IR’s name, despite being the common descriptor for this type of
service. About half the sites used the terms commons, repository, space, or archive in their
names. The other half invented a brand name, perhaps for ease of marketing, which often
referred to the name or nickname of the institution or was an acronym (such as IDEALS: Illinois
Digital Environment for Access to Learning and Scholarship). Only one of these service names
referenced collaborative activities directly.
There is a clear indication that the IR had its origin in the ARL libraries, and migrated as
a service to Oberlin Group liberal arts colleges several years later. The size difference measured
in IR holdings between ARL and Oberlin institutions is striking – about an order of magnitude –
and reflects both the difference in the sizes of the institutions and possibly the length of time the
service has operated in a given institution.
The web documents and the survey demonstrated the presence of all six collaborative
leadership traits under consideration in this study, in both ARL and Oberlin Group IRs. The
documents showed little in the way of libraries claiming leadership positions for themselves
around the issues of open access and long-term curation of scholarship, but there were statements
that connected the IR’s benefits with the mission of the institution, promoted the advantages to

197

individual researchers of using the IR, and in particular stressed the concept of the library as a
safe, trusted, enduring, repository for content that was important for the scholarly record.
There was a high degree of agreement among the survey takers, with only two questions
showing a statistically significant difference between their means. Both of these significant
differences of opinion occurred between ARL directors and ARL developers, and concerned the
degree to which they had assessed the needs and explored the diverse aspirations of the
community. The lower confidence expressed by developers finds some support in the literature,
which highlighted a lack of needs assessment in the planning of IRs. There is also a high degree
of agreement between ARL and Oberlin Group participants about their perceptions of IR
success, and about the network of stakeholders who are (or are not) involved in the planning and
implementation of an IR. Directors repeatedly scored their questions higher on a 1-5 scale than
developers did; ARL directors were generally more positive in their scores than their Oberlin
Group counterparts.
Finally, the 28 comments made by participants at the end of the questionnaire
underscored that there were opportunities for library leadership and collaboration in the building
and maintaining of an institutional repository, but also revealed the tension some institutions face
between their sense of the importance of the IR to their institution and the library’s ability to
invest in it: “It is almost as if the IR is an unfunded mandate however desirable we are to have
this and so unified action, vision, consistent behavior and actions to run the IR has been weak,”
stated one ARL developer. In the face of well-funded commercial competitors for faculty time
and content such as ResearchGate and Acacdemia.edu, this lack of institutional investment is
concerning, and may be reflected in the relatively modest growth in the volume of content held
in IRs, and their somewhat marginalized place in their communities.

DISCUSSION

Introduction
The web documents examined in Chapter Four, Findings, revealed a wide range of
information pertaining to the IRs analyzed in this research, as well as indications about their
service ambitions and perceived value to their universities and colleges. These documents also
showed the presence of the six collaborative leadership traits named earlier in this study, and
more information about these traits was provided by the survey of library directors and IR
developers. In addition, the survey provided opinions about the success of the library’s
engagement with various stakeholder groups in the implementation of an IR. The following
discussion answers the research questions posed in Chapter One, informed by the findings from
the content analysis and the questionnaires reported on in Chapter Four.
Do IR Format, Size, Length of Operation, Nomenclature, or Technology Platform vary
between ARL and Oberlin Group Members?
The two study populations exhibit some considerable variations with regards to their IR
sites, as would be expected: one population is a group of research universities (mean size 32,323
students), and the other is a set of liberal arts colleges with a primary focus on undergraduate
education (mean size 2,153 students). This variation is particularly evident in their volume of
content and their length of operation, with ARL IRs typically being much larger by volume of
content and in service for a longer period than Oberlin Group ones. Variation also appears to a
moderate degree in the choice of the software architecture through which these institutions
operate their IRs. The 146 IRs in this study use 10 different software packages, although two

200

technology platforms dominate: DSpace in ARL and Digital Commons in Oberlin Group
institutions. There is much less variation in their design or in their descriptive content.
The main influence on the appearance and design of the IR web site was not the mission
or size of the institution; rather, it was the technology platform chosen to run the IR, which
brought with it a definite structure, set of features, and sometimes even boilerplate descriptive
text. This results in IR web documents being highly formulaic, as they are influenced in part by
design decisions made by individuals in the organizations and companies who created the
repository software. In addition to being formulaic, these IRs were also imitative, with one IR
site sometimes copying phrasing from another one (or from a common third-party source) to
make the same point, as in the case of these two ARL institutions:
x

“As in all partnerships, it is important that all stakeholders understand and agree to
the policies, guidelines, and procedures required to build a repository.”

x

“As in all partnerships, it is important that all Institutional Repository stakeholders
understand and agree to the policies, guidelines and procedures required to build an
institutional repository.”

Or these from two Oberlin Group institutions:
x

“[The IR] supports scholarly communications that reach across the boundaries of
traditional academic disciplines.”

x

“[The IR] supports scholarly communications that reach globally across the
boundaries of traditional academic disciplines.”

Such imitation and reliance on boilerplate text from a software provider can look like evidence
of a hasty implementation; for the user, however, a degree of similarity across sites may be a
positive attribute, as it creates an air of familiarity for anyone who works across multiple

201

repositories, which can aid ease of use. The benefits of this similarity of design is particularly
noticeable in an aggregation such as the Digital Commons Network (over 500 sites using the
bepress IR architecture). Their graphical navigation design is distinctive – a multi-colored
interactive wheel – but once a user has become accustomed to it in a local IR that familiarity
carries over to all the other sites in the Digital Commons Network and to the interface for the
aggregation itself, which repeats this navigational wheel (see Figure 5.1).

Overall, there was a sense of brevity in the descriptive elements of these IR sites, which
had a mean site length of 888.1 words. Too often, the researcher felt there were missed
opportunities for these sites to advocate for the values and benefits of the institutional repository.
ARL sites (1,039.7 words mean) were noticeably longer than Oberlin Group IR sites (558.5
words mean) although neither were typically verbose. The textual lists that dominated the design
of DSpace sites (such as lists of communities represented in the IR) tended to add to their web
documents’ word counts. This fact notwithstanding, the more text-rich web sites typically had
more examples of the types of holdings one would find in the IR, and more promotional
information on the value and impact of the service to its community. Testimonials from other
users were among the more persuasive pieces of marketing, as they told stories of the impact of
the IR on individual scholars, administrators, and librarians. A selection can be seen at
https://www.bepress.com/testimonials/ for the Digital Commons community; Harvard’s DASH
also provides a compelling set of faculty and community voices in a top-level section – “Stories”
– that by 2017 has developed into an interactive map to showcase testimonials from users
globally: https://dash.harvard.edu/stories/.
Web Sites for IR Services: Terminology
The majority of sites used either the DSpace or the Digital Commons platforms – 75.3%
in this study – and there was a tendency to use the name of the software package in the name of
the service, leading to a prevalence of IRs called “Space” and “Commons.” For example,
“Commons” was used as part of a service name by 10 of the 30 Oberlin Group sites (33.3%) that
used the Digital Commons platform, and by seven of the 19 ARL sites that did so (36.8%). The
concepts evoked by “Commons” are ones of collective ownership and sharing, with echoes of
phrases such as “the common good.” The term “Commons” seems to have resonated with the IR

203

community more generally, as it appears in service names of eight other sites that did not use
Digital Commons infrastructure, including five DSpace sites, two Fedora sites, and one Open
Repository site. Fuster Morell (2010), writing on the building and governance of “digital
commons” services such as Wikipedia and Flickr, pointed to positive attributes that commons
display in terms that are relevant to IRs in their communities. Digital Commons, she asserts, are
“oriented to favor use and reuse, rather than to exchange as a commodity … [and] the
community of people building them can intervene in the governing of their interaction processes
and of their shared resources” (p. 5). This sense of shared governance was seen in some of the
web documents in relation to collective collection development decisions: “the Communities in
collaboration with the Libraries define the kinds of material they want to include” [ARL
institution]; “research and scholarly works included here are selected and deposited by the
individual university departments and centers on campus in partnership with the Libraries”
[Oberlin Group institution]. The DSpace platform, in contrast to Digital Commons, exerted a
lesser influence over service names. Only 15 of the 61 DSpace sites (24.6%) in the study
populations used “Space” in their service names, and the term did not transfer to the service
names of IRs based on other technology platforms in the same manner that “Commons” did:
only one non-DSpace site in this study used the term “Space” in its service name.
The relative popularity of Commons (17.8%), Repository (17.1%), Space (10.9%), and
Archive (6.2%) in the service names of these study populations is out of keeping with the
international trends in service naming, as seen in the records of The Directory of Open Access
Repositories (OpenDOAR). Globally, the term “repository” is overwhelmingly favored, with
1,208 (42.2%) of the 2,864 institutional repositories in OpenDOAR using it by July 2017.
“Space” was used globally at less than half the rate that it was in this study population – 128

204

(4.5%) of 2,864 institutional repositories – despite the overwhelming prevalence of DSpace as a
technology platform for IRs recorded by OpenDOAR (1,374 of the 2,864 sites used DSpace, or
48%). “Commons” is used hardly at all as a service name in sites recorded in OpenDOAR – 83
(2.9%) of 2,864 – and is clearly a geographically-bounded choice, with 72 of those 83
occurrences coming from North America (58 of those sites used Digital Commons software).
Only the use of “archive” as a service name in the study population (6.2%) is somewhat in line
with global use, at 260 of 2,864 institutional repositories in OpenDOAR (9.1%).
Brand names are not as common internationally as they are in the study population
(48.6%), with 394 out of 2,864 sites (13.8%), although this is likely to be an underestimate due
to the fact that there is not always a perfect match between the content of the title field in the
OpenDOAR record and the IR service name itself. For example, the “Aberystwyth University
Repository” (as it appears in the OpenDOAR record) is really “Cadair: The Aberystwyth
University Open Access Repository.” It is possible that in these instances the service name has
evolved and the record has not been updated. The use of brand names internationally seems to
be for the same reasons as in North America: marketing and memorability. Notable examples
include “A-Plus” from the Aomori University of Health and Welfare (Japan), “Carpe dIEN”
from the Instituto de Engenharia Nuclear (Brazil), “Eureka” from The Said Business School at
the University of Oxford (United Kingdom), and “UP” from the University of Perugia (Italy).
What was not found frequently in the IR service names in these study populations,
perhaps surprisingly, was the phrase “institutional repository:” only six ARL and one Oberlin
Group sites qualified “repository” with “institutional” in their service names (4.79% overall).
OpenDOAR records the use of “institutional repository” as part of a service name at twice this
rate, recording 284 instances out of 2,864 IRs (9.9%). The term “institutional repository” was

205

used more frequently in the descriptive text of the web documents analyzed in this research,
however, where it occurred more than twice as often in ARL institutions (34, or 34%) as it did in
Oberlin Group sites (7, or 15.2%). The relative paucity of references to “institutional repository”
may be explained by the literature, which indicated that users were confused by the terminology
employed by IR developers, including the phrase “institutional repository.” Early in the
development of IRs, for example, Foster and Gibbons (2005) observed that faculty “did not
perceive the relevance of almost any of the IR features as stated in the terms used by librarians,
archivists, [and] computer programmers” (What Faculty Members Want section, para. 7). More
pointedly, Jantz and Wilson (2008) suggested that “a first step in [marketing IRs] might be to
change the name ‘institutional repository’ to one that suggests a connection to scholarship” (p.
194). The seventy institutions (48.6%) in this research that invented a brand name for their IR
service did just as Jantz and Wilson recommended: they used “research,” “scholar,” “scholarly,”
and “scholarship” repeatedly, and avoided naming their services after an infrastructure
(repository) or a product (Digital Commons). It is possible that many sites invented brand names
knowing that neither the names of infrastructures nor the names of products were familiar to
their users. They may also have been motivated to give the service a distinctive and memorable
name for ease of marketing: IRs called DASH, Deep Blue, Libra, and SCARAB may come to
mind more readily to users than ones known as “scholarly archive” or “digital repository.”
Figures 5.2 and 5.3 show word clouds derived from the names of IR services for Oberlin
Group and ARL institutions (excluding terms that only appear once, for sake of clarity). Among
other things, these word clouds draw attention to the prominent place that the term “digital”
holds in these service names. This is surprising in one regard, as it hardly seems necessary to

206

stress the digital nature of a repository that can only exist online (at least to the degree that its
digital nature needs to be promoted in the service name).

Figure 5.2. Word cloud of IR service names: ARL institutions

Figure 5.3. Word cloud of IR service names: Oberlin Group institutions

Nonetheless, “digital” was used as a qualifying term in 17 of the 26 sites that used “commons” in
their service names (65.4%), 14 of the 25 sites that used “repository” (56%), 9 of the 21 sites that
used a brand name (42.8%), and 4 of the 9 sites with “archives” in their names (44%). None of
the sites whose service names used “space” felt the need to qualify it with anything that specified

207

the digital format of the contents (although the D in DSpace may evoke the term “digital” for
some users). For ARL sites, it appears that the term “digital” went out of fashion as time passed:
only five of the 31 ARL IRs created after 2009 (16.1%) used “digital” in their service names.
This is not the case for Oberlin Group IRs, where 18 of the 39 IRs created after 2009 (46.1%)
used “digital” in their service names. Of those 18, 11 were using the Digital Commons IR
architecture, and so the name of the software platform may have influenced the choice of
terminology in these service names.
Paying attention to the language used in the names of IR services also showed that there
were two distinct concepts that many IR designers sought to evoke. One promulgated the
qualities of curation and permanence, using familiar library terms such as “archive” and
“repository” in service names, and – more strikingly – using less-common library services terms
to denote safekeeping, such as “cache,” “conservancy,” “vault,” “bank,” and “trust.” The second
concept referred to the value, quality, and professional standing of the content held in the IR,
evoked by words such as “scholarship,” “research,” “academic,” “education,” and “creative
work.” Some sites combined the two sentiments, such as the Knowledge Bank at Ohio State
University. It makes sense that IR designers would want to engender feelings of trustworthiness
and convey the serious nature of the content for such a service, echoing the reputation of the
academic library itself as a trusted, scholarly space. The concepts of trust and preservation of
content were seen throughout the web documents, as is evident from their analysis in Chapter
Four: Findings, which found statements such as “ERA is a database with robust supporting
storage and preservation infrastructure” that underscored the permanence of the library’s
repository. The appeal to permanency should be an important topic for IR marketing, as Kim
(2011) showed that it generated considerable faculty interest: “Specifically, long-term

208

preservation of IR materials is the reason that faculty members cited most frequently as
motivating their IR contribution,” (p. 253) although even here “some interviewees expressed
doubts about the capabilities of university libraries for sustaining digital collections” (p. 253).
Certainly, there is concern about the impermanence of digital scholarship generally, with
multiple studies showing alarming rates of “link decay” both in web sites generally (Koehler,
1999; Oguz & Koehler, 2016, for example) and in the scholarly citations to online resources
found in electronic journals (Sellitto, 2004; Goh & Ng, 2007; Sampath Kumar & Manoj
Kumar, 2012; and Hennessey & Ge, 2013, for example).
Institutional repositories are also closely tied to library support for open access
publishing; looking closely at the language of these sites, however, there were fewer references
to “open access” than might be expected. Only 39 ARL sites use the term (39%), in such
statements as “institutional repositories are a part of the larger open access movement, which
aims to provide free access to research over the Internet,” and only eight Oberlin Group sites use
it (17.4%). The references to open access that do occur in the web documents are strongly
positive ones, however, and sought to underscore its value to inter-institutional collaboration and
to the increased visibility of scholarly work:
x

“Open Access, on the other hand, provides easy access to crucial publications not
only to myself but also individuals who I may collaborate with and not have the same
ease in obtaining various articles” [User testimonial, ARL].

x

“We provide open access to the scholarly and creative works … to increase the
visibility of our scholarship, and to encourage collaboration and innovation in order
to contribute to the ongoing development of new knowledge” [Oberlin Group].

209

x

“According to some studies, open access articles are viewed and cited more
frequently than non-open access articles, thereby having the potential to increase an
article’s impact” [ARL].

It was clear from survey responses to question 7.2 – Our Institutional Repository has been
successful in promoting open access at our institution – that open access was more a feature of
the ARL libraries than the Oberlin Group ones (see Table 4.34), with ARL directors and
developers having more positive opinions (means of 3.6667 and 3.3000 respectively) than their
Oberlin Group counterparts (means of 3.2353 and 2.7333). Indeed, this last mean – 2.7333 –
was the lowest in the survey, and the only one under 3.0.
Just as the literature indicates that “institutional repository” may be a term that is better
understood by librarians than by library users, other studies have shown that the phrase “open
access” may also be opaque to faculty and students (Otto, 2016, p. 8). In addition, in recent
years the term has taken on increasingly negative connotations for researchers, who have now to
contend with “predatory” open access journals whose business model relies on the collection of
open access publication fees via the provision of an online journal that superficially appears to be
a scholarly publication, but which does not adhere to the norms of peer review or editorial
intervention:
A negative consequence of the rapid growth of scholarly open access publishing funded
by article processing charges is the emergence of publishers and journals with highly
questionable marketing and peer review practices. These so-called predatory publishers
are causing unfounded negative publicity for open access publishing in general. (Shen &
Björk, 2015, Abstract section)

210

In eight cases in the web documents the term “public access” was used as an alternative to open
access, occurring sometimes in direct response to the 2013 US Federal mandate that government
agencies engaged in research funding create a Public Access Plan:
The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) hereby directs each Federal agency
with over $100 million in annual conduct of research and development expenditures to
develop a plan to support increased public access to the results of research funded by the
Federal Government. This includes any results published in peer-reviewed scholarly
publications that are based on research that directly arises from Federal funds. (Holdren,
2013)
This government directive and the policies that flowed from it avoid the term “open access” in
favor of “public access.” They do this perhaps to distinguish this requirement from the
publishing model in which the author pays a fee for his or her material to be made openly
available, or to echo such positive terms as public domain, public good, or public library.
Finally, one of the references in the web documents to open access (in a user testimonial)
alluded to a trend that was observed in an analysis of users of the illegal Sci-Hub aggregation of
scholarly articles – that ease of use is of very high importance to busy academics: “we do have
access through our institution to various publications, but sometimes it is just too many hurdles
to jump over in order to obtain a publication. Open Access, on the other hand, provides easy
access to crucial publications ….” [ARL]. It is a reminder again that anything libraries can do to
ease the use of their online open access and subscription materials will find a ready audience.

211

Web Sites for IR Services: Technology Platform
More than 75% of IRs in the study used either DSpace or Digital Commons as their
technology platform, and it was not long before the researcher could tell the platform being used
after a perfunctory examination of the appearance of the web page (irrespective of whether the
site was from an ARL research library or an Oberlin Group liberal arts college). For example,
Digital Commons sites usually contained a consistent set of design elements including sections
showing total papers to date, total downloads, downloads in the past year, a featured paper of the
day, and a distinctive color-coded wheel showing works by discipline, that expanded to a more
detailed view when selected (see Figures 5.4 and 5.5).

Figure 5.4. ARL IR: ScholarlyCommons, University of Pennsylvania (2014)

212

Figure 5.5. Oberlin Group IR: CrossWorks, College of the Holy Cross (2014)

Other common elements often found on Digital Commons sites included a world map showing
downloads in real time, and an About Institutional Repositories page that comes as part of the
default design, pre-populated with the following language:
Institutional Repositories (IRs) bring together all of a University's research under one
umbrella, with an aim to preserve and provide access to that research. IRs are an
excellent vehicle for working papers or copies of published articles and conference
papers. Presentations, senior theses, and other works not published elsewhere can also be
published in the IR.
Such vendor-provided text guarantees that a site has something to say about the service and its
content. However, this web document was probably intended to be a generic starting point, and
refers to content only; it does not mention engagement with stakeholders, open access, copyright
issues, or the collaborative partners that make an IR possible on a campus. Indeed, like all IR
sites in these two study populations this “about the IR” statement describes the value and
purpose of the IR from the library’s perspective, and opens with very familiar library
213

terminology: the IR is concerned with preservation and access. It then goes on to define the
scope of that collection of materials. What it does not do – what no IRs in this study did – is to
open with a statement of the value and impact of the IR from the perspective of the faculty who
contribute the content or the global communities who benefit from its unencumbered access.
The descriptions of the IR services in this study are not fundamentally customer-focused; they do
not really answer the question “What will this do for me and my career or course of study?”; or
rather, if they are customer-focused, the customer is the library and the institution, not the faculty
member and the student.
While an institution using Digital Commons could add more content to the boilerplate
text of the provided About Institutional Repositories page, or replace it entirely, most sites were
sparing in doing this: many of the Digital Commons pages contained less than 500 words in
total, leading to the prevalence of this length across all sites (37% overall; 27% ARL; and 58.7%
Oberlin Group). Other institutions modified the About Institutional Repositories page
extensively, adding local information, mission statements, links to policies, and other
information (Syracuse University’s SURFACE was a good example). However, fifteen of the
Digital Commons IRs (predominantly Oberlin Group sites) made little or no emendation to the
boilerplate language of the About Institutional Repositories page, not even to remove the word
“University” if they were a liberal arts college. This situation is unchanged in 2017 for fourteen
of those fifteen sites, indicating that the reliance on a brief, vendor-provided description was not
a feature of the initial IR implementation, intended to be expanded later as the service matured.
It may also be an indication of ongoing library staff shortages for IRs, as these constraints were
referenced in the open comments at the end of the questionnaire (see Chapter Four: Open Ended
Comments).

214

DSpace sites were also similar in design from one institution to another, with a textheavy layout dominated by lists of communities (departments, centers, institutes, schools, and
labs, for example), recently added works, and subjects, and often containing little graphic
material other than logos. The DSpace software developers also provided a short boilerplate
description that displayed by default on the IR’s main page: “DSpace is a digital service that
collects, preserves, and distributes digital material. Repositories are important tools for
preserving an organization's legacy; they facilitate digital preservation and scholarly
communication.” This supplied text may be even more library-focused than the Digital
Commons equivalent, referring to “preservation” three times in 28 words, and using “scholarly
communication,” which has been challenged as a term that is used and understood by faculty and
students (Smith, 2011; Hawkins, 2015). Some or all of this supplied language appeared
routinely on DSpace sites examined in this study.
Design is subjective, of course, but in the researcher’s opinion, elegance of design was
not characteristic of DSpace sites, even though they were often rich in content. They often
looked austere when compared to Digital Commons sites, to the many professional journal sites
with which scholars are familiar, or to popular academic social networks such as Academia.edu
and ResearchGate. DSpace sites featured technical services such as RSS feeds on the home
page, but they placed less emphasis than Digital Commons sites on promotional elements,
including usage statistics (total papers, total downloads, downloads last year, downloads in the
past day, and global usage). There is an appropriate disinclination in academia for turning
scholarship into a popularity contest or for taking numbers of downloads as an indicator of
quality, but such opinions argue only against “Top Ten Downloads” lists, not against the
provision of overall service figures. Only 39% of ARL sites published usage statistics on their

215

IR sites (although some indicated that they shared statistics with authors regarding the author’s
own material). It is striking that 66.6% of the Oberlin Group IRs gave detailed usage
information as part of their public expression of the IR; this fact is partly attributable to their use
of the Digital Commons infrastructure, where public usage statistics are part of the default
design.
The preference of ARL institutions for DSpace (52% of sites) and of the Oberlin Group
for Digital Commons (65.2% of sites) may reflect their institutions’ relative abilities to engage
with open source software (OSS). There is a strong inclination among ARL libraries to use open
source software, as was evident from a 2014 survey of ARL members conducted by Thacker,
Knutson, and Dehmlow, in which “[74] of the 76 responding libraries (97%) report having
adopted open source software” (2014, p. 13). The most common use of open source software
reported was for an institutional repository, with 52 respondents (68%) deploying OSS for that
purpose (p. 13) (78% of the ARL institutions in this study use OSS for their IR). The IR was
also the most common project through which ARL programmers contributed code back to an
OSS project (38 respondents, or 50%) (p. 14). To explain the predilection for OSS, Thacker and
Knutson (2015) go so far as to draw a parallel between the American Library Association (ALA)
code of ethics (http://www.ala.org/ tools/ethics) and the terms of an open source license, as both
have as a central value the free sharing of information with all: “The core values of libraries and
the OSS movement are similar, suggesting that libraries should tend to favor the OSS model”
(Motivation section, para. 1). Adopting OSS allows for customization and the potential to serve
institutional needs in a more nuanced manner. A web document from one of the Oberlin Group
members to use OSS for its IR (16, or 34.8% of the study population) expressed this well:
“Digital Grinnell is committed to using open-source software … [that] will allow us to develop

216

new functions over time and to collaborate with a large community of other libraries, colleges,
and universities.” Engaging with an OSS community by taking part in the software’s
development is another form of library collaboration, in which there is the potential to
demonstrate collaborative leadership or to benefit from an awareness of its tenets. However, a
2017 Coalition for Networked Information strategic report sounds a more cautionary note about
OSS and IRs:
Going forward, library administrators need to focus more on how development is being
handled on some open source repository platforms and whether development agendas are
genuinely being driven by the strategic needs of the institutions or have become
dominated by the technical agenda of developers themselves. We should be asking
ourselves this question. It is easy to get captured by the agenda of frontline developers,
which can diverge from strategic priorities and goals. In addition, there can be
disconnects between the developers of the repository infrastructure and the librarians who
provide the outreach to the university community. (Concluding Thoughts section, para. 4)
A commitment to OSS development is less feasible for Oberlin Group libraries, which
have far fewer staff members than ARL libraries. Whatever their opinions may be about the
desirability of OSS, it is a less practical solution for a library that has few or no computer
programmers of its own. The promotional material from bepress, a commercially hosted
solution, makes explicit reference to this situation. Their web document titled Why Digital
Commons exhorts potential customers to “stop worrying about software and start doing the
campus outreach you’ve been meaning to,” promising that their “fully hosted software with
99.9%+ uptime means reliable service without any strain on your IT department” and promoting
a “lower cost of ownership: we handle all upgrades, training, and storage for you” (2017,

217

Scalable, Hosted, Fully Supported Technology section). The open comments on the survey cast
doubt on the notion above that the time saved on IR implementation will be used on promotion
and outreach: “We have no staff to devote to this. We try to fit it in but with staff cuts, it's
difficult” [Oberlin Group developer]. The comments also reflect a downside of a hosted
solution, which is that one is reliant on the host for implementation changes: “Ours is a hosted
solution which has slowed communication and implementation – getting responses has been
slow and curtailed some efforts to engage others” [Oberlin Group developer].
Web Sites for IR Services: Length of Operation
It is no surprise that institutional repositories appeared much earlier in ARL institutions
than in Oberlin Group ones: IRs were in large measure an invention of the North American
research library, with much of the early software development and promotion coming from ARL
member institutions. The IR’s heavy focus on research materials, especially academic journal
articles, may also have made them initially seem less central to the mission of a liberal arts
college, which often prioritizes undergraduate education and the student experience over
fundamental research.
Length of operation had an indistinct impact on most other aspects of the repository,
including size or technology platform. There are smaller IRs that are ten years old in both
groups, for example, and both the oldest and the newest ARL sites chose DSpace as a platform
(the same was true with Digital Commons as an infrastructure in the Oberlin Group institutions).
Service naming choices, however, showed that one pattern was affected by the passage of time in
both ARL and Oberlin Group institutions: between 2002-2014, there was a steady move away
from infrastructure-based naming (Space, Commons) and towards brand names that reflected the
institution.

218

Web Sites for IR Services: Size
Figures 4.1 and 4.2 showed IR size from smallest to largest for ARL and Oberlin Group
institutions. Both charts showed similar curves, albeit on different scales, with outliers at both
ends. Increased size does not necessarily correlate to greater success in attracting the content
most often associated with them, which is the scholarly output of the institution. The decision to
include or exclude student content, for example, has a large impact on total size, as does the
inclusion of coursework materials or research archives that may contain hundreds or thousands
of digital images. Inclusion of these types of content was a major contributor to the high item
count of the very largest ARL and Oberlin Group repositories.
Collaborative Leadership
Does IR Planning and Development Reveal Evidence of Collaborative Leadership?
Even though the term “collaborative leadership” did not appear in the web documents
studied here, this research makes clear that the concept was present in the planning and
development of institutional repositories in both ARL and Oberlin Group institutions. While the
questionnaire presented a more complete sense of the collaborative leadership traits that
contribute to the success of IRs (especially the traits Developing People and Mentoring and
Coaching) the public web documents that described these services also underscored the highly
collaborative nature of the undertaking.
It was noticeable, however, that the web documents had far fewer references to library
leadership roles than to collaborative partnerships. There was only a single case of a library
unequivocally asserting a leadership role for itself in the web documents: “As part of the
Libraries’ strategic plan to provide leadership in facilitating access to Holy Cross’s locally
created content….” The other examples of leadership reflected the IR’s role as a service that

219

made the university or college “a leader in research, teaching, and creativity.” The relative
absence of statements of library leadership in these IR web documents was surprising
considering the leadership role that libraries have taken in the development of IRs at both
universities and colleges. Libraries have been the most prominent voices in the campus
conversations about open access that often accompany the creation of an institutional repository.
Beyond the campus, the annual Open Access Week is organized by SPARC (an organization
created by ARL), and major library organizations including the American Library Association
(Open access to research, 2017), the Association of Research Libraries (Open access, 2017a),
and LIBER, the Association of European Research Libraries (Open access, 2017b), regularly and
consistently advocate for open access and institutional repositories. In addition, the literature
review in this study amply demonstrated the leadership role that staff from different areas of the
library have played in the creation of IRs (Baudoin & Branschosky, 2003; Lynch, 2003;
Cervone, 2004; Lynch & Lippincott, 2005; Dill & Palmer, 2005; Allard, Mack, & FeltnerReichert, 2005; Bailey et al., 2006; Markey et al., 2007). This is echoed in two of the open
comments on the questionnaire:
x

“No one had any interest in an IR here so the library filled the void” [Oberlin Group
director].

x

“I was not able to record the amazing leadership, collaborative skills, team building,
and outreach that characterize some individuals involved with the IR. In many ways,
we succeed because one or two people break away from the unorganized,
opportunistic, often critical, and sometimes hostile library leadership (with respect to
IR)” [ARL developer].

220

The second comment locates that leadership specifically in the staff and not the library
administration, serving as a reminder that collaborative leadership can occur across the
institution. Even though the library directors were more positive in their answers to the survey
questions than the developers, this comment also underscores the fact that none of these groups
are uniform in their thinking, and library directors can be perceived to have “hostile” opinions
about IRs as well as enthusiastic ones.
It is possible that the historical reluctance of libraries to describe their activities generally
in terms of leadership, and to talk instead about their management, administrative, and service
functions, was at play here (see Chapter One, Library Leadership section, and Chapter Two,
Collaborative Leadership: History section). Libraries clearly have an opportunity to promote
more effectively the campus leadership they exert around issues of scholarly publishing and the
public promotion of their institution’s research output. If this is happening on campus, it was not
evident from these IR documents.
Which Collaborative Leadership Traits are Present in IRs?
To varying degrees, survey respondents perceived the presence of all six of the leadership
traits derived from the leadership teaching materials created by the Turning Point Leadership
Development National Excellence Collaborative. There was a relatively high degree of
agreement with the questions asking about the presence of the six collaborative leadership traits:
the lowest mean for any of these questions was 3.2, on a scale from 1 (never) to 5 (always).
However, the content analysis revealed considerably more information about four of the six traits
– Assessing the Environment for Collaboration, Creating Clarity, Building Trust, and Sharing
Power – than about the remaining two: Developing People and Self-Reflection. This is not a
surprise, given the nature of the web documents being analyzed, which were public-facing

221

descriptions of a scholarly service, and not the sort of documents that are likely to contain more
inward-looking accounts of professional development and growth for the librarians running the
services. Academic libraries certainly take mentoring and professional development seriously,
however, and the literature shows this, going back at least as far as the ARL publications Staff
Development (1981) and Professional Development in ARL Libraries (1982). The 2016
publication Self-Identified Library, Archives, and Museum Professional Development Needs
(Drummond & Skinner) underscored the degree to which librarians are part of learning
organizations: “a majority (69%) of 2,480 survey question respondents indicated having a high
level of interest in continuing education and professional development” (p. 6).
One observation emerged from several comments in the survey, regarding the assumption
in the questionnaires that IRs were team efforts. Several respondents, all from ARL institutions,
stated that there was not necessarily a formal project team in charge of their IR:
x

“The planning and implementation of the IR at [my institution] has been and
continues to be an informal process … we don’t have an IR committee or even an IR
librarian … the people who are involved in this … are those who want to be”

x

“Different ad hoc groups are formed as needed, making it hard to answer very well
some of your ‘group dynamics’ questions”

x

“Many of these questions are difficult to answer as there is really no defined ‘team’"

x

“Bless you, you think there's an actual team of people working on the IR at my
institution”

This informality of organization is surprising for an undertaking that is university-wide in scope,
publicly visible, and represents a long-term commitment to faculty to curate their intellectual
output.

222

The open comments revealed other real-world complexities that did not always fit in with
the assumptions behind the survey questions about planning and implementation, which assumed
a progression of events and a consistency of personnel that does not always exist.
x

“The planning and implementation of the IR were not single events. We involved
different groups at different times; for example, to support the OA policy, to support
ETDs, to support data management, etc.” [ARL director]

x

“The wording of this survey seems to imply that there is one dedicated consistent
team of people that work over time, and over the years with each other.” [ARL
developer]

x

“I was not involved in the planning or implementation because I was not here when
that happened. My predecessor was very involved in both” [ARL director].

The IR too was not created ex nihilo, and its development or reception was sometimes influenced
by earlier work:
x

“There is some faculty burnout over several failed attempts to create campus-wide
[Digital Asset Management System] in the past” [Oberlin Group developer]

x

“It also incorporated a pre-existing repository for applied econ[omics] (now almost
20 years old)” [ARL director]

x

“The IR for faculty content, open access, campus collaborations, etc. was a happy
afterthought. We needed a space to put some content when our consortially-supported
platform was defunded” [ARL director]

The following paragraphs discuss perceptions about the six traits in more detail.
1. Assessing the environment for collaboration: understanding the context for
change before you act. The web documents revealed that librarians involved in IRs had a well-

223

developed sense of the characteristics of the institutions they served. The organization of the IR
often mirrored the schools, departments, and centers that made up the university or college, and
it allowed for the increasingly interdisciplinary nature of scholarly work. IR services sometimes
drew attention to changing institutional realities, such as new mandates that require the sharing
of publications generated from federally funded research, and the IR’s role as a solution to them.
These federal mandates impact large research universities more than liberal arts colleges,
affecting many more faculty and researchers, which helps explain the focus on this topic by the
ARL IRs.
Assessing the Environment was one of only two sets of questions (out of the six sets
inquiring about leadership traits) where no participant responded 1 (never). The other trait for
which this was true was Sharing Power and Influence. However, the literature review drew
attention to the fact that needs assessments were rarely conducted prior to launching an IR,
which does give one pause about the high levels of confidence shown here that librarians really
understood stakeholder needs when implementing an IR. There was a statistically significant
difference between ARL directors (4.0286 mean) and ARL developers (3.4324 mean) when
answering the question “The people working on the Institutional Repository at my institution
assess the needs of the community,” which raises the question as to what interactions or events
might library leaders experience (or assume) that IR developers do not? Perhaps those closest to
the day-to-day implementation of the service are less confident that the needs and concerns of
the community, especially the faculty, were well understood. On the other hand, the developers
were still scoring 3.3 and 3.4 on a scale of 1-5, showing a reasonable level of confidence that
these behaviors were occurring.

224

2. Creating clarity: visioning and mobilizing; defining shared values and engaging
people in positive action. This was the lowest-scoring section overall, and the standard
deviations show a broad spread of opinion for each of the three questions. This section yielded
the only other statistically significant difference of opinion, again between ARL directors
(4.0278 mean) and ARL developers (3.3889 mean), in response to Q2.1: The People Working on
the Institutional Repository at My Institution Explore the Diverse Aspirations Among Community
Stakeholders. This suggests again that developers felt more reservations than did ARL directors
about whether the IR teams fully understood the aspirations of community stakeholders.
Developers were confident that their IR team could “describe a vision for our community
that is achievable” (Table 4.17), with means of 3.4444 and 3.8000, but had greater reservations
about the degree to which libraries succeeded in communicating that vision broadly (Table 4.18;
means of 3.3333 and 3.2000) and achieving buy-in (Table 4.19; means of 3.2857 and 3.3333). It
is tempting to speculate that the uneven success of IRs, at least if measured by the amount of
content they attract, may be more visible to those who run the IR than to those who run the
libraries in which an IR is only one of many component elements. This in turn could make
developers more aware of the need to communicate the vision more effectively, and to achieve
greater commitment.
Some of the web documents reviewed in this study show an effort to engage contributors
in the vision of the IR by appealing to their aspirations for professional advancement: “When
you deposit your work in [the IR] it becomes visible to colleagues around the world [and] higher
visibility leads to higher rates of citation and impact.” This sentiment was not a dominant theme
across the IRs, however, and more could be done to underscore the impact and value of
engagement with IR services in terms that make sense to the faculty who contribute content (see

225

also the Developing People section for this theme, later in this chapter). More prevalent in the
web documents were statements about the IR’s impact that spoke to institutional, not individual,
ambitions to promote research prowess: “[The IR] provides open and permanent access to [the
institution’s] scholarship thereby ensuring its wide dissemination and increased visibility on the
web.” The documents also referred repeatedly to the mission and vision of the institution,
although they do considerably less to promote a vision to the individual content owners, who are
the constituency who really need to be persuaded, and engaged in positive action.
3. Building trust: creating safe places for developing shared purpose and action.
Terms such as “long term,” “permanent,” “safe,” and “secure” came up repeatedly in the web
documents, in phrases such as “repositories are important tools for preserving an organization's
legacy; they facilitate digital preservation and scholarly communication.” This language reflects
the fact that libraries themselves are often described as enduring spaces that safeguard
information over time. One ARL library cited the fact that their IR had already operated for a
decade as testament to their longevity of service and commitment to permanence, and several
libraries pointed out that their IRs achieved additional stability by being part of larger consortia.
The libraries’ technological expertise and their adherence to industry standards were also offered
up as trust-inducing qualities, and several DSpace institutions reproduced text in their IR’s
description from a 2009 press release announcing the merger of two user groups, Fedora
Commons and the DSpace Foundation, to create DuraSpace, which “will provide leadership and
innovation in open source technologies for global communities who manage, preserve, and
provide access to digital content.” Aiming somewhat lower, in an appeal to data safety, one ARL
institution pointed out in a practical manner that its repository was “safer than keeping copies of
your work on a collection of thumb drives.”

226

The literature suggests that simply stating a preservation ambition may not be enough to
persuade faculty to deposit content, however. Kim (2011) concluded from a survey and set of
interviews with faculty that “merely explaining to faculty that IRs would preserve scholarly work
is by no means an effective way to increase faculty participation in IRs” (p. 252). To build trust
with faculty, Kim advocated that IR developers need to “(1) understand the preservation needs of
an institution and stakeholders; (2) establish a preservation policy; (3) develop a business plan
for preservation” (p. 252). This researcher did not see evidence of a formal preservation policy
or business plan connected to any of the IR sites examined here, although one site stressed the
institution’s commitment to the repository service itself, which may go some way towards
looking like a sustainability plan: “[The institution] is committed to ‘developing a system for
making … research accessible in … open access repositories’ and [the IR] is part of this
strategy.”
In looking at the literature on trust in librarian-faculty relationships, Phelps and Campbell
(2012) examined 304 articles that discussed librarian/faculty partnerships (p. 15) and isolated
thirteen that they could analyze using a model of relationship marketing that measured trust and
relationship commitment (pp. 13-14), and that “furnished specific elements of relationships that
contribute to good collaborative partnerships” (p. 17). They found many examples of
collaborative partnerships between librarians and faculty that were successful because they were
based on a joint commitment to the outcomes of the partnership, shared goals, and
communication (pp. 16-17). They do offer a caution that is germane to the promotion of IRs by
librarians to faculty, however: “Marketing a service … presents an ulterior motive that could be
interpreted as less than positive” (p. 16), and they speculate that “outreach to … faculty has taken
on the tenor of enterprise versus that of relationship building. Often this effort toward expansion

227

is coupled with frustration with faculty who do not wish to partner with librarians” (p. 16). One
of the open comments spoke to the marketing challenges well: “The IR remains a work in
progress even after many years. We have had strong acceptance/engagement from some faculty,
and minimal response from others. It requires continuous education and outreach to sustain and
expand engagement” [ARL director]. This observation is mirrored in a 2017 Coalition for
Networked Information report on IR strategies: “Many institutions commented on their efforts in
outreach and education to encourage submission of materials to their repository. One participant
lamented that without continual marketing, it is hard to sustain faculty interest in depositing their
materials in the repository” (Institutional Perspectives section, para. 8). Library marketing of
open access and IR services does not seem to create stronger trust relationships with faculty, or
indicate that librarians and faculty are working together to build something to which both parties
are equally committed.
While the web documents did not reveal anything about trust within the teams that built
the IRs, the survey data certainly did, with strong support for the existence of safe, trusted, teams
where all stakeholders could exercise collaborative leadership. The ARL library directors scored
question 3.1 highly – The people working on the Institutional Repository at my institution build
communication processes that make it safe for people to say what is on their minds – with 14
responding 5=always (4.0286 mean). The developers were less effusive in this section, with the
ARL developers were noticeably less sure (3.2647 mean) than their Oberlin Group counterparts
(3.8333 mean) about question 3.3, which asked if collaborative leadership opportunities “were
open to all stakeholders” (Table 4.22).

228

4. Sharing power and influence: developing the synergy of people, organizations,
and communities to accomplish more. This section is one of two (the other being Assessing
the Environment) which received no 1=never ratings on the survey, and it makes clear that there
is a high level of confidence in the power sharing and distributed leadership displayed in these
collaborative services. ARL directors were particularly emphatic that “leadership is displayed by
various members of the group.” This was one of only four questions for which the most common
response was 5=always, and in fact it received more scores of 5 (17 out of 37) than any other
question in the survey, leading to one of the highest means (4.1111). The indication clearly is
that ARL directors feel strongly that power and influence is shared, and all respondents in this
section echoed the sentiment. It may be that the topics explored in this section -- of shared
leadership, shared power, and openness to being influenced -- are closest to the way librarians
aspire to work together.
5. Developing people: committing to the development of people as your key asset
through mentoring and coaching. Discussions of staff mentoring or the development of staff
skills, absent in the web documents, are more likely to be found in internal library
documentation, such as project reports, annual evaluations, or justifications for professional
development funding. What one would expect to see in the web documents in greater abundance
are statements about the positive impact that the IR can have on the development of a scholar’s
career, through the global public exposure to her or his work. There were plenty of statements
about greater visibility of one’s work, but only one slightly hesitant indication that this higher
visibility might translate for an individual into any career benefits within the academy:
“participating in [the IR] contributes to the university's research and outreach missions – a point
you might want to emphasize in your promotion and tenure (P&T) dossier.” There were no

229

explicit links to university or college statements describing how engagement with the IR might
be rewarded; it appears that the enthusiasm on the part of the senior administration for promoting
their institution’s research excellence does not translate into rewards or recognition for individual
faculty members who embrace the IR and open access to scholarship.
In some studies, junior faculty have expressed concerns that open access publishing will
negatively affect their chances of promotion (Cullen & Chawner, 2011). Concerns about open
access publishing and IRs can even be seen among librarians and faculty in library and
information science (LIS) departments, a faculty group who might reasonably be assumed to
support sharing their scholarship and be motivated to do it. Peekhaus and Proferes (2015)
surveyed all North American LIS faculty members in programs accredited by the American
Library Association to gauge their attitudes towards open access and received a 27% response
rate (pp. 644-645). They found that submission of work to IRs “is not widespread among LIS
faculty, with only 35% having deposited an article and 24% having deposited some other
research output … during the year prior to the survey” (p. 646). They found hesitation about
open access publication: “untenured LIS faculty (37%) are more likely than tenured faculty
(12%) to agree to some extent that publishing their work in open-access journals may adversely
affect their careers” (p. 648) and noted “some disquietude among LIS faculty about how tenure
and promotion committees would assess open-access publications” (p. 648). These fears are deep
set in academia, especially in the humanities (Guernsey, 1997), although a recent Coalition for
Networked Information report suggests that the IR may have benefits to the humanities by
playing a role in the institutional acceptance of digital humanities scholarship:
For faculty aggressively embracing DH work, and producing new genres of scholarly
output that don’t fit within the existing publishing (and hence stewardship and

230

preservation) systems, the ability to shift access and preservation of their work into an
institutional setting is essential to legitimizing this work. (Institutional Perspectives
section, para. 3)
A 2014 article examining digital scholarship and promotion processes in 27 US institutions
(predominantly liberal arts colleges and including 15 of the Oberlin Group colleges in this study)
draws attention to the importance of institutional guidelines for promotion to encourage such
submission. This article concluded that “incorporation of … guidelines into campus tenure and
promotion processes appears to remain inchoate” (Bartanen, Need for Tenure and Promotion
Guidelines section, para. 1). Her survey of 27 institutions did not find “any evaluation,
promotion, or tenure policies specific to digital humanities or digital scholarship” (Need for
Tenure and Promotion Guidelines section, para. 2). As Kim (2011, p. 248) noted, “Borgman
pointed out that establishing policies that reward scholars who try out new forms of scholarly
publishing would motivate their participation in OA publishing and self-archiving in IRs” (2007,
p. 196-197; p. 225; pp. 239-240). Jain (2011) also highlighted the lack of incentives that
scholars have to engage with open access and the “challenge to promote the benefits IRs offer
whilst allaying stakeholders’ concerns” (p. 132).
A 2006 study of faculty by the University of California’s Office of Scholarly
Communication outlined the problem clearly:
Assistant Professors tend to feel the most constrained by impositions of the tenure and
promotion system…. Faculty appear to consider the act of publishing itself to be
sufficient for accomplishing their goals. Once an article or monograph has been
published (presumably by a publisher with a solid reputation), scholars are less concerned
about the process of dissemination, and whether its impact is measured directly rather

231

than via the surrogate of the publication venue. In large measure, this lack of concern is
due to the tenure and promotion system, which rewards publication over broader
dissemination. (p. 5)
Kim (2011) indicates the impact that this situation has on IRs: “compared to assistant professors,
associate professors are 2.78 times more likely to self-archive in IRs…. Tenured professors are
relieved from tenure concerns so they may be more willing to experiment with new publishing
models, such as IRs, than untenured professors” (p. 250). However, there are clear signs that if
institutional encouragement to submit to the IR were tied to promotion and tenure, then it would
be successful: “improved prospects for tenure and promotion were found to motivate
significantly more untenured (82%) than tenured faculty (34%) to [deposit in an IR]” (p. 647).
Abrizah, Hilmi, and Kassim (2015) asked, “How can an inter-institutional repository for
an LIS scholarly community be useful and attractive enough to be incorporated into their work
routines?” (p. 735). They discovered resistance to depositing in an IR based on fears of
plagiarism, a reluctance to share, and concerns about workload, along with enthusiasm about
greater visibility. There was little indication that the LIS professionals surveyed expected any
career benefit from public access through an IR (pp. 738-739), another sign of the perceived gap
between the institution’s desire to promote research expertise and their willingness to recognize
this activity in faculty promotion and tenure processes. These findings suggest that there may be
an opportunity for the library to broker campus conversations about promotion policies in these
areas. Without senior university or college leadership supporting the values of open access and
the institutional curation of scholarship, and being willing to reward (or at least recognize) these
activities at the point of tenure and promotion, it is difficult to see how progress can be made in
this area.

6. Self-reflection: personal continuous quality improvement; understanding your
own leadership, engaging others. The comparatively large number of skipped questions and
“No opinion” responses in both the Developing People (Tables 4.26-4.28) and Self-Reflection
(Tables 4.29-4.32) sections suggest that there was less confidence in these topic areas than in
others such as Building Trust or Sharing Power. It is not likely that those surveyed were
impatient to finish and started to skip questions as the questionnaire progressed; these were short
surveys, and the length of time to completion was estimated conservatively and announced at the
beginning of the instrument. The literature also challenges the seemingly commonsense notion
that shorter surveys are inherently better or more likely to succeed (Bogen, 1997; Rolstad, Adler,
& Rydén, 2011), suggesting instead that the respondent’s interest in the content and topic is more
important to completion than length.
Is there any difference in the perception of collaborative leadership traits between ARL
and Oberlin Group members, or between directors and developers?
Of the four groups – ARL and Oberlin Group directors, and ARL and Oberlin Group
developers – the ARL directors were generally more positive in their rankings across the seven
survey questions that were scored on a Likert scale. They posted the highest means for five of
the seven questions, and the second highest (after the Oberlin Group developers) on the
remaining two (Q5.1 on coaching and mentoring, and Q6.1 on recognizing personal impact on
group dynamics). The combined means of the directors outscored the combined means of the
developers on six of the seven questions.
The directors, especially those from Oberlin Group institutions, were most heavily
involved in the planning of the IR service (Table 4.37); however, the directors were considerably
less involved in the implementation of the IR (Table 4.38), with less than half of ARL directors

233

answering yes to this question. As one ARL director noted in the open comments: “I had some
involvement in policy, but did not participate in actual implementation – there's a management
group for that.” It may be that the more positive perceptions of collaborative leadership
displayed by the directors in the survey represent their expectations (or aspirations) for
collaborative working patterns, while the developers’ somewhat lower scores reflect what
happened in actuality during implementation.
As previously noted, the directors had a more positive opinion generally than the
developers on almost all questions, and ARL directors tended to score questions higher than
Oberlin Group directors. The outlier question was Q 5.1, The people working on the Institutional
Repository at my institution take seriously the responsibility for coaching and mentoring others
during this process. This is the only question for which developers (combined mean of 7.986)
registered a (slightly) higher score than directors (combined mean of 7.9159). It is tempting to
conjecture that developers, who are more involved in the implementation of the IR, observe or
experience more coaching and mentoring during the day-to-day work of running the repository,
which would account for their higher confidence in the presence of this collaborative leadership
trait.
The only differences between directors and developers that rose to the level of statistical
significance were on Q1.1, which dealt with assessing the needs of the community, and Q2.1,
which dealt with exploring diverse aspirations among community members. The directors were
much more confident on both questions (means of 4.0286 and 4.0278, respectively) than
developers (means of 3.4324 and 3.3889).

234

Does perceived success of the IR vary between ARL and Oberlin Group members or
between directors and developers?
The developers’ responses fell lower on the scale than the directors, here as elsewhere.
All parties felt less confident regarding success in attracting content from faculty (Q 7.1) than
they did regarding success in enhancing the reputation of the institution (Q 7.3). All parties felt
very confident about the IR strengthening collaborations with the library (Q 7.4). Those running
institutional repositories could learn something about success from the levels of enthusiasm and
engagement that faculty report feeling with ResearchGate, Academia.edu, and even Sci-Hub.
Regarding the latter, Crissinger (2017) framed the arrival of Sci-Hub as a teachable moment on
campus. She called it “a case study for asking our faculty and students larger questions about
responsibility and sustainable change” (p. 86), and proposed that
An inherent goal in educating our communities about a guerilla approach to open access
is to teach them about other avenues for openness, expose the complexities of our broken
systems, and provide an alternative view of what scholarly publishing and researcher
workflows could look like. (p. 86)
Faculty have adopted ResearchGate and Academia.edu in part because these sites are easy to use
and material is available quickly. Ease of use is a challenge that libraries can rise to with their
IRs, but speed of publication is more difficult. Libraries feel a responsibility to check copyright
and licensing status before posting materials, which these academic social networking sites do
not, as is evidenced by the legal challenges they have faced (Clarke, 2013). Publishers have
given academic institutions broader legal permissions to host copies of published content than
they would give to a commercial entity such as Academia.edu, and in this may lie an opportunity
for the IR to be the open access article location of record to which these academic social media

235

sites would connect: “If Academia.edu et al. begin linking to institutional and subject
repositories instead of hosting PDFs, this will likely increase rates of self-archiving if such
archiving becomes a necessary preliminary step for some forms of sharing” (Clarke, 2013).
ResearchGate and Academia.edu also provide contributors with a personalized page that
highlights their work and career. IR software vendors and librarians have long realizing the
importance of a scholar’s profile page as an encouragement for faculty to deposit content:
bepress, the company that sells the Digital Commons IR platform, has had a faculty profile
system called SelectedWorks since 2004, and Foster and Gibbons proposed in 2005 that a
“Researcher Page” was a key component in attracted faculty submissions to an IR (Enhancing
the IR to Meet the Needs of Faculty Users section, para. 3). More recently, Wu (2015) reported
that the creation of an “online Faculty Scholarship Register … dramatically improved the
recruitment of faculty publications” at her institution (Current Practice section, para. 2). Such
faculty profile systems are becoming more common in universities because they
make it easier for faculty to highlight and make accessible their work to a global
audience, for students to learn more about their professors and advisers, for university
administrators to track and understand the impact of scholarly outputs from programs and
grants, and for the media, industry, and the general public to find university experts,
among other things. (Givens, Macklin & Mangiafico, 2017, p. 236)
As with IRs, these profile systems often involve the library heavily, and are another chance to
engage with the faculty and the institution around issues of open access and scholarly
communication. They are also another service area that requires collaborative leadership skills
to ensure success. As Givens, Macklin, and Mangiafico (2017) conclude: “these projects
highlight the potential benefits of collaboration between librarians, information technologists,

236

and faculty to facilitate a successful implementation. Each brings an understanding of a piece of
the greater whole” (p. 253).
Opinions varied considerably about Q 7.2 – Our Institutional Repository has been
successful in promoting Open Access at our institution – which recorded the lowest mean for the
entire survey from the Oberlin Group developers (2.7333), and the only mean in the entire
survey to dip below 3.0. Seven participants recorded a score of 1=never for this question, more
than double the number in this category for any other question. In the open comments, one ARL
director wrote of promoting open access: “this is a hopelessly low priority issue on our campus.”
Does the perception of collaborative involvement with stakeholder communities vary
between ARL and Oberlin Group members or between directors and developers?
As 2017’s Rethinking Institutional Repository Strategies report underscored, “librarians
worked with a wide variety of institutional partners in developing their repository strategy.
These partners included the information technology unit, the Vice President (VP) for Research
office, the university public relations office, and the university press” (Coalition for Networked
Information, Institutional Perspectives section, para. 13). Members of both study populations
reported similar views, indicating engagement across all the groups that the survey queried them
about, typically ranking librarian partners most highly, non-library computing/IT staff and senior
campus administrators (Provost, Deans, etc.) either just above or just below faculty engagement,
and student involvement lower than faculty involvement. Surprisingly, the ARL directors and
developers thought students were consulted in planning and implementation more than did their
counterparts in the Oberlin Group, despite the strong undergraduate focus of these liberal arts
colleges, where the literature review showed that students are more likely to be contributors to
IRs than at ARL institutions. When asked about faculty by discipline – science, social science,

237

and humanities – there was in all but one case an agreement that the humanities were most
involved (or equally involved with one of the other groups) in both planning and
implementation. This is a curious finding in one regard, as the literature shows that the
humanities are less likely to contribute content to IRs than other disciplines. They are, however,
often heavy users of both the physical and electronic library collections and services, and may
therefore be familiar collaborators in the planning of new endeavors.
There is also a suggestion that the collaborative involvement with stakeholders was more
a feature of the planning of the IR services, as opposed to its implementation:
x

“Faculty were involved with the development of our open access policy and have
collaborated on several projects involving our institutional repository, but have not
been directly involved in IR planning and implementation efforts.” [ARL developer]

x

“The library has sought input from faculty in designing parts of the IR but overall the
planning and implementation process has been left to the library staff.” [Oberlin
Group developer]

x

“The one faculty member involved in the planning was the chair of one of the
standing faculty committees involved. But the real logistical work of the
implementation was handled entirely by library staff.” [Oberlin Group developer]

The survey did not ask about assessment of IR services, but to the degree that such evaluative
inquiry is happening, one would expect that faculty involvement would be more present there, as
is hinted at in one comment: “Faculty involvement is peripheral in planning stage, then
formalized as member of ongoing implementation team” [Oberlin Group developer].

238

Conclusion
IRs are formulaic and imitative in their appearance and use of language, and in these
study populations they clustered heavily around two technology platforms: DSpace for ARL
institutions and Digital Commons for Oberlin Group institutions. IRs are growing steadily in
size and number, but there is only a weak relationship between their size and their age, with
choices about type of content more likely to affect the former than the latter. The survey
revealed a perception that there was a genuine attempt to engage stakeholders broadly; this was
less clear in reading the IR web documents, where the prevailing sense was of a service whose
value to its constituents was sometimes assumed to be largely self-evident. Despite the
quotations excerpted in this study, there was too often an absence of any significant attempt to
promote the IR or publicize its impact beyond a brief commentary on its importance, a note
about the types of content it contained, and (sometimes) the provision of download statistics.
There were exceptions to the perceived lack of promotional material aimed at authors; generally,
however, the sites in this sample had more to say about their alignment with institutional or
library mission and the collaborative partnerships that sustained them than about their scholarly
impact.
The survey results showed that the six traits investigated in the survey were present in IR
planning and implementation, although directors and developers thought they were present in
different degrees. Nonetheless, the study populations did not exhibit radically differing
perceptions on the leadership present in the work of designing and running an IR service, the
success they were having on campus, or they challenges they faced in attracting content and
engaging faculty on topics such as open access.

Chapter Six
CONCLUSION

The Institutional Repository
Institutional repositories are now firmly established in the service portfolios of North
American university and college libraries. By July 2014, 146 of the 204 libraries (71.6%) in the
Association of Research Libraries and the Oberlin Group offered repository infrastructures that
archived and shared material produced at their institutions. IRs appeared more recently in liberal
arts colleges than in universities, but in both colleges and universities there has been a steady
growth in the number of IRs since the first services launched in 2002. Contemporary IRs hold a
narrower range of content types than was originally predicted, however, consisting mostly of
scholarly articles, books, dissertations, and theses; they hold far fewer educational materials,
videos, institutional records, and creative works than imagined at their genesis in the earlier
2000s (Johnson, 2002, Scholarly Content section, para. 1; Lynch, 2003, p. 331; Jones, 2006, pp.
12-15). To date, their impact has been less profound than originally predicted too, both to the
reputation of the institution (Crow, 2002, p. 16-17; Swan, 2008, p. 15), and to the library (Crow,
2002, p. 21). They have had little positive impact on faculty promotion and tenure to date.
The IR’s core ambition – the free sharing of research and other scholarly materials online
– is a foundational use case of the Internet and the World Wide Web (King & Chvany, 1972;
Berners-Lee, 1989), and the IR is therefore part of a long-held desire to grant public access to
networked academic information. IRs also respond to a concern for the long-term survival of
digital research. Publishers and publications come and go, but in the print world the scholarship
they produced stayed on the library shelves, under the library’s curatorial control, long after the

247

publisher was gone. Much of the world’s published digital scholarship resides only on the
servers of commercial publishers, who may lack the will or ability to offer the very long-term
preservation that a library traditionally can provide. IR development, then, is driven in part by
the ambitions of libraries to curate and share the scholarly record, and in part by the desire of
institutional leadership to promote the research and pedagogical excellence of their university or
college.
From their beginning, IRs have been seen by libraries as a scholarly communications
infrastructure that can challenge the practices of commercial publishers, whose ever-increasing
prices – especially for electronic academic journals – are straining library budgets. IRs are a
response to the opportunity that the internet gives to universities both to create scholarship and to
publish it online, without restrictions. However, the early predictions that IRs and open access
publishing would seriously disrupt the scholarly communications industry (Crow, 2002, p. 4,
Johnson, 2002, Conclusion section) have not come to fruition in the fifteen years since the first
IRs were founded. In fact, some commercial scholarly publishers have simply embraced open
access publishing as another revenue stream, with open access fees being paid by authors (or
their institutions) prior to publication, allowing articles to be freely accessible from the
publishers’ sites. The rise of author publication payments quickly led to the rise of unscrupulous
online entities who charge an author fee but provide little in the way of traditional publishing
services such as peer reviewing, copy-editing, design, or marketing, and run online journals that
bear only a superficial resemblance to a scholarly publication. Even apart from the taint of these
so-called “predatory” open access publishers, faculty have expressed mixed feelings about the
concept of open access publishing that is central to many IRs and heavily supported by libraries.
It is an activity for which faculty members are rarely rewarded, and it may still lack prestige

248

among their peers.
IRs, then, are library led services, and were often driven by strongly held library values
that were not necessarily market-tested in their user communities. It would be difficult to make
the case that the IR was a library response to a groundswell of need expressed by faculty authors
clamoring en masse for a solution to a flawed scholarly publishing model, or particularly worried
about the long-term curation of their digital scholarship. The IR did not (and perhaps still does
not) solve a problem that university and college faculty believe that they have. IRs also compete
with repositories of digital scholarship that are organized by discipline, which may be seen by
faculty to be more prestigious (e.g. arXiv), and with new academic social media sites that are
more feature-rich (e.g. ResearchGate). IRs may even have to compete with the illegal Sci-Hub
site that is gaining a reputation for comprehensiveness and convenience of use, even among
users who have legitimate access to the publisher content that Sci-Hub aggregates, with one
recent observer calling the service “the world’s de facto open-access research library”
(Bohannon, 2016, It's a Sci-Hub World section, para. 2).
The IR web pages examined in this research often lacked significant service descriptions
that promoted the value of sharing research outcomes and other educational materials globally.
The survey data confirmed this, finding that both library directors and developers were less
confident about their IR’s success in promoting open access and in attracting faculty content than
in enhancing the academic reputation of the institution, or (especially) strengthening
collaborations with the library (Tables 4.33-4.36). The issues surrounding digital preservation,
public access to research outputs, or the economics of electronic journal publishing, are not wellunderstood by faculty (as central as they are to library thinking and values). Too often, faculty
remain unaware of the existence of the IR in their institution and the opportunities it presents,

249

although the trend towards organization-specific brand names for IR services may help with
marketing efforts. A 2017 strategic report on IRs from the Coalition for Networked Information
gave some hope that there is a growing awareness of the need to give more attention to design
and marketing of these services, just as a professional publisher or a commercial repository
would do: “university PR/marketing/recruitment/government relations organizations are
becoming important partners and stakeholders in IR programs. Showcasing faculty expertise to
the external world can be a very important function” (Institutional Perspectives section, para.
20).
The IR presents a real opportunity for the library to exert campus leadership around the
issues for which the repository offers a solution, such as the preservation of the scholarly record,
alternate economies of scholarly publishing, the democratization of knowledge, or the promotion
of individual and institutional excellence. The literature shows that libraries are leading the
practical aspects of IR development, but too often they are not presenting themselves as campus
thought leaders on issues that affect academia broadly (judging, at least, by their IR web
documents). They could be, especially if they can use terminology that does not confuse users.
The literature cited here indicated that terms such as “institutional repository” and “scholarly
communications” were not well understood outside the library (alongside such time-honored and
confusing library terms as “monographs” and “finding aids,” which users tend to know as
“books” and “guides”). There is an opportunity for libraries to promote the long-term curation
and safeguarding of a scholar’s academic legacy, or to provide online tools that can manipulate
digital data, or discover new collaborators based on an analysis of publication records. Libraries
could certainly add more content describing such benefits and services to their IR sites without
overwhelming the user: most IR websites are terse, with 66 (66%) of ARL and 40 (86.96%) of

250

Oberlin Group web documents analyzed in this research containing less than 1,000 words.
As they mature, IRs have the opportunity to become a leading part of a broader set of
service offerings on campus that are focused on library publishing, open scholarship, digital
curation, and research management. As noted in a 2017 strategic report on IRs, there is “a clear
path of evolution in architectural thinking, moving from the IR as platform to IR as a service to
IR as a bundle of related services” (Coalition for Networked Information, Institutional
Perspectives section, para. 27). There are evolving connections between IRs, dataset archives,
and faculty profile systems such as Pure (https://www.elsevier.com/solutions/pure/) and VIVO
(http://vivoweb.org/). Presenting the IR as part of a collection of related services may be more
compelling to faculty authors and to the users who benefit from public access to scholarly
materials; this approach has the potential to attract faculty interest, serve institutional needs, and
build a global user community for IR content.
Collaborative Leadership
Library leadership is central to institutional repository planning and implementation.
There was not a single example in this study of an IR that did not include the library as a lead
participant. The leadership displayed in IR development was collaborative in nature and the
survey in particular showed that this collaboration rises above simple collegial behavior and
demonstrates, to varying degrees, all six of the characteristics of collaborative leadership that
were articulated in this research: assessing the environment for collaboration; creating clarity
(visioning and mobilizing); building trust; sharing power and influence; developing people
(mentoring and coaching); and self-reflection. Future IR leaders would be well advised to
recognize the importance of such collaborative behavior throughout the planning and
implementation of an IR, which needs a shared vision between planners and content providers

251

(usually academic faculty). The survey showed that the collaborative leadership traits of
“developing people” and “self-reflection” are ones that these libraries were less mindful of in
their IR planning processes; these behaviors could be examined further to see if they would be
beneficial to repository planning. Nonetheless, both the Oberlin Group and the ARL participants
showed a high degree of agreement on the presence of a range of collaborative leadership traits
in the planning and execution of IR services.
Further Research
This research can serve as the basis for future studies on institutional repositories and
library leadership traits. Broadening the focus of this research to include institutions from
outside North America would make it possible to determine if there are any appreciable
similarities or differences within or between international study populations. Such a study could
examine variations between these US and Canadian findings and those from a European
perspective, for example, or compare them with IRs from the developing world. 1 The Directory
of Open Access Repositories (OpenDOAR) has records of sufficient scope and accuracy to
derive an international selection of IRs. 2 This study’s foray into the use of OpenDOAR data
(Chapter Five, Web Sites for IR Services: Terminology section) showed how useful this source
can be. For example, downloading all the titles of IRs as listed in OpenDOAR allowed the
researcher to test whether the relative popularity of certain terms in service names was in
keeping with international trends.

1

To concentrate on the developing world, however, a researcher would first have to define these countries, as there
is not a firm definition in the United Nations (Khokhar and Serajuddin, 2015), and at the World Bank and the Gates
Foundation this term is being phased out of use.
2
OpenDOAR entries are reviewed for accuracy and completeness: “Each of the repositories has been visited by
OpenDOAR staff to ensure a high degree of quality and consistency in the information provided” (About
OpenDOAR, 2017, para. 2).

252

Figure 6.1 shows a typical OpenDOAR entry from the time at which the web documents
for this study were captured, and the range of data fields that the records contain. Not shown in
Figure 6.1 for sake of brevity is a second section of the record that outlines policies on metadata
re-use, data access rights, content types, rules for submission, and preservation goals.

Figure 6.1. A sample OpenDOAR record (excluding policy section, from July 2014)

OpenDOAR may not be a sufficient source to locate IRs at international liberal arts colleges, as
they tend to be under-represented in this repository. Instead, one could survey the membership
of organizations such as the Global Liberal Arts Alliance (http://liberalartsalliance.org/home) or
ECOLAS, the European Colleges of Liberal Arts and Sciences (http://www.ecolas.eu/eng/). An
international study may present linguistic challenges, however, as web documents could be in a
range of languages, and the survey might need to be translated into languages other than English.
Some knowledge of promotion and tenure realities for faculty internationally, and the status of
253

academic librarians in the countries of interest, would also be helpful to interpret and discuss the
results accurately.
Instead of broadening the pool of institutions under consideration, a researcher could look
more deeply at the institutions in this study, to examine other campus-wide academic services
that need collaborative partnerships between librarians and faculty, or between librarians,
information technologists, and their user communities. Areas of interest could include digital
humanities research, data management and visualization, experiential learning with archival
materials, open access publishing, open educational resources, and online instruction. All would
be potentially fruitful collaborative endeavors whose leadership traits could be compared against
the leadership patterns seen in the development of IRs.
One could deepen the level of inquiry in other ways. A researcher could progress from
these analyses of web documents and questionnaires to a series of guided conversations with IR
directors and developers. This would allow these findings to be discussed with library directors
or IR developers in the field, and the conclusions drawn here could be understood in a more
nuanced manner, or augmented with additional input, or challenged. In addition, a researcher
could move on from library directors and IR developers to interview representatives from other
stakeholder communities such as faculty from various disciplines, senior administrators, or
students.
The study could be extended temporally in two directions. Looking back, the Internet
Archive’s Wayback Machine could be used to analyze earlier iterations of the web sites
examined here; looking forwards, the content collection and analysis could be re-done after (say)
five years, to determine if the written expressions of IR service ambitions and vision had
changed markedly over time. A future researcher could also test whether the opinions of library

254

directors and IR developers were different, with one caveat: while the same institutions could be
surveyed, one could not guarantee that the same individuals were in the roles they occupied
when originally solicited. In addition, if using the same selection criteria as this study, the
populations would have changed: it is possible (though unlikely) that an IR would have ceased
operation, but it is certain (for the Oberlin Group at least) that new IRs have come online since
fall 2014.
The leadership traits identified by the Turning Point Collective proved to be useful for
this research. However, there is a significant research opportunity in the creation of a new
definition of collaborative leadership for 21st century academic partnerships. Both the scholarly
literature and general press contain many recent examples of writers discussing characteristics of
collaborative leadership; see, for example, Vitale (2017), Curwen (2016), Friedrich, Griffith, and
Mumford (2016), McCrory (2015), Goman (2014), Archer (2013), Ibarra and Hansen (2011),
Ullah (2011), and Gratton and Erickson (2007). A literature review of these (and many similar)
articles could help to isolate a set of collaborative leadership characteristics which could then be
evaluated by stakeholders in library or other campus collaborations. In this manner, a researcher
could derive and test a definition of the component elements of collaborative leadership behavior
specific to academia. Such a definition would be very useful to future studies.
Final Remarks
IR planning and implementation are on the rise in academic institutions, as librarians,
administrators, and faculty recognize that digital materials allow an unprecedented opportunity
for libraries to gather, curate, and share institutional assets. The IR’s success has been uneven,
however: it is difficult to determine how effectively they promote the excellence of the
institution’s research, although (when available) the public usage and download figures for

255

individual IRs are often impressive in number and geographic scope. There are significant
opportunities to promote IRs more effectively; to advocate for rewarding faculty for engagement
with open scholarship and for the global impact of their work; and to create more compelling,
convenient, and complete aggregations of IR content across institutions and across repository
infrastructures.
Given the steady increase in IR activity and investment, it is more important than ever
that we understand the processes involved in successful IR development and deployment. IRs
offer a good example of collaborative, boundary-spanning leadership on campus and – as
increasingly mature services – they can offer a model for other service partnerships in academia.
Such boundary-spanning endeavors are frequently in evidence, with massive open online courses
(MOOCs), online degrees, library publishing endeavors, experiential learning, and the rise of
open educational resources (OERs) all taking place on university and college campuses.
Understanding more about the component traits of collaborative leadership can therefore inform
the ongoing development of cross-campus, multi-stakeholder, technology-driven publishing,
research, and pedagogical endeavors, and can contribute to their success.

You are invited to participate in a survey that seeks to gauge how collaborative leadership traits
are manifested in the planning and implementation of institutional repositories. Participants can
withdraw at any time, and can skip questions; the refusal to participate or subsequent withdrawal
from the project will not affect your relationship with the investigator or the institution.
Precautions have taken to protect your privacy. The data are analyzed in the aggregate, and
presented in a manner that renders the institution anonymous. Any datasets and survey results
will be kept in a password-protected digital archive or locked drawer and will be destroyed after
a period of no more than three years from completion of the project. Participants will be sent a
copy of the results of the study.
If you have questions regarding the study, you may contact me, the investigator, David Seaman,
at (603) 646-9930, or you can e-mail me at david.seaman@dartmouth.edu. If at any time during
or after the study, you would like to discuss the study or your research rights with someone who
is not associated with the research study, you may contact the Human Protections Coordinator,
