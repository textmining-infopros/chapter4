Abstract
Over the past decade there has been a dramatic increase in the volume of digital content
created from museum, library and archive collections but research on how this material is
actually used, particularly in digital learning environments, has fallen far behind the rate of
supply. Previous research has focused largely on the technical aspects of digitisation and has
failed to problematise both the agency of those directly involved in creating and using digitised
collections, and the process of end-use. Idiographic research methods have dominated,
employing qualitative, top-down forms of analysis that have limited the validity and
applicability of findings and betray an ideological belief that artefact use is beneficial without
understanding how artefacts are used and why they are used in particular ways. This has led to
a gap in our understanding of how digital artefacts are used at a time when universities are
under more pressure to offer unique content in digital form, in virtual learning environments
(VLEs) and Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), and when the cultural sector is under
pressure to make digital content available for use and re-use without any clear idea of how this
can be done sustainably.
In order to address this gap, this thesis examines how communities of practice (CoPs) involved in
the supply and use of digital artefacts in the Higher Education sector in the UK interact with
content and what factors affect this process. It focuses on a case study involving the digitisation
of Shakespeare collections used in postgraduate research, and the testing of use in a range of
different learning environments. It uses Grounded Theory to generate typologies of artefact use.
Quantitative data (itself unusual for such studies) is used to investigate similarities and
differences between groups of practitioners and research students in the way that they engage
with artefacts in different contexts.
This case study produced a number of significant findings. Firstly, similar patterns of artefact
use were found across all users suggesting that there are generic ways in which we all interact
with digital artefacts. However, distinct forms of use did emerge which correspond with
membership of particular communities of practice. Secondly, members of a CoP appear to share
a particular learning style and this seems to be related to the domain of interest around which a
CoP forms and how members of the CoP interact with artefacts. Thirdly, the nature of the
environment does affect learning style: although differences between artefact use in digital
environments tested were slight, the research did demonstrate that hybrid learning
environments incorporating physical and digital features would be preferred by most student
end-users. Finally, the research indicates that a mixed method mechanism for analysing and
measuring use, piloted and tested in the case study, is possible.

This research highlights theoretical and practical implications for the way that artefacts are
supplied, packaged and used in Higher Education and beyond, and for the way that practitioners
and students work together to improve learning from cultural collections.

Acknowledgements
I would like to thank my supervisors, Henry Chapman and Ian Grosvenor, for their wisdom,
encouragement and support throughout. I’m very grateful also to The Shakespeare Birthplace
Trust and The Shakespeare Institute for giving me the time and resources to work on this
research on their behalf, particularly for the foresight of Kate McLuskie, and the faith and
friendship of Delia Garratt. I would also like to thank the Arts and Humanities Funding Council
for their financial support for the Digital CoPs and Robbers project which formed a significant
part of research activity during Phase 1.

Finally, I must also acknowledge the generous involvement of the participants without whom
there would have been no data. The quality of their contributions played a large part in lighting
the way and reminding me why this research is so important.

1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 Identifying the problem
Over the past decade there has been a dramatic increase in the volume of digital content
created from museum, library and archive collections but research on how this material is
actually used has fallen far behind the rate of supply. With cuts in funding to the museums
sector and increased competition in the Higher Education Sector this has created a pressing
problem; how can digitisation and digital learning environments meet the needs of users and
how can this be sustained? This thesis aims to address this gap in our understanding of artefact
use by examining a particular part of this problem – the usage of cultural artefacts1 in digital
learning environments. In doing so, it focuses specifically on the Higher Education and cultural
sector in the UK. Using the theoretical framework of communities of practice2 to ask what
influence the identity, knowledge, skills and experience of suppliers and end-users of digital
content have on the process of artefact use, and, importantly, a mixed methods approach to
data analysis, this thesis asks two fundamental questions:
1. How are cultural artefacts used in digital learning environments?
2. How can the theory of communities of practice help in understanding the people and

processes involved in the supply and use of digital artefacts?

1

Defined here as an item from a museum, library or archive collection.

2

Defined by Etienne Wenger as ‘groups of people who share a concern or a passion for something they do and
learn how to do it better as they interact regularly’ (2013).

11

Employing Grounded Theory to investigate types of use and patterns among groups of users,
and then testing usage behaviour in different environments,3 the research has provided
significant theoretical insights into how artefacts are used and how the learning styles of
communities of practice influence interaction with digital artefacts. The employment of a mixed
methodology to test the applicability of Wenger’s theory of communities of practice and to
chart usage patterns demonstrates that it is possible to generate numerical data from artefact
use. This has considerable implications for research in an area of study previously dominated by
largely qualitative methods of analysis. Using this methodology, the findings reveal that there
are generic and specific forms of digital artefact use. The discovery that there are ways of
engaging with artefacts shared by everyone is valuable given pressure on the Higher Education
and cultural sectors to produce digital resources for a wide audience. The knowledge that
specific usage behaviour appears to be related to a shared learning style within particular
communities of practice is equally valuable. Tailoring digital artefacts to suit the learning style
and usage behaviour of particular groups of users, particularly those who are willing to pay for
access to material, offers a way of supporting more general access to digital artefact
collections. The research also found that, as well as the social background of the user, the
nature of the environment also affects learning style and artefact usage. Findings reveal
strengths and weaknesses of both digital and physical environments suggesting that hybrid
learning environments would be most effective in accommodating student use of cultural
artefacts.

3

A method of content analysis that combines an open, qualitative creation of codes from data and the
quantitative collation of incidence of those codes, and claims to offer a way of ‘arriving at theory suited to its
supposed uses' (Glaser and Strauss 1999)

12

This chapter explores possible reasons for this gap in our understanding of artefact use and
outlines why the question is relevant to two of the sectors directly concerned with supplying
and using cultural artefacts in digital learning environments: the cultural4 and Higher Education5
(HE) sectors. It concludes by summarising the approach chosen to address the research
question. The following chapter goes into more detail on the political, economic, technological
and strategic context for both sectors and why the research question is so important, before
examining what research has previously been undertaken in the area of cultural artefact use,
digital learning environments and methodologies used to address the problem of how digital
artefacts6 are supplied and used. Chapter 3 identifies gaps in previous research and rationalises
a methodological approach used to address the two central research questions, and describes
research activity used to gather and analyse data over two phases. Findings from Phase 1 and
Phase 2 are given in Chapters 4 and 5 (respectively) before a reflection (in Chapter 6) on how
the research has helped to address the two main questions and the central problem of cultural
artefact use in digital learning environments is given in Chapter 6. A summary of main findings,
implications for both sectors and directions for future research are then given in a concluding
chapter (Chapter 7).

4

For the purposes of this thesis, the cultural sector is taken to mean museums, libraries and archives.

5

Providers of post-secondary or tertiary education, principally universities.

6

Defined here as a digital representation of an item from a museum, library or archive collection, an ‘information
package’ (DCC 2013) typically comprising multimedia files and associated metadata.

1.2 Exploring the problem
As noted above, an exponential growth in the volume of digital content created from cultural
collections over the past ten years has not been accompanied by research on usage of content
particularly in digital learning environments. For example, the number of images of artefacts
available via the Victoria and Albert (V&A) Museum’s ‘Search the Collections’ facility increased
by 300% from 86,500 images in 2009 (V&A 2009, 5) to 260,000 in 2011 (V&A 2012, 4). Similarly,
in 2012 the British Library claimed to have been digitising its collection at the rate of 8,000
images per day (British Library 2012, 9) building on a 500% increase in the creation of digital
images between 2007 and 2009 from 3.1 million (British Library 2007, 26) to 15.1 million
images (British Library 2009, 25), compared to the creation of only 43,673 images in 2005-06.
On the back of such increases, aggregators such as Culture Grid and Europeana offer access to
information on 3 million (Collections Trust 2013) and 30 million (Europeana 2013) cultural
artefacts (respectively) indicating that the trend in content creation found in the V&A Museum
and The British Library has spread wider across the UK and Europe. More generally, digital
content in its broadest sense is predicted to grow over the next 16 years by a factor of 300 to
be ‘40 trillion gigabytes (more than 5,200 gigabytes for every man, woman, and child in 2020)’
(Gantz and Reinsel 2012, 1). However, research studies on use7 of the digital artefact have not
kept pace with the rapid increase in content. In particular, questions about the mechanics of
interaction with the digital artefact and what effect the identity, interests and skills of those
involved in producing and using artefacts has on the experience of end-use,8 have not been

7

For the purposes of this thesis defined as interaction with an artefact at any stage of its creation or development
as a means of accomplishing or achieving a goal.
8

Specifically, the ultimate use of an artefact as a product, i.e. after it has been created and developed.

14

sufficiently addressed. Furthermore, there is also a lack of published research on the influence
of the digital environment on use, specifically how virtual learning environments9 used across
the HE sector, affect artefact use. So why has there been such an increase in the volume of
digital artefacts without attempts to understand how they are being used?

1.2.1 Hypothetical reasons for lack of research: Technology and funding
Arguably, part of the reason for the imbalance between content creation and research on use
might be that digitisation of cultural artefacts has been technologically driven; the tools to
create images and metadata10 and make content available online exist so they have been used.
The speed of technological change might also have been responsible for museums ‘quixotically
chasing the leading edge’ (Parry 2010a, 5) in the way that many responded to the opportunities
of digital technology. The consequence might have been what Parry termed a tendency to
‘fetishise the future’ (2010a, 5) by focusing on the ‘what’ and neglecting the ‘how’ and the
‘why’ of digitisation. There are obvious benefits to digitisation of artefacts such as increasing
public access to cultural collections and improving record-keeping within institutions and these
benefits were perhaps also responsible for many organisations overlooking the precise nature
of content use in favour of general analyses of content creation.
9

A VLE is defined by Dillenbourg in its most general sense as a ‘designed information space’ (2002, 3) and by
Catherall as ‘a Web-based portal to a variety of communication, content publishing, assessment and related tools’
(2011, 117).
10

In the context of this research, metadata is defined as descriptive information about cultural artefacts as well as
structural or technical metadata which generally relate to the design and specification of data structures and to
information concerning the context in which data was captured, respectively.

15

The short-term funding available for many digitisation programmes might also have had an
influence on the lack of evaluation of the products of digitisation projects (Butterworth, Fields
et al.. 2005, 288). Funding for collaborative projects between the cultural sector (which holds
collections) and the HE sector (which sometimes makes research use of them), such as JISC’s
Content Programme 2011-2013 which aimed to stimulate ‘creation and delivery’(JISC 2011) of
digital resources, has placed little emphasis on what happens to the digital artefact postdelivery. Since 2008, JISC has reduced funding for mass digitisation (ibid.) in favour of projects
which generate open educational resources (OERs)11 and programmes centred on the use and
re-use of ‘big data’12. Although this switch in funding priorities places a stronger emphasis on
content use rather than content creation, research interest in ‘inter-artefact’ use (use of data
which links individual artefacts) has predominated over ‘intra-artefact’ use (use of data solely
about an individual artefact). An increased interest in how metadata on cultural collections can
be found, for example JISC’s Discoverability programme (Marchionni 2013), as well as how
metadata can be used, places greater emphasis on machine-readable content to which
museums, libraries and archives have been slow to respond (Ridge n.d.). Although the creation
of a semantic web focuses largely on the interoperability of data, a greater understanding of
how content is actually used is needed so that users are able to find, share and combine data
more easily. Arguably, understanding how artefacts are used is instrumental in creating a
system that enables machines to ‘understand’ and respond to complex human requests based
on their meaning. This makes decoding the process of using artefacts to make finding, sharing

11

OERs are ‘teaching and learning materials that are freely available online for everyone to use’ (OER Commons
2013).
12

In the context of cultural collections, ‘big data’ is defined by Nick Poole (Collections Trust) as ‘large datasets for
academic and scientific research’ (Poole, 2013).

16

and combining information on other artefacts more easily a vital part of the cultural sector’s
contribution to Web 3.0 (British Museum n.d.). Finally, an ongoing and persistent debate about
the relative advantages of either physical artefacts or digital artefacts has also played a part in
diverting attention from efforts to understand the basic processes behind artefact use
regardless of medium.

1.2.2 Hypothetical reasons for lack of research: Research methods
A second possible reason for the lack of research on digital artefact use might be
methodological challenges in capturing data on usage. The lack of adequate research methods
in this area is highlighted, unwittingly, in a recent report published by the University Museums
Group (UMG) and University Museums in Scotland (UMIS) advocating greater funding for
university collections based on the range of benefits they provide. In it the authors claim,
Strategic investment in university museums offers significant academic and societal
benefits: wider access to university, deeper student learning, stronger community
engagement and many opportunities for research impact (UMG and UMIS 2013).
Whilst few would deny that investment in university museums would be expected to bring
benefits to academia and beyond, the inability to prove the impact of object-centred learning
has long been a challenge for university museums. Problems associated with capturing
meaningful quantitative data from an individual’s interaction with an artefact in digital form has
meant that the vast majority of studies (e.g. Chatterjee 2010a) on artefact use are qualitative in
nature and focus on physical collections. An underlying reason for an adherence to qualitative
methods alone could be museology’s place within the humanities where a stress on

17

individuality (Portin 1981) and the uniqueness of an individual’s encounter with an artefact
might have restricted the use of quantitative methods of analysis. The result is that the
evidence base for how artefacts are used is weakened and the wider applicability of any
findings generated is curtailed. But why is it now important to know more about the use of
digital artefacts?

1.3 Relevance of the research questions
This section examines briefly why the research questions are of relevance to the cultural and HE
sectors, and beyond. It looks at changes in how cultural content is valued and controlled, and
current issues concerning the context in which digital artefacts are used by the HE sector and
the creation of content by the cultural sector. Finally, synergies between the two sectors are
examined as pressure builds to collaborate on the creation and use of digital artefacts.

1.3.1 Relevance of the research: Value and use
A reduction in funding for digitisation has led many institutions holding collections to question
the value of digital artefacts and to tackle issues surrounding the sustainability of resources
(discussed in more detail in Chapter 2.2.3). This inevitably leads to an interest in the impact
digital content is having on the end-user (e.g. Zorich 2010) and making the ‘digital supply chain’
(Deutschmann 2009), the set of business functions responsible for the creation and delivery of
digital artefacts, more efficient and effective. Lack of demonstrable return on investment for

18

digitisation (Flow 2010, 15) has also meant that collections institutions are having to make
decisions on which content to continue to make accessible and this has also led to an interest in
uptake and use. Lack of research on how digital artefacts are used jeopardises future
investment for content creation and delivery as priorities have been forced upon the cultural
sector. But understanding use might also help inform the process of assessing risks in releasing
rights-sensitive material. As Mercer (2000) points out,
Much has been written on issues pertaining to licensing and archiving of digital
information. Until recently, there has not been enough information to evaluate how
these digital products, particularly journals, are being used.
Data on use are also needed to enable repositories to make more informed choices about
which digital content to procure externally as availability of content rises and budgets are
squeezed (Mercer 2000). As pressure builds from end-users and government not only to make
content available but usable (see Section 2.2.6) owners of collections have more reason to track
usage of assets in order to understand what is done with them and to try to recapture value
created ‘beyond’ the museum’s ‘institutional walls’(Rumbold 2010, 326). As Rumbold explains,
the terms of value creation are changing; the question for museums (and for the cultural sector
at large) is no longer about generation of content but about what happens next (2010, 321).
Funders such as JISC are placing more emphasis on the value end-users can bring to the
production of digital content through ‘co-design’ (JISC 2013a), and the cultural sector is being
encouraged to think of business models based on the end-user,
A heritage institution looking for a revenue model is best advised to start with its
potential customers, rather than its collection (DEN Foundation 2010, 85).
Therefore, the question of sustainability for the cultural sector has changed from value
appropriation from content and end-users, to value creation with content and end-users (Mizik
2003).
19

1.3.2 Relevance of the research: Control and use
Greater attention to content use as opposed to content creation has coincided with a general
shift in control of the creation of digital artefacts from institutions to individuals. The
proliferation of user-generated content online (Grabowicz 2013) created using mobile devices
or derivatives of owner-generated images of cultural artefacts has meant that the relationship
between cultural institutions and their users has been redefined in terms of how value is
created from cultural collections as these have become available and usable online. The owner
of an artefact can no longer control fully what is done with its digital representation once online
and this has unsettled the power balance between museums and their users (Khan 2002). A
shift to cheaper and more diverse forms of digitisation has meant that users have become
producers, resulting in the Web 2.0 idea of the ‘produser’ or one who produces and uses digital
content (Bruns 2007). Just as the process of creating digital content from physical artefacts has
become more complex so too has the diversity of ways in which content can be used, beyond
what was initially intended by museums, libraries and archives. Production of images from the
artefact and what is done with them has become decentralised and the digital supply chain has
become more multifarious as a result. If museums, libraries and archives are to recapture value
from the digital artefact, greater knowledge is needed about how content is used as well as
how it is produced. In general, the cultural sector might have been too slow in appreciating the
difference between the end-user’s experience of the physical and the digital (Teather and
Wilhelm 1999) let alone accounting for the diversity found in new forms of production.

Nevertheless, this shift online to a ‘user-centered paradigm’ (Veldof, Prasse et al.. 1999, 116)
has been responsible for a rapid rise in the volume of digital artefacts from non-specialist

20

sources beyond the control of collections’ repositories. This should make understanding forms
of usage more vital as cultural gatekeepers are increasingly being expected to become cultural
facilitators (McCrary 2011, 365). As Veldof noted on the changing role of librarians, ‘Usability is
particularly relevant to librarians as their roles change to information specialists and system
designers’ (1999, 123). In other words, knowing how digital artefacts are used should lead to
improvements in how systems work (Duff and Cherry 2000). There is, however, growing
evidence among museum, library and archive professionals that this shift in control has created
something of an identity crisis among those traditionally involved in regulating the use of
physical artefacts (Tousley 2010). This suggests that studying the influence that different
practitioner perspectives can make to the way that digital artefacts are produced is timely and,
in the context of artefact use in the HE sector, might help prevent what Stiles terms the
‘content trap’ (Stiles 2004). This describes the delivery of content by practitioner groups (such
as librarians) by ‘fork-lift’ (ibid.), in other words without any understanding of how this will be
used or how their packaging of it might influence end-use. A failure to take account of the
selective nature of digitisation and the influence of decision makers creating and supplying
content, has limited our understanding of how large quantities of digital material are actually
being used. Scrutiny of the influence of producers on production and end-users on use is
especially important and timely given that increased complexity of the supply chain of digital
content described above. So why is it important now to know more about how digital artefacts
are used in Higher Education?

21

1.3.3 Relevance of the research: Context and use
Over the past decade, the use of digital learning environments by universities in the UK has
been actively encouraged by government as one way of responding to demands for flexibility
(Irvine 2003) while, arguably, reducing operating costs (Fry 2010).With rapid population growth
in the developing world, ‘the demand for post-secondary education is at an all-time high’
(Sedehi and Saccocio 2013). This ‘has created sizeable demand for scalable, consistently
produced online courses’ (ibid.) delivered via digital learning environments. The recent
development of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) which cater for large numbers of
distance learners through virtual learning environments with often minimal contact with
teaching staff (and, in the case of so-called ‘cMOOCs’, increased peer-to-peer contact), and the
expansion of mobile learning environments13 has made the need for understanding how
content is used even more vital as the variety of contexts within which students learn
diversifies further. Moreover, the growth of embedded computing (Fisher, Faraboschi et al..
2005) and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology makes the prospect of an ‘internet
of things’ (Ashton 2009) - creating intelligent artefacts and artefact-based computer interfaces
– a real possibility which could potentially change digital learning environments still further.
However, the affordances or limitations of the context of artefact usage is a relatively neglected
area of study, despite the growing variety of ways that digital content can be found and
engaged with online (Bautista 2012, 3).

13

Mobile learning environments facilitate learning ‘via such wireless devices as mobile phones, personal digital
assistants (PDAs), or laptop computers’ (O’Malley, Vavoula et al. 2003).

22

1.3.4 Relevance of the research: Content and use
Creating unique content from cultural collections might offer universities a way of making
courses stand out as students, many of whom now pay maximum tuition fees, become more
selective (Thompson and Bekhradnia n.d., 14). However, just as it is, ‘absurd to try and solve
the problems of education by giving people access to information as it would be to solve the
housing problem by giving people access to bricks’ (Laurillard 1996) generating digital images
and metadata for research use without paying attention to how this might be used or could be
used seems misguided. The adoption of virtual learning environments has stimulated a great
deal of debate on the kind of pedagogies required to use them effectively both for distance
learning and blended learning.14 Although within digital learning environments there is an
emphasis on problem solving rather than content use per se, they are designed to be learnercentred (Siegel and Kirkley 1997) and considering learner use of artefacts within these
environments would seem to be an important way of gauging the efficacy of artefact-based
content especially as digital learning environments become larger and more open. This
openness poses questions about the role of institutional databases and how these relate to
course provision and to wider public use. As noted above, funding for the creation and sharing
of OERs has increased sharply in the past five years but low levels of uptake, and a lack of
evaluation around use, has called into question the value of investing in shared educational
resources (Anyangwe 2011). Overall, this lack of knowledge on end-use has created a widening
gap between content delivery and awareness of impact on learners.

14

Blended learning combines online and face-to-face instruction (Reay 2001, 6).

23

1.3.5 Relevance of the research: Collaboration and use
A restriction in government funding for mass digitisation in the UK over the past five years has
been accompanied by greater investment in funding schemes which promote partnerships
between content providers (such as the cultural sector) with content users (such as the HE
sector). Although economies of scale undoubtedly lie behind such a shift (both in terms of
sustainability for the cultural and HE sector, and in the pooling of resources between funding
bodies such as the Arts and Humanities Research Council and Arts Council England), the
conditions attached to funding awards suggest that releasing content for use and re-use is just
as important (discussed in Chapter 2.2.6). At a governmental level, both in London and Brussels,
there is also a growing realisation (Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff 2000, 110) that in order to
compete globally, innovation requires dynamic partnerships within the ‘triple helix’ (Etzkowitz
2003) of universities, government and industry (including the cultural sector), although the payoffs for collaborating to create open content remain unclear (JISC 2013d). Knowledge about
how digital artefacts are used in Higher Education would be helpful in persuading organisations
that own collections, as well as those that would most benefit from using them, that
investment of time and resources would be worthwhile.

1.4 Research gaps
Despite a growing number of reasons for a deeper understanding of the use of cultural
artefacts in digital learning environments, there remain significant gaps in research activity.
There are three principal gaps in published research in this area:

24

Focus: the relationship between the identity, interests, experience and skills of suppliers
and end-users of content and how digital artefacts are created and used has not been
researched sufficiently. The basic processes behind the use of digital artefacts have also
not been examined to any appreciable extent. Previous research on the influence of
environment has focused on the usability of VLEs rather than the usability of content
within them
Scope: previous studies on the digital supply chain have been conducted largely on a
particular part of the digital supply chain and by those concerned (for example, in the
museums profession). Also, the scope of what is meant by use has tended to refer to
usability of a product rather than a broader, more inclusive definition of the term
Research methods: previous studies on artefact use have tended to adopt qualitative,
top-down methods of data analysis rather than allow data to suggest new typologies
The research approach adopted in this thesis (outlined in Section 1.5) is designed to address
these gaps.

1.5 Research approach
qualities which we attribute to objects ought to be imputed to our ways of
experiencing them, and that these in turn are due to the force of intercourse and
custom. This discovery marks an emancipation; it purifies and remakes the objects of
our direct or primary experience (Dewey 2008, 23).
The ‘emancipation’ that Dewey is referring to in Experience and Nature lies at the heart of the
approach adopted in this thesis to address the question of how cultural artefacts are used in
digital learning environments. Dewey is pointing to the realisation that interaction with the
25

artefact or ‘object’ is as much about the individual and their environment, as the artefact and
its environment. This corresponds with two of the gaps identified in previous research on
artefact use: the influence of ‘intercourse and custom’ on the process of use, and the
importance of context or environment. Within the context of the research question it is
important to consider the people involved in creating, supplying and using digital artefacts and
how the ‘force of intercourse and custom’ (their previous experience) affects how they interact
with digital artefacts, as well as the processes associated with producing and using digital
artefacts and how this is affected by environment (our ‘ways of experiencing’ artefacts).

One way of examining the role of ‘intercourse and custom’ is by using the theoretical
framework of ‘Communities of Practice’. Etienne Wenger describes a community of practice or
CoP as people, ‘informally bound together by shared expertise and passion for a joint
enterprise’ (Wenger and Snyder 2000). Since usage of digital artefacts is usually preceded by
decisions made by a cross-disciplinary supply chain of CoPs including, for example, curators,
librarians, archivists, academics, and digitisation specialists, Wenger’s theories of acculturation
and social learning on how practitioners develop knowledge and skills together can be used to
analyse the connection between an individual’s identity, interests, skills and experience and
how they either use digital artefacts or (as suppliers of content) influence end-use. Owing to
the lack of progress made on studying artefact use with an idiographic approach (a tendency to
specify rather than generalise, seeking to understand the meaning of often subjective
phenomena) and qualitative methods of analysis, and in an effort to quantify the influence of
‘intercourse and custom’ and ‘ways of experiencing’ artefacts, this thesis adopts an approach
which is more nomothetic in character (nomothetic refers to a tendency to generalise rather

26

than specify, seeking to understand the meaning of often objective phenomena) and employs
both qualitative and quantitative methods of analysis in an attempt to be more objective in the
study of artefact use (see Section 2.3.5.4).

Given the scale and complexity of the problem, coupled with the lack of research activity in this
area, it would be impossible and infeasible to research all of it. Therefore, this study looks at a
sample digital supply chain between a museum, library and archive, The Shakespeare Birthplace
Trust, and a postgraduate teaching and research institution, The Shakespeare Institute
(University of Birmingham). However, given the breadth of disciplines involved in the study of
Shakespeare,15 the research findings from this case study should contain practical advice and
strategic implications that will be of relevance to other organisations across the cultural and HE
sector which have an interest in the use of cultural artefacts in digital learning environments.

1.6 Structure of the thesis
In order to address the gaps in our understanding of the use of cultural artefacts in digital
learning environments, this thesis roughly follows the same course as the research itself. This
began with a closer examination of the research problem and an evaluation of previous
attempts to tackle it. This is done in the following chapter (Chapter 2) which contains two
reviews: a situation review sets out how the research problem relates to strategic and
pragmatic issues for both the cultural and HE sectors, while a literature review examines

15

(Burnett et al. 2011, 2) stated that the widescale ‘interpretation, appropriation, and translation’ of the works
and personality of Shakespeare represents a ‘multi-faceted, ongoing and accumulating movement’.

27

previous studies undertaken in and around the research area. Chapter 3 reflects on research
gaps before explaining the methodological approach, aims and objectives adopted, as well as
the structure and rationale for research activity in both phases. This chapter also explains forms
of data collection and analysis used in both phases. The findings from Phase 1 (where the focus
is on ‘Artefacts and Practitioners’) are presented in Chapter 4 which concludes with a discussion
of the main findings and the formation of hypotheses relating to the two main research
questions tested in Phase 2 (which focuses on ‘Artefacts and Environments’). Chapter 5
presents the findings from Phase 2 of the research in relation to hypotheses formed in Phase 1.
The findings from both phases are discussed in more depth in Chapter 6 which reflects on the
research aims and results, and the implications for the cultural and HE sector in the light of the
situation review and gaps in previous research, both described in Chapter 2. Finally, Chapter 7
returns to the main research questions and sets out the main conclusions, implications and
possible directions for future research.

28

2. RESEARCH CONTEXT
2.1 Introduction
Owing to the lack of research on the topic of digital artefact use, two types of review are
included in this chapter. The first is a situation review (Section 2.2) which examines why the
question of cultural artefact use in digital learning environments is relevant. In doing so it
describes the political, economic, educational, and technological climate of the research
questions for two sectors most closely involved in producing and using artefacts in formal
digital learning environments: the cultural and HE sector. Next, a literature review (Section 2.3)
outlines the most pertinent work around the research area to explain where the main research
enquiry sits with regard to previous published work, to expose gaps, and to inform the research
methodology. Finally, Section 2.4 attempts to bring together the main points from the situation
and literature reviews to reframe the research question in the context of both sectors, and to
identify gaps in research.

2.2 Situation review
2.2.1 Introduction
Since the question of artefact use in digital learning environments is centred on the cultural and
HE sectors, the context in which these two sectors operate is the focus of the situation review.
As observed in Chapter 1, a change in the economic climate over the past decade has affected
the political and strategic context in which universities and cultural sector organisations in the
UK operate. The market for each of these sectors has become more user-driven and both
sectors have experienced pressure to utilise digital technologies to respond to demands for

29

openness, flexibility and sustainability. Greater accountability to the end-user has made the
need to understand more about how digital artefacts are used and what affects interaction
more vital in delivering relevant and cost-effective services and resources.

2.2.2 Higher Education sector
Looking firstly at the Higher Education (HE) sector, restrictions on government spending and
disposable incomes during the latest UK recession (which most economic commentators (e.g.
Verick and Islam 2010) agree started in December 2007), and changes to the way universities
are funded, has raised competition among universities in attracting fee-paying students.
Looking specifically at funding in England, the reduction in the recurrent grant budget of the
Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) from £5.9billion in 2008-09 (HEFCE 2008,
1) to £4.9billion in 2012-13 (HEFCE 2013a, 2) represented a 17% decrease in a major source of
funding for universities. At the same time, the UK Government’s response to the Browne
Review (2010) involved a raising of the cap on tuition fees from £3,000 to £9,000 per annum.
The response of the majority of English universities (including the University of Birmingham)
was to charge the maximum amount allowed under the legislation (Sedghi and Shepherd 2011).
This decision to decrease core funding to universities while making them more accountable to
fee-paying students in an open market economy (Willetts 2011) was accompanied by calls to
improve the quality of provision and widen access to, and increase participation within, Higher
Education (HEFCE 2013b). This meant that, to a greater extent, students have become the
paymasters of universities and pressure to meet their needs has been felt more acutely across
the HE sector (Byre and Howes 2010).

30

UK universities have been under considerable pressure since the late 1990s to increase access
to higher education for post-16 year olds, highlighted particularly in the Kennedy and Dearing
Reports (Tight 1998). The Fryer Report (1997) introduced the concept of a ‘universal learning
culture’, and the 1998 green paper The Learning Age: A Renaissance for a New Britain set out
the government’s determination to ensure Britain’s place in the 21st century knowledge-based
economy by encouraging lifelong learning and lifting barriers to learning (DfEE 1998). A
corollary of this drive towards inclusivity in education is that learning is expected to be more
flexible, in order to address the needs of a more diverse student population. As Irvine points
out,
Higher education today faces rising enrolments and costs, a demographic shift toward
older students and lifelong learning, and a greater demand for anytime/anywhere
learning and online services (Irvine 2003, 5).
VLEs and digital content for use within them are regarded as important mechanisms to enable
universities to respond to this demand, something articulated in the European Union’s elearning strategy, Virtual campuses for all students (2002). It recommended that,
By end 2005 [sic], Member States [...] should ensure that all universities offer online
access for students and researchers to maximise the quality and efficiency of learning
processes and activities (ibid., 13).
The 2009 revision to HEFCE’s e-Learning Strategy focuses less on e-learning as a specialist area
instead stressing the broader aim of ‘enhancing learning and teaching through the use of
appropriate technology’ (2009, 1) suggesting that digital learning environments were regarded
as an established way of widening access to Higher Education, meeting the demand for
flexibility and improving ‘quality’ and ‘efficiency’ (HEFCE 2009, 14) especially in the face of
budgetary cuts. This makes the question of how content is being used within VLEs, and how
more diverse user backgrounds affect this process, relevant and timely.

31

As far back as 2000, a JISC Assist Report suggested that without a Managed Learning
Environment (MLE), a university would not be sustainable far into the 21 st century (JISC 2000).
Today, there are over 157 VLEs in use in Higher Education institutions across the UK (Browne,
Hewitt et al.. 2010, 17) corresponding with a general increase in the uptake of distance learning
programmes. Although VLEs are also used in blended learning,16 a recent report by the
University of Oxford for JISC (White, Warren et al.. 2010), claimed that over the past decade the
provision of online distance learning has ‘increased significantly’(ibid., 11) particularly at
postgraduate level (ibid., 1).

HEFCE, which commissioned this report indirectly through funding for JISC, is the main
government funding body for higher education in England and in a survey conducted in 2010
91% (ibid., 13) of English institutions claimed to use its revised E-Learning Strategy to inform
development of technology enhanced learning. This document challenged institutions to
employ technologies to enhance learning, teaching and assessment activities. Although
deliberately broad in its scope to include other technologies, the report showed that VLEs are
still regarded as efficient and effective ways of increasing student access (particularly in the 1830 age group), lowering administration costs and facilitating the use and re-use of resources
(Ibid, 6). Added to this, higher education, along with all ‘public’ services in the UK, also faces
calls for greater accountability. Bodies such as the Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) oversee
standards and assessments, and VLEs allow for greater tracking and, arguably, accountability.

16

Defined by Graham as the ‘convergence between face-to-face learning environments and computer-mediated or
distributed learning environments’ (2005, 1).

32

For these reasons, VLEs have become conventional tools to enable universities to respond to
the demands of users and funders.

However, research suggests that there are fewer issues with the uptake of VLEs and more with
their use. In a wide-ranging report on student perspectives (GfK 2011), there is a general
perception that VLEs are welcome additions to higher education but that they are underused,
provision varies widely across the sector and even within university departments, and that in
terms of teaching and learning they tend to replicate ‘existing practice’ (Bols 2010). In a study
undertaken by William Dutton, Pauline Hope Cheong and Namkee Park, ‘The Social Shaping of a
Virtual Learning Environment’ (2004), the authors found that usage of VLEs remains patchy
across the HE sector. Limitations on the innovative use of VLEs were attributed to technical
restrictions (infrastructure and skills within universities), inflexibility in pedagogy, and what the
authors describe as ‘risk-adverse academic cultures’ (ibid., 78). This reflects the experience of
students in a recent survey (GfK 2011) that with the ‘penetration’ (ibid., 4) of VLEs there is
increasing potential for flexibility but levels of satisfaction have decreased (ibid., 5). Therefore,
in the HE sector, pressure from government to widen access and increase flexibility, and to
make provision more efficient and accountable, has contributed to the utilisation of VLEs.
However, what is done with them remains under scrutiny.

HEFCE, the main funding body for the sector, has urged universities to collaborate with content
providers, such as the cultural sector, to make delivery of educational resources more efficient
(Fry 2010) (a subject taken up in Section 2.2.4). But how is the cultural sector responding to the
economic downturn?

33

2.2.3 Cultural sector
In the cultural sector there is a strong perception of a public funding crisis kicking-in after 15
years of major investment in digitisation projects. The outcome of a UK government spending
review in June 2013 was a 7% cut in the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS)
resource budget, and a 2% cut in the block grant for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland
(Steel 2013). It was announced in the Coalition Government’s Autumn Statement that £34m of
cuts to the DCMS budget would be passed on to Arts Council England (ACE) and national
museums (ibid.). The local government budget was cut by 10% and local authority funding for
museums fell by 11%, nearly £23m, in 2011/12 (Steel and Atkinson 2013). The Museums,
Libraries Archives Council (MLA), which was until March 2012 responsible for ‘supporting and
developing museums, libraries and archives’, had its budget cut by 26% from £62m in 2010/11
to £46m in 2013/14. During a UK Government Comprehensive Spending Review in September
2010 Renaissance funding17 was also cut by 15% (more than £1.5m) over four years. These
funding cuts appear to have been felt at the front line. In a survey of museum practitioners
published by the Museums Association (MA) in July 2012, 51% of respondents reported a
reduction to their overall budget compared to the year before.18

These funding cuts have impacted directly on the creation of digital artefacts from cultural
collections. A Europe-wide survey of digitisation by ENUMERATE in July 2012 (Stroeker and
Vogels 2012) revealed gaps in digitisation and in thinking about the end-use of content.
According to the report, more than three-quarters of cultural institutions surveyed have a

Renaissance in the Regions is an ‘improvement programme for regional museums’ administered by ACE (2014).

31% of those surveyed reported that they had experienced a budget cut in excess of 10% (Evans 2012).

34

digital collection, or are involved in digitisation, but only 34% have a written digitisation
strategy and just 31% have a policy on use of their digital collections (ibid., 4). Beyond web
analytics (ibid., 18) few organisations investigate regularly how web based resources are being
used. Other key findings from the ENUMERATE report show about 20% of all collections that
need to be have been digitised (ibid., 11). Art museums were the ‘most digitised’ with 42%, but
national libraries have only 4% of their collections digitised against a target of 62% (ibid.).
Moreover, digitisation was funded from internal budgets in 87% of the institutions surveyed,
while public grants or subsidies were mentioned by 40% of them (ibid., 25). The Heritage
Lottery Fund (HLF), which funded almost 32,000 projects worth £4.7billion across the UK
between 1994 and 2012 (HLF 2013a), many of which have involved digitisation of collections
held by museums, libraries and archives, changed the criteria for projects involving digital
technologies in December 2012. The revised HLF policy on digital states that they are able to
support cataloguing, digitisation and retro-conversion activities only where they form part of a
wider project that will provide additional activities to help more people access and learn from
the material. Although ‘hard commitment’ funding distributed by the Heritage Lottery Fund
increased from £680million in 2006-07 to £740million in 2012-13, the London Olympics had a
siphoning effect, lowering the number of £50,000 - £5 million grants available for projects such
as digitisation by 15% in 2008 alone and, according to some estimates, leading to a direct loss
of £161.2 million from the heritage sector to the Olympics (Slavin 2007). In line with these cuts,
funding from JISC for mass digitisation fell from £12m in 2004-06 to £3.4m in 2011-13 (JISC
2013b).

35

The reductions in government spending and a general contraction in budgets experienced by
over half the number of museums who took part in the MA survey means that investment in
digitisation has been affected by the current economic climate. There has also been pressure
on museums to rationalise collections (sponsored through schemes such as the Museum
Association’s Effective Collections fund (MA 2013)) and negotiate rights (CHIN 2013). Therefore,
knowing more about users, how they interact with artefacts and what they wish to do with
them should inform what is collected and what is done with it – in both digital and physical
form. This knowledge might also help to justify future investment in content creation.
Despite the squeeze in core and capital funding, the UK Government seems to recognise the
contribution that museums, libraries and archives make to the ‘digital sector’ which is
estimated to be worth nearly £1 in every £10 the UK economy generates every year (DCMS
2009, 13). However, in a report funded by the Collections Trust, Mapping the use of digital
technologies in the heritage sector (Flow 2010), the failure of many digital projects to provide a
demonstrable return on investment was acknowledged. The report admits that, ‘the provision
of digital content is not necessarily lucrative’ and points to the true costs of digitisation (ibid.
15). So how does the Government propose that content is created and made available in a
sustainable way?

2.2.4 Collaboration between the HE and cultural sectors
With Government policy and funding initiatives advocating economies of scale there is a
growing acknowledgement across the HE and cultural sectors that they can respond most
effectively to new economic and political pressures through collaboration. A scheme already

36

used for such cross-sector collaboration is the Knowledge Exchange (KE) programme funded by
the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC). This scheme is designed for,
Research Organisations already working in strategic partnerships with creative
businesses and cultural organisations to strengthen and diversify their collaborative
research activities’ (AHRC 2013).
The policy agenda behind funding is a diffusion of knowledge to ‘non-academic, public and
private sectors’ (ibid.), the backflow to universities being content provision or work with nonacademic audiences for which the cultural sector is ideally placed.

However, the government has also recently restructured regulatory bodies and encouraged
collaboration between funding bodies strongly gesturing that partnerships are required to
make content open and sustainable. In December 2010, the Arts Council England (ACE) agreed
to assume responsibility for museum and library sector development and improvement in
England from the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council (MLA) in a rationalisation measure
introduced by the Coalition Government (ACE 2010). The MLA closed in March 2012 leaving
ACE in charge of the lion’s share of their former functions in order ‘to create a more coherent
cultural offer that benefits the cultural sector and the audiences it serves’ (ibid.). The
Government’s twin aim of increasing access and promoting sustainability is also detectable in
cross-body funding initiatives such as the Digital Research and Development Fund for Arts and
Culture (British Council 2011), a partnership between ACE, the AHRC, and the National
Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts (NESTA), an independent ideas-based charity
and trust (NESTA 2013). The Fund aims to support arts and cultural organisations across
England to work with digital technologies to expand their audience reach and engagement, and
to experiment with new business models (British Council 2011). This fund is rooted in notions of

37

sustainability, perhaps revealing the future direction of funding for digitally-related projects for
the cultural sector.

The tenor of these funding calls, and the movement of funding and authority from the MLA to
ACE, an organisation with stronger links to the AHRC (both being government-funded
organisations concerned with funding the arts and arts-based research), has implications for
strategic alliances between higher education and cultural sector organisations and for the use
of something they share an interest in: content. If universities are to increase access while
diversifying their offer, then strategic alliances around content and the provision of VLEs would
seem to be strongly related. Initiatives which look towards sustaining long term generation,
use, and storage of content will increasingly be of interest to cultural sector organisations
seeking support from funding bodies such as ACE.

At the same time, there has been a growth in the number of digitisation programmes based on
commercial partnerships, primarily among organisations that receive block grant funding from
the UK Government. For example, the British Library’s partnership with Brightsolid to digitise
the British Newspaper Archive and create a subscription-based resource builds on content
initially created during a £3million JISC-funded project (British Newspaper Archive 2013).
Through commercial collaboration the British Library intends digitising 40 million British
newspapers over the course of a decade (ibid.). The British Library’s deal with Google to make
250,000 out-of-copyright books available ‘to all’ (British Library 2011), and the National
Archives’ intention to digitise three million records from its Crime, Court and Convicts collection
in partnership with Brightsolid (National Archives 2011) also demonstrates a shift not only in
38

how digitisation will be carried out but how it will be made available and how access can be
sustained. To a limited extent this has percolated to non-national collections. For example the
University of Manchester Library’s Digitisation Strategy identifies as a strategic principle,
To increase capacity, we will seek commercial partners for digitisation projects, and
develop and build on existing partnerships with other academic organisations (University of
Manchester n.d.).
Though the success of attracting large commercial interest in cultural collections held outside
London has still to be proven, it is clear that the government regards collaboration with the
business sector as another way of coming to terms with the twin challenges of openness and
sustainability.

2.2.5 Strategic content creation
The UK Government has also been experimenting with ways of coordinating the creation of
usable digital content. Spearheading the Government’s attempts to corral content providers,
the Strategic Content Alliance (SCA) was established in 2006. The SCA is a partnership initiative
funded by the JISC, British Library, BBC, and the Wellcome Trust which seeks to encourage
public and not-for-profit organisations to, ‘maximise financial and intellectual investment in
digital content through a much more systematic approach to pooling and co-ordinating activity’
(JISC 2013c). SCA’s Content Framework (2006-09) outlines the barriers which, ‘inhibit closer coordination and investigates potential resolution or mitigating activities’ (ibid.). In a similar
initiative, the UK Discovery Programme, also funded through JISC, is a more technicallyorientated cross domain project which seeks to create an ‘open metadata ecosystem’ by
encouraging cultural and education sector partners to sign-up to eight principles pledging to,

39

‘enhance the impact of our knowledge resources for the furtherance of scholarship and
innovation’ (Discovery 2012). Building on the work of the Resource Discovery Taskforce, set-up
in 2010, Discovery has attracted some weighty voices, such as the MIMAS Centre (University of
Manchester) and the Collections Trust, behind its principles. Despite this, the Discovery
message has yet to be reinforced by specific funding and its impact has so far been limited
within the cultural and higher education sectors.

2.2.6 Open content
In line with reductions in core and capital funding for universities (Section 2.2.2), including a
decrease in government grants available for the creation of digital content from cultural
collections over the past decade, there has been pressure to make resources available for wider
use. Although there have been funding cuts for mass digitisation (Section 2.2.3), projects which
generate OERs have gradually been given more funding by JISC as part of their E-Learning
Programme (JISC 2013b).19 Therefore, although VLEs are considered an essential tool to enable
the HE sector to cater for a wider student base, the benefits of content creation and use are not
intended to remain exclusively within the ‘walled garden’ (Jones, Pole et al.. 2012, 417) of the
institutional VLE. Although VLEs have become more relevant as a way of responding to
demands for flexibility and efficiency (White, Warren et al.. 2010), the political and funding
agenda has required that digital content needs to be usable by everyone and, although most

19

For instance, Phase 1 of this programme (2010-11) targeted £3.1million on the creation of OERs and Phase 2
(2011-12) invested £5million in continuing the creation of OERs and funding studies on their impact on teaching
practice (JISC 2013b). Phase 3 (2012-13) aimed to consolidate this work with the co-development of guidance on
the creation of OERs, with the Higher Education Academy (HEA) (ibid.).

40

VLEs are still regarded as ‘anti-connectivist’ in nature,20 some are being developed with open
access in mind. This has caused some universities to question the role of institutional data
repositories (such as museum, library and archive catalogues) and how these relate to the VLE,
to MOOCs and to wider forms of provision (Kay 2012).

JISC’s support for the creation of OERs reflects growing public expectations – translated in a
tranche of government policies and conditions attached to funding - not only for access to data
about cultural collections but the ability to use and re-use it. There is now an expectation from
funding bodies such as JISC and the HLF that universities and resource providers such as
museums, libraries and archives create material which is accessible to, and re-usable by, all.21
The justification for creating OERs is driven largely by the new realities of the ‘digital economy’
(Tapscott 1997) which require content and service providers to capitalise on the opportunities
offered by digital networking and communications technologies. A history of public investment
in digitisation is being used as a lever to encourage what the DCMS regards as more democratic
access to content. The UK government is also trying to strike a balance between access and
sustainability through the Digital Economy Act (2010) which aims to provide a regulatory basis

20

According to Mike Johnston, the VLE is guilty of ‘killing connections *with content on the world wide web+ for the
institution’s benefit’ (quoted in Cunningham 2009).
21

The HLF, a major source of project funding for museums, libraries and archive, stipulates that ‘digital outputs’
from projects funded by its ‘Sharing Heritage’ grant programme must be 'usable' and 'available', ‘free of charge
for non-commercial uses’, and ‘licensed for use by others under the Creative Commons licence 'Attribution Noncommercial' (CC BY-NC)’ for five years after project completion (HLF 2013b). Its guidance on digital outputs urged
projects to subscribe to the principles of the ‘open movement’ in terms of creating open file formats and open
source software (HLF 2012, 8-9). Although it does not define ‘usable’ it is clear from the guidance that this implies
inter-operability and less restrictive licensing.

41

for a complex and changing digital society. The Act aims to free up digital access to digital
content to generate more value for the end-user, whilst cracking down on illegal downloading
of commercial assets to protect business interests. The Blair government (1997-2007) also
promoted open data on the back of a social and economic agenda (digital inclusion and
increasing digital literacy were part of New Labour’s social and economic policy (Selwyn 2008))
as well as using digital technologies to find efficiency savings, although this has been reoriented
under the present Coalition government (2010 - ) to focus on provision of superfast broadband
rather than other causes of a ‘digital divide’ (Helsper and Kaczuba 2011).

Museums, libraries and archives in receipt of large government grants have been the first to
respond to demands for calls to make data more accessible and usable. In the Netherlands, the
decision by the Rijksmuseum to release 40,000 high quality images for public use per annum
(from 2013) marked a major shift in thinking about the question of use, albeit among
nationally-funded organisations (Siegal 2013). The Rijksmuseum’s reasons for releasing high
quality images were threefold: firstly, public investment had created the images so this was a
way of making them available to taxpayers; secondly, the income generated through image
sales was not enough to justify the costs of policing use; and, finally, to try to ensure that any
use of the images is of a certain quality (ibid.). Taco Dibbits, the Director of Collections, argued
that the issue of public ownership transcends the physical and digital collections at the
Rijksmuseum, ‘We’re a public institution, and so the art and objects we have are, in a way,
everyone’s property’ (ibid.). A number of other publicly funded institutions across Europe are
following suit, including the UK’s National Gallery and The National Gallery of Denmark
(Sanderhoff 2012). The readiness of others museums to contribute data to aggregators such as

42

Europeana, the use of open standards such the W3C22 open data standard, RDF ,23 by
organisations such as the British Museum (British Museum n.d.) which makes re-use of data
easier, and the encouragement of third party use of data via hack days (e.g. CultureHack 2014),
are signs that national and non-national museums are making efforts to make collections data
not only more accessible but more usable in new, previously unimagined ways.

At the same time the technological landscape for VLEs and educational resources is becoming
more open. A patent application registered by Blackboard in 2006 (USPTO 2012) has generated
a great deal of debate in educational circles because it calls into question the degree to which
universities are part of the equation in the provision and use of a VLE. As one of the largest
single suppliers of VLEs in UK Higher Education, Blackboard’s patent signals a change to the
centralised model of the VLE hitherto used across the largest universities. It states that,
an open platform system is provided such that anyone with access to the Internet can
create, manage, and offer a course to anyone else with access to the Internet without
the need for an affiliation with an institution, thus enabling the virtual classroom to
extend worldwide (ibid.).
This is significant in the present context of the move towards service-oriented approaches in
education, often involving open-source elements, and in changing the relationship between the
university-VLE (provider) and student (user). Proposing to decentralise control of VLEs has
caused a good deal of discussion in terms of the authority of universities and the growing
popularity of the peer-to-peer education movement (Subramanian and Goodman 2004)
embraced, to an extent, in new types of distance learning provision, discussed in Section 2.2.7.

2.2.7 Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs)
In response to the demand for more open content and facilitating wider access to Higher
Education using digital technologies, the recent growth of Massive Open Online Courses
(MOOCs) across the HE sector in the UK and further afield is redefining what is meant by a
digital learning environment and reshaping the relationship between course providers, content
and users. Although they come in many configurations, MOOCs were originally intended as
experiments which combine, ‘the connectivity of social networking, the facilitation of an
acknowledged expert in a field of study, and a collection of freely accessible online resources’
(McAuley, Stewart et al.. 2010, 4). A distinguishing feature of most MOOCs is ‘open, networked
participation’ (Stewart 2013, 229) with more significant peer-to-peer contact than is the case in
conventional VLEs. Another characteristic of MOOCs that distinguish them from more
traditional forms of online learning is scalability; MOOCs are designed to support ‘an indefinite
number of participants’ (Yuan and Powell 2013, 6). Regarded widely as taster sessions to
encourage participants to enrol in a full-time, fee-paying course, MOOCs have been praised for
the degree of access they provide to new audiences for HE and criticised for high attrition rates,
by-passing traditional models of student tuition and, more generally, their ‘privatisation’
(Vernon 2013) of Higher Education. The autonomous nature of most MOOCs and their greater
emphasis on heutagogy24 mirrors the loss of control of content creation in museums, libraries
and archives as traditional tutor-student relationships are redefined in favour of peer-to-peer
support (Levinson 2013). Stewart argued that MOOCs might have unintended benefits in
repositioning traditional roles,
it is the ways in which MOOCs open up questions of goal, purpose, and
teacher/student roles that make their massive scale so powerful (2013, 228).
24

Self-determined learning.

44

Others are less optimistic about the effect of MOOCs in Higher Education. In Digital Diploma
Mills: The Automation of Higher Education (1998) David Noble points to a convergence in the
relationship between the educational, government and technology sectors in the USA
embodied in VLEs and, most recently, the MOOC,
For the universities are not simply undergoing a technological transformation. Beneath
that change, and camouflaged by it, lies another: the commercialization of higher
education. For here as elsewhere technology is but a vehicle and a disarming disguise
(Noble 1998).
According to Noble, the dangers of MOOCs lie in the ‘commoditisation’ (ibid.) of education via
technology – courses run through systems with minimal instruction from experienced academic
staff. Noble emphasises the need to know how academic practitioners impact on the learner’s
experience within the VLE and also to look at the role of content.

Associated with the MOOC movement is a growing acknowledgement of the pedagogical
theory of connectivism which emphasises the importance of the connections between
specialised nodes or information sources in the process of learning and the value of the ‘now’ in
knowledge creation (Siemens 2005). This emphasis on connectivism is represented in so-called
‘cMOOCs’ which prioritise connectivism and the learning process more than ‘xMOOCs’ which
adopt a more content-based, behaviourist approach (Yuan and Powell 2013, 7). Regardless of
the pedagogical approach, both types of MOOC embody the principle of real time generation of
content from numerous sources online, and the repurposing of content created by others.
Given the scale of MOOCs, and the diversity of content used within them, this makes
addressing the question of how digital content created from cultural artefacts is used more
urgent.

45

2.2.8 Technological changes
Recent rapid changes in the technological landscape have made digital content creation and
content use easier and more widespread. This has changed user expectations and has impacted
on the way that the cultural and HE sectors work. Since the mid 1990s there has been a
dramatic increase in the development of Information Computer Technologies (ICT) on a
number of different fronts. Among these the most important are considered to be:25
growth and penetration of increasingly powerful, and more affordable, personal
computers
development of user-friendly interfaces
development of networking hardware and software, including mobile
development of web technologies often grouped under the umbrella term, Web 2.0
growth in bandwidth and improving compression technologies
use of ICT across the public and commercial sectors
increased digitisation across all media
Since this explosion in the use of ICT, there has been a continued growth in mass usage of
digital devices and services with the result that technology is now embedded in the lives of
students in the HE sector, and users of museums, libraries and archives. More than eight in ten
learners surveyed for the 2008 British Educational Communications and Technology Agency
(Becta) report Survey of FE learners and e-learning (GfKNOP 2007) had access to a computer in
the home, with the majority also having access to broadband. 63% of respondents stated they
found it ‘essential’ to use a computer to study (ibid., 11). Another study, ‘Student Expectations
Study: Key findings from online research and discussion evenings held in June 2007 for the Joint
25

Based on a list compiled by Dunn (2003).

46

Information Systems Committee’ (IpsosMORI 2007), further underlined the confidence and
expectations prospective students have of using technology in higher education. Personal
ownership of ICT and the growth of platforms where content based on cultural artefacts might
be accessed and shared – Flickr, YouTube, Pinterest, blogs, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram –
has meant that the means of production (of digital content) is becoming increasingly
decentralised . Although many cultural institutions have responded to this by establishing a
presence on the same platforms, it is clear that user-generated content and the ability of users
of content to also be producers remains ‘a challenge for museums’ (Ridge 2007). There has also
been an increase in the number of universities setting up mobile learning environments in
response to a spread in ownership of mobile devices and demands for ‘any time, any place
learning’ (City College Southampton 2005) and a growth in the use of collaborative course
authoring software (such as iSpring, and Udutu) which facilitate peer-to-peer and student-totutor communication outside the institutional VLE (MindOnSite 2014).

Over the past decade, the generative technologies needed for mass digitisation have also
become more sophisticated and user-driven. The growth of 3D scanning in museums and a
general trend towards user control post-capture, such as the increased use of RTI (Reflectance
Transformation Imaging) scanning allows users to vary light conditions in order to view surface
details (Diaz-Guardamino and Wheatley 2014), marks a shift in the possibilities of digitisation
and in user demands for more flexible, usable content. The combined use of 3D scanning and
3D printing technologies, which allow the replication of physical artefacts for research or
commercial purposes, also emphasises the need to know more about how users interact with
artefacts if museums are to make 3D images available while recapturing value from the end-

47

user. A gradual realisation by museums that websites are not simply a brochure for, or replica
of, the physical site is perhaps responsible for technical developments to create what Piacente's
(1996) in her tripartite typology of museum websites termed ‘true interactives’, i.e. that digital
artefacts could offer something distinctive. Akin to the move to create a presence on social
media platforms and come to terms with user-generated content (UGC), the introduction of
self-service digitisation units in libraries and archives (e.g. University of Virginia Library 2014)
that allow users to scan paper-based items for their own use before adding this to the
institution’s digital repository, are attempts to capture value from end-users and
simultaneously create and deliver relevant, usable content. Encouraging and enabling digital
volunteerism via the editing of database records (such as the recent crowdsourcing initiative at
the National Library of Finland which asked volunteers to check transcriptions created using
optical character recognition software (frollein2007 n.d.) or the cropping of images (for
example the V&A Museum’s Beta Crowdsourcing initiative (V&A Museum n.d.)) is another sign
that cultural organisations are slowly regarding end-users as co-producers of content. Although
issues still exist around what is done with UGC, its status alongside the official institutional
record, and rights relating to use, its user-centred nature represents a potential opportunity to
find out how users are creating and interacting with digital artefacts.

2.2.9 Value and use
So what does this mean for the use of artefacts in VLEs? The institutional ownership of VLEs
and the ‘walled garden’ (Jones, Pole et al.. 2012) approach to education is certainly being
challenged in terms of the control of face-to-face teaching and e-learning, so too the exclusivity

48

of VLEs. Museums, libraries, and archives are under a similar pressure to come to terms with a
challenge which is,
not so much to remonetise a product that the Internet has turned into free content as to
recapture the cultural value that the discourse of new media has ostensibly shifted
outside their walls (Rumbold 2010, 320).
Rumbold points out that ‘value has always resided not in things, but in the way we talk about
them’ (2010, 335) a quality which, in the context of Web 2.0, should reassure the cultural and
HE sectors whose value might still lie in filtering and ‘the way we talk about’ things given their
closeness to subject and object in a more distributed discussion. Perhaps because of a
restriction in funding for digitisation and access initiatives, ‘Lean philosophy’ (Bhasin and
Burcher 2006) which seeks to reduce wastage on any activities which does not bring value to
the customer – might also be adding to the change in value systems between museums and
their ‘consumers’. Rumbold adds that ‘”Access” has gradually been superseded by a more
active language of “participation” and “engagement”’ (2010, 321). So, what has changed is the
expectation that resources need to be more than accessible in the cultural sector - they need to
be usable and sustainable. In the HE sector, arguably, the shift has been more about the value
of discourse since the unique value universities are providing – content guidance, teaching, and
accreditation – will still be of worth. In an environment where educational resources are more
accessible (such as MOOCs), universities as guides through abundance are more important –
but they also have a role to play in determining what is produced from primary source material.
Therefore, both the cultural and HE sectors are repositioning themselves in response to the
open movement and changes in how content is created and valued. The walls of the museum
and the confines of VLEs are both being challenged as the terms of value creation move beyond
access to creativity and use (Rumbold 2010, 313).

49

2.2.10 Identity crisis
The perceived shift in the control of value to users described by Rumbold has been
accompanied by something of an identity crisis in the cultural sector. The current economic
climate might be in part responsible for uncertainty in the museum, library and archive
professions as the number of curatorial staff has decreased (Steel 2013). However, the advent
of Web 2.0 and new opportunities for individuals to be producers as well as users of content
(O'Reilly 2005) have had an impact on the gatekeeping role of curators, librarians and archivists.
Speaking at a curatorial symposium, entitled ‘Are Curators Unprofessional?: Group Practices’
hosted by the Banff International Curatorial Institute in November 2010, Ann Demeester,
Director of de Appel and Head of the de Appel Curatorial Programme in Amsterdam said that a
‘major threat’ is, ‘the cult of the amateur, arising from free, shared, unverified information on
the Internet and the blogosphere, wherein anyone can publish opinions’ (Tousley 2010).
Therefore, UGC is considered by Demeester to be a direct ‘threat’ to the curatorial profession.
At the same event, no consensus was reached on a definition of ‘curator’ except that it is an
‘unstable term’ (ibid.).

This questioning of the role of curator is also evident in the UK. For example, in a listserve
exchange of the Museum Computer Group in July 2012 on the decrease in numbers of
curatorial staff in UK museums, a Museums Access Collections Officer from the West Midlands
asked, ‘Curators – what are they?’ (Ellis 2012) indicating that not only numbers are down but
the role might be changing. Added to this, the term ‘curate’ has been used more generally
beyond the museums profession to mean anything from celebrity management of an arts
festival (Michaels 2010) to selecting digital material to ‘curate your virtual life’ (Bea 2012), or

50

the creation / curation of musical playlists (Robinson 2012). The wider appropriation of the
term and feelings of insecurity within the profession might well be connected. According to
Obadare, new technologies have also changed radically the role of librarians who, ‘must ensure
that there is effective and efficient flow of information from the generators to users of
information in the digital environment’ (Obadare n.d.). As far back as 2003, one archivist noted
that the ‘craze’ of digitisation and the ‘infusion of technology’ unsettled both archivists and
librarians,
With the expanded use of technology, librarians and archivists were suddenly
overshadowed by their new cousin - Information Technology [...] Sadly, instead of
strengthening the identity, the abilities, and the respect of librarians and archivists, IT
eroded their positions (Salter 2003).
The lack of certainty within the cultural sector could, as Salter suggest, be a consequence of the
fast pace of change in technology and the impact of up-skilling. Digital projects are, by their
nature, inter-disciplinary and the involvement of other professions in the process of digitisation
might have contributed to feelings of insecurity and para-professionalism (ibid.). This
professional self-analysis makes understanding the process of supplying digital artefacts,
understanding the role of practitioners in this, and examining the dynamics between
professions, more important.

2.2.11 Situation review: Conclusion
In sum, both user demands and economics have been behind changes in UK Government policy
and this has affected the way that funding is distributed for digitisation and for the use of ICT in
education. As funding for digitisation has contracted in the past five years, funding bodies and

51

organisations who care for or use research collections are asking themselves how this content
has actually been used and how they can continue to sustain access to it (JISC 2005, 2). In other
words, the policy and funding agenda has shifted from creation to end-use of content.
Conversely, because content is expected to be more available and more usable, value
appropriation, or securing a return on investment, has become more dependent on the enduser and how they create value. User-generated content, open educational resources and
MOOCs all challenge the way that content has traditionally been delivered by the HE and
cultural sectors, and how they derive value from it. They also raise issues around ownership
and control. Therefore, how digital artefacts are created and how value is created from them
requires a greater understanding of the process of supply and use, and the relationship
between people and processes. The next section reviews extant research in this area.

2.3 Literature Review

2.3.1 Introduction
Before surveying published studies relating to the main research area, what lies behind the
presentation of an artefact online? Behind the presentation of an artefact and metadata online
– such as the example given in Figure 1 - lies a supply chain of people and processes which,
determine how an artefact is represented and what information is and is not made available to
the end-user.

52

Figure 1. Screenshot of a page from the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust’s online database
embedded in a course module in Canvas, a VLE by Instructure

In this example, featuring a Staffordshireware figurine of William Shakespeare, everything from
the selection of the artefact from a museum, library or archive collection, to the way that the
artefact has been captured digitally (incorporating choices in imagining such as camera angle,
lighting, resolution, white balance etc) and information that is captured in cataloguing (date,
provenance, description, size, weight, etc), has been decided by individuals involved in a supply
chain. Equally, decisions have been made about the nature of the user interface with the
artefact, determining the affordances and limitations of the context in which the digital artefact
will be used.26

To what extent has this transformation of physical objects into digital artefacts been studied
and what research has been carried out on the influence of decision makers in the digital supply
chain? Also, what research has been conducted on end-use within digital learning
26

In the example there are two contexts: the online database in which this item appears and the virtual learning
environment – Canvas - in which the catalogue record has been embedded.

53

environments and how has this been carried out? To answer these questions, the literature
review in this chapter will examine four main areas:
Digital supply chain: the people and processes involved in creating and using digital
artefacts
Basic processes of use: how artefacts are actually used in the process of interaction
Environment: the effect of context on artefact use
Previous research methods: methodologies that might be used to investigate the
research questions

2.3.2 Digital supply chain
Three areas related to the supply of digital artefacts are examined in turn: processes, products
and people.

2.3.2.1 Digital supply chain: Processes
As pointed out above, the digital supply chain is made up of people and processes that
determine the shape and use potential of a product,27 the digital artefact. The processes
involved typically in supplying digital artefacts from museum, library and archive collections for
use are analogous broadly to most manufacturing supply chains. Beamon defines a supply chain
as, ‘an integrated set of business functions, encompassing all activities from raw material
acquisition to final customer delivery’(1988, 105) . In the case of creating and supplying digital
artefacts, the ‘raw material’ is the physical artefact (or in the case of born-digital material,
27

The use potential of a product is the scope of use, or variety of ways in which an artefact may be used.

54

which originates in digital form, the artefact in its native state) which must be selected,
digitised, catalogued and made available through a user interface before it is able to be utilised
by an end-user. Table 1 sets out some of the main activities and agents (those responsible for
directly or indirectly carrying out an activity) involved in a typical journey from the physical
artefact to the creation of a digital catalogue record, and then use in a digital learning
environment.

Table 1. Activities and agents involved in the supply of digital artefacts

Although there are numerous ways in which digitisation and packaging of content can take
place and great variety in who is involved (for instance involving end-users in the selection of
artefacts or even the creation of images and metadata), Table 1 itemises the activities that

55

constitute the main stages of digitisation and those normally in control of the process of
creating digital artefacts from cultural collections.28 The basic workflow following selection of
artefacts for digitisation (usually by those who manage collections, the content providers),
begins with capture involving numerous decisions around methods of creating a multimedia
record of the artefact (equipment used, lighting conditions, camera angles, etc) and recording
metadata (technical information associated with the process of capture, as well as details about
the artefact likely to be of interest to end-users). As Eadie points out, the act of conversion
from analogue (the physical artefact) to digital brought about by capture is highly partial,
A fundamental point to note from any digitisation process is that the binary or digital
channels are relatively narrow, and only a partial representation of an analogue object can
ever be rendered in digital form. In other words, the digital object can ever only be a
version of the real thing. The digitiser therefore has to make informed decisions about what
level of detail is required in the digital version of an object, for that digital version to serve
its intended purpose (Eadie 2005).

A process of selection to retain images considered most suitable before high resolution images
are compressed for use within a digital assets management system (DAMS) again introduces
more decision-making into the supply chain as choices are made about which images to save,
the degree of compression (ultimately leading to data loss in the compressed file) and which
DAMS product is chosen to store images and metadata, and make them available for end-use.
These technical stages are normally conducted with or wholly by technical specialists. Metadata
entry and management of rights usually falls to content providers (cultural organisations)
before three stages (h-j) of making data available for use online. Finally, for use within a virtual
learning environment, digital artefacts would typically be selected and imported into a VLE or

56

linked to it by an academic tutor. Behind every step in the process of digitisation are a number
of ‘informed decisions’ made by the content provider and / or the digitiser. As Eadie notes,
The notion of 'fit for purpose' is central to all digitisation processes. To make decisions
on any technical issue, the digitiser must have a clear understanding of how they
expect the digital object to be utilised (ibid.).
But to what extent does the research corpus examine how ‘fit for purpose’ is arrived at?
Even though much has been published on the development of digitisation activities, the vast
majority of studies have been written from the perspective of content providers or technical
specialists; few studies have looked at the connection between activities and agents. For
example, research on issues surrounding digital preservation (e.g. Gladney et al. 2005; Ross
2007), digital content lifecycles (e.g. McLeod 2006) and metadata standards (e.g. McKenna and
Loof 2009) reflects internal concerns within museums, libraries and archives around
preservation and accessibility rather than studies conducted outside the sector which examine
the impact of the cultural sector itself on the provision of content. Much of this sector-focused
research has examined the challenges of sustaining access to digital collections and futureproofing content against changes in technology (Karvonen 2010) and is passed on to the
cultural sector via practical guides written by funding bodies (JISC 2008). Indeed, the ‘who’ of
digitisation in many of these practical guides has most often involved only the decision whether
to digitise in-house, to outsource, or to work with partners (Karvonen 2010, 217) rather than
focus on the partiality of the process itself.

57

2.3.2.2

Digital supply chain: Products

Another corpus of research reflects a well-established interest among humanists (and digital
humanists) on the ramifications of digitisation in terms of the relative qualities of the physical
artefact and its digital surrogate. Much of the research thinking has focused on the effect of
digitisation on notions of value (Gell 1992) and authenticity (Bearman and Trant 1998) and how
the physical artefact relates to forms of digital representations. Klaus Müller in his essay,
‘Museums and Virtuality’ (2010) explores a shift in the role of museums from information
interpreters to information providers and asks a fundamental question which many
practitioners rushing to digitise might not have stopped to ask, namely, ‘do virtual
reproductions simply mimic their real counterparts?’ (ibid., 296). This question is prompted by
Müller’s assertion that, ‘museums are still struggling to find the connection between the reality
of an artefact and its virtual representation [...] Digitization is more than a reproduction
technique’ (ibid.). This echoes the seminal work of Walter Benjamin (1936), André Malraux
(1951), and others in coming to terms with the differences between the original artefact and its
technologically-dependent surrogate. The importance of an artefact’s context and what Müller
terms its meaning-potential (2010, 300), and how this sits with museums’ new role as providers
of information rather than interpreters or ‘set-dressers’, is not fully addressed in this essay but
Müller does set out recommendations to exploit the space, time, connectivity, accessibility,
depth, and production value advantages of virtual representation over the traditional space of
the museum. In doing so, Müller conveys an optimism in what he believes to be the new role of
museums using digital technologies to offer versatility and a means of participation. In a similar
vein, Frost’s work examining virtuality and learning from artefacts stresses that a new ‘digital
literacy’ (2010, 244) should build on the ‘strengths and limitations of digital representations so

58

that they can enhance, not replace, the real world experience of an object’ (ibid.), employing
the advantages of digital representations (24/7 access, ability to present contextual info,
interactivity and ability to reach a wider audience) without competing with the qualities of the
real thing and the real visit. Prosser and Eddisford also note the qualitative differences between
the physical and the virtual but in a way which is more technophilic,
Many museums are failing themselves and their users by creating a digital pastiche of
the physical museum, rather than seizing the opportunity to extend and enhance the
museum learning experience offered by effective use of ICT (Prosser and Eddisford
2004).

Bandelli (2010) points to the advantages of blurring the real and virtual in the museum, also
helping to depolarise the physical-digital debate. In a similar way, Hawkey points out that
digital technologies can not only support traditional learning tasks but can allow new activities
to take place. Digital technologies allow learning experiences to be tailored to the individual,
In many ways the opposite of collaboration, digital technologies also facilitate
personalisation (2004, 3).
In other words, new technologies can provide choice for users. However easy it is to distinguish
between real and virtual visitors, the difference between real and virtual learners is much more
difficult to make (ibid., 10). Deciding what is special about the particular nature of learning in
virtual environments is tricky: much of educational theory is brought about from observations
and experiments in the traditional environment of the classroom. However, Hawkey is more
optimistic about the benefits of using digital technologies and artefacts and rises above the
weariness of discussions on value distinctions between physical and digital environments.

59

2.3.2.3

Digital supply chain: People

Whilst there have been numerous studies on the technical aspects of digitisation, what work
has been done on the influence of decision-makers in the digital supply chain? Research by
Ooghe and Moreels (2009) on the first activity listed in Table 1, the selection of artefacts and its
role in digitisation, draw attention to the importance of what has been termed ‘supply chain
visibility’ (Goh, Souza et al. 2009). Ooghe and Moreel’s study, funded by the Flemish
Government, investigated key points in the digitisation, preservation and digital archiving of
(primarily) audiovisual documents. Although their study did not gather new data, their close
reading of published standards and advice, and an international survey of current practice,
points out the absence of a ‘detailed frame of reference’ (Ooghe and Moreels 2009) to inform
decisions made on what is selected for digital capture. The study points out that,
current practices are characterised by disparate approaches, different terminologies
and a lack of open communication on the selection decisions that are being made.
Some might suggest that selection needn't take place at all (ibid.).
The authors recognise that the failure to make decisions on selection apparent makes the
process of digitisation seem arbitrary and, therefore, similar to content generated outside
‘memory institutions’ (ibid.). This paves the way for a ‘bottom-up approach to cultural
valuation’ (ibid.) as museums, libraries and archives become just one of a myriad of providers of
artefact-based content available online. Although Ooghe and Moreels’ research moves some
way towards uncovering the processes and people behind digitisation, its need to clarify
decision-making and standardise approaches leads to fixed categories of criteria which might
actually perpetuate rather than end a lack of transparency. Their research also stops short of
examining the criteria behind other aspects of digitisation, both explicit and implicit.

60

Bas van Heur’s paper, ‘From analogue to digital and back again: institutional dynamics of
heritage innovation’ (van Heur 2010), also scrutinises decision-making involved in the creation
of what he terms the ‘digital imperative’ (ibid., 405). Based on observations of a case study
involving the development of a cultural heritage management policy for the city of Maastricht
in 2002, van Heur deconstructs a decision-making process that might colloquially be termed
‘sleepwalking’ towards a digital solution. Although not directly related to the production of
digital artefacts, his analysis of interactions between practitioners and the course that the
project took, draws attention to the influence of different groups of practitioners and a
tendency towards technological solutions for cultural problems, in this case the presentation of
a cultural biography of Maastricht. The dynamics between individuals with different skills and
interests played a pivotal role in shaping the ‘logic’ and direction of the project,
diverging forms of expertise between the main actors produced a division between
infrastructural logic and content logic from the very beginning that shaped almost all
following discussions (ibid., 411).
According to the author, skills gaps between practitioners and different expectations around
technology outcomes led to the ‘‘black-boxing’ of the digital infrastructure’ (ibid., 413) as
reasons behind decision-making became obscured during the course of the project. Although
the methods used in this study were not especially innovative, the emphasis on ‘a less
technology-centric and more contextual understanding of digital heritage’ (ibid., 405) and its
focus on practitioner groups is useful given the multi-disciplinary focus of many projects
involving digital technologies and collaborations between the HE and cultural sectors
mentioned in the situation review (Section 2.2). The intersection between technological and
social determinism also makes this study particularly valuable.

61

McCrary recognises the socio-political dimensions of digital representation in his paper ‘The
Political Nature of Digital Cultural Heritage’ (2011). In an examination of changes occurring
within museums, libraries and archives, McCrary notes that,
It is now generally accepted that many heritage institutions provide interpretations
and representations of the world, rather than the actual objects themselves (359).
The author continually contests the objectivity of the process of digitisation against social,
cultural and political power frameworks which seek to commodify the experience of interacting
with artefacts. McCrary makes the distinction between representation and experience through
digital capture,
Distinctions can be drawn between using digitization as a technological tool with which
to represent the artifact itself or as a mode of interaction to extend the engagement of
the viewer’s experience of the artefact (sic). (361).
This strategic view of digitisation helps to contextualise decision-making within the digital
supply chain and helpfully sets the process of supplying digital artefacts against a grander
political narrative.

Bijker’s concept of the ‘technological frame’ (University of Missouri-St Louis n.d.) seeks to
explain ecologies of interpretation between practitioner communities where dominant and less
dominant ‘frames’, or ways of interpreting, vie in the application of technology to a particular
problem. Bijker regards artefacts as focal points for interaction and ‘structural couplers’
between communities, a theory which fits well within the field of the ‘Social Shaping of
Technology’ (Williams and Edge 1996) which focuses on the non-linear nature of the
development of technology and the effects of different communities who shape, and are
shaped by, technologies (Chandler 1996). Ludwick Fleck’s ‘thought collective’ concept,

62

introduced in 1930, offers a rationale for the dynamics between collaborators in the HE and
cultural sectors. Fleck postulated that knowledge and meaning are grounded in communities
that reproduce social practice. What he termed ‘thought style’ or traditions of thinking ‘easily
overpowers any rationality or logical construction of individual thinking’ (quoted in Tuomi 2002
,111) and dovetails with Bijker’s evolutionary theories on dominance and determinism among
practitioner groups.

The theory of communities of practice (CoPs), co-developed by the cognitive anthropologist,
Etienne Wenger and Jean Lave, following studies of apprenticeship in West Africa in 1991, and
subsequently developed by Wenger (with major publications in 1998, 2002, 2009) provides a
lens through which to examine the influence of practitioners and end-users’ on the process of
digitisation and to explain why they might interact with digital artefacts in particular ways.
According to Wenger, communities of practice are, ‘groups of people who share a concern or
passion for something they do and learn how to do it better as they interact regularly’ (Wenger
2013). Wenger describes a community of practice along three main dimensions: its members
identify with a common domain of knowledge and steward that knowledge together, they
engage with others within the community as they learn together how to solve common
problems, and they put that knowledge and learning into practice. Wenger states that any
individual is normally a member of more than one community of practice; these can range from
a knitting club or an academic discipline to what might be considered more traditional
professional groups like the subjects of Wenger’s original studies: midwives, tailors and
quartermasters. Since people's relationship to, and perception of, objects are socially and
culturally dependent (Appadurai 1998, 5) the attractiveness of Wenger’s theory is that it

63

proposes one way of bridging the gap between people and processes in the supply and use of
digital artefacts. Its focus on tracing the behaviour of individuals to their engagement in a wider
social and learning context, and how knowledge they steward as a CoP might influence how
they act as a part of the digital supply chain, or as an end-user, offers one way of tackling a
complex problem and makes it a potentially valuable conceptual tool. In other words, shared
ways of seeing, thinking and acting could explain a great deal about how individuals supply and
use artefacts.

Although Wenger’s theory has been developed to account for different contexts, for example
cultivating CoPs in a corporate environment (2002) and online (2009), and has been referenced
across a large research corpus on social learning theory, it has attracted some criticism and has
seldom been used in the context of digital cultural heritage. Roberts draws attention to a
number of weaknesses and limitations in the concept of communities of practice. Among these
is a lack of development in the definition of community, given the different ways that
individuals now interact online (Roberts 2006, 632). Developing Wenger’s theory to account for
new types of relations between practitioners, Brown and Duguid’s concept of ‘networks of
practice’ (Brown and Duguid 2001, 205) offers an ‘info-centric’ alternative to communities of
practice and is defined as ‘people who work on a similar practice within the same institutional
framework’ as opposed to CoPs who are ‘located in the same space and time’ (Lave 1991, 69).
While there is a difference between the fixity Brown and Duguid impose on communities of
practice and Lave’s description of a CoP (which can be distributed in space and time), their
loosening of the definition of a CoP to account for electronic networks is an attempt to consider
new community contexts. Roberts also challenged the temporal nature of CoPs, some of which

64

form over a long period of time, while others are fleeting. Roberts drew on Bourdieu’s (1990)
construct of the habitus, the behaviour and beliefs of a particular social groups acquired
through experience, to challenge the idea that meaning is formed through the negotiation of
members of a CoP (Gherardi, Nicolini et al.. 1998; Mutch 2003) and might rely more on what
Roberts termed the ‘predisposition’ (Roberts 2006, 629) of individuals. Lindkvist (2005)
developed a variation of communities of practice which took this into account in the form of
‘collectivities of practice’ (1189), to refer to temporary groups or project teams concerned with
knowledge creation and exchange.

The connection between practice and linguistics has also been identified as an area that
requires development. Tusting (2005) contends that a theory of language is needed specifically
for communities of practice because Wenger does not go into any depth on the importance of
language in the process of meaning making (ibid., 36). Tusting also considered Wenger’s theory
has too much focus on how CoPs maintain their existence rather than how they change,
according to Tusting an essential pre-condition for learning (ibid., 43). Overall, it is perhaps the
versatility of Wenger’s theory that has invited most forms of criticism; its ability to be applied in
a wide range of scenarios inevitably raises questions on validity especially against the context of
rapid changes in technology and in the workplace.

Nevertheless, the theory of communities of practice has been applied widely to a diverse range
of fields from social care (Easen, Atkins et al.. 2000) to management (Lesser and Storck 2001)
(McDermott 2010) and formal learning (Lipman 1988; Brown and Campione 1990; Scardamalia
and Bereiter 1993; Roth 1996; Barab and Duffy 2000; Grossman 2001; O'Keeffe 2009). Steve

65

Herne’s paper, ‘Communities of Practice in Art and Design and Museum and Gallery Education’
(2006), utilises Wenger’s theory in exploring the differences between two CoPs - art and design
teachers, and museum and gallery educators – in how they conceive of ‘critical and conceptual’
studies (ibid., 1). It uses data gathered from interviewing members of each CoP and discourse
analysis to explore differing understandings and perceptions of two groups recruited from the
HE and cultural sectors. Drawing on the work of Star (1989), Herne identifies several ‘boundary
issues’ between the two CoPs and proposes a number of ways to ‘broker’ (2006, 26) interaction
across boundaries. Herne calls for greater self-awareness of the influence of ‘social processes
by which their discourse and practice is constructed’ (ibid., 27) and the development of transinstitutional CoPs based on ‘boundary practices’ (ibid.).

David McConnell’s (2006) work in investigating the dynamics between users in VLEs also
focused on group dynamics but in a digital learning environment. Borrowing from C. Geertz’s
(1973) use of ethnographic tools and methods to interpret an e-learning groups’ social
discourse, McConnell tracked, codified and analysed interactions among students within a VLE.
Although not solely concerned with content interaction and delivery, McConnell’s application
of the communities of practice model to e-learning and the VLE is an acknowledgement of the
value of examining patterns of user behaviour employing Wenger’s theory.
However, the application of CoP theory to specific areas of HE and cultural sector activity, few
studies have applied Wenger’s theory to the various communities of practice engaged in the
digitisation of cultural artefacts or the use of digital artefacts produced.

2.3.2.4

Digital supply chain: Conclusion

Summing up, perhaps as a result of pressure to increase the pace of digitisation (Atkinson
2011), much of the research on the digital supply chain is focused on the technical process of
digitisation and the value of virtualising collections, rather than on the complexities of the
digital supply chain and the process of end-use. Little attention has been paid to investigating
social determinism in the supply chain – assessing the influence of decision makers and
assessing their impact on end-use of the digital artefact produced - or deconstructing the
process of use itself.

2.3.3

Basic processes of use

This section examines to what extent previous research activity has probed how digital
artefacts are actually used. It firstly looks at research activity in libraries and archives,
predominantly ‘service-led’ approaches and studies on information retrieval. Research on how
artefacts are used in museums is then the focus of review, as well as work done on image
usability, the utilisation of web analytics to describe usage behaviour and, finally, on the use of
artefacts in digital learning environments.

2.3.3.1 Basic processes of use: Libraries and service-led approaches
Generally speaking, research on usage behaviour among library users is far more advanced than
that carried out in museums and archives but this has tended to be service-led and lacks
conceptualisation and theorisation. For instance, the JISC-funded User Behaviour

67

Observational Study conducted by the CIBER team at University College London in 2010 focused
on business and economics scholars’ use of digital resources (such as e-books) and sought to
‘demonstrate the issues that real users (students and researchers) face when navigating the
Web and interacting with scholarly resources’ (2010, 7). The evidence base for the study was
four projects focusing on analysing ‘digital usage and information seeking’ (ibid.), all part of the
‘Virtual Scholar’ programme funded by JISC. Log analysis methods29 were used and two of the
projects also employed questionnaires to gather data on usage. The study found that although
business and economics scholars shared the same basic behaviour as other virtual users, there
were also distinctive patterns of use of resources. For instance, variations in the usage of ebooks and e-textbooks, different rates of bouncing, and a marked preference for most current
(as opposed to older) material were found between the two disciplines. The study by CIBER is
useful in probing the link between usage behaviour and academic discipline through its focus
on basic information literacy,30 but its sole focus on library e-resources limits it scope.

In a similar study, Levine-Clark (2007) tested the use of library electronic resources among
different disciplines. Levine-Clark examined ‘intra-artefact’ patterns of use (for example, dwell
times on cover pages of e-publications) and developed a variety of metrics (for example, page
views, format), providing more granularity in the description of usage of library materials. The
study also compared institutions and subjects, access points or gateways (e.g. Google Scholar),
advanced or basic search, type of article viewed, age of article, and so on. Levine-Clark found
29

Log analysis is the ‘use of data stored in transaction logs of Web search engines, Intranets, and Web sites..[to]
[...] provide valuable insight into understanding the information-searching process of online searchers’ (Jansen
2006, 407).
30

Information literacy is ‘about the abilities to know when to find, to search for, evaluate and make sense of the
content’ (JISC 2009).

68

some subject differences in terms of information-seeking behaviour and frequency of use of ebooks among humanities, business, social science and science faculty students. The
methodology used by Levine-Clark linked attitudinal data in questionnaires to web log data of
the same users to gain a better understanding of users' behaviour. However, this top-down
method of describing usage behaviour necessarily restricts the results since subjects’ use of
electronic resources was tested against categories already developed heuristically by
researchers rather than developing these from the evidence.

Tenopir (2003) has provided a useful overview of research in the use of electronic library
resources. Her report was an attempt to draw conclusions from over 200 separate studies
conducted between 1995 and 2003 which looked at library users’ preferences, motivations and
behaviour, using a variety of methods. One of the author’s main findings recognises a
connection between user background and use behaviour with electronic resources,
Experts in different subject disciplines (work fields) have different usage patterns and
preferences for print or electronic. There is no one right solution for services or system
design for every subject discipline (ibid., iv).
In a deconstruction of the ‘fallacy’ (28) that there is a typical user, Tenopir looks at various
studies to note factors which affect end-use. Other than discipline, the author states that,
‘Differences in motivation or task also cause variations in information seeking and use’ (29). In
doing so, she cites the work of Nelson (2001), King and Montgomery (2002), and Rudner,
Miller-Whitehead, and Gellman (2002) which all found that staff and students engaged in
primary research had different usage behaviour to undergraduates and staff not engaged in
such research.

69

A great deal of research on the use of archives (Duff 2002; Anderson 2004; Harris 2005;
Sundqvist 2007) and library resources (Siatri 1999; Carr 2006) has taken the form of usability
evaluations with a view to improving performance rankings for a particular service in line with
such standards (2006) set by bodies as the Public Services Quality Group (PSQG). There have
been a limited number of studies which speak about ethnographic methods with service
improvements in mind, but most of these (e.g. Nardi and O’Day 1999) stop short of practical
application. An exception might be Seadle’s (2000) use of cultural anthropological methods to
analyse the behaviour of nine ‘cultures’ or groups of individuals such as engineers and librarians
who are involved a project to develop the National Gallery of the Spoken Word (NGSW) set up
by the National Science Foundation in the USA in 1998. Perhaps because of the linguistic nature
of the collections being built, it is no surprise that Seadle focuses on language use between
practitioners as the focus of his research concluding that,
useful evaluation of digital library services needs to include an understanding of the
nuances of the meaning and connotation, implication and limitation, for a wide range
of vocabulary across the many micro-cultures involved (ibid., 384).
Although not geared towards artefact use, Seadle’s paper is a rare attempt in library studies to
use alternative methods to examine tensions between communities of practice manifested in
discoursal barriers. This is important because, as pointed out in Chapter 1, the cultural and HE
sectors are being encouraged to collaborate in the creation of artefact-based educational
resources and communication between different practitioner groups is a crucial aspect of
partnership working (Mohr and Spekman 2006, 135).

70

2.3.3.2 Basic processes of use: Information retrieval
In library information science, much research attention has been focused on information
retrieval (Tenopir 2009) rather than different ways of using collections. For instance, Armitage
et al.’s (1997) study on gauging user needs in accessing moving image material is focused on
the categorisation of requests rather than what is actually done once this material has been
found. Equally, the focus of work carried out by Ornager (1997) concerns indexing and
information retrieval rather than end-use. Although there is an increasing body of research on
user-centred indexing and folksonomy (e.g. Matusiak 2006), the vast majority of studies on user
interaction with library collections remain service-driven rather than use-driven per se.

One possible reason for the lack of research on the basic processes of artefact use could be that
cultural repositories have been customers of database providers rather than innovators
(Veldof, Prasse et al.. 1999, 121). Rather than being in the driving seat, museums, libraries and
archives are themselves users in the digital supply chain and have limited abilities in changing
the way that end-users can find and interact with cultural collections. As Veldof points out,
Librarians sometimes became like triage nurses, soothing over frayed patron nerves
and providing as much help as they possibly could to make online experiences
successful. (ibid., 121).
This might have impacted on the type of research which has taken place on use as libraries and
end-users are locked in to particular proprietary databases.

71

2.3.3.3 Basic processes of use: Museums and the physical
In museums, most research attention has been paid to the use potential of physical artefacts
and to web analytics (as a reflection of use) than to detailed studies of interaction with digital
artefacts. Much of the museological literature on artefact use draws uncritical attention to the
value of using physical artefacts (Hooper-Greenhill 2007; Chatterjee 2010a) particularly in
children’s learning (Hein 1998), informal learning scenarios (Falk and Dierking 2000) and in the
context of object handling sessions (Chatterjee 2010b). Much of this research is based on an
ideological belief that artefact-based learning is unquestionably beneficial (Durbin, Morris et al..
1990). Simpson and Hammond’s research (2012) comparing the use of physical artefacts and
digital surrogates at Macquarie University is valuable because it tests the relative impact on
didactic learning of the use of physical artefacts and digital surrogates over a period of time.
However, no studies have been found which focus on how users actually interact with artefacts
(physical or digital) rather than what they could do or ought to do. A failure to problematise
artefact use has meant that empirical research which might support assumptions about the use
value of museum artefacts in physical and digital form has been lacking. In fact, far more
studies exist in material cultures research based on ethnological investigations (e.g. Pearce
1992, 217) into historic use of artefacts and what this tells us about their original use, than
present use of the same artefact.

However, there are a few notable advances in probing physical artefact use in a learning
context. Duff and Cherry’s (2000) investigation of the use of Early Canadiana employed user
surveys, an analysis of server logs, and focus group sessions to gauge how end-users were
utilising artefacts in different forms (original artefacts, microfiche, and online) in research.

72

Audio tapes of focus group sessions were transcribed verbatim and analysed qualitatively
(presumably using Grounded Theory, a content analysis31 method which involves the discovery
of theory in data (Glaser and Strauss 1999, 1), although this is not made explicit). Transcripts
were coded independently for themes by two researchers. A valuable tactic of Duff and
Cherry’s was post-session questioning about use via a questionnaire which,
asked people how long they spent using the item today, their reason for using it, how
they used it, what features they used, and how satisfied they were with the format of
the item they had just used (2000).
Data was then deepened by asking about forms of use in a focus group afterwards. The primary
focus of Duff and Cherry’s research was a comparison of use between a webpage, paper, and
microfiche and they conclude that the connection between the physical artefact and any
surrogates needs to be made clear to users to alleviate concerns around value. However,
conceptualisation of the data might have revealed elements of artefact use shared by all users
across all media, or allowed Duff and Cherry to interpolate behavioural patterns according to
the demographic of participants.

Overall, research on artefact use in museums has been ideologically driven and confined,
largely, to the use of physical collections in formal and informal learning. Arguably, there are
considerable gaps in our understanding of the mechanics of artefact use because of underlying
assumptions about the individuality of interaction, particularly when encountered at first hand.
This is discussed in more detail in Section 2.3.5.4.

31

Defined by Holsti as ‘any technique for making inferences by objectively and systematically identifying specified
characteristics of messages’ (1969).

73

2.3.3.4 Basic processes of use: Image usability
There has been some practice-focused work undertaken outside the cultural and the HE sector
on the usability of images. James Chudley’s (2013) practical guide on the creation of usable web
photographs, Usability of Web Photos, is based around Aristotle’s three types of rhetoric:
ethos, pathos and logos. He explained that,
For a photo to be effective and usable it must be credible (ethos). It should also elicit a
desirable emotional response (pathos) and help answer practical questions (logos)
(ibid.).
Although it neatly side-stepped epistemological issues associated with how advice was arrived
at, Chudley’s guide was written precisely because of his frustration about the lack of theory and
practical advice available online. The field of web usability is also fairly well developed: the
work of Jakob Nielsen (Nielsen and Pernice 2009) and Ben Shneiderman (1987) on web
interfaces is perhaps most cited. Much museological research work in image usability is
devoted to post-capture activities such as search engine optimisation and end-user search
strategies (e.g. Bates 1996; Sacco 2008; Fernandez 2012). Ross and Terras’s (2011) research
based on scholar’s use of the British Museum’s Collections Online portal, based on user survey
data, did include an analysis of user perceptions of the information environment but, again, this
was not conceptualised.

2.3.3.5 Basic processes of use: Web analytics
The measurement, collection and analysis of internet statistics have increasingly been used by
museums (and libraries and archives) to evaluate uptake of collections-based data since the
mid-1990s (ClickTale 2010). Although analytics such as page views, click paths, page depths,

74

bounce rates and so on are generally accepted as useful ways of benchmarking the popularity
of particular resources they provide little in the way of the context of use and information on
exactly how web users are interacting with images and metadata, and can be problematic if
taken at face value (Berthon, Pitt et al.. 1997). The development of social media metrics such as
the content analysis of tweets relating to an exhibition (Villaespesa 2013) does attempt to
provide more qualitative data to support analytics on the use of web resources but this is
ultimately restricted by the degree of contextual data available on social media users.

2.3.3.6 Basic processes of use: Digital learning environments
In terms of gauging the experience of users in digital learning environments much of the
literature is dominated by technology acceptance studies (Keller 2009) motivated by a range of
interests not wholly centred on content. This research ranges from educationalists’ interest in
the shift from classroom teaching, to new pedagogies used in VLEs (Morón-García 2004) and to
reports seeking to justify return on investment (Urwin 2011) on VLEs or studies concerned with
their uptake and impact (Britain and Liber 1999; Monteith and Smith 2001). Most of the casestudy-based literature on VLEs and pedagogy typically focuses on the extent to which VLEs have
changed pedagogical practice (Newland and Wiles 2004; Jenkins, Browne et al.. 2006) rather
than how pedagogical practice is reforming VLEs, or on the nature of content use. More
research interest has been shown in the use of Second Life and MUVE (Multi User Virtual
Environments) technologies in distance learning (Dickey 2005) than in the specific use of
artefact-based content in VLEs. Skills such as searching and navigation used in online learning
(Kwasnik 1992; Brown 1998) have been the subject of research and these are useful in

75

investigating patterns of use associated with a new digital literacy. Brumberger’s (2011) work
on visual literacy and digital nativism represents a constructive addition to a growing research
corpus on digital literacies particularly because of its focus on the individual learner and how
literacies might influence usage of online material. However, despite longstanding pressure to
improve content within digital learning environments (Stiles 2000) there has been a surprising
lack of research, particularly relating to digital content created from cultural artefacts.

2.3.3.7 Basic processes of use: Conclusion
Therefore, although some progress has been made in building a picture of how users interact
with digital resources in the library sector, and connections have been made between types of
user group and particular usage habits, there has been an absence of bottom-up, empirical
studies that are solely interested in the mechanics of artefact use. Much of the previous
research on usage has been service-driven in libraries and archives, and in the HE sector’s use
of VLEs, whereas research on the use of museum artefacts appears to be dominated by studies
that are ideologically-driven and focused on physical artefacts alone. Given the importance of
measuring impact in object-based learning (Chatterjee 2010a) and VLEs (Almpanis 2009), and
ensuring that the digitisation of artefacts meets user needs, there is a real need for an
elemental understanding of how users actually engage with artefacts in physical and digital
form.

76

2.3.4 Environment
This section focuses on published research on the effect of environment or context on artefact
use. It begins by defining learning environments before moving on to review extant research on
artefact use in VLEs, and in museums. It concludes by looking at the theory of environmental
affordances and how work done in this area relates, or could relate, to digital artefact use.

2.3.4.1 Environment: Defining learning environments
Imperial College London, define a learning environment as, ‘The physical or virtual setting in
which learning takes place’(2014). More specifically, Hannafin et al. (1999) describe four
essential criteria for all learning environments:
1. Contexts: authentic or realistic situations to motivate learners e.g. complex, full-scale
problems representative of real-world tasks
2. Resources: content to help students understand complex problems
3. Tools: aids to help learners process information, manipulate data, and discuss data
4. Scaffolds: support to bolster student problem-solving as needed (e.g. tutor or student
peer support)
For the HE sector, the institutional VLE constitutes the main formal digital learning
environment, providing a dedicated space equipped with tools and scaffolds supporting
student learning. However, the resources utilised within the VLE might have been imported
from elsewhere; in the context of cultural artefacts these might be embedded within the VLE
via webpages (such as a museum database record or blogs), multimedia files, or hyperlinks to
other kinds of content created and hosted outside the VLE. The provision of cultural artefacts in

77

online learning environments is widely considered to facilitate situated learning (Brown, Collins
et al.. 1996; McLellan 1996) by providing the first of Hannafin et al.’s criteria, a representation
of an authentic or real world situation through digital artefacts.

2.3.4.2 Environment: Learning environments and the use of content
To what extent has previous research examined the effect of learning environments on the use
of content within them? Despite the prevalence of VLE use (mentioned above in Section 2.2) in
the HE sector and the widespread provision of cultural artefacts in digital form following a
decade or so of digitisation, very little research activity has been devoted to studying the
effects of learning environments on the use of digital artefacts. More attention has been paid
to the usability of VLEs (Parizotto-Ribeiro and Hammond 2005; Walker and Fraser 2005) and
pedagogical evaluation of particular products (Britain and Liber 1999) than to content use.
Indeed, Dale and Lane make no mention of the relationship between content and context in
their VLE usability study carried out among students at the University of Wolverhampton in
2007. They instead conclude that, ‘The extent to which learners engage with VLEs is dependent
upon their design and functionality’ (Dale and Lane 2007, 102). Since one of the key criticisms
about VLEs is that they are simply used as a content repository rather a place where such
content is used (Turnock 2008) research on which content is best suited for use in digital
learning environments would seem to be long overdue.

78

2.3.4.3 Environment: Environmental studies in museums
In terms of environmental studies in museums, although there was a good deal of research
activity in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s in examining the influence of the physical environment
of the museum on formal and informal learning (Falk, Martin et al.. 1978; Wolf and Tymitz
1978; Wolf 1980; Peart 1984; Koran 1988; Norman 1988) this, by and large, has not been
developed to take into account the effect of digital environments on how artefacts are used.
Bitgood (2002) somewhat pessimistically sums-up the lack of research on physical factors as
architecture, interpretive design, amenities, and dimensionality (2D and 3D design) on the
museum visitor, ‘Environmental design in museums is still in its infancy and suffers from a lack
of competent researchers’ (ibid., 17). More accurately, research on the effect of the
environment on artefact use has been limited to studies that use cognitive approaches
(examining the connection between how we think and how we behave) to study meaning
making in physical environments primarily in the context of informal learning (Falk and Dierking
2000, 57). The use of ‘baroque and overly complicated’ (Gaver 1991, 79) cognitive models to
study the effect of environment has meant that tackling the issue of the use of digital artefacts
in virtual environments has proven to be too problematic and, thus, a neglected area of
investigation. There might also be a failure among museums to appreciate that the online
experience should be more than a replication of a visit to the museum, something that
museums have been accused of in the past (Marty 2004). In contrast, Ross and Terras claim
that, ‘academic users consider the museum website to be a very different information
environment to that of the physical museum’ (Ross and Terras 2011) which makes the lack of
investigation into the effect of digital environments on artefact use even more vital. Equally,

79

research has been slow to acknowledge the increased use of the internet as a learning
environment. As Chadwick and Boverie pointed out,
There are no empirically based studies on the nature of the Web as an informal
learning environment and the similarities or differences between the different types of
visitors (1999)
In the 15 years since their survey, little has changed.

2.3.4.4 Environment: Theory of affordances
The theory of environmental affordances, first developed by the perceptual psychologist J. J.
Gibson (1986) as an alternative to cognitive approaches in studying the effect of environments,
utilised in a museum context by Screven (1974), has been widely used in educational and
technological contexts (for example, Laurillard (2002)). Tan et al. define an ‘affordance’ as,
what the environment offers to humans and what it provides or furnishes, which might
be for good or ill; it emphasizes possible actions that the observer perceives as feasible
in the environment (2012, 206).
While cognitive approaches focus on perception, action, memory and sensation, the so-called
‘ecological’ approach to studying the affordances and limitations of the environment prioritises
the link between perception and action, playing down the interference of memory and other
accrued experience on what is enacted. The affordances of an environment, such as the
‘climbability’ of stairs or the ‘pushability’ of a door handle (Gaver 1991, 82) exists whether or
not they are perceived but, ‘it is because they are inherently about important properties that
they need to be perceived’ (ibid., 80). This approach is distinct from the contextual theory of
learning in museums proposed by Falk and Dierking (2000) which takes into account ‘the
causality of expectations, experiences, and memories’ (Kirchberg and Tröndle 2012, 439) akin

80

to the cognitive approach. According to Gibson, affordances depolarise the study of
environmental effects since they look both at context and user,
An affordance cuts across the dichotomy of subjective-objective and helps us to
understand its inadequacy. It is equally a fact of the environment and a fact of
behavior. It is both physical and psychical, yet neither. An affordance points both ways,
to the environment and to the observer. (1986, 129).
This corresponds with constructivist theories on meaning-making in virtual environments
(Osberg 1997) where the meaning of an artefact is dynamically located between the producer
(the artefact’s creator or the museum), the user, the artefact and its environment (Rowe 2002,
31).

Various studies involving the usage of VLEs have employed the theory of affordances to identify
features of the technological environment that affect use. Tan et al.’s (2012) part-qualitative,
part-quantitative study of the affordances of a ubiquitous learning environment 32 made
available via personal digital assistants (PDAs) among fifth-grade Natural Sciences students
revealed eight ‘actual’ and five ‘perceived’ educational affordances (211). This study, and other
recent research on the affordances of mobile learning environments (Klopfer, K. Squire et al..
2002; Patten 2006; Churchill and Churchill 2008) seek to improve environmental design and
make pedagogies used alongside VLEs more effective (Webb 2005). Clark and Brennan (Clark
and Brennan 1991) identify affordances such as synchronicity, audibility, and co-presence
within VLEs in examining the communication affordances of digital learning environments.
However, despite the potential of the theory of affordances, it has yet to be applied specifically

32

A ubiquitous learning environment is ‘any setting in which students can become totally immersed in the learning
process’ (Jones and Jo 2004).

81

to examine the relationship between digital learning environments and the use of cultural
artefacts within them.

2.3.4.5 Environment: Conclusion
Overall, research on digital learning environments has tended to focus more on the usability of
particular VLEs or the pedagogical implications of use rather than the specific effects of context
on content use. Many studies focus either on the learning process or the influence of the tools
and scaffolds within learning environments rather than the association between artefacts and
environments. Of the few environmental studies in museums that have been carried out most
have either focused primarily on complex cognitive approaches to looking at the association
between environments and learning. Museums have generally been slow in acknowledging the
difference between physical and digital environments and the impact this might have on the
use of artefacts. The theory of affordances offers a way of examining the effect of the
behaviour of individuals and the nature of the environment without the complications of
cognitive models, but in the context of the use of artefact-based resources this theoretical
approach has not been adequately applied.

2.3.5 Previous research methods
This section reviews research methods and approaches used to address the question of how
individuals use digital artefacts and the extent to which communities of practice influence this.
Given the absence of theory on artefact use, it begins with an analysis of work done on

82

generating theory from data, before examining two areas closely related to the study of
artefact use and communities of practice: learning theory and language as a form of practice. A
review of methodological approaches and related qualitative and quantitative methods used in
previous studies then follows to look behind patterns in choices made in previous research.

2.3.5.1 Previous research methods: Bottom-up analysis
Given the absence of established theories on artefact use it would seem to be more important
to scope new theories than utilise a top-down approach to testing existing theories on new
data. However, few previous studies (e.g. Ellis 1993) on artefact use employ data analysis
techniques which generate theory from data. Julien and Duggan (2000) point out the lack of
theoretical foundations of much of the work done on information research concluding, ‘it is of
great concern that such a small proportion of literature is based on theory’ (ibid., 306). In their
‘A Longitudinal Analysis of the Information Needs and Uses Literature’ which compared
published research on use over three periods from 1984-94, Julien and Duggan also conclude
that there has been little progress made in using combinations of methods to test the validity
of findings, sourcing sound theoretical frameworks for data analysis, and looking outside of
Library and Information Sciences for questions and methodologies to examine usage behaviour
of readers (ibid., 307). A common theme running across most museological studies of objectbased learning is the underlying essentialist belief that artefact use is beneficial. Arguably, this
assumption, and the use of top-down analytical approaches suggest an underlying political or
ideological agenda and results in relatively uncritical, qualitative commentaries on artefact use.

83

It prevents the generation of new theories from data which challenge orthodoxies surrounding
artefact use and, potentially, are more relevant by virtue of being grounded in data.

However, there are some examples of studies that utilise a bottom-up approach to generate
theory from data arising from artefact use. The most notable among these use ethnographic
methods and Grounded Theory to base new theories on what is found in the data, rather than
testing existing hypotheses with data. Ethnography ‘takes the position that the best and most
authentic way to understand a different cultural setting is ‘to immerse oneself in the data to
understand what is going on and be able to write about it’ (Kawulich 2005) and ethnographic
methods employ qualitative data collection and analysis techniques to provide an in-depth
analysis of a particular ‘cultural setting’. Khoo, Rozaklis and Hall (2012) provide a
comprehensive overview of 81 projects in libraries that have utilised ethnographic methods in
the study of libraries and library users. Taking the form of a literature study, the authors
categorised methods used (observation, interviews, fieldwork, focus groups, and cultural
probes) and found that most libraries were utilising ethnographic methods because they
allowed for flexibility and the collection of authentic data (derived from real users). Overall, the
authors recognise an upward trend in the use of ethnographic methods in digital environments,
for example, Geertz’s (1973) interpretation of an e-learning groups’ social discourse using
ethnographic methods.

Grounded Theory, initially developed by Glaser and Strauss in the mid 1960s, emphasises the
constant comparison of indicators, concepts and categories to generate dynamically and verify
theory from data (Glaser 1965). It combines an open, qualitative creation of codes from data

84

and the quantitative collation of incidence of those codes, and claims to offer a way of ‘arriving
at theory suited to its supposed uses' (Glaser and Strauss 1999). Although criticised mainly for
its claim to generate ‘theory’ inductively (Thomas and James 2006), Grounded Theory has been
widely used in sociology and, increasingly, in cultural studies. Ellis’s (1993) use of Grounded
Theory in a small scale but thorough study of information retrieval behaviour among
communities of learners represents an extremely effective and cogent use of Grounded Theory
which helps to reduce the research gap on artefact use. In the absence of ‘a realistic model of
the information environment and information-seeking behavior employed information retrieval
research’ (ibid., 473) Grounded Theory was used by Ellis in the analysis of data from four
studies on information retrieval in libraries carried out at the University of Sheffield. Transcripts
created from interviews with different academic groups constituted the dataset which was then
analysed and various categories which describe information retrieval behaviour were formed.
Although he discovered linguistic differences between groups, Ellis found a high degree of
‘internal coherence of the models’ which ‘reinforced the feeling that the studies have covered
the key themes and provided support for confidence in their general validity’ (ibid., 483).
Moreover, getting real end-users involved in relating their experience of information retrieval
represented for him, ‘an antidote to perceiving such issues from an orientation very different
from that of those studied’ (ibid., 484). Ellis rejected heuristic studies in favour of the
‘authenticity’ (ibid., 478) of data created from real end-users and analysed in a way which is,
arguably, closer to intended meaning than looking at data through a preconceived theoretical
lens. However, bottom-up studies like this are relatively rare elsewhere in library information
science and, more generally, in cultural studies.

85

2.3.5.2 Previous research methods: Learning theory
As noted in Section 2.3.2.3, Wenger’s theory of Communities of Practice has been used
extensively in educational, management and social science contexts but rarely in looking at
producers and end-users of digital artefacts. Other studies (e.g. Diaz and Cartnal 1999; Terrell
and Dringus 2000) focus on a key characteristic of communities of practice – the collaborative
learning of members – and patterns in learning styles between students learning on-campus
and at a distance. These studies build primarily on the work of David A. Kolb (1984) whose
theory of experiential learning proposes four different learning styles.33 Although criticised for
its Cartesian separation of process into stages and its evidence base, it is frequently used in
museological literature to analyse object-centred learning (Black 2005, 133). Alternative
theories such as Riding and Rayner’s cognitive styles, which focuses on the ‘thinking style’ of
the individual rather than the learning process (Riding and Rayner 1998, 50), have received less
attention in studying digital learning environments since Kolb’s learning styles focus on the
learning process rather than an individual’s hardwiring, the focus of cognitive style theory
(ibid.). Grasha and Reichmann’s cognitive approach to learning styles describes six modes which
categorise ways of learning and coping, and has been used to analyse online learning activity
(Diaz and Cartnal 1999) but this is based more on thinking and interaction patterns between
learners in classroom environments than in the context of a museum or, indeed, artefact-based
learning in digital environments (Baykul, Gürsel et al.. 2010). Fleming’s Visual, Auditory,
Reading-writing and Kinaesthetic (VARK) Model, based around sensory preferences in learning
is widely used in the context of formal learning but has been used less frequently in informal

33

Learning styles are defined by Stewart and Felicetti as, ‘educational conditions under which a student is most
likely to learn’ (1992, 15).

86

learning environments such as museums, libraries and archives and was singled out by Coffield
et al. (2004) in a critique of learning style theories for ‘lack of independent research on the
model’ alluding to the fact that the most salient published work on learning theories is often by
the theorists themselves.

Returning to Kolb’s theory, he proposes that a ‘transformation of experience’ (Kolb 1984, 38)
occurs as individuals move through the four quadrants of a conceptual learning cycle, between
concrete experience and abstract thought on a ‘perceptual’ axis, and reflection and
experimentation on a ‘processing’ axis. Typically, individuals will have strengths in one
particular quadrant and this describes their learning style. The relationship between
enculturation and learning style has been probed by, among others, Kolb and Joy (2009). In a
two-part study on the connection between cultural background and learning style, the authors
found preferences for particular learning styles in some of the seven nations from which 533
participants came. However, research focusing on the relationship between learning styles and
communities of practice is under-developed, although some work has been done in the context
of healthcare training (e.g. Hart, Daviesa et al.. 2013). Equally, research on the connection
between learning styles and artefact usage has not transpired, despite the fact that learning is
conceived of as ‘a process grounded in experience’ (Riding and Rayner 1998, 54) and the
experience of utilising artefacts in learning and research is often talked-up in museum
literature.

87

2.3.5.3 Previous research methods: Linguistic analysis
According to Wenger, learning is a form of practice, one of the three main aspects of a
community of practice (Wenger 2013). So too is language which reifies shared ‘protocols’
(Wenger, White et al.. 2005, 7) developed collectively by members of a community of practice
(Wenger and Lave 2009, 85). Some useful work has been done in examining the conceptual
relationship between linguistic expression and membership of a community of practice (Sarangi
and Leeuwen 2003; Tusting 2005) and presentation styles and CoP membership (Ventola 2002).
Swales’s (2003) study of language and CoP membership among campus-based academics found
that the connection is much more likely to be found in texts than in speech, pointing out that
research speech is not taught or vetted. Therefore we should not expect absolutely rigid
patterns. Akin to casual conversation, there is likely to be more consensus in a social setting.
Unlike speech, text is much more regulated,
it is research writing that is coached, revised, reviewed, copy-edited and generally coconstructed and, finally, it is research and scholarly writing that prevails in research
assessment exercises and the like (Swales 2003, 215).
According to Swales, academic texts tend to ‘reify our perceptions of disciplinary differences’
(ibid.). Far less work has been done in the cultural sector on the link between language and
membership of CoPs; this limits our appreciation of the extent to which practitioners identify
with particular communities and the influence this might have on their practice.

88

2.3.5.4 Previous research methods: Nomothetic and idiographic methodological approaches
According to the Kantian philosopher, Wilhelm Windelband, there are two basic approaches to
knowledge acquisition which describe a different methodological tendency: idiographic and
nomothetic (Robinson 2011, 32).

In the context of this research, an idiographic approach focuses on the uniqueness of an
individual’s encounter with an artefact and would regard usage as an ‘uncountable’
phenomenon, i.e. subjective (MacMillan 2014a).34 Perhaps because ‘the humanities have less
to do with facts as such than with their relationships’ (Portin 1981), this might explain why the
idiographic approach is more commonly used by humanities disciplines which prioritise the
‘distinctive human element and value’ (ibid.) in situations and activities with which artefacts are
associated. Another implicit reason for a preference for idiographic methods might be the
identity crisis spoken about in Section 2.2. In this respect, nomothetic methodologies, which
embody a belief in objective (MacMillan 2014b) forms of measurement,35 might appear to
threaten the special nature of the encounter with the artefact (and the presiding role of the
curator) and thereby challenge the innate social exclusivity of museums (O’Neill 2002, 24) and
the status of gatekeepers. Most often, qualitative methods are used to gather and analyse data
on artefact use, since these focus on the contingent and the individual.

34

For the purposes of this thesis, ‘subjective’ is taken to mean ‘based on *...+ a person’s feelings and thoughts that
no one else can know directly or completely [...] uncountable’ (MacMillan 2014).
35

For the purposes of this thesis, ‘objective’ is taken to mean ‘‘based only on facts and not influenced by personal
feelings or beliefs [...] countable’ (MacMillan 2014).

89

The nomothetic approach works in the belief that patterns can be found in human behaviour
and invokes a positivist epistemology. This objectivist approach is based on an assumption that
‘the social world [...] [has] an existence as hard and concrete as the natural world’ (Burrell 1985,
4). In other words, scientific techniques might be employed to elucidate patterns of behaviour
across the board, even in the arts and humanities. The nomothetic approach tends to employ
quantitative methods to collect and analyse data since these focus on phenomena that are
‘countable’ (i.e. objective) and general patterns.

Although the phenomenon of artefact usage, and methods of analysis used in studying it, will
necessarily contain elements which might be described as objective and subjective, most
methodologies can be described as favouring one or the other. This attention to the ideology
behind methods used is important because it is, arguably, responsible for the lack of research
on digital artefact use.36

In general, previous research (e.g. Chatterjee 2010a) on the use of physical artefacts has been
idiographic in nature while work done on the use of digital artefacts in museums, libraries and
archives has fallen between the idiographic and nomothetic approaches (taken up in Section
2.3.5.6). Research on artefact use in museums is dominated by qualitative studies of the use of
physical collections, reflecting a strong idiographic tendency. Generally speaking, these to take
the form of a-theoretical, small-scale investigations of the teaching use of collections (Romanek

36

The term ‘ideology’ is used in the sense of being ‘a body of ideas that reflects the beliefs and interests of a
nation, political system, etc and underlies political action’ (Collins 2014)

90

and Lynch 2008) or heuristic case studies37 based on the (largely intangible) benefits of objectbased learning (Sparks 2009; Gould in press). Research techniques typically involve some form
of artefact-handling session followed by interviews, focus groups or questionnaires. These
studies tend to generate data used by the authors to demonstrate anecdotally the advantages
of using research collections in Higher Education curricula. Unsystematic methods of data
capture and an absence of theoretical frameworks on artefact use means that pattern analysis
among end-users is either not considered, or is not thought verifiable. Although there are some
examples of direct observation of artefact use (e.g. Ferreira and Pithan 2005; Marie in press),
these have not involved the codification and conceptualisation of empirical data. These
methodological approaches undoubtedly reflect either an underlying belief in the unique,
individual nature of the encounter with the artefact or a lack of faith in more nomothetic
alternatives. The consequence has been that research on the use of artefacts (physical and
digital) remains underdeveloped and the use of qualitative methods alone has restricted the
applicability of findings to the wider cultural sector.

2.3.5.5 Previous research methods: Qualitative and quantitative approaches
In terms of research methods employed to investigate the use of digital artefacts, quantitative
methods have been employed by museums, libraries and archives to chart the behaviour of
web visitors; qualitative methods have generally been utilised to gain information on the
usability of systems rather than content. The cultural sector has tended to utilise log analysis
techniques and heuristic forms of evaluation to test the usability of websites, but direct
37

Methods that do not require users: inspection-based methods carried out by specialists or museum / education
staff.

91

observation of users and in-depth analysis of the use of content has been limited. Although
some good work has been done on the analysis of quantitative data (e.g. Nicholas et al. 2008),
the lack of information on who users are, their motivations, and what they go on to do with
artefact-related data makes this form of analysis alone severely lacking. As Cunliffe points out,
‘the data gathered in a typical web log is relatively poor’ (Cunliffe, Kritou et al.. 2010, 209).
Equally, evaluating web resources heuristically (undertaken within museums, libraries and
archives) can introduce ‘artificial motivations’ (Hardman 1989, 238) into the process since real
end-users are not involved.

As Bailey et al. point out this can lead to false usability problems, something that is confirmed
in an evaluation carried out by the authors where they found that there,
was relatively little overlap between the usability problems identified by direct
observation and those identified by heuristic evaluation [...] This emphasises the
benefits of including real users in the evaluation process (Bailey, Allen et al.. 1992,
214).
Perhaps a slowness in recognising the distinct use value38 of digital collections is responsible for
the lack of development of cultural informatics beyond web logs, but another factor might be
the expense of the direct observation of users (Heinecke 1995). Some studies (e.g. Tröndle M.
and Wintzerith S. 2012) have involved direct observation of real users and these tend to follow
the pattern of VLE testing (e.g. Parizotto-Ribeiro and Hammond 2005; Walker and Fraser 2005)
where the usability of systems is tested by setting participants a task and evaluating ease of
use. These studies tend to utilise qualitative and quantitative methods of evaluation, but data
analysis is systems-oriented and content is, largely, incidental. These tests employ principles of
user interface design developed in the field of Human Computer Interaction (HCI). Indeed, work
38

Use value or utility is defined as the ‘want-satisfying power of a commodity’ (Jain 2007, 57).

92

done in HCI, particularly in the area of user-centred design (which often employs ethnographic
methods to focus on the needs of end-users) and technologies such as eye-tracking, motion
sensing, Near Field Communication (NFC) (Blöckner, Danti et al.. 2009) or Radio Frequency
Identification (RFID) tagging (Cosley 2009; Haberman 2010), heat maps for tracking touch, and
so on, offer a way of developing more precise metrics on use, but this research is in its infancy
in terms of application to museum situations, and forms of analysis, remains laborious (Conati
and Merten 2007). These technologies might offer a way of bridging the methodological divide;
they focus on the individual but produce quantitative data that can be analysed to show
patterns of use across a test sample. Online focus groups, which respond to detailed questions
about a site or an artefact within it, might also offer a way of combining heuristic and focus
group forms of evaluation, and to source data not only on the transmission of information (the
focus of systemic usability evaluation) but on the individual experience and meaning-making
(Teather and Wilhelm 1999).

2.3.5.6 Previous research methods: Conclusion
When you can measure what you are speaking about, and express it in numbers, you
know something about it; when you cannot express it in numbers, your knowledge is
of a meagre and unsatisfactory kind (Thomson 1889, 73).
Although there is obvious value in qualitative methods of research which do not necessarily
involve the use of numbers, the existing corpus of research on artefact use, particularly in
digital learning environments, does not share William Thomson’s faith in figures. In fact, an
over-reliance on qualitative methods to study artefact use and a failure to look beyond physical
collections has curtailed research on the creation and end-use of digital artefacts. The absence

93

of studies which generate theory from quantitative data, rather than testing existing theories
on data, has also retarded the development of new theoretical frameworks for artefact use in
digital learning environments. Equally, the problem of artefact use has rarely been approached
from existing theories which examine the influence of producers and end-users of digital
artefacts on the digital supply chain, such as Wenger’s theory of communities of practice and
Kolb’s theory of experiential learning. The greater use of idiographic approaches which employ
qualitative, heuristic, and top-down methods, or remote studies based on quantitative data,
shows a persistent ideological belief in the special nature of the individual’s use of artefacts.
The consequence has been significant methodological gaps in our understanding of the people
and processes involved in artefact use in digital learning environments.

2.4

Situation and literature review: Summary and conclusion

Given the political, economic, technological and strategic context for the cultural and HE
sectors, and previous research on artefact use in digital learning environments, where does the
main research question lie?

The main challenge for the cultural sector appears to be how to respond to demands for
greater openness in how digital artefacts are produced and what can be done with them in a
sustainable way, given severe financial and political pressures. For the HE sector, making
educational resources more flexible and more open has also meant that digital learning
environments, as well as the content used within them, are a vital part of the strategy to meet
user demands. Therefore, focusing attention on the user and how they interact with artefacts is

94

central to responding to demands for more open and usable digital content, and is something
that needs to be examined.

Previous research on artefact use has tended to be conducted only within the cultural sector.
Since government funding bodies have stressed the importance of collaboration and
interdisciplinary working to meet demands for usable content, research on the use of digital
artefacts needs to consider who should be involved in scoping and testing the use of cultural
artefacts in digital learning environments. The dispersed nature of much of the literature on
artefact use is also an indication of the trans-disciplinary scope of the problem. More research
is needed which looks at the digital supply chain in its broadest sense.

From a methodological perspective, the literature review has suggested ideological reasons
which might be behind the lack of research on artefact use. Therefore, research approaches
which challenge the predominance of idiographic methods are needed in this area.
Additionally, the use of direct observation and bottom-up forms of analysis would seem to be
more important, given the absence of comparable studies and supporting theory on artefact
use. Finally, a pragmatic worldview (one which concentrates ‘on the primary importance of the
question asked rather than the methods’ (Creswell and Clark 2011, 41)) is needed which uses a
combination of research methods, regardless of the academic context in which they are
normally used, in order to deconstruct the processes associated with digital artefact use and
look at the influence of individuals and environments on those processes.

95

From the review of the research context, because the environments used in formal learning
and content created for them have become more diverse, more work is required in testing the
effects these have on artefact use. Previous research on the influence of environment has
focused on the usability of VLEs rather than the usability of content within them. Therefore, it
would also seem to be important to maintain a focus on the distinction between the usability of
the environment and the usability of the artefact, if progress is to be made in this area. In other
words, it is as important to remember what the research question is not about as well as what
it is. Gaps in previous research and how these relate to the particular research approach
adopted in this thesis are examined in the next chapter.

96

3. RESEARCH DESIGN
3.1 Introduction
This chapter begins (Section 3.2) with a reflection on the main points emerging from the
situation and literature reviews in Chapter 2, in order to identify failings and gaps that need to
be addressed in tackling the main research area. These gaps are then used to form the aims and
objectives (Section 3.3) for research activities carried out to answer the main research
questions: how artefacts are used in digital learning environments and what influence
communities of practice have on this process. The methodological approach is then explained
(Section 3.4) in relation to what is missing from previous research and three main theoretical
frameworks that will be used to try to fill these research gaps. The structure and rationale is
also set out, providing detail on research settings, activities, and methods of data collection and
analysis, for both phases of research.

3.2 Research gaps
In Chapter 2, previous research on how artefacts are used in digital learning environments, was
described and critiqued. From the analysis of the situation and literature, it was clear that a
number of significant gaps exist in previous research. Filling these gaps (also outlined in Section
1.8) would help progress research in this area. In particular, as shown in Table 2, three aspects
appear to be under-researched.

97

Gap
Focus

Area
Previous studies have not examined the relationship between the
identity, interests, experience and skills of suppliers and end-users
of content and how digital artefacts are created and used has not
been sufficiently researched. The basic processes behind the use of
digital artefacts have also not been examined to any appreciable
extent. Previous research on the influence of environment has also
tended to focus on the usability of VLEs rather than the usability of
content within them.

Scope

Previous studies on the digital supply chain have largely been
conducted on a particular part of the digital supply chain and by
those concerned (for example, in the museums profession). Also,
the scope of what is meant by use has tended to refer to usability
of a product rather than a broader, more inclusive definition of the
term.

Research methods

Previous studies on artefact use have tended to adopt an
idiographic methodological approach and qualitative, top-down
methods of data analysis rather than allow data to suggest new
typologies.

Table 2. Gaps in previous research on digital artefact use

There does appear to be some overlap between these gaps. For example, as postulated in
Chapters 1 and 2, one of the reasons behind the lack of research in the area of artefact use in
digital learning environments has been a failure to problematise the relationship between
people involved in the supply of digital artefacts, and the process of end-use. Because of the
lack of interest in this relationship, theoretical frameworks which might explore this link have
not been used in the context of cultural artefacts and digital learning environments. Equally, a
tendency to use only qualitative methods of analysis has, arguably, restricted the scope of
enquiry and influenced the focus of enquiry.

98

3.3 Aims and objectives
In order to fill these gaps and address the two main research questions - how are cultural
artefacts used in digital learning environments and how can the theory of communities of
practice help in understanding the people and processes involved in the supply and use of
digital artefacts - four main aims and six objectives were established (Table 3).
Aims
To analyse the influence of the identity,
interests, experience and perspective of
producers and users of content on the
way they use digital artefacts

Objectives

quantitatively

To understand the main factors that affect
digital artefact usage

measuring artefact usage

To analyse the influence of environment
on digital artefact usage

Test artefact use in a range of controlled
environments

Analyse how membership of a CoP might
affect usage of artefacts

Table 3. Main research aims and objectives

These aims correspond with the two main themes identified in Chapter 1, namely who is
involved in supplying and using digital artefacts (the people), and how usage takes place (the
processes), as shown in Table 4. This approach emphasises the importance of the background
(the identity, interests, skills and experience) of producers and users, and the influence of
environment on the process of artefact use in digital learning environments. Although distinct,
the two themes of people and processes are closely related. Looking firstly at the theme of
99

people, Wenger’s conceptual framework of communities of practice was used to assess
whether the identity, interests, experience and perspective of those closely involved in
supplying and using digital artefacts influences eventual usage of artefacts. To do this, the
validity of communities of practice was tested over two phases, firstly with a wide range of
communities of practice in the digital supply chain and then with a strand of that chain. Various
forms of analysis were employed to test Wenger’s model but key to this was codifying and
measuring the usage behaviour of communities of practice to look at any patterning and to
explore any connections between the attributes of a CoP and the way these groups use
artefacts. Therefore, in looking at whether the identity, interests, experience and perspective of
producers and users of digital artefacts influences how they use artefacts it was necessary to
examine the mechanics of usage and to build a statistical picture of usage among CoPs.

As well as looking at qualitative data suggesting how practitioners might perceive issues
surrounding artefact use, quantitative usage data was also used to highlight any behavioural
traits among communities of practice. Once a method of describing and quantifying artefact
usage was developed in Phase 1, this was then used under more controlled conditions in Phase
2 to isolate the number of communities of practice while varying the nature of the usage
environment. Therefore, understanding processes was instrumental to understanding the
people behind those processes but gaining an insight into producers and users of digital
artefacts also helped explain variations in usage behaviour.

3.4 Methodological Approach
3.4.1 Methodological Approach: Overview
As postulated in Chapters 1 and 2, one of the reasons behind the apparent lack of research in
the area of artefact use in digital learning environments has been a failure to problematise the
relationship between people involved in the supply of digital artefacts, and the process of enduse. Because of the lack of interest in this relationship, theoretical frameworks which might
explore this link have not been used in the context of cultural artefacts and digital learning
environments.

Another major gap has been methodological: objective, behaviourist methodologies which tend
to include quantitative as well as qualitative forms of data collection and analysis have not been
used to examine the mechanics of artefact use, or look at patterns of artefact use among
different types of user. In line with the neglect of positivist methodologies has been a tendency
to use top-down methods of data analysis which test theory on use rather than develop theory
from the data. Given the absence of theory on artefact use, this would seem to be a costly
oversight.

Therefore, the methodological approach adopted in both phases of the research carried out to
address the main research questions seeks to tackle both of these areas: the relationship
between communities of practice and artefact use, and methods of deriving meaningful data
on interaction with the artefact.

103

3.4.2 Methodological Approach: Communities of Practice and learning
Etienne Wenger’s theory of communities of practice was chosen to interpret the behaviour of
individuals most closely associated with the supply and use of digital artefacts in HE. Although
other theories such as Fleck’s thought collectives39, and communities of interest40, were
considered, crucially, Wenger’s theory incorporates the idea of practice, a vital component
when analysing artefact supply and use which are both types of reification (turning abstract
knowledge into concrete things (Wenger 2009, 57)) . However, other theories such as Brown
and Duguid’s concept of networks of practice, a looser type of ‘info-centric’ community of
practice whose members need not be co-located (Brown and Duguid 2001) is used to explain
variations found on the model proposed by Wenger. Another important aspect of Wenger’s
theory of communities of practice is the emphasis on social learning. Although Fleck’s theory of
thought collectives proposes a cogent model of how members of a collective direct the
perception or ‘thought style’ (Sady 2001a) of others, Wenger’s theory posits that learning
within a CoP is a plural, participatory process brought about by the tension created by four sets
of dualities: participation-reification (Wenger 1998, 66), designed-emergent (ibid., 232-33),
identification-negotiability (ibid., 188-9) and local-global (ibid., 131-33). Meaning is negotiated
by members of a CoP through participation and active practice, leading to reification of that
knowledge (participation-reification), and this can be part of a planned (designed) or unplanned
(emergent) activity. The identity of a CoP member is negotiated between the individual and the
group (identification-negotiability), and knowledge ‘local’ to a CoP can be shared with those

39

A ‘thought collective’ is defined by Fleck as ‘a community of persons mutually exchanging ideas or maintaining
intellectual interaction’ (Sady 2001).
40

A ‘community of interest’ is ‘a gathering of people assembled around a topic of common interest’ (Henri and
Pudelko 2003, 478).

104

outside the CoP (local-global). In other words members do not just acquire knowledge through participation they actively learn.

The collaborative nature of learning within a CoP, as opposed to the more rigid, learning-bytransmission model proposed by Fleck, corresponds more closely with Bourdieu’s notion of the
‘conductorless orchestra’ (1990, 53) whereby all members, by virtue of participation in the CoP,
learn together and learn through practice. Key to Wenger’s theory, is the active participation of
members in learning,
The notion of participation [...] dissolves dichotomies between cerebral and embodied
activity, between contemplation and involvement, between abstraction and
experience: persons, actions, and the world are implicated in all thought, speech,
knowing, and learning (Wenger and Lave 2009, 52).
The idea that ‘In contrast with learning as internalization, learning as increasing participation in
communities of practice concerns the whole person acting in the world’ (ibid., 49) allows for
any form of ‘embodied activity’, such as artefact use or discussions about usage, to be treated
as an expression of the learning behaviour of the CoP. Learning through participation also
means that other theories of sociocultural learning, such as David A. Kolb’s Experiential
Learning Theory (1984) and its emphasis on learning styles can be aligned with Wenger’s theory
of communities of practice.

3.4.3 Methodological Approach: Experiential learning and CoPs
David Kolb’s Experiential Learning Cycle (1984) is based on experiential learning theories
initially developed by Piaget (1936), Dewey (1938), and Lewin (1951), and groundbreaking work

105

on developmental psychology by the cognitive theorist Leo Vygotsky (1978). Although criticised
for its Cartesian separation of learning into stages and the validity of its evidence base (Smith
2001), it is widely used in museum education to conceptualise object-centred learning (Cook
and Speight 2010, 33) principally because it involves ‘a direct encounter with the phenomena
being studied’ (Borzak 1981, 9; Brookfield 1983) . Kolb proposes that a ‘transformation of
experience’ (Kolb 1984, 38) occurs as individuals move through the four quadrants of a learning
cycle, between concrete experience and abstract thought on the perceptual axis, and reflection
and experimentation on the processing axis (depicted in Figure 2). This involves the correlative
processes of apprehension and comprehension, and extension and intension .41

41

‘Apprehension’ is defined as ‘the act or power of perceiving’ (Merriam-Webster 2013) or in Kolbian terminology,
‘concrete experience’. ‘Comprehension’ is defined as ‘the capacity of understanding fully’ or in Kolbian terms
‘abstract conceptualisation’. ‘Extension’ is defined by Kolb as a ‘transformation of experience’ through ‘active
experimentation’; intension is defined as the use of ‘reflective observation’ in learning (Baker, Kolb et al.. 2002, 3).

106

Figure 2. Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle (Rodwell 2005, 248)
Typically, individuals will have strengths in one particular quadrant and this describes their
overall learning style. Although this theory is largely focused on the individual, Kolb (2009) and
others (Witkin 1967; Lessor 1976) have looked at contextual influences on learning style
broadening the scope of experiential learning to communities and to practice. This has
implications for communities of practice because, as Wenger and Lave contest, CoPs have
distributed knowledge bases which depend on members learning together. Research on
‘communities of learners’ (Wertsch 1998), ‘interpretive communities’ (Fish 1980),
‘technological frames’ (Bijker 2009), and ‘thought collectives’ (Fleck 1935) have all proposed
that individual action is strategic and acknowledge Vygotsky’s theory (1978) that meaningmaking is both social and mediated. Taking this further, communities of practice are made up
of individuals with particular learning styles but the community at large might favour a distinct
learning style in building ‘stores of knowledge or cultural capital’ (Rowe 2002). Kolb calls this

107

process ‘acculturation’ (Kolb 1984, 164). The selection and socialisation of knowledge creates a
‘homogenous disciplinary culture’ (Kolb 1984, 234) which favours a dominant learning style,
That disciplines incline to different styles of learning is evident from the variations
among their primary tasks, technologies, and products, criteria for academic
excellence and productivity, teaching methods, research methods, and methods for
recording and portraying knowledge (ibid., 163).
In fact, professionalisation and educational specialisation are only two of the ‘forces’ that shape
learning styles according to Kolb (ibid., 97). Another is ‘accentuation’ (ibid., 164) or the
performance of ‘primary tasks’ which could involve the use of artefacts. Therefore, the way
that artefacts are used could both be a way of fathoming an individual’s particular learning style
and a way of shaping it through contact with others within a CoP.

3.4.4 Methodological approach: Experiential learning and learning styles
The practical implication of this connection between ways of using artefacts and ways of
learning is that broad patterns in use might be related conceptually to Kolb’s Experiential
Learning Cycle. Following the employment of Grounded Theory (Section 3.4.5) to generate
codes for types of artefact use, these codes might then be aggregated into categories based on
any patterns which emerge. This continues the logic of abstraction and comparison on which
Grounded Theory is based (Glaser and Strauss 1999, 21). Since artefact use is a form of
experiential learning, codes for use must relate to a particular part of Kolb’s experiential
learning cycle. Therefore, categories formed from codes for use might then be mapped to the
four Kolb learning styles based on how well they correspond with the characteristics of each
style (Kolb 1984, 65).

108

However, this mapping exercise has several methodological problems. Firstly, the
characteristics of Kolb’s learning styles might actually influence the formation of categories and
even codes, running against the tenets of Grounded Theory which stipulate that theory must
arise from the data and not vice versa (Glaser and Strauss 1999, 12). This makes the order in
which codes are created and categories formed crucial; this must be done before mapping and,
as far as possible, undertaken independently by more than one analyst. Secondly, the process
of mapping is subject to a degree of interpretation in aligning codes with categories, and
categories with learning styles. It might be argued that this reduces the validity of the process,
especially working from small datasets. The process of abstraction and conceptualisation
inevitably removes context as codes are formed and as categories are created and the
particular circumstances of use, and the nuances which might be associated with that process
by the individual, are lost. The mapping of codes to categories and then to broad learning styles
can only accentuate this stripping of context. The use of the constant comparative method
(Glaser 1965) to generate codes, and the comparison of the results of independent coding by a
number of analysts, might offset some of these issues. Finally, the specificity of artefact use and
the generality of questions in most learning style tests is also an issue when comparing the
results of each to examine the connection between ways of using artefacts and ways of
learning.

Looking at learning style tests, the arbitrary and conceptual nature of the mapping process
requires another form of testing for verification. In this case a method of assessment developed
from Kolb’s learning style inventory (LSI) was used to compare the results of mapping with an
independent learning style test. Kolb developed a learning style inventory based on the

109

quadripartite experiential learning cycle in 1976 and again in 1984. Kolb states that learning
style preference is the product of two pairs of variables, or two separate 'choices' that
individuals make, which Kolb presented as axes (the perceptual and processing axes as shown
in Figure 2), each connecting opposing modes of learning. This explains the format of most
learning style instruments which require a stark choice between two separate answers, or a
ranking exercise whereby participants are asked to prioritise statements about their
preferences in a self-assessment-style learning exercise.

This forced-choice format, and the relatively poor empirical evidence42 for the LSI is something
that has attracted a great deal of criticism (Freedman and Stumpf 1978). The LSI scoring system
has also been questioned since it does not reflect degrees of preference, just a first-past-thepost rating where only the dominant learning style is recognised (Ruble and Stout 1994). The
LSI has also been censured on the grounds of its ‘questionable psychometric properties’ (Koob
and Funk 2011, 293). The employment of the LSI as a predictive rather than a descriptive tool
has also been criticised (Hunsaker 1980; West 1982) given serious ‘conceptual, methodological,
and statistical problems’ (Koob and Funk 2011, 303). However, much of this criticism is
unwarranted, given Kolb’s insistence that learning is a continuous process which involves
transactions between the person and the environment (Kolb 1984, 35) and, as such, ways of
learning are variable.

The LSI tool has been used extensively in multiple fields from social work to corporate
management to higher education - and there have been numerous variations on Kolb’s original
42

For example the test-retest scores published by Kolb in 1976 were low (Koob and Funk 2002, 300).

110

LSI test developed. Most of these are based on four distinct types of learner. Among the most
widely used is Honey and Mumford Learning Style Questionnaire (LSQ), utilised in the fields of
business and management. However, its validity in academia has been called into question (De
Vita 2001). Akin to Kolb’s learning styles, the four different learner types described by Honey
and Mumford are: activists, reflectors, theorists, and pragmatics. Also based on four
dimensions (conditions for learning, area of interest, mode of learning, and conditions for
performance) the Canfield Learning Style Inventory has been criticised for its lack of suitability
in academic settings. Felder and Silverman’s Index of Learning Survey (ILS) tool was designed
for academic use, and was first employed in assessing the learning preferences of engineering
students (Felder and Silverman 1988). However, these three alternatives to Kolb’s LSI tend to
be lengthy and time-consuming to complete: for example the ILS typically includes 44 questions
with two choices. Because of the largely voluntary nature of participation in Phases 1 and 2, a
shorter questionnaire was needed to achieve a high rate of completion and improve research
feasibility. Therefore, an 18 question variation (Appendix C) of the Honey and Mumford and
Kolbian LSI was used which asked participants to make eighteen choices between two
questions which described their preferences in learning situations.43 It combines the essence of
the approach initiated by Kolb and later developed by Honey and Mumford but in a more
concise, user-friendly model which can be applied in a range of disciplinary settings. The LSI was
piloted during the MOMD (Modules Outside the Main Discipline) session at the University of
Birmingham described below. Most students found the test easy and quick to complete (taking
on average five minutes).

43

This was adapted from a questionnaire written at Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada, by T. Blouin (Clark 2011).

111

Therefore, Wenger’s theory on communities of practice and Kolb’s Experiential Learning Theory
provide compatible frameworks for considering to what extent artefact use, as a form of
reification and practice, reflects the learning preferences of groups of practitioners. However,
some theoretical framework was required to analyse forms of practice, both interaction with
the artefact (reified in behaviour) and social interaction (reified in language). This was provided
by Grounded Theory.

3.4.5 Methodological approach: Grounded Theory
Grounded Theory, a systematic form of content analysis which combines inductive and
deductive reasoning to generate theory from data, was employed to detect forms of artefact
use and to relate this to membership of a CoP. Although it has been argued that Grounded
Theory is essentially idiographic in nature (Gay and Weaver 2011), its use in this context to
identify and quantify types of artefact use is intended to be nomothetic (see Section 2.3.5.6).
Grounded Theory, first developed by Glaser and Strauss in the 1960s, was considered a suitably
open approach to content analysis to identify dominant messages (conceptualised as codes and
categories) from textual and visual records of interviews, workshops, web fora, and other forms
of written work. Since most data would be in text form, this method of analysis fits with the
idea of language as practice, a critical, under-researched area of communities of practice theory
(Tusting 2005, 36). Again, alternatives to Grounded Theory were considered such as Engaged
Theory (Sharp 1985), which proposes four levels of abstraction in the analysis of data, a
hierarchy which ranges from ways of doing, acting, relating, and being. However, in comparison

112

with Grounded Theory, Engaged Theory is highly reflexive and this would have caused problems
with the legitimacy, for example, of the collection of data which Engaged Theory regards as a
non-neutral act containing theoretical bias from the outset. Grounded Theory on the other
hand would regard sampling merely as the beginning of a neutral process which seeks to
reduce researcher bias through the constant comparative method (explained in Section 3.5.9).

Other forms of content analysis were weighed-up, such as discourse analysis (a method which
analyses communication events) which is primarily focused on verbal communication and
meaning. Although much of the data on artefact use in Phase 1 came from discussions about
use, Phase 2 involved actual use for which these types of content analysis would have proved
limited. That being said, word frequency analysis (another form of content analysis), a basic
technique akin to Key Word in Context (KWIC) searching which recognises key words and then
quantifies their frequency (Manning and Schütze 1999), was also used. This was to detect
whether communities of practice betray a ‘shared repertoire’ (Wenger 1998, 82) or ways of
negotiating meaning in their use of language.

Although Grounded Theory has been criticised on a number of fronts, including its claim to
develop inductive knowledge and the improbability of avoiding researcher bias (Thomas and
James 2006), given the absence of theories about artefact use, the type of reverse engineering
involved in the creation of theory from data, and its versatility as a method to scope and
conceptualise types of use was considered advantageous.

113

3.4.6 Methodological approach: Conclusion
As outlined in this chapter, the methodological approach utilises three main theories to analyse
artefact use and explore the influence of the identity, knowledge, skills and experience of
practitioner groups on that process. Firstly, in the absence of established theory on the
mechanics of artefact use, Grounded Theory was chosen in order to analyse patterns in
interaction. Glaser and Strauss’s theory offered a way of generating new theory from the data
up, and to produce quantitative and qualitative results to test the influence of membership of a
CoP, and context, on how individuals use cultural artefacts in digital learning environments.
Secondly, since the creation and use of digital artefacts in the cultural and HE sector involves
groups of individuals from different disciplines, Wenger’s communities of practice theory was
selected in order to analyse the influence of membership on interaction with the digital
artefact. A crucial aspect of Wenger’s theory is the notion of knowledge stewardship through
collaborative learning and learning-in-practice. This offers a way of understanding the influence
of a community of practice on how individuals learn and, crucially, how they act. Conversely,
artefact use, as a form of practice, might also reflect how CoPs learn. Thirdly, Kolb’s Experiential
Learning Theory provides a conceptual bridge between learning and practice. Kolb
conceptualises the learning process and proposes that individuals exhibit preferences or styles
in how they learn. These preferences are related to an individual’s psychological make-up but
also to a number of contextual ‘forces’ that shape learning strategies. Kolb’s description of
forces such as acculturation relate closely to Wenger’s theories on social learning making it
possible to look at the connection between ways of using artefacts and ways of learning among
communities of practice.

114

3.5 Structure and rationale
3.5.1 Phases 1 and 2: Overview
In order to scope and to test hypotheses on people and processes associated with artefact use,
research was carried out over two phases. These phases roughly follow two key stages in the
use of digital artefacts: artefact production and artefact use. There was therefore a focus on
the digital supply chain in Phase 1 (thus the name Artefacts and Practitioners), and a focus on a
strand of the digital supply chain (made up of end-users) and the context of usage (thus the
name Artefacts and Environments) in Phase 2 (see Figure 3).

Since the aims and objectives of Phase 1 were both ontological (questioning the existence of
communities of practice) and phenomenological (probing the effects that these entities might
have on the use of artefacts), research design in Phase 1 was broad and exploratory with semistructured elements intended to externalise usage behaviour and issues surrounding use.
Qualitative and quantitative research methods were used to assess whether participants were
members of communities of practice, to describe and measure how artefacts were used, and to
scope how influential the environment might be. Based on the findings of Phase 1, a number of
hypotheses on CoP membership, how CoPs learn, how artefacts are used, and the effect of the
environment were formed which were then tested in more controlled conditions in Phase 2.
Again, mixed methods of data analysis were used but under more controlled conditions to
isolate factors which might explain how digital artefacts are used and what effect communities
of practice and environment have on this process.

115

3.5.2 An overview of Phase 1: Scoping the digital supply chain
In order to scope issues associated with the selection, digitisation and packaging of artefacts
which might affect end-use, a mock supply chain was set up. This required the involvement of
practitioners normally involved in the supply of artefacts, end-users, and the digitisation and
use of artefacts. Since the case study involved the use of Shakespeare-related artefacts in
digital learning environments, individuals normally involved in the selection, care, digitisation,
presentation and end-use of artefacts in postgraduate study at the Shakespeare Institute in
Stratford-upon-Avon were invited to participate. There were six heritage practitioners, four
lecturers, and 14 postgraduate students (three of whom were distance learning students). The
heritage practitioners group was made up of a curator (given the code CC), an archivist (AR) and
librarian (LT) from the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust, a collections manager (CM) from the same

116

organisation, a librarian from the Shakespeare Institute (LS), and a rare book librarian (LU) from
the University of Birmingham Library’s Special Collections Department. All of these
practitioners were involved to a greater and lesser extent in supplying content for use by
students in the University of Birmingham’s VLE. Two lecturers from the Shakespeare Institute
were also recruited. The first lecturer (SS) taught on three different MAs44 at the Institute and
also coordinates e-learning at the Institute. The other lecturer (AH) was a cultural historian who
taught on various history MAs, including MASSACHRE and an MA in the Cultural Heritage of
Shakespeare’s England. The other two lecturers were based on the main campus of the
University of Birmingham and both had a teaching and research interest in heritage and the use
of digital technologies. The first (AT) was a theologian who had worked on various projects
related to electronic editing of ancient textual artefacts and has recently applied some of this
research to Shakespeare-related collections at the Shakespeare Institute. The other lecturer
(AA) taught in Classics, Ancient History and Archaeology with an interest in 3D visualisation of
ancient landscape and heritage practice. This academic chaired the workshops. Of the 14
students, seven were undertaking PhDs and seven were enrolled on MA courses.45 With the
exception of the distance learning students, all of these participants were known to the author.
The author’s role in Phase 1 was participant-observer46, conducting interviews, carrying out the
administration and planning of workshops, and managing the recording, transcription and
analysis of each session. In order to minimise researcher bias and the Hawthorne Effect (Cook

Two students were enrolled on the MASSACHRE course and the others were undertaking either the Shakespeare
Studies, Shakespeare and Theatre, or Shakespeare and Education MA programmes of study.
46

With ‘moderate participation’: maintaining a balance between ‘insider’ and ‘outsider’, combining intervention
and detachment to attempt research objectivity (DeWalt 1998).

117

1962), interventions during interviews and workshops were kept to a minimum but were
sometimes necessary for example to encourage students to vocalise their thoughts on the use
of artefacts and obtain information needed to guide the digitisation of artefacts for subsequent
stages of the trial.

Additionally, to give the research wider scope, two other practitioner groups were recruited:
‘digital creatives’ and performers. Four ‘digital creatives’, or individuals involved in producing
digital content with a creative and cultural element, were enlisted because of their previous
participation in digital projects involving cultural collections. Although digital artefacts used by
the Shakespeare Institute in its VLE most commonly have either been digitised in-house by the
University of Birmingham or in close partnership with the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust, third
party sites47 are often embedded within VLEs. Involving digital creatives was designed to
represent the experience of those who create such web resources outside the VLE and also to
explore some of the wider issues of interdisciplinary collaboration as a factor influencing the
uptake and use of digital artefacts. Since Shakespeare Studies focuses on the interpretation of
dramatic work written principally by William Shakespeare, three actors, one of whom had
become a theatre educator, and all of whom work, or had previously worked, for the Royal
Shakespeare Company, were recruited. Because the artefacts chosen to be the focus of the
research project were costumes and props used in theatrical productions of a particular play or
historic artefacts thematically related to a play, the input of actors and a theatre educator was
intended to add another dimension to the research project - the perspective of practitioners
and end-users combined. The digital creatives and performers were not known to the author or

118

to any of the other participants. A full list of participants, their roles and a code used in
transcripts to identify them, is given in Appendix A.48

Following recruitment, research activity took place over six stages, between February and
August 2012, as shown below in Figure 4.

Figure 4. Phase 1 workflow

48

A missing element in the make-up of the supply chain of practitioners normally involved in the presentation and
use of artefacts was e-learning specialists at the University of Birmingham but their involvement over the course of
the workshops was infeasible given the time commitment. The Centre for Learning and Academic Development
(CLAD) at the University of Birmingham were, however, involved in an advisory role in developing the research
design, particularly in Phase 2.

119

To subvert the norm, end-users initiated the supply chain by selecting physical artefacts at first
hand in the museum store, and stipulated how they should be digitised (Stage 1). This was
done in order to examine how the early involvement of end-users might affect supply and
eventual use. The resulting images and metadata were then supplied to practitioners who
were asked to present ideas over the course of two workshops (Stages 3 and 4) about how
they would use artefacts in research, and how they could package the digital artefacts to
encourage or facilitate research. Prior to the first workshop, in Stage 2 practitioners were
interviewed to profile their membership of one or more community of practice, to obtain
information on their role in the supply chain, and previous experience of projects with a digital
component. Finally, in order to scope issues associated with the uptake and use of artefacts in
digital environments, digital images and metadata were sent to distance learning students with
a set of questions (Stage 5). The students who had initially selected physical artefacts were
sent digital images and asked to write about the degree of transformation brought about by
digitisation. In the same vein, practitioners who had only been exposed to digital artefacts
were taken to the museum store to see the physical artefacts at the end of the second
workshop. Since one of the objectives of Phase 1 was to scope the influence of the
environment on use, comparisons were made between usage of physical artefacts in the
museum store and usage of digital artefacts in digital environments.

As explained above (Section 3.4.2), Wenger proposes that learning takes place as a result of the
tension between four sets of dualities. These dualities were used to frame loosely the overall
research design in Phase 1. Participants were given the opportunity of participating in
discussions or activities, such as artefact selection, and were asked to reify knowledge in

120

presentations. This represented the participation-reification duality. The semi-structured
nature of interviews, workshops and store visits allowed for planned (designed) and unplanned
(emergent) activity, while the use of individual interviews and group activities built on the
duality of identification-negotiability. In this way it was hoped that a temporary community of
practice could be developed during the course of the project which might reveal boundary
issues between CoPs as well as the potential for synergies (working with the local-global
duality). The research design was also intended to facilitate a ‘rhythm’ (Wenger 1998) between
reflection and practice among participants. This was done by combining opportunities for
interaction through discussion and personal reflection, with practical activities carried out
individually (within one’s perceived CoP) and collaboratively. In this way, the trial was focused
on reflective practice within and between different disciplines.

Finally, artefact use is a quiet business; it is difficult to detect and to describe since much of it is
thought to occur on a cognitive level (Rambusch, Susi et al.. 2004). Therefore, one of the key
challenges in research design was creating conditions for individuals to externalise thoughts on
use, as well as interact directly with physical or digital artefacts. This was done through the use
of questions in the profiling interview, and activities set for practitioners and students during
store visits and workshops. Since exposure to artefacts during the course of interviews and
workshops was minimal, discussions about artefact use as well as actual interaction with digital
and physical artefacts constituted the data set which would be used to analyse patterns of use.
Participation, whether spoken or embodied, would be used as a reflection of how artefacts are
used by individuals and would then be related back to their community of practice. To turn a
quote from Shakespeare’s Coriolanus (Act III, Scene ii) on its head, eloquence is action as much

121

as ‘action is eloquence’ (Shakespeare 1991, 851). As Wenger states, ‘Words as projections of
human meaning are certainly a form of reification’(1998, 62). In his foreword to Wenger and
Lave’s seminal, Situated Learning and Legitimate Peripheral Participation (2009), William Hanks
highlights how the authors have acknowledged that,
a significant body of theory and research has shown that speech is equally a means of
acting in the world. The point is germane, since language use entails multiple
participatory skills, and is one of the most basic modes of access to interaction in social
life (ibid., 22).
The versatility of Grounded Theory allowed both words and actions to be encoded (explained in
Section 3.4.5) and for the abstraction of meaning based on a simple question, ‘how are
individuals using artefacts?’.

3.5.3 Phase 1 Stage 1: Selection and digitisation
Six students were recruited from the Shakespeare Institute following an internal email calling
for digital interns (Creese 2012a).49 Given the limited timeframe for the project and the need to
make the process seem as close as possible to how artefacts might be used in real research,
parameters were set for the process of selection. Students were sent a list of museum, library
and archive artefacts relating to Shakespeare’s play, The Tempest. This play was chosen
because students would be reasonably familiar with it through study and because it was then
being performed by the RSC in Stratford-upon-Avon, giving the project more topicality and
relevance. Students were asked to review the artefact list, consisting only of metadata (no

122

images were available), with a view to making a selection once they visited the museum store
in order to address a research question: ‘how can artefacts reveal performance choices?’

The six students were then filmed over the course of three hours in the Wharf Road museum
store, which housed art, props, and costumes owned by the RSC and partly managed by the
Shakespeare Birthplace Trust. The visit was video recorded by the author and a colleague;
students were asked to articulate any thoughts verbally and asked to record any reflections in a
journal, submitted afterwards for analysis. A museum assistant (CS) led the tour, introduced
students to the museum database, and responded to student requests to see particular
artefacts. Questions were asked by the author, and two lecturers (AA and SS, who also took
part in subsequent stages) to clarify the students’ criteria for the selection of artefacts, and to
ask how they would like artefacts to be digitised. Another separate session took place at the
Shakespeare Birthplace Trust’s central store on Henley Street, Stratford-upon-Avon, with two
students from the MASSACHRE course who were asked to speak about artefacts selected from
the museum collection which date from the time of Shakespeare and relate to The Tempest.
This session, which lasted one hour, was led by a doctoral research student (AP) and video and
audio recorded by the author.

In total, ten artefacts were selected and digitised from the Wharf Road store: this included six
costumes and four props. Four artefacts were digitised from the Henley Street store (a rapier,
medicine chest, leather-covered box, and knife sheath). A digitisation ‘wishlist’ for each artefact
was produced from the transcript of the store visit and passed to digitisation specialists at the
University of Birmingham’s Vista Centre, which specialised in 2D and 3D visualisation of

123

artefacts. 25 close-up and full scale photographs were produced of the selected artefacts and
three of the four historic artefacts50 were scanned in three dimensions and made available to
participants using Meshlab software.

3.5.4 Phase 1 Stage 2: Profiling interviews
With one exception, all 14 practitioners who took part in Workshops 1 and 2 were interviewed
in March 2012. Because of professional commitments, one actor (AD) who had previously been
interviewed could not attend workshops but was replaced at the last minute by another (AW).
The overall aim of the interview was to assess whether individuals were members of particular
CoPs, to assess their role in the digital supply chain, to externalise any knowledge, experience
or attitudes surrounding artefact use and the use of digital technology, and to make
interviewees aware of the structure and purpose of the project. A profiling interview guide
based on the three components of a CoP identified by Wenger – domain, community and
practice – and referencing previous work done on assessing CoP membership (e.g. Wubbles
2007), was first trialled with a volunteer. Modifications were made to questions mainly to
clarify what was being asked and to explain any terminology. Interviews were then conducted
either in a neutral location or the interviewee’s place of work to try, as far as possible, to put
them at ease. The guide was designed to provide enough structure to be able to compare
responses across interviews but was employed in such a way that interesting areas of
discussion (pertinent to the research questions on communities of practice and artefact usage)
were followed-up as far as possible. In other words, interviewees were regarded as informants
50

The fourth, a rapier, proved too reflective for 3D scanning.

124

not respondents (Knight 2002, 51). This semi-structured format suited the scoping nature of
Phase 1 and avoided the pitfalls of highly structured frameworks which,
lock respondents into the researcher’s theory of what matters [...] [and] [...] reduce
their ability to convey the complexity of their experience, perceptions or feelings
(Knight 2002, 52).
Interviews were audio and video recorded, and then transcribed by the interviewer as soon as
possible after the event. The transcript was then sent to interviewees for verification of
accuracy and any anonymisation to check that this had been carried out appropriately. The
interview transcript, plus transcriptions of individual contributions to discussions held later in
the trial, was then analysed on a number of different levels (described in Section 3.5.9) to
establish whether or not participants were members of a particular community of practice, and
how they use artefacts.

3.5.5 Phase 1 Stage 3: Workshop 1
All 14 participants were invited to attend a one-day workshop at the IBM Visual and Spatial
Technology Centre (VISTA), University of Birmingham. They were joined by four doctoral
research students based at the Shakespeare Institute. Prior to this workshop, participants were
issued with the images and metadata generated in Stage 1 (made available using Basecamp51),
and then paired-up (on the basis of the closeness of their areas of practice) and asked to
prepare a five minute presentation for Workshop 1 based on how they would encourage and
facilitate research on The Tempest using this material. After a short introduction by AA, the

convenor and chair of the workshop, participants introduced themselves and presented their
ideas followed by a general discussion. On the basis of this discussion, two groups were then
formed to take forward ideas to encourage and facilitate research on the play with a view to
creating a blueprint of a product. This format was designed to allow for participation and
reification and externalise how each individual uses artefacts or their attitudes about use.
Communication between group members after Workshop 1 was encouraged on Basecamp,
although this did not happen to a great extent.

3.5.6 Phase 1 Stage 4: Workshop 2
Three weeks after Workshop 1, a second workshop was held at the Shakespeare Birthplace
Trust’s headquarters in Stratford-upon-Avon.52 There was a high retention rate of participants
and all but one of the practitioners from Workshop 1 attended Workshop 2. The reason for the
change of venue was to allow participants to gain access to the physical artefacts from which
the images and metadata had been taken. Before this took place, each group formed during
Workshop 1 presented their blueprint for the encouragement or facilitation of research on The
Tempest using the digital artefacts created during Workshop 1, followed by a discussion
reflecting on some of the main themes emerging from both workshops. Participants then
inspected physical artefacts in the museum store and were asked about the differences
between the digital artefacts they had been sent and the physical-original.

52

This was the closest date to the first workshop which most participants could attend, chosen in order to
maintain momentum.

126

3.5.7 Phase 1 Stage 5: Use by distance learning students
Three students (DL1-3), two of whom were enrolled on the MA Shakespeare and Theatre
programme and one who was in the final year of their PhD (Shakespeare Studies) were
recruited following a general email appeal for volunteers issued to all distance learning
students (Creese 2012b). These three students were then supplied the same images and
metadata created in Stage 1 which were supplied to practitioners for the workshops. However,
these were made available on the University of Birmingham’s VLE, WebCT, in order to gauge
the affordances or limitations of this environment. Students were asked to review the digital
artefacts and then answer three questions:
1. How would you use this material to answer the question, ‘how can artefacts reveal
performance choices?’
2. What is missing (in terms of tools or other information / resources) which would
enhance use of this material?
3. Did you have any problems accessing or using this material?
Responses were sent to the author and any points of interest were then followed-up. Although
an attempt was made to encourage all three students to exchange views on a web forum, this
did not prove successful because of time differences in home countries.53 Transcripts of
responses were anonymised before analysis. As a way of assessing the efficacy of the
digitisation process, three students (B, C and E) involved in Stage 1 were asked to reflect on the
differences between the use value (in research) of the physical artefacts they had selected and
the digital artefacts that had been produced. These were published as blogs and included
within the dataset for analysis.

53

One student was in the USA, another was based in Chile, and the third was based in the UK.

127

3.5.8 Phase 1: Data collection
Each activity in Stages 1-4 was video and audio recorded (using a number of separate devices to
increase the quality of capture and reduce the risk of data loss) and a series of field notes made
based on observations of footage. All audio (approximately 20 hours) was transcribed (172,519
words) by the author and a number of other sources such as participant journals, reflective
blogs, and records of conversations held between workshops were gathered and filed, and the
identity of all participants anonymised.

Table 5. Phase 1 research objectives and methods of analysis

In order to answer the question of whether individuals were members of one or more
communities of practice, three forms of analysis were used. Firstly, responses to interview
questions were collated through a process of recursive abstraction. This involved the systematic
summarisation of datasets, to form summary sheets and a profiling grid for each practitioner.

129

Reasons were then noted for the sifting and summarising of data to make any loss of meaning
in the decontextualisation of data, transparent and accountable. This allowed a picture of
individual responses as well as cross-referencing between practitioner groups and the whole
sample to assess the validity of Wenger’s theoretical model. The tabulation of data made it
possible to assess against Wenger’s definition of a community of practice and to detect
patterning among individuals. 54 Secondly, examination of the frequency of words used during
interviews and workshops was undertaken using N-Vivo 10 software. Reports itemising the top
50 words used by each participant were collated, and then compared across practitioner
groups and the whole sample for any patterning. Finally, Grounded Theory was employed to
detect types of artefact use from textual and visual records of interviews and workshops. This
was done on an individual basis and then compared to other individuals in the sample to detect
patterning which might or might not be commensurate with membership of a CoP.

This generated qualitative and quantitative data (see Appendix E) indicating broad patterns in
the way that artefacts are used. These were then mapped to Kolb’s four learning styles.
Qualitative analysis of interview and workshop transcripts was undertaken to discern
practitioner perspectives on the use of artefacts and to scope issues associated with the
selection, digitisation and packaging of artefacts which might affect end use. Qualitative
analysis of the responses from distance learning students, and a comparison of coding patterns
(generated using Grounded Theory) across the distance learning sample and the campus-based
student, were designed to assess the affordances and limitations of WebCT as a digital learning
environment.
54

According to Wenger, all communities of practice share three structural elements: a knowledge domain, a
community of people, and a shared practice (2002, 29).

130

In order to recognise and describe forms of artefact usage among communities of practice and
in different formats (physical and digital), a broad working definition of use was developed by
looking at samples of the trial transcripts and asking the basic question, ‘How are participants
engaging with artefacts?’ Looking through transcripts for descriptors which relate to cognitive
and physical engagement with artefacts, 119 different types of use were identified. In total,
over 13,661 code references were made from an analysis of the entire transcript, some 2538
references from student-related activities, and 11,123 references from practitioner-related
activities. Use of the physical artefact was taken to mean interaction via direct, bodily access to
an original artefact or discussion about the same; use of the digital artefact was defined as an
engagement with material digitised from an original artefact, or discussion about the same.
Context was key when categorising forms of use: video footage was used to discriminate
whether artefacts were being used in physical or digital form.

In order to test the robustness of codes and increase validity, transcripts were coded across the
whole sample and incidence rates calculated for individuals and communities of practice. Code
types were then refined and rationalised into a parent and child code schema (e.g. Figure 10).
Negative case analysis was used to revise, broaden and confirm patterns emerging from the
data by detecting and analysing deviance. Incidence rates were calculated for individuals and
compared to a group mean to ensure patterns of usage were shared across communities of
practice. N-Vivo 10 software was used to facilitate the coding of transcripts. This helped with
the volume of data and the variety of formats and allowed choices made in the analysis to be
auditable.

131

This example from a discussion of the digitised artefact by a postgraduate student, ST, during
Phase 1, shows how codes were formed from the text:
Like if you’re gonna have an image, it would be [...] if you could somehow link it55 and
have a production photo too56, because you’ve got the article of clothing but you’re
missing the RSC costume so if you could have both linked in together57 and
information like58, like an art historian (pointing to AH) would have: what’s the
material59, what’s the medium60, what’s the weight61, the dimensions62 these are really
really important (ST 2012, 5).
The number of occurrences of these codes was calculated by individual and by CoP and a
percentage formed relative to other forms of use (this helped provide a basis for comparison
between CoPs since the number of practitioners in each varied). This resulted in qualitative and
quantitative data on the incidence of particular codes by each CoP. For example, incidence of
the code, ‘assessing materials’, across all transcripts can be represented in a chart (Figure 5)
according to percentage use by each CoP.

Therefore, abstracting information from transcripts was used to serve three main purposes:
to detect patterns in practice (manifested in artefact use) across the sample in order to
interrogate the community of practice model
to scope how artefacts are used and how membership of a CoP might affect this
to scope how the context of use – the usage environment – might affect the quality of
interaction
The findings, following these forms of analysis, are given in Chapter 4.

134

In order to test the five main hypotheses, the scope of Phase 2 narrowed to focus on a strand of
the digital supply chain: end-users. Although postgraduate students were selected to represent
a single academic CoP, their recruitment from three different disciplines was intended to
introduce a variable – domain – to test its influence on usage behaviour and learning style.
The other variable in Phase 2 was context: four controlled learning environments, two physical
and two digital were selected to test the influence of context on artefact use. Finally, while
Phase 1 concerned mainly discussions about use, Phase 2 focused on actual use in order to test
hypotheses on categories of use and learning style.

3.5.11 Phase 2: Test participants
20 postgraduate students were recruited from three different disciplines at the University of
Birmingham to form the sample for Phase 2 testing. There were two main reasons why
postgraduate students were selected. Firstly, the research questions concern use and while
Phase 1 did scope processes of use the focus was principally on the roles of those involved in
the digital supply chain rather than end-users. Phase 2 centred on end-users so the recruitment
of those with experience of using digital artefacts in research was essential. Secondly, since
context was one of the variables in Phase 2 and digital learning environments are the focus of
the main research question, end-users needed to be familiar with virtual learning
environments.

To attract student volunteers an advertisement was circulated at the Shakespeare Institute
and, separately, in the University of Birmingham’s postgraduate newsletter. Ten student

135

volunteers came forward from the Shakespeare Institute (six PhD and four MA students).
However, only three students came forward from the University and they were from three
different disciplines. These numbers were not sufficient to generate a large enough sample.
Therefore, more proactive recruitment was required. Two disciplines that use physical and
digital artefacts in research were identified: Digital Cultures (a module which is part of the MA
History of Art programme), and Egyptology. Four Digital Cultures students and six Egyptology
students (four PhD and two MA students) were recruited. Of the 20 students, the Shakespeare
Studies and Digital Cultures students were known to the author: the curator of the Eton Myers
Collection63, also a postgraduate student who took part in testing, was also known to the
author.

3.5.12 Phase 2: Test environments
The choice of learning environments was based on the types of context in which all three
disciplines are likely to encounter artefacts in postgraduate research: two types of digital and
two types of physical environments.

In terms of digital learning environments, one formal and one informal environment were
chosen. During 2013, the University of Birmingham was in the process of replacing WebCT as its
virtual learning environment. Therefore the new VLE, Canvas by Instructure was selected as a
learning environment (Environment A). Since outside the VLE most students would be expected

is on loan to the University of Birmingham.

136

to use the internet for artefact-based research, different websites (Flickr, a museum database,
and a blog) constituted different elements of an online learning environment (Environment B).

Two physical environments were used to continue the line of enquiry started in Phase 1,
namely that there seemed to be clear differences in how artefacts are used in digital and
physical form. Although the main research question concerns digital learning environments, the
inclusion of two physical environments was also intended to act as a control or baseline for the
digital environments and to test the recurrence of types of use of physical artefacts found in
Phase 1. The postgraduate students in Phase 2 had all used artefacts in a formal museum or
gallery context or behind the scenes in a handling session as part of their degree. Therefore,
this environment was mocked-up in the test using a handling artefact (Environment C) and a
small display case (Environment D). There are undoubtedly other scenarios in which
postgraduate students might encounter artefacts, such as hybrid environments where access to
the internet and the physical artefact are possible at the same time, and variations within each
of the four environments, but these four test environments were considered to be most
representative of the experience of postgraduate students, and most feasible given time
constraints with each participant.

The tests took place in three locations: the author’s office in The Shakespeare Institute, the
Eton-Myers Museum on the University of Birmingham’s Selly Oak Campus, and a meeting room
at Redmarley, the museum collection offices on the University of Birmingham’s main campus in
Edgbaston. The artificiality of the wider context of each test environment – the setting of the
test within an office, a meeting room or a museum - does not correspond with how students

137

would normally experience Environments A-D and factors such as lighting levels, temperature,
time of day, and the physical layout of the test environment varied from test to test. However,
attempts were made to reduce these variables as far as possible. Lessons were learned during
two pilot studies (see Section 3.4.5) to offset some of the variables which might compromise
the test results.

3.5.13 Phase 2: Test artefacts
The artefacts used within each environment were selected by the author on the basis that they
were related to the discipline of each student group and typologically alike across all three
groups. This was done, as far as possible, to allow comparison between each group not on the
basis of artefact but environment. By being related to the participant’s discipline the artefacts
were likely to draw on the knowledge and interests of the test subject. Artefacts that were
approximately of the same type (figurines) and size were needed to, as far as possible,
eliminate this as a difference between different student groups. A range of figurines (shown in
Table 7) familiar to the Shakespeare Studies (coded SS64) and Egyptology (EG) students (shown
in Table 8) were selected on the basis that they are artefacts which these students would
typically have used as part of their research degree. Different figurines were needed in each
environment since the tasks involved questions regarding the identification, contextualisation
and interpretation of each artefact; if the artefact had been the same in each environment this
would have defeated the objective since the test subject would already be familiar with that
artefact. The artefacts used in the testing of Digital Cultures (DC) students were the same as

138

those used in the Shakespeare Institute student test, with the exception of the handling
artefact65. This was done because the artefacts were items of decorative art and, as such,
would not have been unfamiliar to DC students, and would provide some basis for comparison
between the two disciplines (SS and DC). The Egyptology artefacts were selected by the author
following a meeting with the Curator of the Eton Myers Collection: the artefacts needed to be
figurines which were accessible and usable during the trial, and for which metadata was
available.

3.5.14 Phase 2: Test format
The task environment, or the conditions and goals set upon the user, were identical for each
test session although there was a degree of flexibility. For example, some questions were not
asked if information had already been given in that line, and the order of questions also varied
depending on how the participant responded to each task and question. Any points of interest
or responses which required clarification were followed-up. There were three tasks set for each
environment based on the same artefact, with a number of questions designed to test how
each participant used the artefact and how the environment influenced this process. These are
given in Appendix D. The task was layered, beginning with the artefact alone, either in image
form (digital environments) or in physical form (physical environments), and then involving
metadata on the artefact to test forms of use. The tasks and questions were kept relatively
simple to make testing of all four environments possible in one session. The order in which
these were carried out was varied from session to session again to try to eliminate this as a
factor influencing how each environment was experienced.

In Task 1, participants were asked to identify and describe the artefact, thinking about its age,
manufacture, and purpose (Questions a-e), and then to comment on what helps or hinders
identification of the artefact (Questions f-j). These questions were prescriptive in the sense that
they reflect the main categories of use found in Phase 1 – identification, contextualisation, and
interpretation – and they attempt to gauge the influence of the environment in which an
artefact is used. A structure of this type was considered necessary to turn what had been
informal discussions about use in Phase 1 to an artefact-based learning exercise – involving
learning goals - in Phase 2. Although use processes themselves are in the spotlight in this test,

142

some structure was needed to test against to focus principally on the limitations and
affordances of the environment, but this was also a way of testing the relevance of use
categories since coding was done anew. Task 2 introduced participants to an ‘information
environment’ (Ross and Terras 2011): metadata on the artefact was supplied either via an
online database, website or blog (Environments A and B), or a catalogue sheet or object label
(Environments C and D). Task 2 questions focused on the difference this metadata makes to
identification, contextualisation and interpretation of the artefact, what information is missing,
and how the information environment affects artefact use. Finally, Task 3 asked participants to
reflect on their experience of each environment and to suggest a utopian alternative. This task
was designed to source information on artefact use and environmental affordances outside the
parameters of tasks, questions and environments.

In order to assess the participant’s learning style, two methods were used: the coding of use
types from transcripts and video footage, and subsequent mapping to learning styles, and
testing using a Kolbian Learning Style Inventory (LSI). The choice of LSI test is discussed above
in relation to Phase 1 and the same reasons applied for selecting this test in Phase 2: brevity
and usability for a mixed sample. Participants were asked to complete the LSI test at the end of
the session although some, for practical reasons, completed it before.

Tests were conducted one at a time; the author acted as participant-observer (with ‘moderate
participation’ (DeWalt 1998, 24) explaining the purpose of the test and then asking participants
to carry out a number of simple tasks followed by a series of questions (explained above). The
dis-benefits of influencing the actions of the testers were considered to be outweighed by the

143

need to provide prompts and to ensure proper recording of the test. Participants were asked to
follow a ‘think aloud protocol’ so that their experience of each environment would be reflected,
as far as possible, in the textual record. This was particularly important in the digital
environments because of the absence of tracking software either attached in some way to the
participant or available on the test computer.

Two pilots of the test were run to assess the validity of tasks and questions, and the usability of
data produced. The first pilot was held on 7 March 2013 with eight international undergraduate
students from different disciplines, who took part in one of the University of Birmingham’s
MOMD (Modules Outside the Main Discipline). The pilot took the form of a workshop where an
overview of learning environments was given by the author before students were split into
small groups (2-3 persons) and given 15 minutes to complete tasks within four different
learning environments. Responses were not video recorded but written responses on
tasksheets and a general debrief after testing allowed feedback on the setting-up of each
environment, the nature of tasks, and the relative advantages and disadvantages of each
environment.

The tasks were refined in three different areas. The wording of some questions was altered to
make what was being asked clearer, an introduction to each learning environment was
factored-in to the beginning of Task 1 in each environment to give participants time to adapt,
and some questions were removed to make the tasks quicker to complete.66 After these
modifications were made, a second pilot was held with a librarian volunteer at the Shakespeare
66

Feedback from the first pilot indicated that the differences between environments were not clear.

144

Birthplace Trust on 11 March 2013. This took the form of a one-to-one session and was video
and audio recorded. This pilot demonstrated that different equipment was needed to capture
data.67 The manoevreability of cameras was also a problem especially since they needed to be
moved between all four environments within the test session. Therefore, webcams were
chosen instead for reliability and improved flexibility (the size of webcams make movement
between environments and adjustment easier although there are limitations in terms of cable
length from a laptop) and discretion (their size makes intrusiveness less of an issue). Finally, a
Kolbian learning style test was trialled with MOMD students: feedback indicated that the test
was easy to complete and could be quickly analysed.

3.5.15 Phase 2: Data collection
In total, 20 sessions were held, ten of which took place with Shakespeare Studies students, six
with Egyptology students, and four with Digital Cultures students. Each session took an average
of 51 minutes, with roughly 13 minutes spent by most participants within each environment.
Each test was carried out at a time to suit students over the course of two months (April –
Might 2013). Sessions were video recorded using an iPad and webcam, and audio recorded
using an iPhone app68. Overall, 17 hours of usable audio were recorded, and this was
transcribed by the author with the assistance of Siri voice recognition software to produce

transcripts totalling 94,396 words. These transcripts were anonymised and sent back to
participants for verification, before being analysed.

Two problems arose during data collection which impacted on data analysis and findings. Hard
drive failure on 11th April 2013 led to the loss of video data for the test session with student
SS269. This meant that only an audio recording was available. The absence of observational data
affected the calculation of learning style from the incidence of use codes. Also, a temporary loss
of internet connectivity in the Eton Myers Museum Room during the test session with Student
EG1 meant that no data was recorded for this part of the session. Again, this affected the use of
coding information, in calculating learning style and assessing the influence of environment.

69

Although regular back-ups were made hard drive failure occurred before this could be done.

Table 9. Phase 2 hypotheses and methods of analysis

The coding of artefact use was a fundamental part of Phase 2 data analysis. It was required to
explore the connection between domain and learning style (Hypothesis 1), between usage style
and learning style (Hypothesis 3), and to assess the influence of the environment on use

147

(Hypothesis 5). Coding of Phase 2 data was also required to test whether the ways that
individuals use artefacts are broadly similar but that differences might be found between
particular CoPs (Hypothesis 2). Finally, the process of coding itself was under scrutiny
(Hypothesis 4). Word frequency analysis was identical to that carried out in Phase 1.

The major difference between coding in Phase 1 and Phase 2 was that in the latter, video
footage of test sessions was encoded as well as textual records. This was also done using
Grounded Theory in the same way as coding transcripts: the question ‘How are participants
using artefacts?’ formed the basis of generating or verifying types of use. All video footage was
coded to increase validity. The constant comparative method was used to refine codes as they
were generated. Incidence rates were then calculated for individuals and compared to a group
mean to ensure patterns of usage were shared across communities of practice. N-Vivo 10
software was used to facilitate the coding of video footage. The order of coding was also
important. In order to focus only on actions, observational analysis was first carried out without
sound. Coding was then rechecked with sound to make sure that the context of use matched
what was supposed.

The mapping of codes for use to learning style was similar to that used during Phase 1 but there
were some revisions made to categorisation of codes. For example, the codes ‘describing’ and
‘comparing ideas’ categorised in Phase 1 as examples of interpretation, were reclassified in
Phase 2 as types of contextualisation. The overlap between contextualisation and
interpretation is discussed in Chapter 4 and these codes fall into the grey areas between the
two categories. However, the context of how participants described artefacts and compared

148

ideas about them in the learning environments in Phase 2 was considered to be closer to
placing the artefact within a particular context rather than deriving meaning from them.
However, this re-categorisation was exceptional; most codes remained within the same
category in both phases. Also, as noted in Chapter 5, a large number of types of use found in
Phase 1 were verified in Phase 2. The process of coding expanded and contracted in response
to the circumstances in which data was gathered in each phase. In Phase 1, the focus on issues
surrounding stewardship of collections was responsible for the code category ‘curation’; in
Phase 2 the focus on actual use meant that far fewer codes which align with ‘curation’ were
found, and there was a dramatic expansion of the code category emotion-action because of the
degree of interaction with artefacts. Finally, so that coding would not be influenced by the LSI
test results, the latter were calculated after the usage-learning style mapping exercise was
complete.

4. RESULTS: PHASE 1 (ARTEFACTS AND PRACTITIONERS)

In the previous chapter, a series of aims and objectives were defined for each phase of research

This chapter presents findings from Phase 1 in response to each of these questions before
summarising the main findings and proposing hypotheses for testing in Phase 2.

150

4.2 Are individuals in the sample members of a community of practice?
4.2.1 Introduction
In order to address this question, firstly, evidence of CoP membership among trial participants
was sought. Wenger states that members of a CoP share the same three characteristics
(Wenger 2002, 29):
Interest in a domain of knowledge which defines a set of issues
Alignment with a community of people who care about this domain
Signs of a shared practice that they are developing to be effective in their domain
Therefore, to qualify as a CoP there must be a focus on a common ‘domain of knowledge’,
relationships between people who steward this, and some practical activity as knowledge is
translated into practice. The whole process will involve collaborative learning (Wenger 2013).
However, the process of mapping domains of interest, proving whether an individual belongs to
a particular community or refines practice as a result of mutual interest in a domain is
problematic. An individual might not identify with a particular CoP or might indeed identify with
several. Communities might be short or long lived, informal or formal, localised or dispersed.
Wenger acknowledges the difficulties of detecting membership by describing a CoP as, ‘an
intention – however tacit and distributed – to steward a domain of knowledge and to sustain
learning about it’ (Wenger 2013). Various strategies (outlined in Chapter 3) were adopted to
externalise this ‘intention’ to steward knowledge and ‘sustain learning about it’ and to reveal
attitudes and behaviour which might be ‘tacit’. Although all three characteristics of a CoP are
closely related, for the sake of analysis, the twin axes of domain-practice, domain-community,
and community-practice are examined in turn to look for evidence of the ‘intention’ to steward

151

knowledge and learn collaboratively, before looking at how membership of a CoP and ways of
learning might influence artefact usage (Section 4.2.2).

4.2.2 Domain and Practice
4.2.2.1 Domain and Practice: Introduction
The reification of knowledge, Wenger explains, is a critical aspect of membership of a
community of practice. The connection between a domain of interest and how this interest is
channelled into some form of activity defines a community of practice and demonstrates how a
CoP stewards knowledge. This section looks at two aspects of the link between domain and
practice: how participants define their work role, and membership of work-related groups.

4.2.2.2 Domain and Practice: Defining work roles
The connections between domain and practice are most easily discerned in the self-definition
of work roles. Although trial participants were selected on the basis that they represent the
main constituent groups involved in the creation and use of artefacts in a VLE, in order to find
out whether participants really identified with particular domains, the profiling interview
contained a series of questions about work and work-related groups designed to drill down to
their particular ‘concern or passion’ (Wenger 2013) as well as their formal work role. Therefore,
opening with a general question asking the candidate to ‘tell me a bit about yourself’ (Question
1, Appendix B) and then asking the same question in an extra-curricular scenario (Question 4,
Appendix B) was intended to expose any difference between their job title and how they like to

152

describe what they do in a social setting, to single out possible domains. This produced primary
and secondary descriptors for each participant (excluding students) given in Appendix A. For
example, CC first described her role using its official title, ‘Museum Collections Officer’ but later
qualified this by saying ‘curator’(CC 2012, 1). AT first described what he does as ‘teacher’ (AT
2012, 1) but then goes on to say ‘teacher of the bible’ (ibid., 2). Despite variation across the
sample in the way practitioners describe what they do, responses show that trial participants
identify with domain interests broadly commensurate with their perceived community of
practice (heritage practitioners, academics, performers, and digital creatives) and that the
modification between primary and secondary descriptors not only highlights a ‘concern or
passion’ (Wenger 2013), or in the case of digital creatives a way of referencing what they do to
known professions, but might be suggestive of membership of more than one CoP.

Looking in more detail at how domain fits with practice, heritage practitioners seemed most
confident in identifying their domain and area of practice and demonstrated most consistency
throughout the trial in the desire to be regarded as a distinct community of practice.
Significantly, heritage practitioners make most use of the word ‘professional’, more than
performers and digital creatives put together. Although the word is used by all participants
from the heritage practitioner CoP there is one outstanding example which is worth looking at
because it places enough stress on the word to go beyond casual use and, importantly, it was
used to make a point to other CoPs in Workshop 1. LU, a Rare Books Librarian, began a
presentation with the following explanation of how heritage professions are involved in the
research process,

153

I want to talk briefly as a way of introduction just about the way that professionals,
collections professionals, position themselves in relation to the research process [...] So
what we do is [...] as professionals is that we look after collections [...] and collections
are managed by different types of professionals, they’re managed by librarians, they’re
managed by archivists, and they’re managed by curators and all of those share the use
of conservators so there’s four different professions that manage different collections
[...] used by researchers (LU 2012a, 15).

Such density of use of the words ‘profession’ and ‘professional’ reinforces the point that
heritage practitioners are clearer about their role or are more dependent on it being regarded
as ‘professional’ to explain what they do. In other words, domain and practice appear to be
closely linked for this CoP. However, there was less consensus among heritage practitioners
when asked to describe the differences between sub-domains (museums, libraries and
archives). All practitioners (with the exception of the collections manager, CM) had recourse to
using the types of collections material cared for rather than work practice as the chief way of
discriminating between librarians, archivists and curators. This calls into question the shared
identity of this practitioner group, even within sub domains, something which is reinforced
when looking at levels of participation or activism within the CoP, and ways of learning among
this group.

Although digital creatives showed a clear commitment to a domain (described by DW most
generally as ‘digital’ (DW 2012a)) and area of practice, with one exception the digital creatives
found themselves hardest to define. When asked to describe what she did, one participant (DP)
who co-runs a digital agency said, ‘to be honest I always find it quite hard [...] I don’t really have
a noun as it were’ (DP 2012a, 1) suggesting this is a frequently asked question without a single
answer. DP went on to say that she was a ‘project worker’ who does ‘internet stuff’ (ibid.).

154

After describing the division of labour which has developed in the digital sector among coders,
designers, writers and so on, DP outlined the broad portfolio of work taken on by her agency.
They have recently gravitated towards developing digital strategies ‘accidentally’ (ibid.),
although DP later reflected that, ‘I see myself as a content strategist at heart’ (ibid.).
Throughout the course of the profiling interview, DW kept returning to the first question which
asked what he did. At one point he light-heartedly added that his young daughter told her
friends that her dad, ‘tits around on the internet’ (DW 2012a, 3). This role flexibility suits the
rapid pace of change in digital technology and the agility that is required to win contracts (all
digital creatives who took part in the trial were self-employed).70 DC, the director of a digital
SME (which DS works for), found his role much more difficult to pin down talking about his job
variously in terms of management, ‘digital and design’ (DC 2012a, 1) and entrepreneurship
though the latter was mentioned reluctantly. Only one participant, DS, defined her role in only
one way, as a digital consultant strategist, but this was the exception rather than the rule in this
CoP.

The digital creatives’ difficulty in classifying what they do has undercurrents of antiprofessionalism. One participant, DW, who described himself as a digital writer and producer
and ‘a sort of digital guy’ claimed the medium makes little difference and decried the boxing-in
of roles within the digital sector (DW 2012a, 1). DW says that the work that he does directly
with audiences places ‘professionals under threat’ (ibid., 7) by changing the relationship
between author and audience. What is proposed is a peer-to-peer rather than professional-toprofessional set of relationships in his area of work, and that his area of practice is,
70

Whether digital creatives who are not self-employed have fewer issues with self-identification is worthy of
further investigation.

155

becoming industrialised which is a good thing in a way because it allows people to
develop a practice and they feel like they’ve got a job to talk to their mums about but
on the other hand I think it sort of limits the potential to some extent because [...] we
should still be in quite an experimental stage where we don’t know what we’re doing
with this stuff..(ibid.).
Digital creatives perhaps find it most difficult to identify with a single domain because of the
changing nature of their job, and the broad skillset, creativity and flexibility this requires. DC, a
company director, points out that ‘The whole point of new media is it’s new, it’s not proven’
(DC 2012a, 4) and this requires a degree of dexterity and experimentalism to respond to the
particular challenges of a project. AT, a textual editor, in speaking about digital projects,
concurs saying that,
there’s no reason particularly why how anything was done in the past should apply you
know how people relate to each other, how networks are formed, and what the nature
of the job [...] it’s [...] it is actually changing all the time (AT 2012, 4-5).
This challenges the fixedness of a single domain and the effect this might have on communities
and networks which form around a common interest albeit temporarily.

It is more difficult to generalise across the sample of performers who took part in Phase 1
because of the low number of participants and the fact that the actor (AW) who took part in
the workshops was not interviewed. However, both full-time performers who took part in
Phase 1 described themselves as professional actors and both identified with the actors’ union,
Equity, as a community of practice of sorts. ED, an arts educator and former actress, still
identified with the profession but the interdisciplinary nature of her present role perhaps
accounts for the various descriptions given for her job such as ‘teacher trainer’ (ED 2012a, 1),
‘arts educator’ (ibid.), and a ‘teacher’ (ibid., 3).

156

The academic CoP appears to combine a degree of uniformity in describing their professional
teaching role, with greatest scope in that role suggesting a community of communities of
practice. All but one academic described themselves as a lecturer, but there was considerable
diversity among this CoP in terms of secondary descriptors such as ‘project worker’ (AT 2012,
4), ‘critic’ (ibid., 3), ‘editor’ (ibid., 5), ‘teacher’ (AS 2012a, 4), and ‘researcher’ (AH 2012a, 1).
One academic (AH) described herself using five different terms.

The other participant group in the trial was research students recruited from the Shakespeare
Institute. These included campus-based MA and PhD students, and off-site distance-learning
students. Although time constraints and uncertainty of attendance at workshops made profiling
interviews infeasible, these students had elected to study ‘Shakespeare’ at postgraduate level
which implies an intrinsic interest in the subject and requires externalisation of that interest in
the form of graded work. Analysis of transcripts, reflective journals, blogs, and VLE forum
discussions shows that there is an obvious orientation around the domain of Shakespeare and
Theatre (one of the MA courses offered by the Institute) and the cultural history of
Shakespeare’s period and the staging of his plays (another MA offered by the Institute is
‘Shakespeare, Stratford-upon-Avon and the Cultural History of Renaissance England’, or
MASSACHRE). Tellingly, one distance learning student articulated a sense of kinship around
subject,
Many people are critical of the likes of us who scrutinise and analyse in fine detail
everything we see in a performance (DL1 2012, 3).
The scrutinising and analysis of fine detail by this CoP conforms with the notion of ‘shared
competencies’ (2013) Wenger describes which ‘distinguishes members *of a CoP+ from other
people’ (ibid.) and suggests that within the student group there might be communities
157

distinguished by the specificities of their subject (e.g. the performance of Renaissance drama)
but overlapping in an interest in ‘Shakespeare’ in the most general sense.

In this respect, Ludwick Fleck’s notion of ‘thought collectives’ (Sady 2001a, 197), although not
about practice per se, is useful to conceptualise the connection between CoPs on the basis of
domain interests. A thought collective is ‘a community of persons mutually exchanging ideas or
maintaining intellectual interaction’ (ibid.). These communities are both esoteric (a small circle
of experts) and exoteric (a larger circle of less expert teachers and students) and the gradual
participation of novices is reminiscent of that described in Wenger and Lave’s theory of
legitimate peripheral participation but is more tightly restricted and one-sided (i.e. transmission
of knowledge and skills from master to apprentice rather than a mutual learning experience
(Wenger and Lave 2009, 92)). The collective has a dominant ‘thought style’ (Sady 2001a) which
is defined as ‘directed perception, with corresponding mental and objective assimilation of
what has been so perceived’ (ibid.).

In terms of direction, styles of written work, presentation of academic papers, and even modes
of performance in the Shakespeare Institute’s practical MA Shakespeare and Creativity might all
play a part in regulating the link between domain and practice. According to Swales, the
relationship between domain and practice is more likely to be expressed linguistically in texts
rather than in speech since, ‘Academics tend to listen more widely than they read’ (2003, 207).
Moreover, outlets for written work (such as academic journals) are all peer-reviewed imposing
a close control of domain and practice via a community of like-minded scholars. Examining
written work produced by both sets of students for Phase 1 does show a common style of

158

communication among Shakespeare Institute students. Although this is a small sample, all
students who wrote reflective blogs on the difference between costumes and their digital
representation quoted from Shakespeare in some way.71 This suggests that this form of
interpretive description is part of a ‘shared repertoire’ (Wenger 1998, 82) developed by this
CoP. Indeed, during a profiling interview, AS, a lecturer of Shakespeare Studies, described her
research and teaching as ‘focused more on reading and interpreting ideas’ (AS 2012a, 1) and
‘mostly what you’re doing is looking at the words and what the words are doing intellectually,
artistically’ (ibid., 2). This implies that within the domain of Shakespeare Studies, scholarly
expression conforms to a certain type of practice.

In terms of domain of interest, as an academic librarian LS stands at the intersection between
two CoPs linked by domain interest in Shakespeare: heritage practitioners and academics. Her
thoughts (recorded in a reflective journal kept during the trial) on the directorial role of the
librarian are significant,
How far do people who have no background in the study of Shakespeare, performance
and 17th century history [need to] be directed? Quite a lot as they have no lexicon, or
background knowledge for interpretation (LS 2012a, 1).
This echoes comments by distance learning student DL1 on how scholars ‘like us’ are regarded
by others and strongly suggests an insider and outsider perspective relating to domain of
interest. AT, a textual scholar with an interest in Shakespeare, and with whom LS has worked in
the past, is not viewed by LS as an outsider but the digital creatives are all regarded as being
‘not in the Shakespeare or academic world’ (ibid., 2). The librarian’s role in directing perception,
71

For example, Student E quotes 67 words by Shakespeare in a 1100 word post, and uses a line from The Tempest
as the title of the article. Student C quotes 12 words from the play within the article and uses ‘I will discase me’, a
line spoken by Prospero in The Tempest, to entitle the post (2012). Each post also uses language which combines
description with interpretation. For instance, Student C states that a costume ‘shimmers green’ (ibid.) while
Student E describes another costume as ‘reminiscent of bodily decay’ (2012a).

159

according to LS, depends on the degree of autonomy expected of the student. In Workshop 2 LS
explained,
for postgraduate research you’d want something that is not so directed, you want a
whole range of material that people can draw on (2012b, 10).
It is clear that the librarian is a director of perception in terms of resources. LU, a university rare
books librarian, reinforces in describing his role,
students they would come and ask me for advice on what there is on a subject, on a
topic, on a person or an issue and then you’ve got a much richer awareness of the kind
of potential there is within your own locality of finding interesting, relevant material
(2012b, 6).
However, thought style is most orchestrated by lecturers who are closer to the ‘esoteric circle’
postulated by Fleck (Sady 2001a). As lecturers on two MA courses run by the Shakespeare
Institute, AH and AS train students in particular way of thinking. AH reveals to what extent her
role as a director of perception is needed,
you can’t just put stuff up there and hope that people can experience it. You have to
provide some sort of task to direct that experience: that’s our *AH, AS, and AR+ role I
guess [...] my role as curator and academic [...] and it stimulates what you do in the
classroom (2012b, 24).
AH expresses surprise at the effectiveness of inculcating a certain style of thinking among her
students, admitting that,
I was very interested to think about how I’d certainly, without realising it, primed my
students to think in a particular way which has then informed their selection of the
objects (2012b, 15).
In terms of directing learning, Fleck’s concept is in some respects a better fit for a scholarly
community of communities, made up of different practitioners – teachers, students, and
librarians - whose learning is more directed and regulated than one would expect in the type of

160

situated learning described by Wenger and Lave where both the individual and the CoP learn at
the same time (Wenger and Lave 2009, 76).

4.2.2.3 Domain and Practice: Membership of work-related groups
In the profiling interview, asking participants whether or not they are members of any work
related groups was a way of exploring links between interest in a domain and commitment to
that domain. Although this is not a straightforward connection and formalised groups do not
necessarily indicate by themselves genuine interest in a domain (for instance data suggests that
factors such as career stage influence the decision to participate in a professional association) it
at least suggests a degree of commitment to domain beyond casual interest. More direct
questions followed, asking about membership of specific professional groups, roles held within
the CoP and reason for joining.

Although 87% of practitioners are members of work-related groups, there are clear differences
between CoPs on how domain-related knowledge is stewarded. For heritage practitioners,
academics, and performers, there are clear expectations of which professional groups should
be joined. For heritage practitioners, the Museums Association (MA), Archives and Records
Association (ARA), and the Chartered Institute for Library and Information Professionals (CILIPS)
are the formal professional groups for curators, archivists and librarians respectively and
membership of these groups was confirmed among heritage practitioners participating in the
trial. These groups are important in members ‘keeping up to date’ (LS 2012c, 2) but there is

161

little in the way of participation.72 Similarly, academics tend to combine largely passive
membership of remote prestigious groups such as the Institute for Archaeologists, and the
Higher Education Academy, which define and regulate parameters for practice, and special
interest groups such as the British Shakespeare Association where participation is more active.
For performers, membership of professional organisations appears to be restricted to Actors
Equity which acts very much like a union, protecting pay and conditions, rather than a
knowledge stewarding group per se.

For digital creatives, the diversity of domain interests and practice is reflected not only in
membership of work-related groups but in how these groups are formed. All digital creatives in
the trial were responsible for either setting-up or playing a significant role in maintaining
special interest groups related to what they do for a living. The reasons for this degree of
personal initiative relates to personal interest in the stewardship of knowledge with likeminded individuals (reflecting a domain of interest) as well as cultivating a network to learn
about funding or commercial opportunities in their field as they arise. This financial aspect
distinguishes digital creatives from the other CoPs in the trial. In their profiling interview, both
DC and DS described the value gained from keeping an informal group called the ‘Digital Media
Cluster’ active in Birmingham. This group was described as a pool of different skillsets –
strategists, coders, developers – who exchange information on opportunities through the
Cluster and, less formally, share knowledge within the Birmingham area. DS said, ‘I think that’s

72

There is much more participation in special interest groups such as the Social History Curators Group, the Group
for Literary Archives, and Manuscripts, Theatre Information Group, and the Data Standards Committee of ARA
which align more closely with domain and practice on a day-to-day level.

162

one of the strengths of the city. There is a lot of expertise here and we’re all quite keen to share
it’ (2012a, 4). For DC and DS the Birmingham affinity appeared to be particularly important.

For all digital creatives, the practical value of such groups is significant. DP is a Fellow of the
Royal Society of the Arts ‘which is pointless - it doesn’t really help at all’ (2012a, 3), but goes on
to talk about two groups she has created, ‘Women and Technology’ and the ‘Makers’ Guild’
(ibid.).73 DP derived satisfaction from knowing that the Guild had catalysed working
partnerships at every meeting in an ‘emerging area’ (ibid., 3) of technology founded on
‘common interests’ and ‘shared issues’ (ibid., 4). For DW, work on trans-media storytelling
necessarily involves keeping in touch with a distributed ‘community of people’ (DW 2012a, 5)
sometimes brought together on individual initiatives such as a geo-location project called ‘Golf
on the Moon’ (ibid., 2). Therefore, for digital creatives there is a marked difference in the
pioneering nature of their stake in organising groups around a common domain and the
commercial element, as opposed to the combination of larger professional bodies and smaller,
less formal special interest groups found among academics and heritage practitioners.

Finally, one area of commonality across the sample was age and activism: the early career
academics, most of the younger heritage practitioners, and all of the digital creatives, appear
most engaged, one academic (AS) citing active membership of five different associations and
groups. Reasons for this were mixed but one academic (AA) claimed that career progression
was a compelling reason for associating with a particular CoP (2012, 2).

73

The Makers’ Guild is concerned with the crossover between craftworking and technology.

163

4.2.2.4 Domain and Practice: Conclusion
Overall, findings from Phase 1 suggest that there is an especially strong link between domain
and practice in academia and the performing arts and that this heavily influences their style of
learning. Although some of the more established professions such as those represented in the
heritage practitioner CoP outwardly identify with professional bodies (compared to a degree of
anti-professionalism and freer associations among digital creatives) this is not reflected by
levels of participation in the life of a CoP. Wenger’s CoP model adequately describes most
practitioner group behaviour in terms of interest in a common domain and translation of this
interest into practice, but other conceptual models are helpful in explaining forms of regulation
between domain and practice.

4.2.3 Domain and Community
4.2.3.1 Domain and Community: Introduction
Wenger defines the communal characteristics of a CoP as a set of relationships that allow
members to ‘interact and learn together’ (Wenger 2013) on a regular basis around a common
domain. They do this through discussion, sharing information and joint activities (ibid.).
However, the variety of ways communities are formed and maintained can make description
difficult,
Communities cannot be measured and managed in conventional ways. Traditional
methods are not likely to appreciate the creativity, sharing, and self-initiative that are
the core elements of how a community creates value (Wenger 2002, 185).
In order to find out how individuals ‘interact and learn together’ (Wenger 2013) participants
were asked how they maintain contact with fellow members in work-related groups (Appendix

164

B, Questions 10 and 11). Further questions on practitioners’ immediate work environment were
asked to build a picture of working relationships and to examine where domain-related learning
is ‘situated’ (Wenger and Lave 2009).

4.2.3.2 Domain and Community: Academics
In academia, domain and community appear to be very closely linked. In its widest sense,
academics’ domain might be regarded as research and teaching around which a university
community has formed with specific modes of practice, importantly the conferment of degrees.
In fact, the Latin word ‘universitas’ refers in general to ‘a number of persons associated into
one body, a society, company, community, guild, corporation, etc’ (Lewis 1966). Beyond this,
the organisation of colleges, departments, schools, and institutes, and the existence of subjectspecific communities between universities or with other sectors, plays a large part in defining
an academic’s membership of particular communities of practice. In describing domain
interests, academics in Phase 1 all gravitated towards their subject area in defining who they
are and what they do conveying the importance of subject-focused domain and community to
their sense of identity. Therefore, the group ‘academics’ could be described as a community of
communities, with common interests, skills and experiences in research and teaching, but
specific interests in a particular discipline whose community of practice stretches beyond a
particular institution.

Based on findings from Phase 1, academics do appear to share characteristics of both the
generic academician and the subject-specific scholar. For instance, the conference functions as

165

a key event in the life of the university community but takes different forms according to
discipline. Teaching and research standards are policed by organisations such as the HEA but
there are discrete bodies for regulating practice and influencing community activity within
separate disciplines. Accreditation of learning is conferred by universities, teaching and learning
tends to take place within particular parts of the campus. Although exchange clearly takes place
between departments, domain and community are both situated in the sense that they are
physically and metaphysically co-located.

In terms of research, the shaping of academic practice happens both in isolation (through
individual research) and during periods of connecting with other academics via community
events and network activity. AS describes the academic conference as, ‘kind of an impetus to
make sure that we catch up in terms of what we’re doing’ (2012a, 9). For this CoP, the rhythm
between individual and group work, reification and participation, is especially important,
‘individual research [...] can be very solitary but you’ve got to keep some kind of connection
going with other people in the field, especially people who are very closely allied to your area’
(ibid., 11). The conference as a key event in the life of the academic community provides an
accepted way to share and shape practice, an outlet and inlet closely linked to the
academician’s workflow,
it’s a two-way process, you go to tell people what you’re doing and I suppose generate
interest in it and show the way it might be reshaping some aspect of Shakespeare
Studies but you’re also taking away as well, hearing what people are working on
(ibid.,.10).
The normal route would be to publish research as part of a conference or use the conference as
a way of airing research that has or will be peer-reviewed and published in a journal or book.
These events – the conference and the vetted act of publishing - are largely driven by the
166

singularity of the research subject rather than ‘working through community problems’ (AS
2012a, 6) but, again, this demonstrates an attempt to craft practice using routes that are
socially accepted by that community.

For academics, there is a duality in lecturers’ membership of different communities of practice.
On one hand, as teachers they are mostly members of organisations such as the Higher
Education Academy (HEA) which is ‘pushing forward in new directions really in teaching’ (AH
2012a, 5). According to AH, the HEA is,
an important kind of gateway to information and also to [...] enthusiasm because
sometimes you just have to go and..I don’t know, *be+ woken up and energised by
different approaches (ibid.).
This professional body is therefore acting as an information resource and provider of
professional development for the teaching profession. It does this by offering training events to
share techniques such as the use of new technologies in the classroom, and by informing
practitioners on other practice-based issues via a web forum. The HEA is therefore using a
particular way of sharing knowledge in focusing on standards and improvements in pedagogy.
Early career academics in particular seemed to have very clear vocational reasons for joining
professional bodies which steward expertise on teaching. However, all lecturers were also
members of subject-specific communities some of which have regulatory bodies. For example,
AA, a senior lecturer in Archaeology is a member of the Institute for Archaeologists (IA). The IA
is as a reference point for technical information on archaeological practice, such as the
‘minimum requirements’ for ‘digging a hole’ (AA 2012, 5), and this information is then fed back
into teaching practice. The IA has developed its own way of ‘addressing recurring problems’
(Wenger 2013) through the use of statute, adopting a top-down approach to developing

167

practice among its members. In a similar vein, the IA also acts as a union of sorts, representing
members and advising on wage levels making it ‘both carrot and stick’ (AA 2012, 4) for
archaeologists. The British Shakespeare Association was described by AS as a mainly ‘academic
association’ (AS 2012a, 9) which discusses research in the field of Shakespeare Studies.
Although it lacks the regulatory purpose of the IA, the BSA is a membership-based organisation
and is recognised by Shakespeare scholars as a key forum ‘to tell people what you’ve been
working on before it actually comes out in print’ (ibid.,10). This layering of membership of
different CoPs was summed-up by AS, ‘you know I’m an academic but I’m also specifically in the
humanities disciplines but even more specifically English, Drama History’ (ibid.,9-10).

This sense of identity is reinforced by physical distinctions in terms of where teaching and
learning takes place and the subsequent closeness of communities of teachers and learners.
The Department of Classics, Ancient History and Archaeology is housed in a particular part of
the Arts Building on the main campus at the University of Birmingham and within the
Department there are further divisions – physical and intellectual - along the lines of disciplines
such as Archaeology, Egyptology, and so on. Teachers and students of Shakespeare Studies
occupy a small site 25 miles from Birmingham in the town of Stratford-upon-Avon with only
occasional exchanges with the main University. Again there are subject divisions within the
Institute according to subject (there are six different MA programmes) and degree (MA / MPhil
/ PhD) but there is an appreciable amount of overlap between teaching modules and, of course,
a common theme (Shakespeare) galvanised in formal (e.g. weekly seminar) and informal (e.g.
plays staged by staff and students) events within the Shakespeare Institute. This degree of co-

168

location according to domain undoubtedly builds a sense of community identity which creates
distinctions in the way that subject knowledge is stewarded and learning sustained.

4.2.3.3 Domain and Community: Digital creatives
The creative and multi-disciplinary nature of what digital creatives do necessitates membership
of multiple communities of practice and the maintenance of looser ‘networks of practice’
(Brown and Duguid 2001) to steward knowledge and sustain learning. When asked whether
working with others is a routine part of what he does, DW said,
Absolutely necessary unless you’re completely brilliant [...] there are some people who
know how to program, design, write, set-up servers, interact with audiences, design
the posters, raise the finance, perform, but there aren’t that many (DW 2012a, 1-2).
For digital creatives, the formation of communities around domains appears to happen in two
different ways. Groups which meet regularly on a face-to-face basis tend to have a pragmatic
purpose, to share commercial information or to learn a particular skill around a clearly defined
domain of interest. For instance, DC uses Birmingham’s Digital Media Cluster to share
information on funding opportunities or ‘lessons learnt’ (DC 2012a, 4) as a way of honing
practice openly. DP’s two self-created groups share experience at meetings and this is normally
task-based or leads to practical partnership projects. DP said that attempts to depart from this
pragmatic focus shared by the Makers’ Guild had not been successful.74 Therefore, local

74

For example, speaking about a visit of the Technology Strategy Board, she said that ‘a lot of the makers in the
group felt that was a little bit too airy fairy’ (DP 2012a, 3). That is not to say that members of these groups do not
use digital platforms to stay in touch between meetings: of those groups that DP has started up, she uses mainly
Twitter as a tool in a ‘light touch’ (ibid., 2) approach to keeping members in contact with each other.

169

communities formed around a practical interest tend to be grounded in forms of practice which
achieve particular goals, and which operate on mutually agreed rhythms of activity.

On the other hand, online networks of practice are used by digital creatives to engage long and
short term interests in particular domains according to the demands of mainly project-based
work. These ever-shifting, digital networks allow digital creatives to share technical expertise or
creative practice but do not require the same maintenance or degree of engagement with
other ‘members’ as CoPs. This allows for flexibility in opting in and out of ‘a community or build
a network of people who are like minded’ (DW 2012a) according to the needs of a project.
Membership of a part-community75 and part-network76 has, according to DW, a sense of shared
endeavour through knowledge exchange and practice,
we’ve spent enough time trying to crack these problems together that we sort of know
each other but we’re very distributed, ah, and we don’t see each other very often, and
we tend to keep in touch via Twitter or you know text message or just looking at each
other’s blogs (2012a, 3).
This emphasis on horizontal relationships which criss-cross traditional community of practice
boundaries permits what Wenger describes as ‘extreme multi-membership’ (2009, 59) as the
individual interacts regularly with a number of different groups, be they CoPs, networks of
practice, or community-network hybrids. A dependence on networks rather than communities
could explain DW’s feeling that his perceived community of practice (digital creatives) does not
have a definable identity even though he feels ‘very, very at home’ in ‘digital culture’ (2012a,

75

According to Wenger, members of a community (of practice) share an identity based on affinity for a domain
(2013).
76

According to Wenger, members of a network share information but not an identity (2013).

170

5). This could also be explained by DW’s general reluctance to industrialise or professionalise
digital culture even though he feels very comfortable with being associated with it (ibid., 1).

DP and DW, and CM all use Twitter as a key way of building networks and keeping in touch with
like-minded individuals, at least in a work capacity. This way of stewarding knowledge inverts
the traditional focus on domain, so that the person becomes the focus of interest, rather than
the domain per se. For DW, Twitter is a ‘natural’ (ibid., 5) way of sharing interest and refining
practice as well as a medium for his work in trans media. This sharing of practice is based on a
‘transactional value’ (ibid., 4) which, although less regulated, resembles the peer-review
process for academics, discussed in Section 4.2.2.1.

Drawing on a wide skillset appears to be a vital part of working creatively with new
technologies for this CoP, and this usually means working collaboratively with others. However,
this does not always mean technical staff. DW went on to say,
what I quite like to do now is that you work with others but the others are the
audience [...] I step into the ring with my audience and I start something off and then
they start to take on roles (2012a, 2).
Working directly with audiences is something that digital creatives do as part of their job,
opening up or sharing their ‘concern or passion’ (Wenger 2013) beyond a community of
practitioners. This can be driven by an experimental or creative urge, or it can be induced by
necessity. The language used by DC and DS during the profiling interviews, joint presentation
and workshop discussions all suggest the competitive, client-facing and user-focused nature of
what they do. DC spoke a number of times of projects his company had ‘won’ (DC 2012a, 5) and
during the presentation he gave with DS, his colleague opened with an outline of what they do

171

for clients ‘our angle is how we use digital media to help service our clients and their project
needs’ (DC 2012b, 1). DS explained that this ‘service’ usually begins with the end-user, ‘we
come to all kinds of digital projects and propositions starting with [...] content and users’ (DS
2012b, 28) and with end-users in mind she repeated the word, ‘journey’ six times to describe
the experience of engaging with digital content from an end-user’s perspective.

Therefore, end-users appeared to be an important way of digital creatives defining their
domain and in many cases might actually introduce a new dimension to skew membership of a
community of practice by widening participation in less formal but nonetheless influential
communities or networks of interest. This places digital creatives closer to end-users in the
digital supply chain than other CoPs.

4.2.3.4 Domain and Community: Heritage practitioners
Among heritage practitioners in the sample there appears to be a mixed picture in terms of
domain and community identity. According to CC, a curator, the museums profession seems to
have a stronger sense of identity since ‘the MA *Museums Association+ represents the
museums community and sort of brings a cohesiveness to it’ and membership is
‘indistinguishable from a career in museums’ (CC 2012, 5). The MA functions as the sector’s
professional accreditation scheme and for many years ‘dictated’ (ibid. p.6) policy and practice
via the institutional Accreditation scheme. University librarians do not seem to think that their
professional association (CILIPS) has a strong sense of identity although LS feels, ‘obliged to
become a member of it to be honest’ and ‘It’s a good means of communication with your

172

profession basically’ (LS 2012c, 3). AR feels a part of the Archives and Records Association
(ARA), the professional body for archivists, and this could be because of her active participation
on one of its sub committees (AR 2012, 2). However, she did not feel as if ARA has a strong
sense of identity and this could be related to the size of the organisation and its low profile
compared to such organisations as the MA. CM, the Collections Manager recognised the value
of groups such as the MA and the Association of Independent Museums (AIM) but perhaps her
role as manager of a collection which is overseen by curators, librarians and archivists had
lessened her sense of affiliation with a single domain. CM said, ‘I don’t ever perceive myself to
be a member of a club as such’ (CM 2012a, 5) and this was reflected in her use of personal
networks, principally via Twitter, to help in her management of the activities of museum, library
and archive collections. This does not seem to disrupt CM’s affiliation with the heritage sector
but rather offers alternatives networks and communities of interest which are more selfselecting based on individuals CM chose to stay connected to.

LS was much more animated on the topic of subject-specific communities and this is the
pattern across all heritage practitioners. Her enthusiasm for finding out about other
Shakespeare-related collections was apparent when discussing the value of membership of the
Association of Performing Arts Collections (APAC) which she claims is,
very useful with regards to you know what’s happening with theatre collections across
the country which you can always feed back to staff and to students and there’s always
potential with that to develop projects with other people, jump on the funding wagon
and all that sort of thing (LS 2012c, 4).
Therefore, LS’s twin role as an academic librarian and a subject specialist are both served by
APAC membership, but the motivation to become part of this community of practice and the

173

purposefulness in using information to shape practice suggests a strong interest in the subject
as domain. Equally, membership of other collections-focused groups such as the Social History
Curators Group (CC 2012, 1) and the Group for Literary Archives and Manuscripts (LU 2012b, 4)
appears driven by interest in particular collections and is the basis for a distinctive approach to
learning discussed in Section 4.2.5. Therefore among heritage practitioners we see a division
between membership of a professional organisation because they feel compelled to be, and
voluntary membership of special interest groups. Again, subject area acts as a powerful domain
driving personal interest and notions of community identity.

4.2.3.5 Domain and Community: Performers
Of all practitioner groups represented in Phase 1, those involved in the performing arts seem
least likely to identify with particular communities of practice. Equity, the actors’ union, acts as
a kind of passport to qualify for auditions and as a union to protect standards of pay and
conditions among members, but it is not a knowledge-sharing organisation (AD 2012, 1). Part of
the reason that theatre practitioners do not become members of fixed communities is that
acting, like project work, involves an intense focus on a piece of work within a temporary
community of practitioners for the period of a particular production, unlike the comparative
constancy of working in a museum or even in academia. Those in the performing arts also find
their particular domain difficult to classify. ED, who works, ‘building theatre vocabulary among
young people’ and running, ‘workshops which take theatre practice and apply them to issues to
do with classroom teaching or leadership’ (ED 2012a, 1) finds her role difficult to pin down
because ‘it’s such a broad area that I work in’ (ibid., 2).

174

Unsurprisingly, working with end-users is a standard part of working practice in the performing
arts although, like some heritage practitioners and digital creatives, this is often a fleeting
engagement. A recurring concern for ED in both workshops was clarifying who the audience for
artefact-based resources would be ‘Don’t we come back to the issue of audience, each
audience will have its own pathway’ and ‘I’m not clear about the audience you know’ (ED
2012b, 11). AW, an actor, considered the audience in discussing the social media platform,
Tumblr ‘You can even add your comment as an audience member who saw the show?’ (AW
2012a, 16) and, in the museum store, reimagining staging (‘pros arch’) from the way that a
costume has been designed (AW 2012b, 6). Worrying about what audiences think of the smell
of a costume was also a concern suggesting just how close to end-users AW routinely gets
during a performance (ibid., 5-6).

Apart from the sharing of knowledge among actors and production staff during a particular run,
all of the performers who took part in Phase 1 claimed that they had developed practice based
on the previous experience of other actors and directors. This diachronous and one-sided
sharing of knowledge is made possible by viewing archive footage, prompt books, production
photographs and theatre reviews to learn about previous interpretations of characters,
costume and set designs, stage directions, and so on. This is not always done to copy
techniques but to make sure that what they do is different (AW 2012c, 2-3). In this way, the
‘solitary’ nature of the way that many actors work is offset by connecting with the community’s
experience and, in turn, leaving a record of what is made of this experience through new
performance.

175

4.2.3.6 Domain and Community: Conclusion
Overall, findings from Phase 1 suggest that for all groups, the nature of the domain defines the
character of the community. For academics there are distinct, rigid structures for sharing
subject-specific research knowledge and more generally for career progression, whereas for
digital creatives the nature of their job demands a wide skillset and flexibility in community
formation and maintenance, often dependent on social media networks. For heritage
practitioners, communities are confined to sub-domains such as museums, libraries and
archives, and still further depending on the nature of the collection. For performers,
communities are formed around specific projects and knowledge is shared sometimes through
past experience. Therefore, the nature of domain-specific knowledge reflects choices in how
communities form and knowledge is stewarded.

4.2.4 Community and Practice

4.2.4.1 Community and Practice: Introduction
Members of a community of practice are practitioners. They develop a shared
repertoire of resources: experiences, stories, tools, ways of addressing recurring
problems—in short a shared practice (Wenger 2013).
Practice is central to Wenger’s theory of learning in communities, and learning requires a
‘negotiation of meaning’ (1998, 52) among members of the CoP. According to Wenger,
negotiation of meaning involves the convergence of two interlinked processes: participation
and reification. In other words, a consensus on meaning cannot be arrived at without active
negotiation (participation) and agreed linguistic structures and ways of using language

176

(reifications). This dynamic negotiation of meaning within a community results in the creation
of distinctive forms or uses of language use as communities define and refine practice together.
Therefore, since ‘Language is one of the principal means by which meaning is reified’ (Tusting
2005, 40) it is the main ‘tool’ in the ‘shared repertoire of resources’ examined to look for
evidence of a link between community and practice among participants in Phase 1. It is used by
CoPs as both a means of developing practice and a product of practice in itself. It is also
fundamental to collaborative learning because, as Wenger and Lave explain, ‘Language is part
of practice, and it is in practice that people learn’ (Wenger and Lave 2009, 85).

As well as linguistic analysis (Section 4.2.4.2), types of ‘recurring problems’ (Wenger 2013) that
might tackled by a CoP in the process of negotiating meaning are also analysed below (Section
4.2.4.3) to look at the connection between community and practice and to suggest factors
which might influence usage of artefacts. These differing perspectives in the digital supply chain
highlight how these communities collectively tackle issues associated with the selection,
digitisation and packaging of artefacts, and working with end-users, but also confirm the ties
between membership of a community and forms of practice.

4.2.4.2 Community and Practice: CoPs and language
Although Swales (2003, 207) points out the differences between the spoken and written word
among academic communities and the greater degree of consensus that might be expected
from interdisciplinary spoken conversation, responses from semi-structured profiling interviews
with project participants, and content analysis of contributions they made to discussions during

177

workshops, suggests some linguistic patterning commensurate with membership of a particular
community of practice.

Firstly, analysing the frequency of words used during interviews and workshops reveals certain
patterns among individuals suggestive of priorities held by particular communities of practice.
Although by level of usage very few of these terms reflect what Mätikalo and Säljö term
‘categorical knowledge’ (2002, 66) i.e. those words whose meaning is shared only by ‘insiders’,
it is significant to find the repetition of verbs such as ‘know’ and ‘look’, ‘think’, and ‘see’, and
‘use’, adjectives such as ‘professional’ and ‘interesting’, and nouns such as ‘collections’,
‘idea(s)’, and ‘digital’ by certain practitioner groups, as shown in Table 11.

Table 11. Frequency of word use compared between the four different communities of
practice (figures are weighted percentages)

178

Table 11 also shows the extent to which CoPs use key words which, generally speaking, fit their
area of expertise, or perceptions of their role. For instance the greater use of the words,
‘collection’ and ‘professional’ corresponds with heritage practitioners’ area of work and the
emphasis on professionalism pointed out above in discussing the relationship between domain
and practice for this CoP. Equally, the greater relative use of ‘research’ by academics, ‘digital’ by
digital creatives, and ‘audience’ by performers reflects what one might expect for communities
centred on this type of practice. Significantly, ‘people’ is a term used to a greater extent by
digital creatives reflecting perhaps their user-focused approach to work described in workshops
and profiling interviews. The higher use of the word ‘look’ among heritage practitioners might
also confirm Alpers’ assertion that ‘the museum effect [...] is a way of seeing’ (Alpers 1991, 27).

There are some terms that also unite CoPs. The frequency of use of the words ‘think’ and ‘see’
are identical for heritage practitioners and academics, and notably higher than for other CoPs,
suggesting that these two activities are manifested to a greater extent in their day-to-day
practice. The words ‘things’ and ‘idea’ are used to the same extent by academics and digital
creatives which perhaps reflects the greater exchange of ideas between these two CoPs during
workshops discussions. The word, ‘use’ is spoken by academics and performers to the same
extent. Interestingly, some categorical terms such as ‘pros arch’ (proscenium arch) were
introduced by ‘insiders’ (in this case the actor AW, (2012b, 5)) but then explained and used by
academics and heritage practitioners signalling a wider ‘speech community’ (Barley, Meyer et
al.. 1988, 27) which recognises theatre vocabulary. Over the course of the two workshops
there is evidence of mirroring behaviour between different CoPs through word use: the sharing
of words such as ‘enrichment’, ‘play’ and ‘pathway’ were all first introduced by digital creatives

179

in Workshop 1 and subsequently used across all CoPs suggesting a negotiation of meaning
during each session much in the way Wenger postulates happens within a CoP.

Taking context into account, the differences between words which are used across the sample
also highlights practitioner differences. For example, Figure 6 shows that the word ‘curate’ and
variations such as ‘curating’, ‘curation’ and ‘curator’ were most used by heritage practitioners
(0.11%) and digital creatives (0.10%). Looking at the actual context of word use shows that
definitions among the former group are based around ideas of management and control of
predominantly physical resources whereas for digital creatives what is being ‘curated’ is
metadata and access routes through that data.

Figure 6. Frequency of use of the word ‘curating’ by different CoPs (P: performers, D: digital

The pragmatics of the use of the word ‘curate’ by two different practitioner groups suggests
that each associates the same word with a quite different meaning within their own CoP.

We can see from this inter-practitioner exchange (given in Table 12) during an examination of a
late 16th Century recipe or receipt chest (SBT 2013b) that the use of language is very different
between AH (a cultural and art historian) and DW (a digital writer).

Table 12. Excerpt from Digital CoPs and Robbers: Stage 4 Workshop 2 PM (AH and DW 2012)

AH uses precise, categorical terms such as ‘upper middling’ to refer to class, ‘domestic context’
to describe use, and hedging terms such as ‘more consistent with’ to formally identify,
contextualise and interpret the artefact. This corresponds with what AP (a PhD student
supervised by AH) says about the special skills used in reading or decoding the artefact, ‘It’s
supposed to be read in a certain way so it has this interior logic to it’ (AP 2012, 13) and Student
C’s description of ‘close reading’ (2012) of an artefact suggesting a learned artefact literacy
among the academic CoP, lecturers and students. In contrast, DW is using non-academic
language, such as ‘it shouts out’ referring to the chest’s fine workmanship and decoration, and
domestic analogies such as, ‘It would be in the front room, right?’ in discussing the prominence
of the item in the home.

Therefore, although professional practice cannot be reduced to language, it is still a
fundamental tool involved in learning and socialisation within a community. More extensive
research on far larger samples would be needed in order to provide more conclusive data on
links between communities of practice and ways in which they communicate, but analysis of
181

language use in profiling interviews and workshops does suggest areas of differentiation among
disciplines worthy of further investigation.

4.2.4.3 Community and Practice: Practitioner perspectives
Another way of reifying practice is in expressing common attitudes to ‘recurring problems’
(Wenger 2013) and fault lines between communities of practice emerged in during Phase 1 in
stances taken on the topic of access to, and use of, digital artefacts. These different
perspectives not only provide evidence for the existence of communities of practice but begin
to explain why these communities might exhibit different forms of practice around the artefact
and influence how end-users interact with the artefact. To scope the opinions and viewpoints
of practitioners, interviewees were asked about their use of artefacts in research and about
their experience of the digitisation of artefacts. These questions (22 and 23) were intended to
build a mental picture of practitioner attitudes to artefact use in physical and digital form.
Additionally, during both workshops, activities and discussions were designed to externalise
latent perspectives on the supply and use of digital artefacts.

The most important and recurring issue for all CoPs was around physical access to artefacts.
According to AH, ‘the main problem with humanities research not using objects, is access’(AH
2012c, 20). This point is reiterated in a more oblique way by AP who hoped that the Digital CoPs
and Robbers project would reveal ‘the extent to which digitisation stops museums from having
objects out’ (AP 2012, 13) voicing a similar frustration about access. Ownership of artefacts was
implied throughout the two workshops in the use of the personal pronoun when referring to

182

artefacts, ‘your objects’ (e.g. DW 2012b, 24), by academics, digital creatives and performers,
and even in how practitioners line up during an artefact examination session held at the end of
Workshop 2.77

This degree of control was underlined by references to collections access made by a number of
heritage practitioners. CC emphasises ‘proper procedures’ (CC 2012, 8) in place for gaining
access to artefacts; CC, LU and LS described their gatekeeper role in digitisation in deciding
which objects should be digitised, something which certainly has ramifications for the use of
artefacts. In contrast, digital creatives tend to pick up post digitisation or are concerned with
‘connecting datasets’ (DC 2012a, 7) or finding innovative ways of using them, but are largely
excluded from the process of selection and capture. This control of physical access to the
collection actually seems to be the last line of defence in capturing value from use. CM
explained that the ‘real strength’ of the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust is,
the fact that everybody has to come here to engage with research in Shakespeare’s
biography and being able to make that connection with the town he lived in, see the
birthplace (CM 2012a, 12).
The stages of access to the artefact within the SBT collection normally involve first hand
inspection due to the basic nature of the online catalogue. This means that quite early on in the
process of research, ‘They *the researcher+ would have to contact us to look at the book’ (CC
2012, 9). Again the personal pronoun is used. The issue of control of physical access is perhaps

77

Three artefacts were shown to participants in order to compare the experience of seeing (and using) a digital
representation with their impressions of the physical artefacts which had been digitised. This was lead by CC, the
curator, assisted by AR (an archivist) with CM (collections manager) and AA (leader of the workshop) on a stage
with the artefacts. The digital creatives, performers and academics (with the exception of AA) were all standing
below the stage looking up. Although the use of the stage was an attempt to separate the viewing of artefacts
from other activities in the room (such as tea drinking), the alignment of heritage practitioners behind the artefact
makes an emphatic semiotic statement about ownership and access to collections.

183

the clearest example of how practitioner perspectives influence the end-use of artefact and
reveals boundaries between CoPs involved in the digital supply chain.

Digital creatives were the most outspoken opponents of a fixation with the physical artefact
and its intrinsic value preferring to focus on using data associated with collections, and its
relationship with end-users, than the collections themselves. Although DW expressed a ‘sense
of absence’ (2012b, 20) that in the first instance, practitioners were not given 3D artefacts to
‘manipulate and investigate’ (2012c, 14) but digital surrogates, for most of the discussion digital
creatives emphasised the use value of metadata around artefacts. DP, DS and DC all referred to
artefacts as ‘assets’ (e.g. DP 2012a, 6) which can be used by institutions ‘in times of threat’
(ibid.). Artefacts are described as ‘connected thing*s+’ (DP 2012d, 23) whose value derives from
their place in an interconnected network. DP states that ‘almost nothing has meaning on its
own’ (ibid., 24) drawing attention to the social value of artefacts which, unlike the use value
ascribed to artefacts by AR and the socially constructed reading of an artefact, comes from
connections with other things and even from the artefact itself. DP says that ‘an object on its
own doesn’t start to act in the world until you have an audience I suppose’ (DP 2012b, 7) laying
importance on the relationship between the artefact and its users. DW goes further, pointing to
arts and technology projects which focus on communicating the experience of the artefact
itself, so that the object ‘nearly has life’ (DW 2012b). This almost goes full circle back to the
heritage practitioner stance on the intrinsic value of the artefact, but the mediation is more
technological rather than hierarchical.

184

Academics shared this interest in plurality and the human context of the artefact, although
their need to access the physical artefact sets them slightly apart from digital creatives. For
Humanities scholars, although the artefact itself might be important for the information it
contains and its inherent structure and composition (for example the setting-out and printing
of Shakespeare’s First Folio as well as the textual content), it is the space around the artefact
which offers most interest (the interpretation of the First Folio version of Shakespeare’s text).
For that reason, seeing objects in the round – capturing different perspectives and valuing the
use of the artefact rather than the artefact alone – is fundamentally important for the academic
CoP. In a similar way, those performers who took part in the trial shared the academics’
interest in the person and the artefact. AD uses artefacts and cultural settings to tap into a
‘mental state’ (AD 2012, 1) but this is more related to building a picture of a period or about
watching people’s response to art than about the artefact itself.

For academics whose interest is in the cultural history of a particular time, direct access to the
material content and context of the artefact is important in ‘getting to grips’ (AH 2012a, 10)
with the experience of the artefact’s original owners. AP’s physical inspection of artefacts in the
collection of the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust is a vital part of generating new knowledge,
the manipulation, the handling of the object seems to be incredibly important when
generating new ideas and new ways of thinking about it (AP 2012, 12).
AP gives the example of a medicine chest that had been,
fixed into a category partly just through provenance [...] but when you actually start
researching it and handling it, it became clear that it had completely different
functions really (ibid.).
For AH, the original context of an artefact is equally important and this often requires ‘first
hand’ (AH 2012a, 1) inspection of artefacts and settings. Access to digital versions of objects
185

supports and informs ‘fieldwork and sort of secondary research’ (ibid., 5) and the ‘interplay’ of
the two (ibid.), but academics have mixed views on the value of digital representations of
artefacts. For AT, a textual scholar, many digital versions of manuscripts allow the user to ‘see
more than you could if you had the manuscript’ (AT 2012, 2) and for AA, an archaeologist, the
ability to capture from a dig something which would otherwise degrade and disappear aids
analysis (AA 2012, 4). For AH and AP, their interest in the material culture of Early Modern
England is facilitated by digital technologies, which can accommodate the sifting of information
before a visit, and studying, for example, the iconography of an artefact post-visit, but much of
the sensory information needed for their research is not normally supplied as part of
digitisation but must be gained at ‘first hand’ (AH 2012a, 1).

Therefore, based on evidence gained from the profiling interviews and participation in
workshops, there are differences between practitioner groups in the way that they value
artefacts and use them in their practice. There seems to be some common ground between
heritage practitioners and academics in the value they place on the use of physical artefacts,
but academics like digital creatives and performers appear to use artefacts as ways of accessing
human experience and creating social value, rather than prizing their intrinsic worth and place
within an institutional value system.

Another tension, or ‘boundary object’ (Star 1989) among practitioners that highlighted
differences between communities was the status and use of metadata. Academics, performers,
and digital creatives all appeared to value different perspectives on the artefact and saw a
place for this alongside the official record. Heritage practitioners appeared less comfortable

186

with the management of this. In a conversation about creating catalogue content, CM said ‘I
think my feeling talking about responsibility [for administering the record] is that it does sit
with the organisation that manages that object’ (CM 2012b, 19). Equally, AR mentions the
importance of preservation of content, context and structure within archival records which is
endangered by hacking and mashing content which disturbs relationships between records in
reusing data. Although DW saw the need for ‘a lead enthusiasm’ (2012c, 18) in creating
metadata, this should be a plural process which could involve a ‘hierarchy of curators’ (ibid.).
AH put this another way when she said that her preference would be, ‘moving away from the
idea of one authority to multiple authorities’ (AH 2012d, 12).

Therefore, around issues concerning access to, and control of artefacts and metadata about
them, attitudinal patterns began to emerge between individuals which reveal boundaries
between communities of practice. These perspectives on artefact usage signal how each of
these CoPs, who all have a stake in the supply and use of digital artefacts, perceive legitimacy
and illegitimacy with regard to accessing, controlling, valuing and utilising digital artefacts. Their
articulation of particular views (and the way that they actually interact with physical and digital
artefacts – described in Section 4.3) make explicit tacit knowledge held by the CoP. This
knowledge as Wenger et al. point out is ‘social as well as individual’ (2002, 10) and is bound up
with other aspects of the domain of knowledge which characterises their CoP or CoPs. This
undoubtedly influences practice within the digital supply chain or how curators, librarians,
archivists, digital creatives or technologists, academics, performers and others interact in the
process of creating and using digital artefacts.

187

4.2.4.4 Community and Practice: Conclusion
Linguistic and attitudinal differences between participants in Phase 1 suggest boundaries
between CoPs in the way that communities develop practice. However, membership of a
community of practice depends not only on interest in a common domain, mutual engagement
within a community, and shared practice, but Wenger also identifies another component
essential to collective knowledge stewardship: ‘collaborative learning’ (Wenger 2013) examined
in Section 4.2.4.

4.2.5 Learning
4.2.5.1 Learning: Introduction
Before looking at how communities of practice learn, what is meant by ‘learning’? There are a
wide range of definitions on what constitutes learning but most acknowledge that some form
of transformation occurs in the behaviour of the individual as a result of experience (Thorpe
1963, 55). Kolb’s definition of learning as a ‘transformation of experience’ (Kolb 1984, 38) was
considered the most suitable general description of the process of learning since it has been
widely used in the context of experiential learning (particularly in museology), is behaviourist in
orientation (akin to the research approach described in Chapter 3), and corresponds most
closely with Wenger and Lave’s theories of social learning in communities of practice which
emphasise the simultaneous transformation of the individual and the community through
participation in the learning process,

188

rather than learning by replicating the performances of others or by acquiring
knowledge transmitted in instruction, we suggest that learning occurs through
centripetal participation in the learning curriculum of the ambient community (Wenger
and Lave 2009, 100).
For Wenger and Lave learning involves both internalisation and externalisation since,
‘increasing participation in communities of practice concerns the whole person acting in the
world’ (ibid., 49).

To examine how CoPs learn in the sample, and how this might relate to artefact use, three
methodological approaches were used:
a. Qualitative analysis of interview and workshop transcripts
b. Learning Style Inventory (LSI) testing of participants
c. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of artefact usage based on interview and workshop
transcripts
Looking for clues to how practitioners learn (a) provides context for the systematic assessment
of learning style using a standard LSI test (b). Mapping patterns in artefact usage to learning
styles (c) is taken up in Section 4.3.3. This combination of methods provides evidence of
distinctive traits in learning behaviour shared by practitioners from similar backgrounds.

4.2.5.2 Learning: Heritage practitioners
Heritage practitioners tend to combine an interest in each other’s collections with knowledge
exchange which is both practical (for example, the digitisation of manuscripts based on a case
study) and strategic (for instance, information relating to funding cuts or job opportunities in

189

the sector). A community of practice seems to develop by bringing together the domain of
interest and practice-based issues in individual events or via journals, bulletins, or email lists,
but the emphasis is always on collections,
you always get a tour around someone else’s service, and then everyone tells each
other what they’ve been up to, or what problems have been going on with their
service so at the moment everyone’s talking about all the cutbacks and stuff, and then
there might be training that somebody, so it’s all kind of sharing, it tends to be
knowledge sharing (AR 2012, 18).
Knowledge is then used selectively in the workplace based on its relevance to day to day
practice. For LS, CILIP (the Chartered Institute for Library and Information Professionals) offers
support by raising awareness of issues around projects which impact on her everyday practice
such as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tagging of library books. Therefore, for all
heritage practitioners, learning about practice is highly experiential, collections-based and
focused.

Perhaps because of this, the variety of learning styles found among heritage practitioners was
the widest of any of the practitioner groups and there was very little correlation along the lines
of domain (museum, library, archive). As well as six of the participants who took part in Phase 1
interviews and workshops, another five heritage practitioners (Anon 1 – 5) were asked to
complete an LSI test to increase the sample size. The results are shown in Table 13.

Table 13. Heritage practitioner roles and Learning Style Indicator test results

The LSI results show that there is little consistency in learning style among heritage
practitioners. This might be because of the collections they manage, lack of a strong community
identity (discussed in Section 4.2.2.2), or that these professions attract diverse skillsets.

Although heritage practitioners do operate beyond their comfort zone, responses suggest this
is less of a feature of their day to day work. CC responded to the question by giving the example
of a ‘storage problem’ for the collection which makes her feel uncomfortable. Her way of
embodying the collection and turning the question around by feeling for the collection rather
than feeling out of depth in any way seemed somewhat deflective. CM, a collections manager,
was exceptional among the heritage practitioners by saying that she feels outside her comfort
zone ‘all the time’ (CM 2012a, 4) so she seems to share an appetite for working on the edge
with digital creatives and academics.

Therefore, the heritage practitioners who participated in Phase 1 all shared an inclination
towards experiential, practice-based learning, but this mainly takes place within the workplace
191

rather than in projects which might be beyond individuals’ comfort zones. The range of learning
style results suggests that despite an insistence on professionalism and uniformity among
practitioners, there is a great deal of diversity within this CoP.

4.2.5.3 Learning: Performers
Although the Performance CoP is a very small group and, as such, it is harder to make
generalisations, from workshop transcripts it seems that participants seem to share other
creative practitioners’ difficulty in defining what they do but show a marked inclination to learn
by doing. Made up of an arts educator (ED), and a trained actor (AW), both work or have
worked with the RSC in Stratford. Their roles are theatre-focused and performance-based. AW
found it easiest to define his role introducing himself to the other CoPs at Workshop 1, ‘I’m an
actor [...] I’m here to give an actor’s opinion’(2012e, 4) but later on confides that, ‘The difficult
thing about acting is that everyone does it in a different way’ (AW 2012c). ED found it more
difficult to encapsulate her role, explaining ‘it’s such a broad area that I work in’ (2012a, 1).
Eventually ED said, ‘I guess I’m an arts educator’ (ibid.) and a ‘teacher trainer’ (ibid.) though she
was also an academic and an actress. ED’s difficulty in summing up what she does might be
because of her bridging role between the classroom and the stage but could also be because
she is a retired freelancer moving between CoPs on a regular basis.

For both performers, the rehearsal and the classroom are places where ideas are tried out and
learning takes place. ED revealed that, ‘I’m active and physical by nature and I learn by doing so
the theatre is really interesting to me - all the choices it offers’ (ibid., 3). Equally, AW’s

192

contributions are frequently accompanied by demonstrations or anecdotes or both showing an
inclination towards dynamic learning. During an inspection of a costume in the museum store,
he explained what messages he would want to convey once the artefact is digitised,
I suppose you’d want to communicate [...] I dunno [...] the way it moved I suppose you
see how long it is and how it affected his movement it would be huge [...] you’d have
to do strong movements (AW 2012d, 4).
AW mentioned ‘move’ or words related to it five times and his inclination to touch the artefact
suggests a strong tendency for kinaesthetic learning. Another actor interviewed in the project,
AD, highlighted this learning-by-doing approach commenting that he finds the words of
Shakespeare easy to learn because they seem to have a ‘muscle memory’ (2012, 1) and that
there are clues in the play-text about where to breath. This embodied response to learning and
practice is confirmed by LSI test results showing both performers are accommodative learners,
each by a considerable margin.78

Therefore, the performer CoP share some of the reluctance of other creative practitioners to
narrow down what they do but their descriptions of how they do this are broadly similar and
confirm a dynamic, hands-on approach to learning.

4.2.5.4 Learning: Digital creatives
For those involved in the creation of digital resources, learning on the job and learning through
experimentalism or ‘play’ appears to be characteristic. The project-based nature of the work
78

In the LSI test, nine questions test whether or not an individual has a preference for doing or watching; another
set of nine questions tests whether individuals have preferences for either thinking or feeling. Both performers
were unequivocally doers and feelers, each scoring all doing preferences in the first set of questions, and 7/9
feeling for the second set.

193

digital creatives normally undertake as well as the variety of skillsets required and the fast pace
of change in digital technologies all seem to be responsible for a great deal of learning focused
on the delivery of resources to clients or the development of art-based projects. For instance,
DP described work on a project for BBC Radio 3 which will typically involved ‘a short time for a
deep period of work’ (2012a, 8) consisting of ‘deep immersion for a week, you know very rapid,
thinking of themes and then coming up with ideas, but more generally I suppose there’s an
ongoing relatively lightweight research that happens’ (ibid.). This ‘immersion’ is normally
needed to become familiar with a topic (in this case the work of a particular composer)
whereas the ‘lightweight research’ (ibid., 5) most often involves consulting a wider network of
peers for technical fixes or building on the work of others. This mimetic aspect is especially
valued in the open source community where sharing and reusing content rather than starting
from scratch is the modus operandi. DW explained, ‘You’re copying and then you’re revising
and then slowly it’s becoming yours’ (2012a, 5). In this way, communities learn from other
communities in a form of mutualism (or commensalism depending on whether the benefits of
adaptation are returned as open resources). Participation in situated learning79 takes on a new
dimension as distinctions between ‘apprentice’ and ‘old timer’ are blurred as different CoPs
tacitly exchange knowledge and experience.

Working at the edge of their ‘expertise’ (2012a, 5), digital creatives appear to thrive on
stretching themselves in work-based learning which usually entails openness to
experimentation. All digital creatives claimed that they were not only amenable to operating
79

‘Situated learning usually involves engaging in tasks which parallel real world applications’ (Heeter
2005).

194

outside their natural ‘comfort zone’ (Question 17, Appendix B) but this was a vital part of how
they work. DS commented, ‘I lap up new experiences and challenges [...] just dive in and go for
it’ (2012a, 8). DC confirms that exposure to new areas of practice and to knowledge deficits is
needed for the kind of experimental work he gets involved with, ‘I like to push it and get out
the comfort zone so you’re kind of forced to catch up essentially’ (2012a, 7). The way this is
done requires a degree of adventurousness and trial and error, most frequently described by
digital creatives by the word play (or synonyms thereof). Figure 7 shows the relative use of this
word by all CoPs.

Figure 7. Frequency of use of the word 'play' by four communities of practice (P = performers;
D = digital creatives; H = heritage practitioners; A = academics)

Although this shows that performers use ‘play’ most often, examining the context of usage
shows that what is being referred to is a theatrical production, and this explains usage for all
other CoPs except digital creatives. For this CoP, the most common usage of the word ‘play’ is
in reference to ‘investigation’ by ‘toying’ with an idea or a resource. Digital creatives used the
word play to mean ‘gaming’, ‘mucking around’ and generally unstructured forms of learning. DC

195

explains that an area of his business premises is devoted to ideas creation, the focal point of
which is a pool table intended to facilitate ideas exchange between practitioners in a more
relaxing, playful environment. DW frequently uses ‘play’ in the context of children’s ways of
learning as a way of tackling ‘recurring problems’ (Wenger 2013) or issues encountered during
workshops. In a discussion about a timeline as a digital resource, DW hints at this,
you always give plastic hammers to the small kids and real ones to the grown-ups but
it’s quite interesting to do it the other way around (2012d, 8).
The inference is that sensory contact with artefacts and less formal forms of instruction are
needed to ‘sustain learning’ within this CoP. As DW points out, ‘Nobody reads a manual’
(2012a, 7).

Learning style test results support the idea that digital creatives learn through play. Although
only two digital creatives undertook the LSI test, both were found to be accommodator
learners. Kolb explains that accommodation is a learning style which combines active
experimentation with concrete experience (Kolb 1984, 78). An accommodator,
tends to solve problems in an intuitive trial and error manner, relying often on other
people’s information rather than on own analytic ability (McGill 2013, 3).
In keeping with his thoughts against pigeon-holing what he does, DW initially refused to
undertake the test on the grounds that ‘I'm afraid the multiple choice options quite often didn't
reflect how I would want to answer, so it felt like a rather false exercise’ (2013). However, the
result does correspond with the unstructured, hands-on ways of learning on the job discovered
in qualitative analysis of transcripts for this CoP.

196

4.2.5.5 Learning: Academics
Although the academics in the sample share an openness to learning outside their domain,
results from Phase 1 seem to suggest that domain – or academic discipline - is a powerful
determinant of learning style. For academics taking part in Phase 1, embracing new challenges
is an essential part of their job and their way of learning. Academics, like digital creatives,
appear to thrive working on the edge although register some discomfort in moving into new
disciplines. Being stretched is regarded as a good thing by AH, ‘I think everything I do is a bit like
that because if it was really comfortable I would want to do something else’ (2012a, 3). AA, an
archaeologist, shares this need for going beyond one’s own subject area pointing to the value
of interdisciplinary project, ‘outside everyone’s comfort zone which makes it useful research’
(2012, 7). This is also the way that AT, a theologian with scholarly interests in electronic forms
of editing text, works on projects with colleagues from other departments and in other
institutions, learning with ‘overlapping circles of people that I’m in touch with for different
things’ (2012, 4).

Although it is difficult to typify academics’ way of learning, looking at LSI results (see Appendix
G) suggests that learning behaviour across the academic spectrum is typified less by role
(lecturer, research fellow, postgraduate etc.) and more by discipline. According to the LSI test,
all of the Shakespeare Studies and MASSACHRE lecturers who took part in Phase 1 (plus two
colleagues also asked to complete the test) are accommodators and the majority of students
tested (nine in total) have an accommodative learning style. The remaining students are either
assimilative (two) or convergent learners (two). Interestingly, LS, the academic librarian who
took part in Phase 1 also shares the same learning style as lecturers and most students of

197

Shakespeare Studies. If learning style and CoP are closely linked this suggests membership of
the academic and the heritage practitioner CoP.

This does not mean that all lecturers and students share the same approach to carrying out
research. For example, although the MASSACHRE lecturer (AH) and students (eg. AP, and
Student B) have the same learning style as more text-focused Shakespeare Studies scholars,
they express a stronger preference for direct access to cultural artefacts to further research,
‘you need to be able to get to grips with the object and deal with the object at first hand’
(2012b, 9). AS, a lecturer who works more with text and performance, content is often more
important than medium, ‘mostly what you’re doing is looking at the words and what the words
are doing intellectually, artistically’ (2012a, 2). However, despite variations in technique and
focus, like performers and digital creatives who completed the LSI test, there appears to be a
dominant learning style among Shakespeare Institute staff and students which favours
kinaesthetic ways of learning. Discerning learning styles from types of artefact use is dealt with
in a more systematic way in Section 4.3.3 below.

4.2.6 Conclusion: Are individuals in the sample members of a community of practice?
Phase 1 clearly reveals evidence among participants of membership of one or more
communities of practice. Although other theoretical frameworks such as Fleck’s thought
collectives, or Brown and Duguid’s networks of practice, are useful in explaining deviations
from Wenger’s CoP model, all participants in Phase 1 manifested an interest in a common
domain of knowledge, alignment with a community of people who care about this domain, and

198

signs of a shared practice developed to be effective in their domain. Data from Phase 1 also
suggests that members of CoPs share specific ways of addressing ‘recurring problems’(Wenger
2013), and have particular ways of learning. This last characteristic is examined in more depth
in the Section 4.3 in order to explain how membership of community of practice might affect
interaction with artefacts.

4.3 If individuals are members of a community of practice, how does this affect how they use
artefacts?
Findings from Phase 1 suggest two main reasons why membership of a CoP might affect how
individuals engage with artefacts. Firstly, a CoP’s learning style appears to affect how members
use artefacts. In this section, usage behaviour is described before a connection between usage
styles and learning styles is proposed. In the process of understanding how artefacts are used,
more evidence is produced for the existence of communities of practice among participants in
Phase 1. Secondly, practitioner perspectives seem to affect how members of a community of
practice perceive the artefact and use it. Like learning style, perspectives are a form of
acculturation within a community that affect how practitioners learn from artefacts and,
subsequently, how end-users are able to interact with collections-based digital material.
Practitioner perspectives are referred to in examining the learning strengths and weaknesses of
CoPs and the dynamics between CoPs responsible for creating and using digital artefacts
(Section 4.3.3).

199

4.3.1 Artefact usage
Data suggests that the basic ways in which all individuals use artefacts are broadly similar but
there are also key differences between communities of practice which suggest distinct ways of
using and learning from artefacts. Additionally, these ways of interacting with artefacts appear
to change depending on the nature of the interaction, i.e. whether an artefact and the
environment in which it is used are predominantly physical or digital (discussed in Section 4.4).
In order to explore these findings, this section first looks at generic ways of using artefacts
shared by all participants in the trial before comparing behaviour between communities of
practice within these broad categories of use to expose differences in how CoPs engage with
the artefact.

4.3.2 Categories of Use
Using the constant comparative method to look for patterning in the 121 codes for use found
across the sample, seven broad conceptual categories of use were identified, set out in Table
14 and listed in detail in Appendix E.

These categories appear to be non-sequential and connected, and involve different forms of
physical and cognitive interaction with the artefact. Although all seven categories were
represented across the sample (i.e. all communities of practice use artefacts in this way), based
on incidence rates of the child codes which make up each of these categories, the three main
types of interaction with the artefact centred around working out what an artefact is

201

(identification), where it fits in to a wider physical or informational scheme (contextualisation),
and what it means (interpretation). Thinking inductively about the artefact (induction),
controlling its use (curation), responding to it physically and emotionally (affection), and finding
the artefact (location) were proportionately far less common (the incidence of codes relating to
curation and location can be explained by the discursive nature of interviews and workshops,
discussed below).

Before analysing these findings, why is the grouping of use types into these conceptual
categories valid and how it might be useful? One might argue that the degree of abstraction
and selection involved in the development of conceptual categories for use - themselves based
on the creative codification of text - is arbitrary and lacks validity. Equally, it might be thought
that the aggregation of 121 codes into seven categories over-simplifies the complexities of an
individual’s engagement with an artefact and conceals important nuances. However, the
generation of conceptual categories for use is a systematic and logical extension of the process
of recursive abstraction and conceptualisation begun in the creation of codes from text and,
contests Glaser and Strauss, contains a ‘relevance’ independent of source (Glaser and Strauss
1999, 30).

202

Therefore, the aggregation of codes into conceptual categories continues the process of
dynamically analysing and comparing data while providing a way of describing the complexity
of engagement with the artefact. By its very nature, Grounded Theory requires constant
questioning of evidence as theory is developed from data,
verifying as much as possible with as accurate evidence as possible is requisite while
one discovers and generates his theory – but not to the point where verification
becomes so paramount as to curb generation’ (ibid., 28).
In other words, there is a danger that if a theory is arrived at too early in the process of
generation it will be self-verifying and thwart the process of generation. It is important then to
point out that in this case conceptualisation of use happened after the generation of codes in
response to the recognition of, ‘underlying uniformities in the original set of categories or their
properties’ (ibid., 110) but essentially continues the logic of the constant comparative method.
This means that rather than papering over differences between how individuals use artefacts,
these categories were generated from individual forms of use and would expand, contract and
perhaps disappear based on the evidence of other trials involving different communities of
practice, different artefacts, and different environments, and different types of use. Therefore,
the formation of conceptual categories of use is both methodologically valid and useful
provided one remembers that it is constantly open to change. In other words, these categories
of use are dynamic representations of use, or ‘theory as process’ (Glaser and Strauss 1999, 32).

Looking at the seven categories of use, there are notable differences in the use of physical and
digital artefacts. Since much of the workshop discussions centred on use of the digital artefact,
there is a marked increase in usage under the categories location and curation as communities
of practice articulated ways of using digital images and metadata. Finding and controlling use of

203

digital content created from artefacts dominated many of the discussions, something which did
not happen to any extent when communities of practice encountered physical artefacts in the
museum store. This might be a result of the representation in the trial of communities of
practice who are closely connected to the generation or use of images or metadata created
from physical artefacts, but it might also be a consequence of the particular qualities of digital
representations of the artefact which offer different ways of locating and using material and
challenge traditional forms of ownership.

Looking at the incidence of the three main categories of use – identification, contextualisation,
and interpretation (based on cumulative percentages across all CoPs) - there appears to be a
three-way split between these processes with slightly more identification and contextualisation
taking place with physical material (Figure 8). The higher rates of identification and
contextualisation in the museum store might be because the physicality of artefacts makes the
task of identification more sensorily engaging and encourages more activity seeking to work out
what an artefact is (identification). Equally, the lack of information attached to the artefact in
such an environment could stimulate a need to build context around the artefact
(contextualisation). Students in Phase 1 who spent most time with the physical artefact
remarked on the paucity of information identifying costumes and props, on the physical and
informational gaps between the museum’s database and physical items, and on the artificiality
of the museum’s typological separation of art, props and costumes which students found
unhelpful when thinking in terms of a particular play, material relating to which was physically
separated. More generally, since the act of collecting and ‘museumification’ normally involves
storing similar items together and decontextualisation (McLean 1997, 18) the higher rates of

204

identification and contextualising activity with physical artefacts could be a natural response to
this as opposed to, for example, the presentation of artefact images and metadata on the same
page in an online museum database.80

80

For instance, one student (E) remarked about a costume in the museum store, ‘It would be interesting to see
how it looks on stage rather than just hanging here’ (2012c, 18-19).

Figure 9. Incidence of the seven categories of use of digital artefacts in Phase 1 across all CoPs

Looking at the use of digital artefacts based on cumulative percentages across all CoPs (Figure
9), there is a marked preference for forms of use which attempt to derive meaning from the
artefact, falling under the category Interpretation. The higher rate of interpretation using the

206

digital artefact might be because of the temporal advantages of digital material (having greater
time to reflect on images and metadata as opposed to the usual limitations on time allowed
with physical artefacts in a museum), the choices made in digitising the material (for example
drawing attention to details of an artefact or views from different angles) or recording
information about it (for example, opportunities for accessing user-generated content or
interpretive blogs accompanying the artefact), or indeed the connectedness of the
environment which allows an element of ‘flow’ (Nakamura and Csikszentmihalyi 2002) from the
artefact to other information sources which might extend or deepen the process of meaning
making.

Although the seven categories of use are in evidence right across the sample, there is significant
variation in incidence rates between communities of practice suggesting a strong connection
between membership of a CoP and the way artefacts are used. Each process of use is examined
in turn to look at these variations.

4.3.2.1 Category of use: Location
Generally speaking, for all users of artefacts, locating material seems to be of more importance
in the digital sphere than physically. This interest in searching combines ‘finding artefacts’,
thinking about purposeful routes to encourage use (coded from the transcript as ‘access
routes’), and the serendipity of discovery (coded as ‘discovering artefacts’). Across all
practitioner transcripts recording interaction with physical artefacts, none of these codes are in
evidence. This might be explained by the relatively short nature of the session and the fact that

207

material was pre-selected. Students who were required to inspect and select artefacts within a
specific timeframe in the store were the only group who were concerned about ‘finding’
physical artefacts (distance learning students did not mention finding artefacts, again because
they were supplied with a limited number of digital images).

However, in terms of finding artefacts online, the data suggests that digital creatives and
heritage practitioners are most interested in this, but that digital creatives, performers and
academics are far more concerned about creating access routes. This corresponds with the role
of heritage practitioners in facilitating searching (i.e. the code ‘finding artefacts’) but reflects a
concern among those not directly associated with artefacts and data about how material is
found and used. Although academics were the only group who were interested in the discovery
of artefacts (0.11% of use of digital artefacts), there was a wider discussion featuring academics
and digital creatives about the pros and cons of finding data. Whilst DP spoke of how restricting
access to arts-related data could lead to artefacts being ‘un-findable’ (2012b, 12), DW explained
the benefit of freeing-up data and not overly structuring access to it. The example he gave was
the value of how the Google search engine works,
it’s value is in how it doesn’t work . That if the thing you put in was the thing that came
back as the top line search every time for everybody, Google wouldn’t make any
money at all because the bare value is in the gap between what you searched for and
what you clicked on (2012e, 13).
This ‘creativity’ (ibid.) is then compared by AH to ‘the experience of a library’ (2012e, 13) where
serendipity plays a role in broadening research horizons. Both DW and AH agree that there are
dangers in both the granularity and generality of searching online, but disagree on how to
compensate for this: AH suggests that the analogy of the ‘nuanced’ (ibid., 14) physical search is

208

required whereas DW places faith in users generating their own ‘taxonomy’ (2012e, 13). ED
agrees with the points made by DW and mentioned repeatedly the importance of ‘pathways’
(2012c, 9) to provide access routes tailored to the individual. Therefore, although heritage
practitioners have a role in the selection and organisation of artefacts and data associated with
them, the other CoPs seem to be calling for more diverse ways of accessing that data. This
appears to separate providers from producers.

4.3.2.2 Category of use: Identification
In trying to work out what an artefact is, practitioners and students appear to use sensory and
cerebral interaction with collections material as reflected in a notional taxonomy of codes
related to the identification of physical and digital artefacts (Figure 10).

Figure 10. Taxonomy of Use: Identification
Identification is principally a sensory process with sight being the main way of working out what
an artefact is. The most common ways of looking shared by all CoPs are to ‘look more closely’
and ‘analyse detail’ in order principally to ‘assess materials’ (something which happens 8%
more with digital artefacts than physical) and ‘assess condition’ (something which happens 15%
more with physical artefacts than digital). The need to look in more detail occurs at the same
rate regardless of medium (physical or digital) but what is being looked at certainly does
change, with more attention being paid to condition when an artefact is encountered in person,
and materials when using a digital surrogate. Distance learning students expressed no interest
in the condition of artefacts. This could be because digital images usefully convey close-up

210

images of artefacts (showing materials) but signs of deterioration are less visible or even
disguised through choices made in digitising the artefact.81 Another reason might be that an
artefact’s materiality is harder to ascertain using digital representations so more attention is
paid to it, something which might be clearer from further qualitative testing.

Touching is the next most used sense for every group except digital creatives, who seem to use
other senses more .82 Although there was consensus across CoPs in the hegemony of visual
interaction with the artefact (Figure 11), suggesting that the ‘ocularcentric’ (Dudley 2009, 8)
nature of the museum (Alpers 1991, 27; MacDonald 2002, 118) is perpetuated in the
digitisation process, the extent to which CoPs use sight and the other senses varies widely.

Figure 12. Incidence rates for identification of digital and physical artefacts by CoPs in Phase 1

Generally speaking, digital creatives use the widest range of senses in identifying the artefact
(for example they are the only CoP to reference taste in the identification of an artefact),
particularly with physical material suggesting there might be a connection between creativity
and sensory engagement with the artefact. Digital creatives were the only CoP to talk about the
use of all five senses when trying to identify the artefact. For example, DW, a digital writer,
equated taste with ‘truth’ (2012d, 7) in talking about a child’s natural instinct to place an object
in its mouth to identify it. When academics use senses other than sight this is not taken
seriously, there was an air of atavism and romance about the idea. For example, the smell of
old photographs encountered while conducting research on primary sources (AH 2012e, 12).

212

Therefore, there seems to be more openness and legitimacy among digital creatives in using
senses other than sight to work out what an artefact is which is not shared by other CoPs.

Academics and students spend far less time identifying digital material but demonstrate
greatest variety in ways of looking at an artefact, for example, the codes ‘looking from further
away’ (scale); ‘viewing holistically’ (part and whole), ‘looking from different angles’
(perspectives), and ‘reading from the artefact’ (reading written details on the artefact’s
surface). This visual inquisitiveness marks academics and students out as communities of
practice distinct from the others. Within the student body there are different reasons for the
need for alternative views of the artefacts: for Shakespeare Studies students a variety of views
is important for recapturing an artefact’s life on stage, whereas for MASSACHRE students there
seemed to be a strong connection between 3D views of the artefact and the realness of the
artefact (e.g. Student B 2012b, 19). The MASSACHRE students are also far more interested in
the age of an artefact and its provenance whereas for performance students the post-stage life
of an artefact is of little consequence in terms of research value.

Behind the different incidence of codes for identification of the physical artefact, rates of
‘handling’ are markedly higher for heritage practitioners and performers (two CoPs with
experience of handling artefacts) than for all other CoPs, particularly digital creatives who did
not touch the artefact at all. This also marks a split in the academic CoP between those
lecturers who are accustomed to dealing directly with artefacts and those who are not. AH and
AP, both historians whose research interests regularly involves direct inspection of physical
artefacts, stress the importance of tactility in the investigation of the artefact, ‘the need for the

213

manipulation, the handling of the object seems to be incredibly important when generating
new ideas and new ways of thinking about it’ (AP 2012, 12). This implies that handling is
learned behaviour and, more generally, that artefact use is a form of experiential learning.

What about the influence of medium on the identification of the artefact? Overall, across all
CoPs rates of identification are significantly lower for digital material – as pointed out before –
and part of this might be because of the selective and fixed nature of digitisation or the
environment in which artefacts are used.83 Incidence of the codes ‘assessing materials’,
‘assessing condition’, ‘analysing detail’ and ‘looking more closely’ are all significantly higher for
all CoPs when dealing with physical artefacts compared to digital artefacts. For example, the
code ‘assessing condition’ is much higher (19.56%) with the physical artefact compared to
4.07% with the digital. Malraux refers to the ‘specious unity’ (1967, 55) of a photograph and
perhaps in the process of digitisation, the heterogeneity of the artefact, its frailties and the
clues to use which might be hinted at when assessing condition, are not fully apparent.
Material culture students certainly appeared to be much more aware of, and interested in, the
condition of the artefact than performance students. This extended to looking for clues of
former use and adaptation and to the affect its provenance might have had on the ‘story’ of the
artefact and how it might be interpreted today. Therefore, academic discipline and particular
ways of seeing might well be responsible for the varying level of importance of condition
assigned by participants in Phase 1.

83

Some distance learning students complained about features of artefacts which were inaccessible, and frustration
with software, packaging of images and metadata, and so on.

214

Data from Phase 1 also suggests that the environment influenced how artefacts were being
used. Distance learning students spent proportionately more effort trying to identify artefacts
(25.3% compared to 16.38% for students in the museum store). Distance learning students
registered difficulties reconciling artefacts with metadata in the VLE given the separation of
image files and Word documents containing metadata. There were also technical issues using
Meshlab software (needed to view 3D artefacts) within the VLE; heritage practitioners had
similar technical problems using Basecamp, a project management platform used by
practitioners between workshops. Therefore, the virtual environment presented technical
barriers in the identification of content.

Figure 13. Taxonomy of Use: Contextualisation
The process of contextualisation is taken to mean the placing of an artefact in a physical or
informational context to enrich understanding. This is closely related both to identification
(ascertaining physical attributes to aid contextualisation) and to the interpretation of the
artefact, which involves comprehension and an abstraction of concrete information (supplied
by the artefact) in the making of meaning.

Generally speaking, contexualisation of artefacts happens to a greater extent with the physical
artefact (60% compared to 40% with the digital) and this seems to be prompted by the human
associations of a physical artefact. The codes, ‘thinking about the actor’ or ‘thinking about
character’, and ‘imagining the artefact in motion’, are noticeably higher across the sample

216

when using the physical compared to the digital artefact, particularly for performers. This is
true too for students who do this a great deal in the museum store (11.86%): distance learners
appear to think about any of these aspects of the digital artefact. This ability to relate to the
actor who once wore a costume or used a prop corresponds with the code ‘imagining trying
on’, and ‘size and scale’ expressed across the sample. This preoccupation with the actor was
also shared by digital creatives who seemed to appreciate the celebrity associations of
particular costumes (several laughter episodes initiated by DW centred around the height of a
famous actor who had worn particular costumes in the store). However, academics and both
sets of students (particularly distance learners) think about the perspective of the audience
more using digital material, suggesting that this way of thinking about artefacts, shared almost
exclusively by academics and both sets of students, is facilitated more by the digital.

As well as the preferences of particular communities of practice, the usage environment also
seems to be influential in the process of contextualisation. For example, incidence of the code
‘thinking about lighting’ is higher in the physical environment, perhaps because the effect of
lighting in the museum store is more apparent as opposed to merely accepting the lighting
conditions used in the digitisation of the artefact. Size and scale were mentioned little by
distance learners (1.62%) compared to students using physical artefacts in the museum store
(7.46%). Finally, the code ‘creating links’ is an activity which is largely confined to digital
environments while comparing between artefacts is done to a greater extent in the museum
store with physical artefacts. By and large, thinking of other sources of information and links to
that information is more common with digital material across the sample, and comparing and

217

matching seems to be much easier with the physical artefact hinting at the importance of
environment on the process of contextualisation.

Therefore, ways of contextualising depends on previous experience of the artefacts concerned
(so there is variance across CoPs) and medium (with physical artefacts the human associations
with an artefact are more apparent; with the digital there is greater focus on abstract
associations such as literary or artistic context) as well as environment (which appears to
influence both how artefacts are regarded and how to obtain more information to place the
artefact in context).

Figure 14. Taxonomy of use: Interpretation
As shown in Figure 15, academics and both sets of students (especially distance learners)
interpret more than any other CoP. Unlike all of the other CoPs, academics and students show
a higher degree of abstract thinking around the digital artefact. Again this could be because of
the temporal advantages of the digital (digital artefacts can be studied for longer84), being
accustomed to only using digital material, or a connection between learning and flow within a
digital environment.
84

Analysing detail is more evident among store visit students in reflective blogs (5.97%) written afterwards
compared to 3.19% use by distance learning students suggesting that the temporal advantages of digital
representation are being use in ‘close reading’ (StudentC 2012) of the artefact, something which AH claims is done
after a visit to a heritage site or collection for example to ‘engage with the iconography’ of a work of art (2012, 1).

Figure 15. Incidence of codes relating to the interpretation of artefacts by CoPs in Phase 1

Moreover, academics and students are the only CoPs to think about the value of an artefact, its
design and construction, and symbolic meaning, particularly with the physical. Indeed, these
CoPs are unique in their critical analysis of artefacts.85 Likewise, students were also the only
CoP to use the code, ‘interrogating metadata’ (critiquing the quality of data in museum
database). Students recorded in their reflective journals the inadequacy of metadata available
on artefacts they were considering for selection with comments such as ‘Who are the pictures
and paintings by?’ and ‘Why is it not known to staff’. They were also sceptical of the quality of
the metadata. CS admitted that some of the metadata was added by volunteers and would
contain the assumptions of the cataloguer, explaining that what is captured is ‘how we perceive
the object when we’re cataloguing it’ (2012, 14). This arose because the description of one
costume appeared to either be highly subjective or contain some sort of prior knowledge of the
production. As such, one student said they would treat the information ‘gingerly’ (Student E
85

For example, in a reflective journal, Student B notes ‘Items catalogued according to cataloguer’s perception:
potential for misunderstanding of concept’ (Student B 2012, 3).

220

2012c, 53) and noted in her journal that she was making ‘assumptions forced by the
description’ (Student E 2012b, 2).

Thinking about the authenticity of an artefact also reveals fault lines between CoPs. Actors use
the authenticity of the artefact to tap in to emotions. For example, one actor spoke about
visiting a gallery in Rome to prepare for a role. However, it was not the authenticity of the
artefacts per se which was useful but their ability to illicit an authentic response from visitors.
This then allowed the actor to gauge a ‘mental state’ associated with a character. For actors
who took part in Phase 1, it seems to be the space between artefacts and people which is of
interest. In Phase 1, academics seemed to use the authenticity of the artefact in a more factual
way, assessing whether something is real or fake and using interaction as a way of assessing an
artefact’s significance and research value. Although DL students did mention authenticity,86
there were no discussions about authenticity among students who visited the store, performers
or digital creatives. This suggests that for students encountering the physical artefact in the
context of a museum store, authenticity of the artefact is assumed. However, as noted above,
authenticity of the interpretation of the artefact is very much open to questioning as students
attempt to assess the value of metadata. Academics and heritage practitioners are the CoPs
most interested in the authenticity of artefacts; this is highest among academics who are
discussing digital representations of the physical artefact, and among heritage practitioners
interacting with physical artefacts who spoke about the originality of artefacts during a
handling session at the second workshop.

86

For example, DL1 writes that ‘In modern performances, producers either try to be entirely authentic in their
productions - desiring to reveal an accurate depiction of Shakespearean life, or they try to avoid reality completely’
(2012, 1).

221

Interpreting the artefact, therefore, brings out practitioner perspectives and preferences
defined by domain interest, knowledge and experience within each community of practice.
Digitisation appears to facilitate abstract thinking around the artefact but also seems to cause
end-users to question authenticity and value.

4.3.3 Usage styles and learning styles
How each CoP identifies, contextualises and interprets the artefact highlights differences in the
way they use artefacts but what else does this tell us? Using the artefact is, like membership of
a community of practice, a manifestation of an innate intention to create knowledge and to
learn. Since one of the hallmarks of communities of practice is that they learn together, what
does shared usage behaviour around the artefact tell us about the way that CoPs learn?

Wenger and Lave propose that collaborative learning within a CoP is about knowledge
acquisition gained through practice (2009, 49). Since artefact use is a form of practice and a
type of experiential learning, how communities learn ought also to be detectable from how
they engage with artefacts. The corollary of this is that membership of a community of practice
should be discernible from patterns of artefact usage and learning style preference. In Chapter
3, conceptual connections between learning style and artefact use as a form of practice were
proposed. Based on artefact usage data from Phase 1, how can categories of use and learning
styles be reconciled?

222

The three main categories of use identified in Phase 1– identification, contextualisation and
interpretation – are concerned with use of the physical and digital artefact in making meaning
through concrete experience. This means that it ought to be possible to locate each of the
categories of use within the Experiential Learning Cycle proposed by Kolb. Having used
recursive abstraction to generate categories of use from use codes, these processes were then
mapped to quadrants within Kolb’s Experiential Learning Cycle to match use behaviour with
learning styles (see Section 3.4.3). Both locating artefacts and responding to them affectively
would seem to logically fit in the concrete-experimental quadrant of Kolb’s cycle since it is
‘action-oriented’ and ‘encourages independent discovery’ (McGill 2013, 3). Contextualisation is
a process which involves largely divergent knowledge grasped by apprehension when exposed
to concrete experience. For example, ‘links between things’, ‘matching’, and ‘thinking about
other information’ all concern drawing on data from a diverse range of sources to place an
artefact in context. This corresponds most closely to concrete-reflective learning. Interpretation
involves comprehension and a ‘mode of adaptation to the world’ (Kolb 1984, 29) which is
conceptually opposed to concrete experience. Therefore, it corresponds most closely with
assimilative learning. Finally, identification of an artefact entails inductive thinking, drawing on
comprehension and extension to narrow down the identity of an artefact from an infinity of
possibilities. This places identification in the domain of convergent knowledge between
abstract conceptualisation and active experimentation. Although other processes (such as
curation) are involved which map to quadrants in Kolb’s learning style, these are the main areas
identified in the study and are largely responsible for suggesting a dominant learning style for
each CoP (shown in relation to Kolb’s Experiential Learning Cycle in Figure 16).

Although this was a relatively small sample, data indicates that different CoPs have strengths

depends on whether the engagement with the artefact is physical or digital (Table 15).

Phase 1

224

Looking at the correspondence between CoPs and learning style it is possible to interpret what
might be happening during the encounter with the physical artefact and with digital material
generated from it. Firstly, no CoPs are classified as accommodators: this is hardly surprising
given the brevity of sessions with collections (physical or digital) and the degree of mediation
(by gatekeepers) involved in the interaction of CoPs with artefacts in the museum store. All
CoPs, except heritage practitioners and academics, assume a divergent learning style in the
museum store. In this scenario, curators, librarians, archivists and collections managers were
using a convergent learning style which prioritises identification of the artefact as opposed to
all other CoPs (except academics) who were contextualising using a divergent learning style.
Bearing in mind that heritage practitioners assumed gatekeeping roles during the objecthandling events, this stylistic preference certainly makes sense. Given that all other participants
were new to the artefacts used in the trial, imaginative responses (characteristic of divergent
learners) which seek to make sense of physical stimuli also sounds likely and logical. This
learning style pattern was reversed for heritage practitioners (and the performer CoP) when
they used digitised material suggesting that with the virtual they engage in more
contextualisation than identification activity. The similarity in learning styles across the
scholarly community using digital material is significant (both CoPs become assimilators)
although there is a difference in response to physical material. This suggests that the scholarly
community contextualises more with the ‘real thing’ and interprets to a greater extent with the
digital.

However, the most notable relationship between CoPs and learning style is that in their ‘native’
environment, i.e dealing with digital material or physical artefacts, digital creatives and heritage

225

practitioners exhibit the traits of convergent learners (shown in Figures 17 and 18). This means
that these CoPs are most focused on finding solutions to problems as their learning styles
combine abstract and active elements. In their ‘non-native’ environment, each CoP takes on a
more divergent learning style, thinking out-of-the-box and generating ideas which split off in a
variety of directions. This is significant because it affects the degree of learning and innovation
which can occur when these communities come together. It must also affect the packaging and
presentation of digital material generated from primary sources and determines the potential
use of artefacts in research.

These findings have implications for collaborative learning and innovation in the digital supply
chain. Kolb points out that specialisation of a learning style within the individual or group
involves loss in the polar opposite mode of learning (ibid., 203). To ensure projects bring about
creativity and growth, a balance of all four learning styles would, theoretically, be needed. At
the earliest stages of a project, divergent learning styles might be most required as ideas are
conceived and discussed. Interestingly, the data suggests that this might be done most
effectively by exposure of real artefacts to digital creatives and by engaging heritage
practitioners (and performers) in the formative stages of a digital project. This fits with the
creative ideas recorded in the reflective diary of LS (an academic librarian) whose suggestions
(made prior to viewing the actual cloak) on ways of presenting Prospero’s cloak digitally
included a circle instead of a straight line for a timeline to correspond to 17 th Century
cosmology and necromancy (2012a, 2). Equally, DC’s explanation (given in his profiling

227

interview) of his company’s involvement in a collections-based digital project begins with the
‘need to get to grips with [...] content’(2012b, 5) and that ‘normally, you get a kind of sniff of an
idea and we kind of, and that’s when we’re brought in to help’ (ibid., 6). This indicates that
heritage practitioners could be responsible for much of the creative direction taken in the
presentation of artefacts online but that digital creatives could benefit from earlier engagement
with real artefacts (and expertise in the form of curators or scholars) pre-digitisation. This is
discussed further in Chapter 6.

4.4 What influence does environment have on artefact use?
The environment appears to affect not only the types of use individuals engage in but also the
incidence of those types of use. Although the majority of codes for use straddle both physical
and digital environments, there are some types of use which are only exhibited with physical or
digital artefacts. As Appendix F shows, certain forms of finding the artefact, viewing it,
interpreting it, curating it, or responding to it affectively are exhibited only with physical or with
digital artefacts. For instance, codes for identification such as ‘looking from different angles’
and ‘looking from further away’ and interpretive use of artefacts such as ‘historical accuracy’
are only recorded in digital environments. Equally, codes such as ‘reminiscing’, ‘imagining trying
on’ and ‘completion’ are only recorded with physical artefacts. Therefore, either the nature of
the artefact itself or the affordances of the environment (or a combination of both factors)
seems to be responsible for eliciting different forms of usage behaviour in participants.

228

As noted in Section 4.3.3, overall incidence rates of usage of digital and physical artefacts are
different across the entire sample as well as among different CoPs. As shown in Table 16, there
is a marked decrease in rates of identification and contextualisation and a notable increase in
forms of interpretation of the artefact when usage passes from a physical to a digital context.

This data indicates that the environment either facilitates or obstructs ways of seeing among
particular communities of practice, allowing or restricting forms of use which correspond with
the interests and learning styles of those communities. In other words, environmental factors
influence individuals in terms of their acculturation in the workplace but also by determining
what is and is not possible in digital learning environments. Both forms of determinism are
tested in Phase 2.

4.5 Does the method of describing and measuring artefact usage work?
Generally speaking, the process of describing and measuring artefact usage proved successful
in scoping types of use and providing a basis for comparison between individuals and
communities of practice. Although a degree of adjustment was needed following a pilot
exercise of coding,87 most codes for use generated from the text proved robust and
87

Adjustments were made to the working definition of ‘use’, and in deciding when the digital and the physical
artefact is being invoked in discussions.

229

representative. This was proven by the survival of such a large number of different codes
throughout the exhaustive coding of all text and by the interrogation of each code using the
constant comparative method. Although this was principally an issue-based rather than actionbased phase of investigation, the conceptualisation of data to form codes and use processes
provided a firm basis for testing hypotheses about usage of digital artefacts in Phase 2.

However, attempts to calculate learning styles from usage behaviour did not match all of the
results from the LSI test. This was probably because of a combination of test conditions, and
methodological difficulties with processing and analysing the data. The mixing of CoPs in Phase
1 might have influenced usage behaviour so that, just as linguistic differences might be less
apparent in the informality of such a setting and in mirroring behaviours, artefact-based forms
of practice might have been less representative of individuals or communities than if conducted
in isolation. The focus on talking about using artefacts rather than actually using them might
also have affected results and would explain the relative absence of usage behaviour associated
with the accommodative learning style. In processing data, difficulties were experienced in
distinguishing between environments (digital and physical) in the coding process for Phase 1
and the exclusion of observational data in the coding process (this was used mainly to clarify
the digital / physical distinction in Phase 1). These shortcomings were addressed in Phase 2 by
focusing on actual use rather than discussions about use, controlling test environments and
artefact-based learning goals, and coding observational as well as textual data.

230

4.6

What issues are associated with the selection, digitisation and packaging of artefacts
which might affect end use?

4.6.1 Other issues affecting end-use: Introduction
In order to find out what other factors affect end-use of digital artefacts, three approaches
were taken. Firstly, in the profiling interview, participants were asked about their involvement
in previous digital projects. These questions (18 and 19, Appendix B) were designed to probe
which roles different practitioners had adopted in the digital supply chain in the past and what
some of the issues were with selection, the process of capture and packaging of artefacts for
use. Secondly, campus-based students were asked to stipulate which features of physical
artefacts should be captured digitally and then to evaluate the degree of transformation that
had occurred in the products of that process. Finally, the use of digital artefacts was compared
between campus-based students who had encountered the physical artefacts, and distance
learning students who only used the digital material. The first approach was intended to
uncover issues involved in supply of digital artefacts from the suppliers’ perspectives, and the
second and third approach were intended to reveal end-users’ perspectives on the efficacy of
the digitisation process, even when they are involved.

4.6.2 Other issues affecting end-use: Supplying content
Looking firstly at suppliers, the processes of selection and digitisation appear to be intimately
linked and remain largely in the control of collections and technical specialists. It was clear that
heritage practitioners play a lead role in both controlling access to physical artefacts for

231

digitisation but a more limited role in directing how this should be done. CC, a museum curator,
explained her gatekeeping role in terms of selection and admission to collections,
I’ve sat down and talked about what she *a digitisation project officer+ can include [...]
how she can physically have access to things to photograph them (2012, 5).
CC goes on to point out the passing on of experience to the digitisation specialist through
training,
I’ve also helped give her a bit of brief training on the proper procedures for getting
things in and out of store (ibid.).
Although LS, an academic librarian, has not been closely involved in the process of capture, she
has played the role of selector and adviser of what is most significant. LU mentions the act of
the librarian to ‘acquire material’ (2012b, 1) repeatedly as well as ‘collecting’ (ibid., 3), ‘mix and
match’ (ibid., 2) selection for exhibition, and ‘identifying’ (ibid., 1) artefacts for digitisation,
underlining the role of heritage practitioner as a key selector in the use of artefacts in physical
and digital form. Speaking to all heritage practitioners, there seems to be a degree of opacity in
terms of the criteria for artefact selection, and then how this translates in terms of the
technical approach to digital capture. Ooghe and Moreels (2009) point out that these two
processes are frequently confused,
Regarding selection and digitisation, there is often little distinction between the
reasons for digitisation (e.g., increasing access) and the criteria for selection (e.g.,
prioritising heavily demanded materials) (ibid.).
The outcome is that selection by heritage practitioners tends to drive the process rather than
‘the reasons for digitisation’, usually justified on the grounds of end-user access. But a further
disconnect between roles in the digital supply chain seems to happen between the gatekeeper
and the digitiser roles in terms of creative and technical decisions made on photographing or
scanning an item and associated metadata capture. The complicity of heritage practitioners in a

232

process which they ultimately do not fully control is acknowledged by LU, a rare books librarian
who explains that, ‘there is a real difficulty in arriving at something which is [...] effective for
everybody’ (2012b, 4) when talking about the technical challenges of digitising manuscripts and
annotated books. Therefore, although heritage practitioners play a formative role in deciding
what should be digitised and what end users have access to, this degree of determinism does
appear to diminish post-selection.

For academics, their involvement in selection and digitisation is variable and generally limited
but they have an interest in how this is undertaken. All academics in the sample had experience
of working on digital projects and this seemed to vary according to level of technical expertise.
For AH and SS, they expressed an interest in the commentary around capture and some of the
issues associated with representing material, as well as a shared frustration about actually
gaining access to and using digital artefacts related to their subject. AH spoke most about the
selection of artefacts that have been digitised for the workshops, going on to discuss the
importance of the ‘process of selection’ (2012b, 33) a number of times in relation to the
‘survival’ (ibid.) of artefacts and their absorption into collections. The control and the
intellectual ‘ownership’ (AH 2012d, 12) of artefacts is a key issue for AH in her role as an
historian. For AA and AT, they had been more closely involved in projects that experimented
with digital tools and both of these academics shared an interest in user-driven innovation. For
AT he was more interested in creating environments than content, speaking at length about
projects to equip biblical scholars with tools to edit ancient manuscripts and he maintained
throughout the profiling interview that ‘I see myself as the end-user’ (2012, 5). Equally, AA, an

233

archaeologist with a lead role in the 3D visualisation of landscapes and artefacts, stressed that
it was necessary for him to think outside the box when digitising,
ignore the software, think about what you want to achieve, and then just find a way of
doing it (2012, 5).
Although academics in the sample are not closely involved in the selection of artefacts for
digitisation, they are interested in the relationship between capture and use, and share a
stronger belief in the potential of the process to be determined by end-use since they
themselves are informed end-users in the digital supply chain.

The performers who took part in Phase 1 either act as mediators in the supply of content to
schools (in the case of the arts educator, ED) or end-users of archive material when researching
previous productions of a play in preparation for a role (AW 2012c, 2). In terms of mediation of
content, what is meant is that archive material which might be of use to school teachers, such
as images of costumes or production photographs, is either created anew from the RSC’s
cultural collections or, more commonly, existing content is packaged for school teachers under
the direction of ED. This tailoring of resources for specific audiences is similar to the role played
by heritage practitioners but is very focused on particular end-users rather than collections.

234

Digital creatives are more likely to become involved in packaging digital artefacts post-capture
and this usually revolves around encouraging use of metadata rather than digitisation per se.88
DC explained his usual involvement in presenting digital material created from cultural artefacts
for use,
how you serve that, how you frame that and how you deliver that to the user in
different types of context or in different situations so it’s that whole sort of process
(2012a, 6).
For digital creatives, the focus is on user selection and creating personalised access ‘routes’
(e.g. DP 2012a, 5) into data. DC spoke about ‘playlists’ fourteen times during the two
workshops (e.g. 2012b, 27), DS also shows an interest in playlists using the word eight times
(e.g. 2012a, 2), while DP speaks about ‘favourites’ (DP 2012c, 17) and personal ‘lists’ (e.g.
2012c, 11) of artefacts.

In packaging content for end-use, digital creatives expressed a frustration with the supply of
metadata on cultural collections and the difficulties of stimulating uptake and use of resources.
DS described the problem of a ‘human bottleneck’ (2012a, 1) created by relying on ‘archivists’
to supply collections metadata to keep up with the pace of mass digitisation. 89 However, DP is
more realistic in her expectations about user uptake. She spoke about a project which tried to
encourage the general public to add a story to an artefact’s online catalogue record, admitting
that this was over optimistic about the idea that the public would or could respond with what
was imagined,

88

There was an incidence rate of 2.07% of the code ‘Thinking about Digitisation’ among digital creatives compared
to 6.5% for heritage practitioners and academics, in transcripts of interviews and workshops.
89

DS went on to explain about a project she was working on to by-pass heritage practitioners in favour of creating
digital environments to allow for the crowd-sourcing of information to tackle ‘metadata barriers’ (2012a, 1).

235

actually it’s your interpretation and your ability to bring context which actually changes the
content of the object as it were rather than I think the idea that everyone instantly has a
kind of response that they’re able to turn into words is actually not really true (2012a, 1).

DP organised hacking workshops that aim to stimulate ‘co-creation’ (ibid., 5) of content based
on principles such as ‘openness, collaborative working, the idea that technology’s a good thing’
(ibid., 3). In playing a key role at the user end of the digital supply chain, digital creatives on the
one hand face problems with the supply of usable content and on the other with the challenge
of how to package that content so that users will want to engage with it and add to it. This, DP
supposes, requires a balancing act between ‘freedom and structure’ in order to provide
‘stimulus in at an appropriate level’ (ibid., 3). Therefore, in a way the role of heritage
practitioners in managing selection which, ‘prevents us from ending up with a cumbersome
mass of data that is practically and financially impossible to maintain or access’ (Ooghe and
Moreels 2009) is repeated in the work of digital creatives who find that although supply of
material is important, actual use is more likely if the focus of their activity is narrowed.

4.6.3 Other issues affecting end-use: Using content
The engagement of students as directors of the supply chain in Phase 1 was intended to test
whether giving end-users a degree of control in digitisation would lead to more usable digital
artefacts. Having selected fourteen artefacts based on various productions of Shakespeare’s
play The Tempest (thus assuming the traditional role of heritage practitioners), students were
asked what information was important to capture in the process of digitisation. A list of
artefacts and priorities for digitisation was drawn up with students and this was passed to

236

digitisation staff at the University of Birmingham’s VISTA90 Centre to capture artefacts on the
list. Metadata on each of the artefacts was prepared by a doctoral research student in
accordance with the priorities given by the students. The resulting image files and metadata
were then passed to those students who had originally selected artefacts and instructed
digitisation for a before-and-after-style evaluation, given by three research students in
reflective blogs. The digital material was also given to distance learning students to compare
their responses with those of students in the museum store. The main features specified by
students in the digitisation of artefacts are listed in Table 17.

Although most students wanted digitisation to deliver the same things, there is a degree of
differentiation among them which depends on the type of object and the discipline of the
students. Material culturists were more interested in 3D representations of historic artefacts
and this might be associated with their interest in construction and changes to the artefact
since it was made. Whereas for students of performance the post-stage life of the artefact is of
less interest, what is of most concern is recapturing the moment an artefact is used on stage.
For these students, detailed and holistic imaging of the artefact, and under different lighting
conditions, would be most useful. Therefore, a strong connection between the domain of
interest of students and what they expect from the digitisation of material and how they would
wish to use this material is apparent.

So how far did digitisation deliver what students wanted? Despite students’ role in directing the
process of digitisation, we can see gaps in delivery which results in different levels of
satisfaction with the product. These gaps seem to depend on exposure to the physical artefact
and the process of cataloguing it. Distance learning students distinguished between different
types of image according to how they could be used and for whom, suggesting that decisions
made during the process of capture have altered an artefact’s use potential. Commenting on a
close-up photograph of the blade of a sword (Image 2674), DL3 pointed out that the image was
‘Good for museum archival photo but not much use from a performance perspective’ (2012, 1).
Looking at another photograph of the tip of the sword (Image 2704), DL3 added that the image
has, ‘No performance value but a fine example of markings and material for museum archives’
(ibid., 2). Another image (Image 019_1) was a ‘great photo for inventory or rental purposes’
(ibid.). This signals a dissatisfaction with digitisation given the particular purpose this student

238

had in mind for the artefact (to answer a research question about performance) and a change
in value according to how an artefact had been represented. Repeated distinctions are made
between the adequacy of a photograph for internal purposes (i.e. identification in a collection)
and its use beyond the repository. Therefore, students appear to regard some images as a
museum record, while others are more usable by providing information more geared towards
their research interest. In other words, they detect a degree of intentionality behind the taking
of these photographs.

The students’ criteria for selection of artefacts suggests the importance to them of original
(stage) context and the use potential of images and metadata might be related to how far these
facilitate a reimagining of an artefact’s original context of use. DL2 stresses that ‘Images need a
context’ (2012a, 2) while DL3 states that a particular photograph is ‘unintelligible [...] when
standing alone’ (2012, 2). Student C makes it clear that, for her, digitisation is a process of
decontextualisation. In speaking about an image of a robe worn by Derek Jacobi in 1982 as
Prospero (SBT 2012) she points out that, ‘Digitised, divorced from its context, the costume
insists upon its singularity’ (2012, 1).

Although the parameters of selection were narrowed by the play and the research question,
the artefacts they chose collectively showed that the completion of a particular outfit,
‘collating’ (AS 2012b, 31) Prospero’s cloak, staff and book from a particular production, was as
important to them as an artefact’s association with iconic or ‘seminal productions’ (Student D
2012, 20) or ‘selecting costumes that are emblematic of a performance’ (Student B 2012a, 44).
One student claimed that bringing together the whole outfit worn by a character is more likely

239

to achieve, ‘full usefulness in interpreting performance choices’ (DL3 2012, 2) just as digitising
those costumes worn by key characters (10 of the 14 artefacts selected relate to Prospero, one
of the protagonists in The Tempest) and from well known productions of the play are more
likely to excite interest as well as ‘reveal performance choices’ owing to their prominence.
Student E speaks about the ‘double vision’ (Student E 2012a) which digitisation necessitates in
the astute researcher,
at times it is hard to know whether the connotations that arise *from ‘reading’ the
digital artefact] are a function of the costume or of its digitisation: the image privileges
detail, and thus, a kind of double vision is needed to negotiate the boundary between
what can be perceived by an audience because of its design; a spectator in an
exhibition space because of its proximity; or by an online-viewer because of its
digitisation (ibid.).

Student E makes the point that digitisation is affecting how students ‘see’ the artefact and that
this probably affects how they should second-guess how an audience once ‘saw’ the artefact,
given the degrees of separation between the staged-artefact, the displayed /stored-artefact
and the digitised-artefact. Digitisation is, therefore, responsible for a form of dramatic irony,
allowing the user of a digitised costume a view of the artefact which was not possible for the
audience and, as such, should be treated judiciously.

Information about the context of capture appears also to be very important to student endusers. For DL2, an explanation of why images were taken and what they were intended for is
vital,
I missed a kind of background or contextual information regarding the images.
Something like: “These images were taken for such and such purpose…They can be
used for such and such…”, etc (2012a, 1).

240

Student A also makes a point about distinguishing between images according to the context of
capture,
it depends on what kind of image because if it’s a production image then you get to
see it in a completely different context and perhaps something which can give you
further insight into that performance cos here it’s, it’s things are like stored but in a
theatrical space is totally different (Student A 2012, 20-21).
Therefore, vital contextual information of relevance to researchers of performance history (e.g.
how a costume looked on stage, how it moved, how it affected the actor’s movement, as well
as what has been done during digitisation) might be left out in focusing digitisation on
particular aspects of an individual artefact.

The efficacy of digitisation can also be gauged from what students did not say as well as what
they did. Codes for use concerning the weight, texture and condition of the artefact were
entirely absent from the distance learning student transcripts. This means that distance
learning students did not express an interest in these features of the artefact compared to
students who had encountered the physical artefacts at first hand suggesting that digitisation
appears to be removing data of value to research students, despite the involvement of their
peers in specifying how these artefacts should be represented. In comparing an artefact with its
digital representation, Student E admits that ‘much is lost in the digital image’s composition’
(2012a) and the ‘eloquence’ of the physical artefact is ‘frustrated’ and ‘muted by its digitisation’
(ibid.). The loss of ‘tactile associations’; and the pliability of the costume, experienced in the
museum store, are ‘harder to extrapolate from the virtual images’ (ibid.). However, only
students who encountered the artefact in digital form drew attention to its authenticity,
historical accuracy, aesthetics and value.

241

Therefore, apart from difficulties in representing aspects of the artefact’s physicality, the
process of digitisation also seems to be causing a qualitatively different response, leading
students to question the authenticity of an artefact (is it real or is it fake?) and its research
value, as opposed to assumptions of authenticity and value in the museum store. This
difference between those students who dealt only with the digital and those who worked with
both the physical and the digital artefacts is made clear in their opinion on the partiality
(Student E 2012a) of images and metadata, or the degree of trust they place in the relationship
between the physical artefact and its digital representation. For students who interacted with
physical artefacts in the museum store and specified how they should be digitised, they
regarded the images produced favourably but called into question the quality of the metadata
that accompanied both the physical and the digital artefacts. For these students the images
‘partially tempered’ (ibid.) the subjective nature of the metadata and allow for different forms
of interpretive response. Whilst the metadata ‘does little justice’ (ibid.) to the physicality of
artefact and relates ‘too confident a narrative’ (ibid.) which can mislead the researcher, the
images are ‘presented impartially’ (ibid.) and provide a ‘record’ (Student C 2012) of the artefact
which ‘gives a lie to the catalogue description’ (ibid.) and offers ‘a space for speculation’ (ibid.)
through ‘the opportunity to study the costume by a process akin to close-reading’ (ibid.) in
different light conditions. This might be because the process of reconciling metadata from the
museum database with physical artefacts was difficult and revealed degrees of interpretation
on the part of ‘volunteer’ (Student E 2012c, 53) cataloguers. For example, a costume
(STRPG:C:TEMP.026) was described in the museum catalogue as, ‘Wine coloured body suit
covered with stiffened strips of material giving it a rotting flesh appearance’ (SBT 2012)
whereas students soon realised that this was the interpretation of a volunteer rather than a

242

formal description or even a reference to part of the playtext or character. This is represented
by the incidence of the code, ‘reconciling with metadata’, which was 4.98% among students
who visited the store and zero among distance learning students. In contrast, for students who
were only exposed to digitised material (images and metadata), the imaging of the artefact was
considered ‘partial’ and the veracity of the metadata was generally ‘good’ (DL2 2012a, 1), and
unquestioned. DL2 commented on the degree of editing that has happened before students
engage with the digital artefact,
Even the 3D images are not a copy of the real object or costume. The image captures a
perspective of it. We do not see how objects move or are used. The fact that some
images have been selected means that someone else has chosen what to see (DL2
2012b, 1).
Therefore, for students who had access only to the digital artefact the image itself is crucial; for
those who had already experienced the physical artefact at first hand they regard detailed
digital images as helpful but were far more critical of their first access point to artefacts –
descriptions given in the museum catalogue. In other words, for both sets of students the
relationship between physical and digital is not explained. Since the digital artefact is for many
end-users the ‘primary access-point to collections, regardless of the institutional setting within
which their analogue counterparts are housed’ (Ooghe and Moreels 2009), there is perhaps
greater need for making decisions clear and standardising approaches. This underlines the
point on the importance to end-users of the context of capture, made above.

243

4.6.4 Other issues affecting end-use: Conclusion
Although all CoPs represented in Phase 1 have an important role to play in directing the
selection, digitisation, and packaging of artefacts, influencing what is represented digitally and
to whom, decisions made about how digitisation is carried out has an inordinate effect on the
use potential of digital artefacts. Choices made at the point of capture on which aspects of an
artefact will be represented, both in terms of imagining and cataloguing, and how this
information will be accessed by end-users, play a large role in determining the use potential of
the digital artefact. The lack of satisfaction among students in the products of digitisation even
when end-users are placed in the driving seat demonstrates that digitisation is an interpretive
act which is based on the selective nature of technology and the selective interests of providers
of content. Although students in this case and heritage practitioners more generally, are
responsible for selecting artefacts for digitisation, defining the relationship between the
physical artefact and its digital representation falls to digitisation specialists and to cataloguers.
The decisions made by technical staff are therefore firmly embedded in the digital artefact
made available for end use. This echoes what Wenger and Lave said about the ‘cultural
transparency of technology’ (Wenger and Lave 2009, 30) in that the products of the digital
supply chain evidence the varying degrees of influence of decision makers at different points in
the chain. Since defining the digital artefact ‘depends on what aspect of it will turn out to be
important’ (Lanier 2011, 134), if the interests and learning styles of end-users are not
considered by digitisers and cataloguers, and of the influence of their own learning styles and
perspectives is not appreciated, then there is the real possibility of a disconnect between the
use potential of the physical artefact and the use potential of the digital artefact.

244

4.7 Phase 1: Summary, conclusions and hypotheses
Returning to the central question concerning how digital artefacts are used and what factors
influence use, the testing of the concept of communities of practice and the derivation of
quantitative data from interviews and workshops has revealed important patterns in the way
that artefacts are used as well as suggesting factors which might influence use. These findings
can be expressed as a number of hypotheses that need testing.

As a way of understanding the dynamics of the digital supply chain and the perspectives of
suppliers and users of digital artefacts, Wenger’s theory of communities of practice is a useful
conceptual tool illuminating patterns of behaviour that might otherwise go unrecognised.
Although other concepts help explain alternative ways of stewarding knowledge, the CoP
model provides a way of comparing the way how practitioners identify with a particular
domain, form communities and refine practice with like-minded others. It provides a
framework for rationalising the way that practitioners who took part in Phase 1 identify with a
domain of interest, steward knowledge about that domain, and learn collaboratively.
Moreover, it seems to suggest how practitioners are likely to learn since each CoP appears to
have a dominant learning style. Although Phase 1 showed that most practitioners are members
of more than one CoP, of the three components of a community of practice – domain,
community and practice - domain appears to be the most influential in determining which
learning style is most dominant. Although in many respects members of the academic CoP
exhibit the characteristics of a single community, there are signs that domain is influential in
determining a CoP’s learning style. Therefore, findings from Phase 1 suggest a hypothesis on
the connection between domain and learning style.

245

Hypothesis 1: Domain defines the learning style of a CoP
Phase 1 identified two main factors which appear to explain how membership of a CoP might
affect usage of artefacts: the roles and perspectives of practitioners involved in the supply and
use of artefacts, and the influence of collective learning styles. The perspectives of practitioners
on issues associated with the selection, digitisation and packaging of artefacts, suggests that
these play a large part in guiding their use of artefacts, influencing the dynamics of
interdisciplinary projects, and, through the crystallisation of decisions made by practitioners in
creating digital artefacts, directing the scope of end-use. Data derived from discussions of
artefact use indicates that the way all participants use artefacts is broadly similar
(conceptualised in three major use processes: identification, contextualisation and
interpretation) but there are particular patterns of use shared by members of each CoP. Since
artefact use is a form of experiential learning, it has been proposed that patterns of artefact use
and learning styles are connected. The corollary of this is that the learning style of a CoP might
be influencing how artefacts are used. However, since data was based largely on discussions of
use there remains a need to test actual usage in controlled conditions. Moreover, disparities
between calculations of learning style from coding of usage and LSI testing make the findings
inconclusive. Therefore, this suggests two hypotheses on artefact usage and learning style.
Hypothesis 2: The way that artefacts are used is broadly similar but there are differences
between CoPs
Hypothesis 3: Usage behaviour and learning styles are linked
With some exceptions, the use of Grounded Theory to describe forms of artefact use and
harvest quantitative data from usage behaviour, proved successful. However, modifications are
needed in data processing (incorporating observational data into the analysis) and the

246

management of test conditions to assess whether the data can more closely reflect actual
usage behaviour. A measure of this will be how closely usage behaviour and calculation of
learning styles based on usage behaviour, matches the results of an independent learning style
test. Based on evidence from Phase 1 a hypothesis on methodology is proposed.
Hypothesis 4: Grounded Theory can be used to describe and measure artefact usage
Data from Phase 1 also indicates that the types and incidences of artefact use vary according to
the context of usage. This might be because of features of the environment and / or the format
of a digital artefact. Therefore, it is possible to form a hypothesis on the influence of
environment for testing.
Hypothesis 5: Environment affects the usage behaviour and learning style of CoPs
As Table 18 shows, these five hypotheses relate closely to the main research objectives listed in
Section 3.3.

5. RESULTS: PHASE 2 (ARTEFACTS AND ENVIRONMENTS)
5.1 Introduction
In Phase 1, individuals from different communities of practice associated with the supply and
end-use of digital artefacts were involved in a scoping exercise designed to find out whether
they were members of a community of practice and, if so, how that might affect their use of
artefacts. Based on data from Phase 1, five hypotheses (listed in Table 19) were defined for
testing in Phase 2. Findings from Phase 1 suggested that, although the CoP model has
limitations, it helpfully illuminates how an individual’s membership of a CoP might affect the
way they use artefacts and the way they learn from them. A key determinant in directing both
processes seemed to be the domain of interest shared by members of a CoP so the first
hypothesis to be tested in Phase 2 was the extent to which domain defines the learning style of
a CoP. Broad patterns were found in the way that all individuals interacted with artefacts in
Phase 1 but there did appear to be differences in usage commensurate with membership of a
particular CoP. The second hypothesis tested in Phase 2 is whether this pattern in generic and
particular forms of artefact use is found again. Content analysis of interaction with artefacts in
Phase 1 and subsequent mapping of usage typologies to Kolb’s Experiential Learning Cycle and
the four learning styles associated with it suggested a connection. The link between usage and
learning styles was tested in the third hypothesis. Analysis of artefact use employing Grounded
Theory as used in Phase 1 was tested further in Phase 2, except behavioural patterns were
based on verbal, non verbal and written records of actual artefact use rather than transcripts of
discussions about use (which was principally the case in Phase 1). Phase 1 also sought to gauge
the influence of the environment on the use of artefacts and there did appear to be differences
in usage behaviour and learning styles among the CoPs who took part. To this end, artefact use

249

by a single CoP (but representing three different disciplines) was tested in four different
controlled environments in Phase 2 (to address Hypothesis 5).

In order to test these hypotheses on use, a strand of the digital supply chain was singled out
involving a specific set of end-users: postgraduate students. Whilst research design in Phase 1
was scoping in nature, involving multiple communities of practice in discussions about the
supply and use of physical and digital artefacts, Phase 2 involved using a single CoP (an
academic community of practice made up of three student groups of end-users)91 and testing
actual use of artefacts in a series of controlled learning environments, two physical and two
digital.

5.2 Findings
Findings from Phase 2 are presented in response to each of the five hypotheses based on
findings from Phase 1.

5.2.1 Hypothesis 1: Domain defines the learning style of a CoP
5.2.1.1 Hypothesis 1: Introduction
In order to test the hypothesis that the domain of a community of practice defines its learning
style, firstly the question of whether individuals are members of a CoP is addressed followed by
analysis of the connection between domain and learning style based on the coding of artefact
use and LSI test results.

5.2.1.2 Hypothesis 1: CoP membership
By virtue of enrolment on a particular course, postgraduate students express an interest in a
common domain of knowledge. The stewarding of knowledge about this domain or discipline is
evidenced by postgraduate students in the writing of an assessed piece of original research.
Other forms of practice are regulated by course tutors via lectures and tutorials and in the
marking of coursework, and to an extent, through interaction with student peers in physical
and virtual environments (for example, online discussion groups). The formation of a
community of learners is driven largely by the composition of a class but the different rhythms
of participation and reification, group and individual work would normally be defined both by
the course tutor and student peers, and by the requirements of a particular course.

Artefacts in Phase 2 were selected deliberately to draw-out domain-specific knowledge and
provide qualitative evidence of membership of a community of practice; patterns of use
certainly revealed knowledge differences between groups. The use of the same artefacts by
both Shakespeare Studies and Digital Cultures students clearly revealed differences in a
posteriori knowledge utilised in the identification, contextualisation, interpretation and
affective use of each artefact. For example, none of the Digital Cultures students were aware of
connections between the figurines used in testing and the original artworks on which they were
based. In contrast, 70% of Shakespeare Studies students referenced these artworks in
Environments C and D (respectively, the Holy Trinity Church bust and the so-called Chandos
portrait of Shakespeare) and 40% knew that the porcelain figurine in Environment A was based
on the Westminster Abbey statue of Shakespeare by Peter Schumaker. One student even
admitted that this was not obvious and ‘I brought Westminster Abbey to it via prior knowledge’

252

(SS10 2013, 2). All Shakespeare Studies students knew of the date and historical context of the
Shakespeare Jubilee in Stratford-upon-Avon (1769) and used this to contextualise and interpret
the mulberry bust of Shakespeare used in Environment B (e.g. SS1 2013, 7), in contrast to
Digital Cultures students who first became aware of the event in reading about it in the
catalogue description for the artefact. Equally, Shakespeare Studies students were able to use
domain-specific knowledge to interrogate the depiction of period costume in Environment A.
One student commented that the figurine’s clothing, ‘doesn't quite look right for Elizabethan
it's more like it 17th or 18th century trying to look Elizabethan’ (SS4 2013, 1), while another
decided that a ‘ruff’ is sufficient evidence of ‘a Renaissance look’ (SS6 2013, 1). One student
twice mentioned the peculiarity of a spelling of Shakespeare’s name with reference to an
inscription on a mulberry bust in Environment B. He noted, ‘the Johnsonian spelling of
Shakespeare without the first 'e'. Shakspeare’ (SS5 2013, 4), which might help date the artefact
since, ‘it might be someone misspelling it in the 18th century and not following Dr Johnson’
(ibid., 5).

Digital Cultures students did not evidence such categorical knowledge but they did reveal
domain-specific knowledge related to the topic of their research degree. For example, Digital
Cultures students were unique in using art historical knowledge to identify and interpret
figurines of Shakespeare as well as drawing on knowledge of the digital humanities. For
example, DC1 described the posture of Shakespeare in terms of classic Greek conventions
(‘contraposto’ (2013, 1) and DC2 stressed his ‘art history background’ which made him wish to
know the ‘function’ of an artefact (DC2 2013, 3). DC4 agreed that the interests of ‘an art
historical person’ in an artefact will be different from ‘someone who's just wandering in to the

253

museum and looking at something first hand’ (DC4 2013, 2). Knowledge from their current
course on Digital Cultures was also based more around techniques for finding out more
information on each artefact online: DC2 would use a ‘reverse image search’ (2013, 4) to trace
metadata on the porcelain figure in Environment A or some other ‘digital tool’ (ibid., 5). DC4
spoke about a ‘digital sphere’ (2013, 11) for tactile interaction with an artefact, while DC1
criticises the unfulfilling use of digital technology in capturing the artefact in Environment A
(2013, 4). All Digital Cultures students repeatedly mentioned the possibilities of 3D technology
in representing artefacts. Therefore, these students evidenced stewardship of knowledge
relating to at least two different domains as they used art historical knowledge to describe and
interpret the artefact, and knowledge of digital technologies to critique each environment and
to find out more about the artefact.

Egyptology students shared the Digital Cultures students’ affinity with a domain and a far
greater use of domain-specific knowledge than any other group. All Egyptology students made
some reference to belonging to a scholarly community of Egyptologists. For instance, one
student spoke about how faïence, the material from which most of the shabtis used in Phase 2
were made, is more recognisable and meaningful to Egyptologists,
Faïence certainly means a lot to me as an Egyptologist but I think other people would
probably be confused as to what faïence is as a material (EG4 2013, 3).
Another student went further, claiming that her technique of trying to date an archaeological
find before thinking about where it was found is ‘just an Egyptology thing’ (EG5 2013, 1) making
a definite connection between identification with a domain and stewardship of domain-specific
knowledge. Although all Egyptology students knew that the artefacts chosen are shabtis and

254

were able to explain what purpose shabtis served in Ancient Egypt, there was an
acknowledgement of sub domains of knowledge within Egyptology. For example, one student
referred to ‘the funerary sphere of Egyptology’ (EG1 2013, 6) and others were more reticent
about translating hieroglyphic text given their degree of expertise in this area. Nevertheless, all
students were able to utilise prior knowledge in identifying, contextualising and interpreting
the shabtis used in testing and were able to express this categorical knowledge using
categorical terms.

Table 20 shows the categorical or ‘insider’ terms used by each student group. In the case of
Egyptology students, many of the terms were period-related (e.g. ‘Third Intermediate Period’)
or associated with specific features of the shabti (e.g. ‘dorsal pillar’). Shakespeare Studies
students also used particular terms to refer to historical periods (e.g. ‘Elizabethan’ or
‘Jacobean’) or to the study of Shakespeare (e.g. ‘bardolatry’) or artefacts associated with him
(e.g. ‘Shakespeareana’). As mentioned above, Digital Cultures students’ stewardship of
knowledge of two domains was reflected in the use of categorical terms such as ‘contraposto’
(DC1 2013, 1), ‘decoding’ (DC3 2013, 6), and ‘megapixel’ (DC4 2013, 1).

These terms are, therefore, signifiers not only for what is intended (the age of the artefact or its
physical description) but, it is proposed, for membership of a particular community of practice
and a particular way of learning from the artefact.

5.2.1.3 Hypothesis 1: Domain and learning style
But how are these forms of practice, which evidence interest in a domain, reflected in the
learning style of each CoP? The learning style of each participant was assessed in two ways: by
using Grounded Theory to encode examples of artefact use of transcripts and video footage of
each test session and, independently, using an LSI test. The results of each form of assessment
are given in Table 21.

Table 21. Student learning styles based on coding and LSI testing in Phase 2

What this shows is that for Shakespeare Studies students there appears to be a preference for
the accommodative learning style. This is more pronounced in the LSI results where 70% of
students seemed to share this way of learning.92 Looking at Digital Cultures students, 75% of
those who took part in testing were convergent learners according to the LSI method of testing,
and 100% of students shared this learning style as calculated from coding of artefact use. For
Egyptology students, the results were more mixed: according to the LSI test 33% of students

92

Extending the LSI test to lecturers at the Shakespeare Institute demonstrated that of the six members of staff
who regularly teach these students, five were also accommodators.

257

are assimilative and another 33% are convergent learners. The remainder were either divergent
or accommodative learners.93

Why might there be variations in some of the sample? A simple answer might be multimembership of several communities of practice or the existence of sub domains. Looking at
the Egyptology sample where there was greatest variation, EG1 and EG4 had recently become
museum curators so this could exert an influence on their learning behaviour, something each
remarked upon during the test session (e.g. EG1 2013, 3). Equally, the sub domains within
Egyptology referred to by student EG5 might help explain the variety of learning styles found
(2013, 1). Indeed, this concurs with a study of learning styles conducted by Kolb among
different practitioners in 1976 which found some variation within professions that are more
specialised, such as in the field of medicine.

But why might domain define learning style? The connection between domain and practice is
key in answering this question. Wenger states that,
The domain inspires members to contribute and participate, guides their learning, and
gives meaning to their actions (Wenger 2002, 28).
The domain directs the attention of members. It enables members to recognise that a piece of
information or a particular problem is valuable to the community at large, and demonstrates an
understanding of a community’s domain and ‘a commitment to a shared learning agenda’
(Wenger 2002, 29), motivates members to participate in problem-solving with other members.

93

Unfortunately it was not possible to obtain LSI scores for lecturers in Digital Cultures and Egyptology but this
would have been a logical extension of the investigation to probe the link between domain and learning style.

258

This sense of communal, trained observation also fits with how Fleck describes thought
collectives’ way of seeing,
It is not possible to see anything definite simply by looking. We need specific mental
readiness to notice new objects or processes, to separate them from attendant
phenomena, to describe them, and to turn them into subjects of collective
investigations (Sady 2001b, 199).
If domain is clearly defined and practice regulated tightly within a community then one would
expect learning - which is a form of improvised practice (Wenger and Lave 2009, 93) - to follow
a particular pattern and for artefact-based learning to follow suit. Kolb tells us that,
When there is a mismatch between the field’s learning norms and the individual’s
learning style, people will either change or leave the field (1984, 88).
In this way, the domain will direct what is important in terms of knowledge stewardship and in
learning, and the dominance of a learning style within a particular ‘field’ will influence the
personal preference of individuals within the CoP. Wenger explains that what, ‘guides the
actual learning of the community is an insider’s view of the domain’ (Wenger 2002, 31) and this
will be expressed in forms of ‘learning-in-practice’ (Wenger and Lave 2009, 56), such as artefact
use. However, since the student groups who took part in Phase 2 work in close physical
proximity and interact on a frequent basis, there is undoubtedly also a strong community
dimension to their CoP. Observational learning theory highlights the way that community can
exert an influence on learning preferences,
individual behaviors can spread across a culture through a process called diffusion
chain. This basically occurs when an individual first learns a behavior by observing
another individual and that individual serves as a model through whom other
individuals learn the behavior, and so on (Schacter and Wegner 2011, 295).

259

Further research which examines disparate communities within the same discipline might help
determine the relative influence of domain and community in affecting the learning style of a
CoP.

5.2.1.4 Hypothesis 1: Conclusion
In testing whether domain defines the learning style of a CoP, data suggests that the three
student groups who took part in Phase 2 are members of a different community of practice
centred on a particular domain or discipline. Moreover, evidence from the coding of artefact
use (discussed in Sections 5.2.2 and 5.2.3) and LSI testing shows that two of the three student
groups have a distinctive and dominant learning style. Although further testing would be
required on a larger sample, results do indicate a connection between interest in a common
domain and preference for a particular learning style.

5.2.2 Hypothesis 2: The way that artefacts are used is broadly similar but there are
differences between CoPs

5.2.2.1 Hypothesis 2: Introduction
Data from Phase 2 shows that although differences exist in the way that student groups
interact with artefacts in different environments, they share many of the same basic traits. This
is evident in the types of use coded across all groups. Similarities in digital artefact use are
examined before differences between student groups in how they interact with artefacts are
highlighted and appraised.

260

5.2.2.2 Hypothesis 2: Similarity in patterns of use
Broad similarities in how all three student groups interact with artefacts were evident from
coding types and incidence rates. For instance, in terms of identifying an artefact, all groups
were interested in its materiality and its classification. Code incidence of ‘material’ and ‘type’
was consistent across all groups suggesting that an artefact’s material composition (whether it
is made of marble or plastic or bronze) and being able to identify an artefact according to
standard typologies (such as ‘sculpture’, ‘bust’, or ‘shabti’) are fundamental aspects of the
process of determining what an artefact is. This curiosity about materiality is consistent with
incidence of the code ‘assessing materials’ in Phase 1 (Appendix E), although the need to
classify an artefact according to ‘type’ only became apparent when recording actual use of
artefacts in Phase 2.

In terms of the contextualisation of the artefact, again there were broad patterns of use shared
by all of those who participated in Phase 2. The original location in which the artefact was used
and when it was originally made and used appeared to be important to all groups in placing the
artefact in a spatial and temporal context. This was apparent from incidence of the codes
‘contextualising original location’ and ‘date’ across all groups in Phase 2. Equally, the
importance of ‘detail’, especially facial features in the case of the figurative artefacts selected
for test sessions, and ‘different views’ (expressing an interest in different opinions and
perspectives) in the contextualisation of the artefact, was demonstrated by all users in Phase 2.

Coding also suggested a degree of consistency across all groups in terms of how they
interpreted artefacts. The importance of metadata in the interpretation of the artefact (code:

261

‘interpreting metadata’), and interests in the authenticity (code: ‘authenticity’), provenance
(code: ‘provenance’), condition (code: ‘condition’) and manufacture (code: ‘manufacture’) of an
artefact were demonstrated by all users regardless of their CoP. There was also a degree of
consensus among all groups on reading information on the artefact itself (code: ‘reading the
artefact’) and passing comment on the aesthetics of an artefact (code: ‘aesthetic judgement’).
With the exception of ‘provenance’, these types of use were all evidenced in Phase 1,
suggesting that these are fundamental aspects of how all individuals interpret the artefact.

There also appeared to be a degree of commonality in users’ affective response to artefacts.
Just as all users showed an interest in the materiality of the artefact, all student groups paid
attention to the size (code: ‘size’), weight (code: ‘weigh’), colour (code: ‘colour’), structure
(code: ‘structure’) and surface (code: ‘surface’) of the artefact, albeit in varying degrees. All
users expressed a wish to view the artefact (code: ‘view artefact’) in different ways and to be
able to rotate it in physical and digital form. Incidence of the code ‘touch’ is remarkably similar
across all CoPs with the exception of use within Environment B. Again, all of these codes except
‘rotate’ and ‘surface’ were evident in Phase 1.

Therefore, although further testing is needed to provide a larger statistical basis for usage
behaviour, there appear to be firm patterns of use shared by all users, regardless of their
community of practice.

262

5.2.2.3 Hypothesis 2: Differences in patterns of use
Despite evidence of a set of core codes for use shared by all individuals, Table 22 shows the
relative incidence of those codes grouped by category of use across all environments. With the
exception of the category of interpretation, Table 22 shows that there are notable differences
between CoPs in the rates of identification, contextualisation and affective use of the artefact.

Table 22. Incidence of use categories among student groups in Phase 294

Digital Cultures students appeared to invest more effort on the identification of the artefact
and far less on contextualisation, and affective use of the artefact, than any of the other
groups. Examining the incidence of codes for use within the process of Identification, Digital
Cultures students associate an artefact with a particular person (code: ‘associate with particular
person’), consider posture (code: ‘posture’) and shape (code: ‘shape’) in the identification of an
artefact, and are more interested in classifying an artefact by type (code: ‘type’) than all of the
other groups. This perhaps reflected this group’s art history training and interest in using form
(explaining an interest in, for example, ‘posture’) and recognised typologies to establish what
an artefact was. Conversely, these students appear less interested in the contextualisation of
an artefact with low incidence of codes such as ‘historic context’, ‘place made’, and ‘part of set’
compared to other groups. Equally, Digital Cultures students’ affective response to artefacts
94

263

was far less pronounced with lower incidence of such codes as ‘expression’ and ‘weigh’,
although a higher incidence of codes associated with looking at different parts of an artefact
were recorded for DC students. This could suggest a lack of interest in, or experience of, forms
of sensory access to artefacts beyond the visual. Finally, although Digital Cultures students
appear to interpret artefacts to the same extent as other CoPs, they have a greater interest in
metadata associated with an artefact compared to Shakespeare Studies and Egyptology
students.

Shakespeare Studies students contextualise to a greater extent than any of the other groups.

This shows that the historical context of an artefact, its age (codes: ’date’, and ‘anachronism’),
and where it was originally manufactured (code: ‘place made’) are more important to
Shakespeare Studies students than the other CoPs. This corresponds with ways that this CoP
interpreted artefacts, for example their interest in period costume (codes: ‘interpreting
clothing’ and ‘interpreting style’) as represented in the figurines of Shakespeare was not found
in any other group. Shakespeare Studies students are also unique in looking for evidence of
95

264

manufacture in identifying an artefact: they are the only CoP who looked specifically for a
maker’s mark (code: ‘maker’s mark’). These students also showed a greater interest in the
rarity (code: ‘unique’) of an artefact, its current location (code: ‘current location’), and its
historic significance (code: ‘historic significance’). This indicated not only an interest in artefacts
related to the legacy of Shakespeare but a trained competence in assessing and using them in
research.

Although Egyptology students demonstrated a similar division of attention paid to the
identification, interpretation and affective use of the artefact as Shakespeare Studies students,
looking at incidence levels of particular codes revealed niche interests and skills in how
Egyptology students interact with artefacts. Looking at three codes which relate to the category
of affective use (Table 24), Egyptology students appeared to be far more interested in the
colour and lighting (code: ‘lighting’) of the artefact, and in its structure than the other CoPs.
One student explained that the style of an artefact, often evident from the colouring and form
of the shabti, is a route towards dating taken by many Egyptologists (EG5 2013, 1).

As shown in Table 25, Egyptology students paid more attention to the original location (where a
shabti was found) and facial features of the shabti in describing and contextualising an artefact.
This is undoubtedly because shabtis can represent the deceased in some way (Mark 2012) so

For Egyptology students, the interpretation of the artefact involved more reading (code:
‘reading the artefact’) and thinking about the original user of the artefact than all of the other
CoPs.98 The much higher incidence of reading behaviour among Egyptology students might be
largely attributable to the nature of the shabti which would normally have hieroglyphs on the
surface (codes: ‘hieroglyphic text’ and ‘hieroglyphic bands’) of the artefact but these features
require knowledge and skills in recognising and decoding hieroglyphic signs, evident in the
incidence of the codes ‘transcribe’ (3.2%), ‘transliterate’ (0.5%), and ‘translate’ (9.2%).

This activity is connected with ‘thinking about the user’ most probably because shabtis were
made or sourced for a particular person and stayed with them in the tomb (James 2005, 122).
Moreover, the hieroglyphic text usually contained information about the deceased (Teeter
1998) so, ‘reading’ the artefact or finding a translation is a vital part of interpreting their
particular meaning. Since the text usually appears on the surface of the shabti, it is important to
see the artefact in the round and this is no doubt responsible for the slightly higher incidence of
the code ‘rotate’ (3.5% compared to 3.2% for SS, and 2% for DC students) and the desire by all

97

In the case of a shabti, the ‘original user’ is the deceased buried with it or rather them since shabtis are almost
always found in groups.

266

Egyptology students to be able to see the artefact in 3D when asked about the representation
of the artefact in an optimal learning environment (Question 3a, Appendix D). The reliance on
surface detail in interpreting the artefact makes condition an important factor for this group as
evidenced in the far higher incidence of the code, ‘interpreting condition’ as shown in Table 26.

Therefore, the distinctive nature of the shabti seems to require specialised ways of learning
from the artefact. However, the dual nature of the shabti (part-figurative, part-textual) and
specialisms within the field of Egyptology means that there are preferences within this CoP in
how artefacts are analysed,
There's a split in the object really and one set of scholars might go for the text the
other scholars might go for the rest of the shabti [...] I'd probably put it 80 or 90%
looking for a chronology first but mightbe there's a few others that would do
something different (EG1 2013, 1).
Indeed, these sub-domain interests might even explain the variety of learning styles among
Egyptology students. Regardless of these differing priorities in this group compared to the other
CoPs, the use of the structure of the shabti and categorical terms (mentioned in section 5.2.3)
by Egyptology students to arrive at a date made responses to Question 1a (Appendix D) on

describing the artefact seem much more standardised and trained compared to the other
CoPs.100

5.2.2.4 Hypothesis 2: Conclusion
Therefore, in testing whether the way that artefacts are used is broadly similar but there are
differences between CoPs, test data shows that, although all three CoPs demonstrate generic
ways of using artefacts, the use of particular knowledge and ways of responding to artefacts is
distinctive to each CoP. All users were interested in the materiality and condition of the
artefact, aspects of its provenance (codes: ‘location’, ‘date’, ‘manufacture’), type and a diversity
of perspectives on the artefact. Since all three CoPs are from the Humanities, these common
interests manifested in similar ways of using the artefact might well be expressions of ‘the
particular configuration of situations and activities and the distinctive human element and
value in those situations and activities’ (Portin 1981, 18). However, data from Phase 2 also
indicated that there are preferences and peculiarities in the way that students from different
disciplines interact with artefacts. Digital Cultures students utilised art historical knowledge and
information literacy skills in trying to identify and interpret artefacts and focused less on its
contextualisation, perhaps because of a lack of knowledge or fewer competencies in placing the
test artefact in a particular context. Shakespeare Studies students focused more on the
historical context of an artefact and utilised prior knowledge of its connection with a particular
artwork and identifying marks on the artefact to describe and interpret Shakespeare-related
artefacts. Although further testing with a larger sample and different disciplines would
100

For example, all Egyptology students mentioned type, structure and condition in describing the artefact in each
learning environment whereas this varied across the other student groups.

268

undoubtedly reveal other patterns in terms of generic and specialised types of use, data
suggests that the main use processes discovered in Phase 1 are also relevant in Phase 2 and
these indicate that some ways of using the artefact are, to a degree, common and predictable.
Other aspects of the usage of digital artefacts are more specific and harder to predict and this
seems to vary according to the skills, interests and experience of communities of practice, and
of individuals, and the nature of the artefact itself.

5.2.3 Hypothesis 3: Usage behaviour and learning styles are linked
5.2.3.1 Hypothesis 3: Introduction
Although evidence was cited in Section 5.2.1 suggesting that each student group was a
community of practice and that there appeared to be a dominant learning style in two of the
three CoPs, to what extent is artefact use connected with learning styles? As pointed out
above, learning styles were calculated in two separate ways to begin to answer this question. In
order to calculate learning style based on the way that participants used artefacts, codes were
generated from transcripts and observational analysis of test sessions, and then grouped in use
categories in a similar way to Phase 1. The incidence of each code was also recorded and this
was used to indicate the preferences of each individual for different types of artefact use.
These use categories were then aligned with a particular learning style according to the
mapping exercise carried out in Phase 1 (see Section 4.3.3).

269

5.2.3.2 Hypothesis 3: Learning style results
The results indicated a connection between individuals’ learning styles and membership of a
CoP, and that environment seemed to influence ways of learning. An average was calculated
across all environments to arrive at a single, ‘dominant’ learning style. Separately, individuals
undertook a learning style inventory test but the results from this test (given in Appendix C)
were not computed until after the coding and mapping exercise was complete so as not to
prejudice the outcome.

Although based on a small sample, the results indicate that there is a link between artefact
usage behaviour and learning style. Table 27 shows that of the ten Shakespeare Studies
students, six results matched. The loss of video data for the test session with Student SS2 might
be responsible for the difference in outcome between the learning style derived from the
coding and mapping exercise and the LSI test in the case of this individual.101

101

This is because most coding from observational analysis was associated with the identification and affection
categories of artefacts which tended to suggest participants were more accommodative or convergent learners.
This might be expected to skew the results of SS2 towards either the accommodative or convergent learning
styles.

Table 27. Learning styles of all students who participated in Phase 2, based on coding of
artefact use and LSI testing

Table 27 also shows that the coding and LSI test results of three out of four Digital Cultures
students match, which is the highest of any of the CoPs. Four out of six of the results calculated
from the two tests also match for Egyptology students. Although not all results tally, and the
process itself requires an averaging across different learning environments, based on this data
there does appear to be a connection between usage behaviour and learning style.

5.2.3.3 Hypothesis 3: Usage behaviour and learning styles
So what might be behind this link? The conceptual link between use types and use categories,
and between use processes and Kolbian learning styles was made in Chapter 3 (Section 3.4.3).
In short, the mapping of use types to learning styles is based on the premise that artefact use is
271

a form of experiential learning and there are patterns between use codes which make up use
categories, and parallels between these use categories and Kolb’s four learning styles. The link
is also based on the forces of acculturation and accentuation which Kolb claims shape, and are
shaped by, learning style preferences. Given this line of logic, the incidence rates for particular
types of use reflect the strength of user preferences in interacting with artefacts and it is this
weight of numbers and the dominance of particular use types which determines the calculation
of learning styles of individuals and CoPs. Kolb stated that, although the process of learning
depends on a combination of all four learning styles, individuals have a preference for either
accommodative, assimilative, convergent or divergent forms of learning. Based on both ways of
assessing learning style, the majority of Shakespeare Studies students are accommodative
learners and the majority of Digital Cultures students are convergent learners.

Looking at the most common types of use associated with the category of affection (aligned
with accommodation) and identification (aligned with convergence) is it possible to rationalise
this connection between ways of using artefacts and ways of learning? According to Kolb,
‘accommodators’ use concrete experience and active experimentation to learn (1984, 23-24).
These learners tend to rely on ‘judgements based on feelings’ and ‘are not primarily interested
in theory; instead they like to treat each case as unique and learn best from specific examples’
(McGill 2013, 2). Moreover, an accommodator’s approach to learning ‘relies heavily on
experimentation’ (ibid., 2). In other words, accommodators are active, hands-on learners who
prefer a learning situation, ‘that encourages independent discovery’ (ibid., 3). But how far is
this reflected in the type of codes for use, and their incidence rates, aligned with this learning
style? Table 28 shows the top ten codes (based on incidence rates) for Shakespeare Studies

272

students and Digital Cultures students in the affection category of use. What is immediately
obvious are the higher values associated with Shakespeare Studies student artefact use: 81.1%
compared to 55.5%.

For eight out of ten of the types of use listed in Table 28, Shakespeare Studies students are
more active. Comparing these results with all use types related to the category ‘affection’
shows that not only are incidence rates far lower among Digital Cultures students (79.8%
compared to 113.8% among Shakespeare Studies students), but the range of different codes is
far narrower (36 codes by Digital Cultures students compared to 50 codes used by Shakespeare
Studies students). This suggests that Shakespeare Studies students show a distinct preference
for interacting with the physical attributes of the artefact (its size, shape, surface, and weight)
and are more actively engaged in finding a variety of ways of doing this. In other words, they
are more interested in investigating the physicality of the artefact and more inclined towards
‘independent discovery’ (McGill 2013, 3) in doing so. For example, based on these figures
Shakespeare Studies students are more likely to wish to weigh an artefact or touch it than
Digital Cultures students.

Table 28. Incidence of ten codes for affective use of the artefact by Digital Cultures and
Shakespeare Studies students, Phase 2 (figures are cumulative percentages across all four test
learning environments )

A number of factors might explain the greater propensity of Shakespeare Studies students to
engage in hands-on, active learning. Compared to Digital Cultures students, the greater use of
artefacts in research by Shakespeare Institute students102 might account for their greater
interest in the physicality of the artefact. Training in artefact use and relative ease of access to
online and physical collections in Stratford-upon-Avon might also help explain the greater
diversity of types of ‘hands-on’ investigation. All students at the Shakespeare Institute engage
in at least some form of performance history, and exposure to dramatic performance is a key
part of the curriculum. This involves ‘learning by doing’ (Healey and Jenkins 2000, 186). The
creation of an MA in Shakespeare and Creativity in 2013 and, beyond the curriculum, the
existence of two groups of players made up largely of students who regularly enact plays by
Shakespeare or other Renaissance writers, might also either help explain a preference for
hands-on, active learning with artefacts or, indeed, might be responsible for encouraging this
way of learning.

Reflected in the Research Skills module which all students enrolled on MA Shakespeare and Theatre and MA
Shakespeare and Education undertake.

274

Turning to Digital Cultures students, both tests indicated that the majority of students are
convergent learners. Those with a convergent learning style share the accommodator’s
preference for active experimentation but are more inclined towards abstract
conceptualisation than concrete learning (Kolb 1984, 77). This means that they are active
learners only insofar as they might, in the case of an object-based learning situation, return to
an artefact to solve a problem or test an idea. Convergent learners are strong problem solvers
and they have a preference for active forms of engagement combined with narrowing down
options through experimentation to arrive at a solution (ibid.). This is why incidence of codes
for use associated with these types of activity grouped within the categories of ‘identification’
and ‘induction’ are higher for these learners. But why should Digital Cultures students show a
stronger preference for identification and induction than Shakespeare Studies students?
Looking at the overall rates of both use categories (identification and induction) shows a clear
difference between the two CoPs: 133.3% for Digital Cultures students compared to 71.2% for
Shakespeare Studies students. Table 29 sets out incidence rates for the top 16 codes for use for
Digital Cultures students, compared to rates for Shakespeare Studies students.

Table 29. Incidence of sixteen codes for identification of the artefact by Digital Cultures and
Shakespeare Studies students, Phase 2 (figures are cumulative percentages across all four test
learning environments )

Since the Digital Cultures module is part of an MA programme in History of Art, this might be
responsible for students’ greater interest in an artefact’s type (classifying an artefact by terms
such as ‘statuette’, ‘bust’ etc), its material composition, and the display context (code: ‘display
case’), all of which are related to the study of Art History or, ‘the fabrication of elaborate
typological orders of ‘specimens’ of artistic activity linked by multiple chains of causality and
influence over time’ (Preziosi 2009, 10). This might also account for an interest in an artefact’s
details reflected in the variety of codes for looking at parts of an artefact, including specific
details such as a ‘book’ and ‘scroll’ held by the Shakespeare figurine in Environment A.
Conversely, lack of knowledge about Shakespeare iconography might be the reason why Digital
Cultures students feel the need to reference William Shakespeare (code: ‘associate with a
particular person’) more to narrow down and identify the artefact. These trained ways of

276

seeing (Alpers 1991) found in the Digital Cultures students sample might explain the dominance
of usage behaviour associated with identification and with the convergent learning style.

5.2.3.4 Hypothesis 3: Conclusion
Results from LSI testing and from coding transcripts and video footage indicate that not only do
student groups share a dominant learning style (behaviourally related to their area of study),
but that preferences in ways of learning can be explained by preferences in ways of using
artefacts. This link has implications for the use of digital artefacts and digital environments in
learning, discussed in Chapter 6.

5.2.4 Hypothesis 4: Grounded Theory can be used to describe and measure artefact usage
5.2.4.1 Hypothesis 4: Introduction
In order to assess the efficacy of a method of describing and measuring artefact usage based on
Grounded Theory, the types and incidence of codes from both research phases are analysed to
gauge how the method adapted to changes in test settings.

5.2.4.2 Hypothesis 4: Use categories and use codes in Phase 1 and 2
A fundamental characteristic of Grounded Theory is that it involves 'the discovery of theory
from data' rather than the 'verification of theory' using data (Glaser and Strauss 1999, 1). Glaser
and Strauss stated that the generation of theory and its verification should go hand in hand. In

277

the process of testing hypotheses in Phase 2, there was a danger that verification would
dominate the process and generation of new insights would be stifled by attempts to confirm
codes and use processes from Phase 1. However, data from Phase 2 suggests that generation
and verification were occurring at the same time because new codes were created, while
others (produced in Phase 1) were found to be relevant again and were reused. This suggests
that the method proved versatile enough to adapt to new circumstances, while corroborating
the validity of generic forms of use discovered in Phase 1.

But how far did Grounded Theory allow for the description of use in Phase 2? Table 30 shows
the expansion and contraction of the number of codes in each use category from Phase 1 to
Phase 2. Overall, the number of codes expanded in the three main use categories discovered in
Phase 1: identification, contextualisation and interpretation. The number of new codes needed
to describe types of use was most marked in identification and interpretation. In terms of
identification, the ability to look in different ways at the artefact (as noted in Section 5.2.3 in
discussions about convergent learners), the specific interests of particular CoPs, or the nature
of the artefact itself (as seen, for example, in the codes ‘transcribe’ and ‘transcription’ by
Egyptology students) might be responsible for the increase in the variety of codes. Looking at
interpretation, again the change in coding can be explained by the particular interests of
different CoPs (for example, the use of the codes ‘interpreting costume’ or ‘literary significance’
by Shakespeare Studies students). There was also a significant increase in the number of codes
for use in the affection category and a reduction in codes relating to curation.

Table 30. Use categories and number of child codes, Phases 1 and 2

The most likely reason for this was the change in emphasis from discussions about use among
those associated with supply of digital artefacts in Phase 1, to controlled testing of individual
end-users actually interacting with artefacts in Phase 2. This meant that issues around
‘curation’ of collections did not feature in Phase 2, while the affordances of the environment
required 106 new codes for use. Data collection also became more precise as individuals could
be asked to clarify any comments made – meaning that codes could describe behaviour more
accurately - whereas the group nature of workshops in Phase 1 made this difficult.
Consequently, codes categorised as ‘location’ and ‘induction’ in Phase 1, became better
qualified and more specialised in Phase 2 and some were re-categorised as a result.103
Therefore, changes to the collection of data, the affordances of the environment, differences in
the knowledge, skills and interests of different CoPs, and the nature of particular artefacts,
could all be responsible for the generation of new codes to describe new forms of use. Despite
these changes, 70 codes were re-used from Phase 1 and overall incidence rates for use
103

For example, ‘finding artefacts’ in Phase 1 became ‘Internet search’, ‘library search’ and ‘reverse image search’
in Phase 2 and, because of the context in which they were used, were mapped to the category of contextualisation
instead of location. Equally, the code ‘photograph’ which appeared in the category of curation in Phase 1 was
reallocated to the category of ‘affection’ in Phase 2 due to a change in the context of use from discussions about
digitisation and control (Phase 1) to capture for research use in test environments (Phase 2).

279

calculated across all CoPs and environments in each Phase are reasonably consistent with the
exception of the category of affection (Table 31).

Table 31. Incidence of use categories across all CoPs in Phases 1 and 2 (figures are cumulative
percentages across all four test learning environments )

The durability of use codes and use categories between Phases 1 and 2 helps to verify the
hypothesis that all users wish to identify, contextualise and interpret artefacts. The
enlargement of the category of affection and the contraction of the other use categories, shows
that using Grounded Theory to describe and measure artefact use remains sensitive to context.
Therefore the technique appears to be capable of both the generation and verification of
theories surrounding artefact use and would be transferrable to other test settings.

5.2.4.3 Hypothesis 4: Methodological problems
However, certain features of the technique remained problematic. Despite adjustments made
between Phase 1 and Phase 2 to control test environments and to take into account
observational data, this method of describing and measuring artefact use remains largely a
language-based technique that depends on the expression of tacit knowledge, skills and
interests through verbal expression. Separating action from intention continued to be difficult

280

even in controlled environments. For example, the code, ‘flicking between images’ is an action
but the intention could be a number of things. Equally deciding on use categories depends on
context and requires the judgement of the encoder to create and refine codes. Data capture
could be improved by using more sophisticated ways of tracking digital use such as eye
tracking, motion sensing equipment, or more sophisticated forms of tracking within the VLE.
Finally, a major factor affecting the feasibility of the technique was data processing and analysis
time; the need to work from a transcription or video footage makes data processing and
analysis is labour-intensive.

5.2.4.4 Hypothesis 4: Conclusion
Despite these drawbacks, the utilisation of Grounded Theory in Phases 1 and 2 to generate
meaningful quantitative data, does indicate that an objective method of analysing artefact use
is possible. Further testing of the method is needed before refinements can be made.

5.2.5 Hypothesis 5: Environment affects the usage behaviour and learning style of CoPs
5.2.5.1 Hypothesis 5: Introduction
In order to test the effect of context on use, four environments (A – D) were set up as outlined
in Table 32 (described in more detail in Section 3.4.3).

The extent to which these environments accommodate or challenge individuals’ learning style
is examined before differences in categories of use in each of the test environments are
considered. Finally, differences between the two digital environments are scrutinised and,
based on data from participants, an optimal learning environment is described.

5.2.5.2 Hypothesis 5: Use categories and environment
Table 33 shows the distribution of usage activity by use category and by environment. This
shows several significant patterns:
Identification of the artefact generally occurs more in physical environments
(Environments C and D) and the online environment (Environment B)
Contextualisation of the artefact occurs more in the VLE (Environment A)
Interpretation of the artefact occurs most in the online learning environment
(Environment B)
Affective use of the artefact occurs most in the VLE (Environment A) and the handling
environment (Environment C)

Table 33. Incidence of use categories in Environments A – D (figures are cumulative
percentages across all four test learning environments )

The environment does appear to be affording or limiting particular ways of learning but, there
is not a straight split between usage behaviour in digital and physical environments and this is
in keeping with the type of environment that most students said would be optimal. However,
the evidence also points to the influence of content (the nature of the artefact and the way it is
presented or represented) on how artefacts are used and learning takes place.

Looking at all learning environments employed in testing, the way that artefacts are used within
them suggests that all four environments appear to facilitate all four learning styles but
particularly accommodative and assimilative ways of learning. Table 34 shows the total
incidence rates for all CoPs within each environment, mapped to learning styles.

Table 34. Learning styles calculated from codes for use in Environments A - D

This demonstrates that the way that individuals use artefacts in Environment A and C indicates
more accommodative learning activity there than any other learning style, while the way that
individuals use artefacts in Environment B and D indicates more assimilative learning activity.
Therefore, these environments appear to be affording particular learning styles, even for those
CoPs for whom accommodation and assimilation are not dominant learning styles (such as,
Digital Cultures students). The possible reasons for this will be discussed below but, it is
important to point out that, although some environments appear to be favouring one way of
learning, each environment is also affording all four learning styles.

Looking at the learning style of each individual and comparing this with usage activity in each of
the test environments does, however, show that the physical environments are the most
versatile in terms of facilitating most individuals’ natural learning style. In the case of
Environment C, 13 users expressed their true learning style in this environment as reflected by
affection-related usage behaviour and 12 users in Environment D (Appendix G). This compares

284

with nine users in Environment B and eight users in Environment A, the least compliant
environment in terms of accommodating an individual’s natural learning style. These findings
have pedagogical implications since both digital and physical learning environments are
supporting a range of learning styles, something discussed in Chapter 6.

Environments A and C are the environments in which most accommodative learning appears to
take place but they also score highly on encouraging artefact use related to assimilative
learning. In terms of use categories, this means that the VLE and the handling environment
seem to facilitate affective use of artefacts more than the other learning environments, but
incidence of the interpretation of artefacts is also high. But why might this be the case?

Looking at the incidence of codes for use within the categories of affection, identification,
contextualisation and interpretation across all CoPs provides some clues as to why the
environment is influencing usage behaviour and, in turn, learning style. In terms of
Environment C, incidence of forms of use associated with sensory interaction with the artefact
are all higher. For example, incidence of the codes ‘pick-up’ (4.8%), ‘touch’ (10.8%), ‘turn upside
down’ (2.4%), ‘weigh’ (5.2%), ‘colour’ (8.1%) are all higher in the handling environment. The
range of codes for use relating to affection is far wider in Environment C compared to other
environments: 42 codes compared to 36 in Environment A, 33 in Environment D, and 31 in
Environment B. This includes some types of use found only in the handling environment. For
example, the ability to knock (code: ‘knock’), shake (code: ‘shake’), count (code: ‘hieroglyphic
bands’), mimic the pose of a shabti (code: ‘mimic pose’, and ‘mimic crook and flail’), and take
the temperature (code: ‘temperature’) of an artefact were only evident in this environment.

285

Therefore, the physical freedom found in direct interaction with the artefact in Environment C
seems to encourage these forms of independent discovery and allows participation in active
learning, two of the key characteristics of the accommodative learning style.

The display case itself (code: ‘display case’, 7.9%) and its physical influence on viewing to
identify artefacts (represented by various codes which reflect looking at different parts of the
artefact) are also responsible for the higher degree of identification activity with the encased
artefact. One student noted the display case’s effect on the isolation of the artefact and
emphasised its distorting effect on viewing the artefact,
It would be nice to take it out of its case it doesn't have to be touched but the actual
box itself is a big distraction because of the lighting you can see it reflecting other
objects in the room and then the corner of the case itself getting a bit of the way (DC4
2013, 9).
Proximity to the artefact aids identification, but the glass acts as a barrier which facilitates and
frustrates sensory access. As Dudley points out, the ‘dominant visual paradigm’ favoured by
museums and apparent here in a mock display environment ‘brings about increased distance
and reduced intimacy’(2009, 9). This form of visual access to the artefact leads undoubtedly to
the encoding of forms of use such as ‘looks at base’ which are either not possible with digital
images or were not detected using this data collection technique. Just as the ‘boxing’ of
information available online within the VLE is found to reduce distractions and aid
interpretation, the display case appears to be intervening in the user’s gaze and making the
identification of the artefact a more involved process in terms of active experimentation. Since
active experimentation is one of the two components of convergent learning, this might explain
why the encased environment favours identification and the convergent learning style.

286

All students appeared to contextualise the artefact within the VLE to a greater extent than in
any other learning environment. For instance, the incidence rates for comparing artefacts
(code: ‘compare’, 2.1%), speaking about artefacts in three dimensions (code: ‘3D’, 2.1%),
examining details of the artefact (code: ‘detail’, 7.9%), and consulting other perspectives (code:
‘different views’, 7.8%) are all higher in the VLE. Again, this is more likely to be because of the
nature of the resources embedded within the VLE than the VLE itself. The artefact chosen for
Environment A was the most intricate in terms of detail and most students seemed frustrated
by the fact that more detail (such as the wording on books and a scroll on a figurine of
Shakespeare in Environment A) could not be seen clearly. This prompted calls for 3D images
and more information from different sources to enable the user to gain more contextual
information on the artefact.

The range of codes for use relating to the category of affection (Table 35) also explains partly
why Environment A appears to facilitate the accommodative learning style. But, why should the
VLE be any different from the online environment in this respect? Although the overall
difference in affective use of artefacts in Environment A and B is reasonably small (85.8% in A
compared to 72.9% in B) Table 35 sets out the incidence of codes which might provide a clue to
any differences in the affordances of each environment.

Table 35. Incidence of eight codes for affective use of the artefact by all students in
Environments A and B (figures are cumulative percentages across all four test learning
environments )

Users were more inclined to manipulate the artefact in the VLE by selecting the image, saving it,
zooming-in, or trying to rotate the artefact than online. They were also more likely to want to
touch or view the artefact in the VLE than online. However, these affordances are more likely to
be attributable to the affordances of the webpage which is embedded in the VLE, rather than
the VLE since these forms of use relate to options associated with the webpage. Therefore, it is
likely that the degree to which Environments A and B facilitate artefact usage related to the
accommodative learning style depends on tools and features found in webpages rather than
affordances associated with the structure of the VLE. This was corroborated by a number of
students from each group who either expressed the opinion that the two environments were
very similar when asked (for example, ‘to my untutored eye, [Environments A and B] were
essentially the same and I wasn't conscious of much difference’ (SS4 2013, 13-14)) or who
confused the two digital environments when questioned about their relative advantages and
disadvantages (e.g. SS3 2013, 3).

Perceptual differences between the online environment and the VLE might account for the
different ways in which artefacts are interpreted within the VLE and online. Although the
288

incidence rate of codes for interpretive use of artefacts are generally higher in Environment B
than in Environment A (98.4% compared to 86%), these differences indicate that information
within the online environment is being treated with more caution than in the VLE. For example,
the higher incidence of codes such as ‘provenance’ (13.7% in Environment B, 4.2% in
Environment A), ‘aesthetic judgement’ (2.8% in Environment B, 2.2% in Environment A),
‘authenticity’ (1.7% in Environment B, 1.0% in Environment A), ‘quality’ (1.2% in Environment B,
1.1% in Environment A) and ‘value’ (3.0% in Environment B, 2.7% in Environment A) in
Environment B reflects a scepticism about the value of images and metadata relating to an
artefact found online compared to those within the VLE. Looking at the context of these codes
shows that students generally questioned the reliability of websites and were more likely to
trust those sites embedded within a VLE simply because they had been put there by a course
tutor (e.g. SS1 2013, 8). Moreover, the ability to contact the tutor via the VLE appears to make a
difference to the use value of artefacts placed there (SS2 2013, 11). This quality was not
confined to the VLE. One student, SS10, noted that a museum blog which was embedded in
Environment A also made the reader feel as if they could trust information contained in an
article and contact the author, unlike in a museum or in an online catalogue,
you could ask that question and start a conversation which is always useful when
you're researching to find somebody else that's working in a similar area (SS10 2013,
6).
This compares to the seemingly ‘rootless’ (SS4 2013, 13) nature of artefact images placed in an
online environment such as Flickr; the ‘anonymous’ (SS1 2013, 8) nature of their creators made
students much less trusting in using them. The importance of the validation of information by
an expert or a respected institution was also found in a study by Tenopir conducted on the
trustworthiness of library information:

289

Respondents report a difference in how they trust information that comes from the
library versus that from the Internet [...] when information comes from the library
almost all (98.2%) believe it is from a credible source. Less than half (45.9 %) reported
using information from the Internet without verifying it’ (Tenopir 2009, 13).
Therefore, the use of artefacts within the VLE appears to be affected by who placed them there
as well as what they are and what the environment affords in terms of tools or barriers. This is
what Heft (2003) refers to as the ‘multidimensionality of affordances’ (154) - the fact that there
are ‘values’ at work beyond the physicality or ‘digitality’ (Parry 2010b, 293) of the environment.

5.2.5.3 Hypothesis 5: Digital learning environments
Another difference between the VLE and the online environment which affects artefact use is
the framing of the on-screen work area. Although it is possible to make the tool bar disappear
in Canvas so that only learning content is visible, no students selected this option. Students
noted that the framing of webpages by Canvas restricted the window in which artefacts could
be viewed and that removing additional scrollbars would make it ‘nicer for comprehension’
(DC2 2013, 8). The reduction in screen size when using Canvas does appear to impact on the
use of artefacts displayed there for some students (e.g. SS9 2013, 7). However, most students
were either not aware of the impingement of Canvas on what they were viewing or welcomed
the ability of the VLE to reduce online ‘distractions’ by providing ‘a space dedicated to study’
(DC2 2013, 8). Indeed, this property of the VLE, and the ability for tutors to direct students to
particular resources within it, are underlined in a Canvas tutorial based on ‘how to post a link to
the outside world, somewhere on the internet’,
these sites can already be pre-selected [by the tutor], deemed as relevant, deemed as
safe, and they can really help guide and focus you for instruction and really can avoid

290

the pitfalls of having your students search and search and search on the internet and
waste a lot of time and be off-task for a while so these links can be very very
informative and intentional and very deliberate for your teaching practices (Kisow
2013).
The inference made in the tutorial is that the internet is dangerous or not ‘safe’ and can waste
time through lack of focus and distractions leading students ‘off-task’. The VLE on the other
hand is safe, intentional, informative, and deliberate.

This focus on resources through trusted direction and the lack of distraction from other
resources might well explain the differences in the degree of interpretation found between
Environments A and B but what about the higher degree of artefact usage related to
convergent learning found in Environments B and D, the online and encased environments?
Rates of activities related to the identification of artefacts are highest in the encased
environment (79.8%) but also score highly in the online environment (71.1%) and in the
handling environment (69.5%). Three codes for use stand out as users attempted to identify
artefacts in the online environment: ‘association with a particular person’ (17.7%), ‘type’
(23.1%), and ‘material’ (22.3%). Looking at the context of these forms of use, the need to
narrow down a figurative artefact’s identity based on who it is based on, its classification
according to type, and its material composition might be higher because the environment is
less trusted than the VLE or less obvious than the physical environments. The bust of
Shakespeare made of mulberry wood and used in Environment B caused most students
difficulty in identifying what it was. Referring to the images alone, most students pointed out
the artefact’s association with Shakespeare or attempted to pin down what it was made of (e.g.
‘bronze’ (DC3 2013, 3), or ‘wood’ (SS10 2013)) or what class of artefact it belonged to (e.g.

291

‘chess piece’ (SS6 2013, 6), or ‘bust’ (DC2 2013, 5)) to try to answer Questions 1a and 1b. This is
especially true of Digital Cultures students who, as noted above, have least a posteriori
knowledge of these artefacts. Another reason for the higher degree of identification in
Environment B could be the option to seek other information online to aid identification. One
participant said that they were, ‘more likely to ‘travel outward’ online than in VLE’ (SS9 2013,
7). Therefore, although the physical affordances of Environment B were similar to Environment
A, the fact that it is accessed online might be influencing the degree of caution shown by
students in identifying the artefact.

5.2.5.4 Hypothesis 5: Optimal learning environments
Although there were some differences between physical and digital environments, the
incidence rates for Environments A – D, and student responses to Question 3a (Appendix D),
suggest that properties from all test environments would be needed in creating an optimal
learning environment for all learning styles. Metadata appears to be much more important in
digital environments than in physical environments; incidence rates for the code ‘thinking
about metadata’ are twice as high in Environments A and B than in Environments C and D. Just
like Phase 1, students were far more likely to notice the condition of a physical artefact (7.9% in
Environment C and 7.5% in Environment D) than a digital artefact (3.7% in Environment A and
2.2% in Environment B) and to contextualise an artefact by considering its ‘original location’
(16.6% in Environment C and 8.6% in Environment D, compared to 8.3% in Environment A and
5.4% in Environment B). Equally, as noted above, users are more likely to express their
individual learning style in physical environments than in digital environments and this could be

292

because of the absence of certain value-based distractions associated with digital artefact use;
for example, questioning the authenticity of the artefact or information associated with it, in
comparison to digital environments. This was summed-up by one student talking about the
advantages of physical access to the artefact, ‘Just the knowledge of what you're looking at is
there and is real, I guess’ (EG3 2013, 7). Another student also made a connection between
direct, physical access and confidence about authenticity, crucial when conducting artefactbased research,
I think even from an authenticating perspective you're able to know that this is the
object you're able to handle it you can feel the connection to it (EG4 2013, 12).
This also corresponds with the findings from Phase 1 which describe the far higher incidence of
the code ‘authenticity’ by distance learning students who had not been given direct access to
physical artefacts. However, the incidence of codes in all four environments (given in Appendix
F) suggests that there are elements within the physical and the digital environments that are
desirable to users, and that blended learning or hybrid environments are more attractive for a
range of learners rather than a straight choice between physical or digital environments. Table
36 sets out a summary of the affordances of each environment considered desirable by
students based on a qualitative analysis of the types of use code in each environment
(Appendix F). Both physical environments allow some forms of tactile and visual access to the
artefact and choice in how this is used. As one student said,
I think I'd like to have access to the physical objects [...] and the ability to do with it
what I want to it in terms of identification just because what I want to do with it would
not be what anybody else would (SS2 2013, 14).
The majority of students mentioned the importance of being in control of artefact use. This was
especially the case in the physical environments but, the enclosure of the artefact in

293

Environment D had an effect. Both environments allowed the user to appreciate instantly the
size and scale of the artefact but the glass barrier also created problems viewing the artefact
and gauging its material composition through weight and temperature (SS2 2013, 11) and
connoted higher status and value of the artefact (SS5 2013, 11). On the other hand, the
uncased artefact removes these barriers to access, ‘Object handling is 100% uninterrupted
unmediated access to the object’ (2013, 9).

Table 36. Affordances of physical and digital environments based on the types of code for use
in test environments

The internet was considered by the majority of students as a better environment for ‘deeper
levels’ (SS2 2013, 14) of contextual information (via links and tags), accessible anytime, more
easily shared (SS8 2013, 14), and more easily referenced than an artefact displayed in a
museum (SS6 2013, 11). Although limited in the test, the ability to zoom to high resolution and
to search quickly and extensively was considered by students to be another advantage of
artefacts presented in the VLE and online. Finally, the digital environment was also considered
to be better than the physical in terms of starting ‘conversations’ (SS10 2013, 6) with others
about an artefact and providing direct access not to the physical item but to expertise about it.

294

All students wished for some sort of hybrid environment which offered a way of ‘Bridging the
two’ (EG4 2013, 12) worlds of the physical and the virtual. This would involve the type of
‘unmediated’ sensory access at the control of the user associated with Environment C
combined with the ability to access different levels of metadata directly from the artefact. The
emphasis was on user control, instant access, and flow between the physical and virtual. Not
only would this provide what most students consider an ideal learning environment but it
would seem to fit with the results of learning style testing. This shows that each environment
supports a range of styles because features of both physical and digital environments suit all
four Kolbian learning styles.

5.2.5.5 Hypothesis 5: Conclusion
In summary, the usage environment does seem to affect the usage behaviour and learning style
of CoPs but distinctions between environments are not as clear-cut as one might expect. Only
perceptual differences seem to affect how users identify, contextualise, interpret and make
affective use of artefacts in a VLE compared to an online environment, although more extensive
testing, probing other tools available within the VLE, and more sophisticated methods of data
collection, would be needed to prove this conclusively. The physical environments provide a
useful basis for comparison, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of handling and display
environments and the relative advantages and disadvantages of digital learning environments
for the use of artefacts. This study also reiterates the importance of the way that an artefact is
digitised and packaged since the nature of content as well as the affordances of the

295

environment seem to exert a strong influence on usage behaviour and ways of learning from
the artefact.

296

6. DISCUSSION
6.1 Introduction: The problem and the approach
Over the past decade, there has been a strong drive to create digital content from cultural
collections and to use digital learning environments to cater for distance and blended learning.
However, there has been little research on how the people and processes associated with the
digital supply chain affect content creation, and on how digital learning environments affect
end-use. In practice, this relates to three principal gaps in previous research categorised in
Section 1.4 as research focus, scope and methods.

Within the context of these gaps, the research presented in this thesis focused on two main
research questions:
a. How are cultural artefacts used in digital learning environments?
b. How can the theory of communities of practice help in understanding the people and
processes involved in the supply and use of digital artefacts?
As outlined in Chapter 3, in order to address these questions, four main aims were identified:
To analyse the influence of the identity, interests, experience and perspective of
producers and users of content on the way they use digital artefacts
To understand the main factors which affect digital artefact usage
To identify the mechanics of digital artefact usage
To analyse the influence of environment on digital artefact usage
These aims were addressed through two phases of study. In Phase 1, individuals from
communities of practice (CoPs) closely involved with the supply and use of digital artefacts in
Higher Education, comprising academics, digital creative professionals, curators, archivists,

297

librarians, theatre professionals, and students, participated in a mock digital supply chain.
Transcripts from interviews and workshops with participants were analysed using Grounded
Theory to look for patterns in how individuals use digital artefacts and what effect membership
of a CoP, and context of use, have on this process. Based on this analysis, five hypotheses were
produced. The testing of these hypotheses formed the basis for Phase 2 of the study which
focused on end-users, a single strand of the digital supply chain (involving postgraduate
students from three different academic disciplines) and four different learning environments.
Transcripts and video footage were analysed using Grounded Theory to test each of the five
hypotheses. Although conducted on a small sample, the main findings reveal significant
patterns in how all individuals interact with digital artefacts and demonstrate the influence of
the special nature of communities of practice on this process.

This chapter reflects on the main findings from both phases and on the process of carrying out
the research. Section 6.2 discusses the results of this research in relation to the four main aims.
This is followed in Section 6.3 by a reflection on the methodologies used to carry out this
research. Section 6.4 explores the relevance of these results to the broader issues outlined in
the situation and literature reviews in Chapter 2. Finally, Section 6.5 provides a summary and
conclusion on the main points from the discussion of findings, methods and implications.

298

6.2 Discussion: Main aims and findings
Results of the research are discussed below in relation to the four main aims, rephrased here as
questions.

6.2.1 What influence does the identity, interests, experience and perspective of producers and
users of content have on the way they use digital artefacts?
Evidence from both research phases suggests that membership of a community of practice
appears to help define the identity, interests, experience and perspective of producers and
users of content, directing their attention to particular ways of interacting with the digital
artefact. As noted in Section 6.2.3, general patterns were detected in the way that all
individuals who took part in both research phases interact with artefacts, described in seven
categories of use.104 However, variations in usage were also found in the dataset which seem to
relate to the identity, interests, experience and perspective of communities of practice that
produce and use content. One possible reason for variations between the way that different
CoPs use artefacts is that the domain of knowledge around which the community is formed
might be directing the perception of members to particular features of the artefact. Another
related reason could be the manifestation of a particular learning style through artefact use.
Most individuals who took part in the research appeared to share a preference for ‘educational
conditions’ (Stewart and Felicetti 1992, 15) under which they are most likely to learn with
members of the same CoP. In other words, ways of using artefacts might mirror ways of
learning within a CoP. These forms of use might also be affected by distinctive ways of tackling
recurring problems among practitioner groups such as the selection, digitisation and packaging
104

The seven categories of use are identification, contextualisation, interpretation, location, curation, induction
and affection.

299

of artefacts and views on accessing, controlling, valuing and utilising digital (and physical)
artefacts by practitioners. These perspectives on the value and use of digital artefacts might
affect interdisciplinary working in the digital supply chain as well as end-use.

6.2.2 What are the main factors affecting digital artefact usage?
Data from both research phases indicate that there are three main factors affecting how digital
artefacts are used:
a. How digital artefacts are created
b. The context in which digital artefacts are used
c. The learning style and perspective of the end-user
The effect of the environment on digital artefact use (b) is considered in Section 6.2.4, and the
influence of the learning style and perspective of producers and users of content on digital
artefact use is discussed in Section 6.2.1 above.

But what about (a), how digital artefacts are created? Research findings from Phase 1 reveal
serious shortcomings in the process of digitisation and cataloguing which affect the end-use of
digital artefacts. Even when end-users specified what was wanted this was not delivered, both
in terms of capture (visual and other sensory information) and metadata. The requirements of
end-users were translated by digitisation specialists into digital artefacts that did not meet
expectations. This suggests that those who direct or carry out digitisation play a fundamental
role in determining the use potential of digital artefacts. To counteract the seemingly innate
partiality of digitisation and cataloguing, plurality, transparency and diversity would seem to be

300

important in making the creation of digital artefacts more relevant and the products more
usable. As the digital supply chain becomes more complex with more user-generated content
available online, knowing the fundamentals of artefact use (explained in Section 6.2.3) and
being aware of the partiality of production could provide museums, libraries and archives with
the upper hand in the battle for sustainability. This is discussed at more length in Section 6.4.3.

6.2.3 What are the mechanics of digital artefact usage?
Findings from Phase 1 and 2 expose the mechanics of digital artefact use for the first time and
they highlight that more research is needed in this area. Employing a predominantly
quantitative methodology to describe and measure usage of digital artefacts suggests that this
activity is, to a degree, generic and predictable; users will want to identify, contextualise,
interpret and make affective use of digital artefacts in the same way as they do physical
artefacts. However, digitisation (and usage in digital environments) tends to make identification
more difficult and certain aspects of contextualisation and interpretation easier. Other types of
artefact usage are more specific and harder to predict and this seems to vary according to the
skills, interests and experience of communities of practice, the aptitudes and interests of
individuals, and the affordances of the environment in which interaction takes place. Although
this was a small scale study, the data suggests that, while the use of artefacts in digital learning
environments is not wholly objective and predictable, it is not hopelessly subjective and
unpredictable.

301

6.2.4 What influence does the environment have on digital artefact usage?
The findings from both phases of research suggest the importance of environment in
influencing usage behaviour. Data indicates that object-based learning is facilitated by all
physical and digital environments tested in Phase 2, drawing attention to the strengths and
weaknesses of each environment for users with different learning styles. Interestingly, this is
not split along the lines of physical versus digital - all users tended to prefer specific aspects of
both physical and digital environments, something that is supported by quantitative and
qualitative data.

This research also suggests that content is key in encouraging particular types of artefact use.
Within each digital learning environment tested in Phase 2, local affordances associated with,
for example, artefacts found on a website or a catalogue page embedded within a VLE, seem to
be as important as the tools and layout of the virtual environment. In fact, the main differences
found between artefact use in the VLE and in the other online environments tested were
attributable to content (either the nature of the artefact or the way it has been packaged in
digital form) or the selection of that content for use. This perceptual difference between
proprietary learning environments and online environments reaffirms the importance of
universities’ role as guides through abundance and underlines the importance of digital literacy
and visual literacy, the ‘reading’ of images (Avgerinou and Ericson 1997), in assisting students in
the use value of digital artefacts found inside and outside the institutional VLE.

302

6.2.5 Summary discussion: Aims and results
This research suggests that there are three main factors which affect the use of digital
artefacts: the identity, interests, skills and experience of those involved in the digital supply
chain, the processes involved in producing digital artefacts, and the environments in which they
are used. The way that individuals interact with artefacts appears to be directed by domains of
interest and learning styles within a CoP. These usage styles and learning styles are either
afforded or limited by the context of use. The findings show that digital and physical
environments have strengths and weaknesses in terms of their ability to support different
usage and learning styles, and that the differences in artefact use in two types of digital
learning environment were largely perceptual. The discovery of factors influencing artefact use
was made possible by content analysis of research data based on Grounded Theory. This form
of analysis also found generic and specific patterns of digital artefact use which suggest that
artefact usage is neither wholly subjective nor wholly objective. This means that it is possible to
quantify and compare how individuals interact with artefacts and to demonstrate that certain
aspects of interaction are predictable. This enables research on artefact use to go further than
idiographic analyses (described in Section 2.3.5.4) have previously allowed.

6.3 Discussion: Methodological approach used
Research in this thesis draws on three main theories: Wenger’s theory of communities of
practice, Glaser and Strauss’s Grounded Theory, and Kolb’s Experiential Learning Theory. The
following sections (6.3.1 – 6.3.3) look at how successful the use of these theories has been
before providing recommendations for future work (Section 6.3.4). Finally, the overall research
approach adopted is discussed in Section 6.3.5.

303

6.3.1 The application of Wenger’s CoP model
Based on its application in this thesis, Wenger’s theory of communities of practice illuminates
helpfully patterns of behaviour which might otherwise go unobserved. It provides a theoretical
lens through which to examine the complexity of the digital supply chain and the nature of an
individual’s interaction with a digital artefact. It allows the effect of social learning within
special interest groups to be assessed compared to the actions of the individual operating
outside these groups. Its emphasis on shared practice also permits patterns in the usage of
artefacts to be explained and, conversely, for behaviour with artefacts to be interpreted as
forms of learning cultivated with the CoP.

However, there were several issues with Wenger’s theory which proved problematic when
applied to the question of digital artefact use. In recruiting individuals for each phase,
assumptions were made about CoP membership which overlooked the fact that individuals
might not subscribe to a particular community or, even if they do, that this has an appreciable
effect on their attitudes and behaviour. Although the profiling interviews conducted in Phase 1
attempted to verify membership of a CoP, this proved difficult, especially given the possibility
of multi-membership of different CoPs. Although Wenger attempted to develop CoP theory to
account for a ‘digital age’ (Parry 2010c), his description of communities of practice does not
account for all manifestations of practitioner behaviour in Phases 1 and 2 and other theories
such as ‘networks of practice’ (Brown and Duguid 2001, 205) and ‘thought collectives’ (Sady
2001a) better explain participant attitudes and behaviour. Indeed, Wenger’s theory might even
be considered a distraction to studying the issue of patterning in artefact usage, placing too
much emphasis on formal structures and the effect they might have. Additionally, the absence

304

of theory around CoPs and language as a shared ‘protocol’ (Wenger, White et al.. 2005, 7)
makes linguistic analysis to prove CoP membership problematic.

Despite these ontological and phenomenological issues, CoPs provide a cogent, well developed
theoretical perspective with which to tackle a complex problem. The application of Wenger’s
theory to a wide range of practitioner settings demonstrates its versatility but might also
explain why it does not account for every manifestation of behaviour. As such, it ought to be
regarded as one of a number of ways of exposing linkages between who is using artefacts and
how this is done. However, its use in this thesis highlights patterns in behaviour which might
otherwise go unnoticed and, as such, shows that other forms of investigation into artefact use
are possible.

6.3.2 The application of Grounded Theory
As discussed in Section 5.2.4, the use of Grounded Theory in the analysis of data from both
research phases produced meaningful results which suggest that, although improvements
could be made to the technique of coding forms of use, the method is sensitive to context,
flexible and transferrable to other usage scenarios. Reasons were given in Section 3.2.5 for the
choice of Grounded Theory which included its versatility (being able to conceptualise both
linguistic and visual data) and the degree of openness or neutrality which suited both the
scoping nature of Phase 1 and the testing of hypotheses in Phase 2. The application of
Grounded Theory in both research phases proved its worth in generating and verifying theory
easily and effectively, and to enable comparison of data from two separate datasets.

305

However, there remains significant blind spots in employing Grounded Theory to describe and
measure digital artefact use. Although observational data was coded in Phase 2, the technique
still relies on verbal expression as a signifier for knowledge, perspectives and learning
preferences. Although language was conceptually linked to Wenger’s CoP theory through
reification and practice (see Section 3.5.2), it is debatable whether words always reflect
preconceived thought. Among other voices in the field of hermeneutics, Georg Christoph
Lichtenberg observed that, ‘one draws from the well of language many a thought one does not
have’ (as quoted in Bennett 1997, 539). In other words, what was said by participants during
both phases of research might not actually be as strategic and deliberate as one might think.
Language and intention are not always the same. The ambiguity of language is therefore an
issue when coding artefact use from textual records or interpreting it from video footage. 105 So
too the extent to which the tacit knowledge of practitioners is being fully externalised in test
environments, and the ability to collect usable data (such as information derived from eye
tracking) other than language. Another issue with Grounded Theory is the legitimacy of the
coding process (discussed in Section 3.5.9) and the time-consuming nature of data analysis
associated with this technique.

105

Equally, the conceptual framing and analysis of data using linguistic labels may be misleading. For instance,
terms used to investigate artefact use such as ‘digital supply chain’, ‘digital artefact’, and ‘market’, although
defined earlier in the thesis may, in attempting to simplify the question, bias the methodology and the conclusions
drawn. For example, the words ‘market’ and ‘chain’ to describe the context and mechanisms in which ‘digital
artefacts’ are ‘produced’ assumes a coherent, integrated view of how digital content is created which is not only
loaded with formalist economic theory but may actually bear little resemblance to how digital artefacts are
actually created.

306

However, despite these issues, Grounded Theory proved that for the first time it is possible to
extract quantitative data from artefact use. This helps to shed light on the influence of social
context, environment, and the inner workings of artefact use itself. In the absence of theories
on artefact use, content analysis utilising Grounded Theory proved an important mechanism for
generating new insights into how individuals interact with artefacts. It has demonstrated that,
although refinements are needed, a Grounded Theory-based method is transferrable to other
scenarios, whether looking at artefact use (physical and digital) or, more generally, the use of
any other type of learning content.

6.3.3 The application of Kolb’s Experiential Learning Theory
Although Kolb’s theory on learning from direct experience complements Wenger’s theories on
how communities of practice steward knowledge, and helps to explain broad patterns in how
members of a CoP engage with digital artefacts, a few precautionary points are needed on
learning styles and their relationship with artefact use.

The theory of learning styles has been widely criticised for lacking validity (Riding and Rayner
1998, 78) and for the multiplicity of definitions used (Gardner 1996, 585). This variety in the
interpretation of the ‘construct’ (Koob and Funk 2011, 304) has led to multifarious use of
learning styles which in turn has resulted in allegations that the theory is ‘fuzzy’ (Verheij,
Stoutjesdijk et al.. 1996) by meaning different things to different scholars. Moreover, proper
detection of learning styles via direct observation has also been dismissed by some scholars
who claim that the construct deals with hidden processes that occur inside the brain meaning

307

learning styles can only be inferred not proved (Browne 1986). Abstracting meaning from how
individuals use artefacts and then linking this with another form of abstraction leads to
circularity in the relationship between artefact use processes and learning styles and does raise
questions on validity. If artefact use reflects learning style, and learning style influences artefact
use, both might be accused of propping the other up in an attempt to understand patterns in
experiential learning. In this sense, the discovery of a possible link between learning and use
styles raises more questions than answers. For instance, are producers of digital content more
likely to create digital artefacts that suit their usage and learning styles? Also, are learning styles
conceptually capable of explaining the variation in use styles across different environments?
Therefore, the possible connection between learning styles, communities of practice, and the
way artefacts are used, although promising, should be treated with caution especially given the
exploratory nature and scale of this research.

Nevertheless, Kolb’s Experiential Learning Theory provides a way of conceptualising and
categorising the great variety of types of artefact use and explaining differences between
individuals based on learning preferences. It provides a well-defined structure against which to
map codes for use generated using Grounded Theory. Its ability to accommodate and explain
both the social learning theory of Wenger (learning through participation and practice) and the
phenomenon of artefact-based learning (usage both as a form of reification and as a
transformation of experience) makes Kolb’s theory a vital theoretical tool in understanding the
two main research questions on cultural artefact use and the influence of communities of
practice.

308

6.3.4 Recommendations for future studies
This research has added significantly to our understanding of the use of digital artefacts and has
highlighted a variety of directions for further study. Bearing in mind the points made above
about the use of three theoretical frameworks, and the experience of carrying out the research,
several recommendations might be made about conducting future studies based around the
gaps identified in previous research: focus, scope and methods.

In terms of focus and scope, research designed to include a larger sample and in vivo testing
(following a live project) might help offset the choices made in setting up a mock digital supply
chain in Phase 1. Focusing less on establishing membership of a CoP and more on how decisions
made by individuals are invested in artefacts and environments would also be aided by this
form of testing. Narrowing the research focus to look at the precise nature of identification,
contextualisation, and interpretation of the digital artefact would also help to provide more
depth on types of artefact engagement, as well as broadening testing to include different types
of digital environment and different types of end-user to scope any other patterns in artefact
use, or nuances thereof, which might have been missing from the research carried out.

In terms of methods, trialling other types of data collection and making adjustments to data
analysis would be advisable. Methods of data collection used in Phases 1 and 2 were focused
mainly on audio and video recordings; improvements could certainly be made to the dataset by
using more sophisticated equipment to capture other aspects of user behaviour (such as eye
movement and motion sensing which would provide additional datasets) and to externalise
user preferences. In terms of the analysis of data, this proved laborious and time-consuming

309

and subject to researcher bias as codes were generated from data and categories formed. The
act of code creation is interpretive and, although the constant comparative method is designed
to reduce the degree of partiality, coding large datasets can lead to lock-in as the same codes
are recycled to describe behaviours in different contexts. Sampling transcript text before coding
and extending the practice of independent coding would make the process more manageable
and more rigorous.

6.3.5 Being objective?
This thesis adopted a positivist, behaviourist methodological approach and pragmatic
worldview in order to address fundamental gaps in our understanding of how we engage with
cultural artefacts in digital form. In doing so it attempted to analyse the phenomenon of
artefact use in a more objective way than had been the case in the majority of previous studies.
It was argued in Section 2.3.5.4 that a principle reason for the lack of research on artefact use is
because of the domination of idiographic methodological approaches in the Humanities and
their use in cultural contexts might reflect the social exclusivity of museums, libraries and
archives and insecurities among those who work in them.

The theoretical frameworks chosen to align with this methodological approach were all
essentially nomothetic in character. Wenger’s theory of communities of practice attempts to
explain individual behaviour within the context of practitioner groups. Glaser and Strauss’s
Grounded Theory involves the abstraction of meaning to find patterns within a dataset. Kolb’s
Experiential Learning Theory describes learning in terms of fixed modalities and categorises

310

learners according to the relative strength of learning preferences. All of these theories attempt
to find order in disorder, and help to analyse a complex problem previously tackled using a
largely idiographic, subjective approach and qualitative methods.

But exactly how objective was this approach? It could be argued that Wenger’s CoP theory pays
as much attention to subjectivity than it does to objectivity in terms of practice-based learning,
since it focuses both on social interaction (objective participation) and individual action
(subjective reification106). Grounded Theory requires subjectivity in the generation of new
codes from data as analysts creatively interpret the words or actions of others. Continuing this
emphasis on the subjective, Experiential Learning Theory is based on the learning preferences
of the individual rather than the group. Equally, moving between these three theories in the
analysis of data has required a degree of interpretation, for instance in the mapping of
categories of use to Kolb’s learning styles or the equating of code incidences to communities of
practice.

However, although each of these three theories involves a degree of subjectivity in how they
are applied, the emphasis overall is on rationalising phenomena and making it more objectively
understood. The theories chosen share a tendency towards grouping: studying the effects of
collectivity through membership of a community of practice, the formation of categories from
codes using Grounded Theory, and the classification of only four types of learner by Kolb.
Although Grounded Theory allowed for the generation of codes, this did not remain a
subjective process; use of the constant comparative method and, crucially, the collation of
106

According to Lave, learning ‘is neither wholly subjective nor fully encompassed in social interaction’ (1991, 64).

311

incidence rates provided units of measurement for both the process of artefact use and factors
which affect it. Above all, it is the formation of numerical data from words and actions that
facilitates the nomothetic study of artefact use and overcomes barriers to researching a
phenomenon previously considered wholly subjective in the sense that it is entirely partial and
unknowable (see Section 2.3.5.4). In this respect, this research, whilst not wholly objective in its
application is nomothetic in its approach. Ratner (2002) makes the point that objectivity and
subjectivity can be complementary,
Objectivism integrates subjectivity and objectivity because it argues that objective
knowledge requires active, sophisticated subjective processes—such as perception,
analytical reasoning, synthetic reasoning, logical deduction, and the distinction of
essences from appearances. Conversely, subjective processes can enhance objective
comprehension of the world.
Therefore, the approach taken and methods used in this research fit within the scope of
objectivism in that they incline more towards the ‘knowability’ of artefact use (using objective
processes) than the ‘unknowability’ of artefact use (using subjective processes).

6.4 Discussion: Wider implications
6.4.1 Wider implications: Introduction
In Chapter 2, the relevance of the main research questions to the cultural and HE sectors was
explored in a situation review, and published research on digital artefact use and the influence
of communities of practice was surveyed and critiqued. Sections 6.4.2 – 6.4.4 revisit the
situation and literature reviews and look at the implications of the main research findings for
the cultural and HE sectors. These sections situate the findings in the research corpus in
relation to three of the four areas examined in the literature review: the digital supply chain,

312

basic processes of use, and the environment. The fourth area of the literature review, which
focused on research methods, is addressed in Section 6.3.

6.4.2 Wider implications: Digital supply chain
The research findings have implications for the products, processes and people involved in the
digital supply chain, discussed here in turn.

6.4.2.1 Digital supply chain: Products
This research has underlined the importance of the use value of digital artefacts to the enduser. Although more digital content was welcomed by those who took part in Phase 1, in
particular by academic users, end-users were generally dissatisfied with the products of
digitisation and cataloguing produced in Phase 1. Jones et al. (1999) suggest that multiple
voices and different user interfaces in the museum, library, or archive record are a way of
making digital seem more ‘authentic’ (ibid.). They observed that, ‘the more information the
system provides about an item, the more they will trust it’ (ibid.) and this is supported by
qualitative data in Phase 1. However, data suggests that the supply of usable ‘products’ could
be improved by diversifying forms of capture, and by embedding technical metadata which
contextualises capture to allow the use value of artefacts to be evaluated by end-users.107 An
acknowledgement of the degree of interpretation involved in digitisation and the need for
transparency connects with the work of Tenopir (2009) on decision-making in the digital supply
chain and chimes with what has been proposed by JISC in their eContent strategy (2011) which

107

Technical metadata related to capture might include details of who digitised or catalogued an artefact, when
this was done, when it was done, which equipment was used, and so on.

313

calls for clear parameters and standards in the creation of digital content from cultural
collections. The underlying principle is that mechanisms for assessing the value of information
should rest with the researcher not the institution.

This research also indicated the importance of content creation and curation outside the
cultural sector. The ubiquitous nature of user-generated content and its use by students means
that, as digital learning environments become larger and more open (for instance with the
growth in popularity of the use of MOOCs), the role of course tutors as directors to suitable
content, and the cultural sector as content facilitators, becomes more important. The
importance of quality in content also represents an opportunity for the cultural and HE sectors
to collaborate on content creation and curation. Examples of universities and cultural
institutions teaming up to tailor unique content for end-users are becoming more common, for
example the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust and the University of Warwick’s recent partnership
to create a MOOC, ‘Shakespeare and his World’ (University of Warwick 2013), and the
collaboration between the Shakespeare Institute and the Cadbury Research Library (both part
of the University of Birmingham) to create the MOOC, ‘Shakespeare’s Hamlet: Text,
Performance and Culture’ (University of Birmingham 2014). Since the research findings endorse
the importance of creation and curation of content to end-users, this type of initiative would
seem to be more likely to deliver products which end-users trust.

However, these findings also endorse moves to integrate VLEs with institutional repositories,
mentioned in Chapter 2. Although in Phase 1 there were clear differences between
practitioners in the use value and control of digital artefacts, and all academic and student

314

users welcomed a greater variety of user-generated content, the value of content selection and
curation by universities to end-users was evident in Phase 2. The perceptual differences in the
use value of content between the VLE and the wider internet (Environments A and B) suggests
that greater integration of institutional repositories with VLEs and MOOCs would strengthen
the position of universities and give end-users what they want. These findings support the
direction already adopted by some academic libraries (Kay 2012).108

6.4.2.2 Digital supply chain: Processes
Research findings suggest that adjustments to the way that digital artefacts are made would
benefit end-users. Given the research findings relating to artefact use and learning styles, the
process of capturing information (images and metadata) from the artefact needs to take
account of the widest range of learning styles possible. This could either be done by getting
end-users involved in the co-creation of content as a ‘produser’ (Bruns 2007, 2), either through
consultation in the selection and digitisation of content, by encouraging the production of usergenerated images or metadata, or by building end-user control into the products of digitisation
(such as through 3D imaging or RTI scanning which allow a degree of choice in viewing
artefacts). By making digitisation more user-driven, creating and sustaining digital artefacts
should become more efficient and sustainable because it should then respond ‘to actual rather
than theoretical demand’(JISC 2005). Diversifying forms of capture to cater for the widest range
108

Chumbe et al. (2007) note that, ‘Various studies have reported that achieving effective use of increasingly
heterogeneous scholarly objects within institutional learning and teaching frameworks is becoming critical to the
performance of educational institutions. The integration of digital information environments, such as a University
library, within a virtual learning environment (VLE) encapsulates this challenge’.

315

of interests and learning styles among end-users, and to counter-act the tendency of
digitisation to prioritise visual information (Dudley 2009, 8) would also help make content
accessible and usable for those with sensory impairments. The use categories discovered in
Phases 1 and 2 could help frame such diversity by guiding capture with a view to likely future
use.

6.4.2.3 Digital supply chain: People
The research findings indicate that, if communities of practice have strengths and weaknesses
in how they learn, knowledge of this could help improve interdisciplinary working between
different practitioner groups involved in the supply of digital artefacts. Kolb states that a
balance of all four learning styles is needed in order to provide optimal conditions for creativity
and learning (Kolb 1984, 203). Therefore, a mix of skills and learning styles would be most
desirable in the creation of digital artefacts. This could involve end-users as well as different
CoPs, such as those involved in Phase 1, and accords with much of the literature on user-centric
or participatory design (e.g. Kodama 1995) and moves by funding bodies such as JISC to involve
end-users in co-design (JISC 2013a). Rather than dissolving disparities between CoPs,
acknowledging that interdisciplinary boundaries necessarily involve differences and
dependences (Carlile 2002) is more likely to produce better resources (AHRC and CBR 2011).
Acknowledging differentiation in the skills, backgrounds and attitudes between sectors and
building on dependences (such as physical access, metadata creation and knowledge of endusers) is more likely to achieve innovation on joint projects.

316

From profiling interviews it was apparent that learning about the use of digital technologies in
the cultural sector happens on the job. Therefore, treating collaboration as a learning event and
working at boundaries (which is where innovation is most likely to take place (Tuomi 2002, 4))
is most likely to provide a mix of learning styles and opportunities for CoPs to stretch
themselves and even adjust their habitual learning style as they become acculturated within
temporary CoPs which might form around projects. If artefacts are regarded as ‘boundary
objects’ (Star 1989), articles that help mediate differences between CoPs, then they could
catalyse and accelerate this process of adjustment through learning,
Learning transforms our identities: it transforms our ability to participate in the world
by changing all at once who we are, our practices, and our communities (Wenger 1998,
226).
Encouraging CoPs to be self-aware about how they learn could be a useful part of the learning
process. Speaking about cognitive styles, Riding and Rayner stress the value of awareness of
differences in ‘styles’ in their general sense,
The significance of an awareness of style is its potential for enhancing and improving
human performance in a variety of contexts (1998, 5).
The idea that practitioners might be more confident and adept in an area which suits their
learning style is an attractive one but an awareness of stylistic weaknesses might also help to
counteract some of the entrenched practitioner perspectives evidenced in Phase 1 (see Section
4.6). Equally, acknowledging that one’s learning style might be embedded in a product such as
a digital artefact and might consequently restrict end-use might also be a useful outcome of
conducting further research into the connection between CoPs and learning styles.

317

Much has been written on the advantages and disadvantages of applying learning style theory
to teaching (e.g. Dunn, Griggs et al.. 2000) and specifically in digital learning environments (e.g.
Kanninen 2009). In the same way that raising awareness of one’s preferences in learning could
be beneficial for practitioner groups, the LSI test is widely believed to be an aid to metalearning, i.e. learning-to-learn. In other words, learning styles should be regarded as a
descriptive rather than a predictive tool to reflect on one’s preferences rather than suggesting
how learning should take place. Knowing that CoPs have distinct learning styles should not
automatically mean that resources are tailored to focus on one dominant learning style, the socalled ‘meshing hypothesis’ (Pashler, McDaniel et al.. 2008). Research has shown that
stereotyping learners in this way might be counter-productive and tending towards multimodality, by catering for different learning styles through a range of learning opportunities,
might be more productive (Massa and Mighter 2006-334). For example, digitising an artefact in
a variety of different ways and making this available in different formats and different
environments is not only likely to appeal to a wider audience (a key aim of OERs), but is
considered a more efficacious way of encouraging learners to become more versatile in
adopting learning strategies outside their comfort zone (Pask 1998, 96).

Finally, although not conclusive, the learning style of a CoP does seem to be determined to a
large extent by the domain of interest around which the community is formed. Differences in
how artefacts are used and patterns in LSI test results both indicate that a student’s discipline
plays an influential role in directing knowledge stewardship and learning style. The dominance
of domain has implications for the HE sector. As the number of core subjects which the
government recommends is reduced (Garner 2014), if domain does determine learning style

318

then this could mean that the breadth of learning styles is correspondingly narrowed. The
implications for non academic fields are less clear. Although in Phase 1 heritage practitioners
appeared to be the most sure of their ‘professionalism’ and sense of identity in interviews and
workshops, the learning style test results show that this is not reflected in a dominant learning
style even among sub domains (museum, libraries, and archives). Indeed, this variation could
be behind the sense of professional unease among curators and librarians described in Chapter
2. Perhaps an acknowledgement of the diversity among members of these professions should
instead be regarded as a strength in appealing to a wide range of end-users. However,
discovering that performers in Phase 1 shared the same learning style (accommodation) as the
majority of Shakespeare Studies lecturers and students, demonstrates a strong link between
domain and ‘learning by doing’ (Healey and Jenkins 2000, 186) and might be useful in
developing pedagogies for distance learning and face-to-face teaching within Shakespeare
Studies and beyond.

6.4.3 Wider implications: Basic processes of use
There are certain themes or principles which emerge from the usage data that are potentially
helpful when creating artefacts or packaging them for use. The discovery that some ways of
using artefacts are shared by all users is good news for the creation of content suited to a
general audience. For example, universities have been encouraged to create more Open
Educational Resources (OERs) to widen access to Higher Education and the fact that all users
seem to engage with material in the same basic ways is helpful when creating content and
evaluating uptake and use in the knowledge that it will be of use beyond the university campus.

319

To the same extent, museums, libraries and archives that create collections content for access
and use online might also benefit from knowledge of a basic taxonomy of use to cater for a mix
of academic end-users. The main use categories identified in this research could act as a
framework for the preparation of content. For example, those responsible for the delivery of
digital artefacts could ask themselves how end-users might identify, contextualise, interpret
and make affective use of content which might influence choices made in the production and
presentation of resources. In the cultural sector, categories of use could be used as a checklist
for improving the efficacy of content. For instance, the identification of material could be
promoted through tagging or more diverse and sensorily-engaging forms of digital capture. The
contextualisation of artefacts could be facilitated through the provision of online tools to
compare artefacts, to create links, and encourage ‘flow’ (Nakamura and Csikszentmihalyi 2002)
between VLEs and other online learning environments, while the interpretation of artefacts
could be aided by providing space within the record for meaning-making and sharing.

Equally, knowing that some types of artefact use are specific to particular user groups is also
helpful. For example, knowing that those with an interest in theatre studies are more likely to
be accommodative learners, resources could be tailored either to cater for their learning
strengths or to stretch users with different opportunities to engage with artefacts depending
on the pedagogical imperative (see Section 6.4 for a discussion on learning styles). If actors
have a kinaesthetic learning style then providing opportunities for hands-on access to theatre
archives, for example, might be more effective than simply online forms of access and use.
Knowing that Egyptologists have niche interests in the artefact – for example, they appear to be
more interested in the colour, lighting and structure of artefacts than the other two student

320

samples – could inform the digitisation of the artefact by emphasising these qualities during
capture or providing forms of capture which allow end-users to vary colour, lighting, and
manipulate the artefact in three dimensions.

Although much more research and development is needed, having an elemental understanding
of how users interact with the digital artefact should also help with the development of ways of
evaluating artefact-based learning. On the back of this research, metrics could be developed
not only to assist in the creation of digital content, but to build lessons and to measure the
impact of object-centred learning, the ‘Holy Grail’ of museum education (Rice and Yenawine
2002, 289). For example, types and rates of interaction with particular aspects of an artefact
could be assessed before and after other forms of teaching to assess whether or not exposure
to artefacts (in digital or physical form) has improved understanding of a topic. The corollary of
this is also possible; ways of reading artefacts could also be used as a way of gauging the
efficacy of lectures and tutorials by highlighting the impact of these sessions on interest in the
artefact. In the cultural sector, using metrics to quantify the value of engagement with digital
artefacts, long considered marketing lost-leaders (Kelly 2013, 5) within the sector, could justify
investment in the improvement of online collections access. Incorporating better tracking
systems (developed from categories of use) in websites and VLEs and conducting direct
observation trials of content could help in quantifying the value of digital artefact use. Knowing
how artefacts are used could also help the cultural sector co-create value with end-users and
provide tangible ways of returning investment by facilitating forms of use grounded in
experience. Generating quantitative data on end-use should also help both sectors provide the
sort of statistical evidence of use required by funding bodies such as JISC to prove that projects

321

respond to ‘actual rather than theoretical demand’ (JISC 2005). In other words, identifying
categories of use should give the cultural and HE sector more confidence in working with a
wider range of end-users.

This research contributes to a small body of work which has looked at how artefacts are used.
As mentioned in Chapter 2, Seadle’s (2000) use of cultural anthropological methods to analyse
the behaviour of engineers and librarians involved a project to develop the National Gallery of
the Spoken Word (NGSW), and Duff and Cherry’s investigation of the use of Early Canadiana
(2000), also attempted to look for patterns in use but they stopped short of an elemental
analysis of artefact use. The granular research of Levine-Clark (2007) on the use of library
resources, combining attitudinal data in questionnaires with web log data, comes closest to the
approach used in this research, but their formation of categories was heuristic and highly
reductive. Although this research helps in terms of reach and detail, more work is needed to
probe the applicability and utility of use categories, not least because of the effort required to
collect and analyse data, the degree of validity in this process, and the experimental nature of
this research. However, the potential for the HE and cultural sector to digitise more smartly,
and to deliver more relevant and usable resources for different end-users in sustainable ways,
and to evaluate end-use, is considerable.

6.4.4 Wider implications: Environment
Despite the fact that of the four test learning environments the virtual learning environment
was the least versatile in allowing users to express their natural learning style, the ability of

322

VLEs to still support a broad range of learning styles when artefact-generated content is used is
an encouraging finding for the HE sector. Data from Phase 2 indicates that although virtual
learning environments impose some limitations on the end-user (such as restricting working
space, issues with software compatibility, and so on) and are dependent on the quality of
content, they do not seem to discriminate against particular learning styles. This research
suggests that the strength of VLEs lies in the curation of quality content and on its reliability. In
a comparable way to the effect of the display case in Environment D (which represented
authority, selectivity, and value for participants) by virtue of content supply by an expert (the
course tutor or librarian) the VLE is regarded as more dependable and focused. Therefore,
investing in the supply and vetting of content would seem to be more important than ever.

Investment in staff training and utilisation of the major categories of use identified in Phases 1
and 2 – identification, contextualisation, interpretation, and the affective use of artefacts –
could also aid the process of selecting suitable artefact-based digital content. For example,
asking how digital content might allow students to identify an artefact (for example selecting
rotatable artefacts) and contextualise them (exploiting hyperlinks or providing different
perspectives on the same artefact) and utilising the VLEs communication tools to promote
dialogue about the interpretation of an artefact could substantially improve use. Looking to
those aspects of the handling environment (Environment C) which make it the most stylistically
versatile would be another way of benchmarking the use potential of content within the VLE.

That being said, technical improvements could also be made to facilitate more diverse forms of
artefact use within the VLE. Incorporating user-extensible features so that students can add

323

their own content and share this with others could allow VLEs to embrace student activity
outside the VLE while maintaining something of its perceived integrity. Through peer-to-peer
discussion of the use value of content harvested by students from beyond the VLE this could
enrich content, while developing skills in digital literacy, building on the connectivist properties
of VLEs and the constructivist credentials of artefact-based learning (Hein 1998, 155). Some
learning software, such as Curatr (2013), already does this using gamification to encourage
users to select relevant content although the pedagogical value of a scoring system which
rewards the finding of content rather than its use is questionable. Improving tracking systems
within VLEs to include measurement of how digital artefacts are used would allow course tutors
to evaluate the efficacy of content and comply with calls for greater accountability across the
HE sector. This is especially important given the investment in MOOCs without any real
indicators, beyond uptake and completion rates, of how content based on artefacts might be
being used. This research could provide some direction to the technical development of
tracking systems: for example, detecting how an end-user seeks to identify, contextualise, and
interpret an artefact could involve eye tracking technology as well as more overt methods to
externalise types of use such as written or verbal description.

Artefact usage data suggests that different disciplines have distinct learning styles and some
environments are more suitable than others to support their particular learning style. For
example, Shakespeare Studies students (accommodators) would benefit most from hands-on
access to artefacts and using digital artefacts in the VLE, while Digital Cultures students
(convergers) would benefit most from access to artefacts in a display environment or online.

324

Although a nomothetic approach was deliberately chosen to take an objective look at the
processes involved in using artefacts to avoid assumptions made in previous studies about the
beneficial aspects of object-based learning, studying the effect of four different environments
appears to show that, despite these variations, in every case all four Kolbian learning styles are
catered for by artefact-based learning. This endorses the view that using artefacts in physical
and digital contexts stimulates a broad range of learning styles, while highlighting the strengths
and weaknesses of particular learner groups and learning environments.

The results from Phase 2 also suggest that there are continua within physical and the digital
environments - elements of each that are desirable to users – and that blended learning or
hybrid environments are more attractive for a range of learners rather than a straight choice
between physical or digital environments. This should help to depolarise the debate on
whether the physicality or the ‘digitality’ (Parry 2010b, 293) of environments is most suitable
for research use of artefacts. Analysis of the affordances of physical and digital environments
and learning styles of users suggests that each learning style seems to prefer a combination of
features found in physical and digital learning environments. Therefore, understanding the
latent affordances and limitations of different usage environments should allow tutors and elearning specialists to tailor content more effectively. Realising the advantages of blended
learning environments is not new (e.g. MacDonald 2008), but knowing that hybrid
environments might be the most stylistically versatile when engaged in artefact-based learning,
is encouraging, especially given the growth in interest in mobile learning environments (Masie,
Baker et al.. 2012).

325

Learning about the strengths and weaknesses of different environments should also inform
how artefacts are presented in physical spaces, for particular users. In general, while digital
environments privilege detail and contextual information, physical environments privilege scale
and functionality (though this was not always true in the encased environment, Environment
D). Designing hybrid learning environments which allow end-users to move effortlessly
between the physical and virtual environment (for example, by embedding computation in
physical artefacts) would, in the opinion of all twenty students who participated in Phase 2,
combine the best of both worlds.

6.5 Discussion: Conclusions
In taking a more objective approach to the analysis of artefact interaction, this study has
proven that other research methodologies are capable of deconstructing the process of digital
artefact use, generating meaningful qualitative and quantitative data from an area largely
untouched by previous research. Looking at the phenomenon of artefact use through the prism
of Wenger’s theory of communities of practice, and conceptualising artefact use as part of the
Experiential Learning Cycle conceived by Kolb, sheds new light on an old problem: just how
subjective is the encounter with the artefact? This research shows that two types of context
influence artefact use: the knowledge, experience and learning preferences gained through
membership of a CoP appears to affect an individual’s behaviour, and the usage environment
affords or limits certain types of interaction with the artefact. This research demonstrates that,
although there are broad similarities in how we all engage with digital artefacts, our ‘ways of
experiencing’ (Dewey 1938, 23) them are also determined, as Dewey observed, by ‘the force of

326

intercourse and custom’ (ibid.). These findings have significant implications for the way that
digital artefacts are created and how they are used within digital learning environments. Most
importantly, the research findings draw attention to the influence of ways of learning on ways
of using artefacts and, in turn, provide guidance on how digital artefacts can enhance objectbased learning.

327

7. CONCLUSIONS
7.1 Being objective
The research presented in this thesis sought to address significant gaps in our understanding of
digital artefact use and to find out to what extent two contexts affect this process: the social
learning of communities of practice involved in creating or using digital artefacts, and digital
learning environments. In doing so, it adopted a nomothetic approach to data analysis and
tested a more objective method of obtaining qualitative and quantitative data on artefact use
than had previously been used in researching this area of enquiry.

Chapter 6 outlined how the research addressed the four main aims identified in Chapter 3. This
chapter highlights the main findings and theoretical and practical implications arising from
them in relation to the two overarching research questions presented at the start of the thesis:
1. How are cultural artefacts used in digital learning environments?
2. How can the theory of communities of practice help in understanding the people and

processes involved in the supply and use of digital artefacts?

These questions are significant because of the growing importance of digital content and
services for both the cultural and HE sector as users demand more open, usable digital
material. However, despite more than a decade of major digitisation and the widespread
adoption of virtual learning environments, there is no clear way of measuring usage of artefacts
in digital environments, or gauging return on investment for the creation, presentation and use
of cultural artefacts in digital form. Despite the prevalence of this problem and the expected
expansion of digital content available online, little research has been carried out which focuses

328

on how digital artefacts are actually used and to what extent those interacting with artefacts,
and the environment itself, affect this process. Later parts of the chapter address other broad
considerations stemming from the research findings and how this might affect the work of the
Higher Education and cultural sectors.

7.2 Returning to the research questions
This section examines how the research carried out addresses the two main questions.
7.2.1 How are cultural artefacts used in digital learning environments?
All users appear to interact with digital artefacts in seven main ways. These categories of use
are listed and defined in Table 37.
Category of Use
Identification

Definition
Cognitive or sensory interaction with the
artefact to establish what it is
Contextualisation
The placing of an artefact in a physical or
informational context to enrich understanding
Interpretation
A process of comprehension and abstraction of
concrete information (supplied by the artefact)
in the making of meaning
Location
The process of discovering an artefact or
metadata associated with it
Curation
The process of controlling use of the artefact
Induction
The process of looking for coherence between
artefacts or metadata associated with them
Affection
The process of responding to the artefact
affectively
Table 37. Categories of use and their definitions
Of the seven categories of use, four are most common in terms of levels of usage:
identification, contextualisation, interpretation, and affection. In other words, users want to

329

identify an artefact (work out what it is), contextualise it (place it in relation to a physical or
informational context), interpret it (work out what it means), and respond affectively to it.
Although there was some variation between research phases, these categories of use represent
170 different types of use (e.g. trying to establish an artefact’s date and where it was made are
types of use code within the category of contextualisation).

The usage environment does seem to affect how individuals interact with digital artefacts.
Although there were only minor differences in artefact usage between the digital learning
environments tested, the findings underline the importance of how digital artefacts are created
and curated. VLEs and online environments were found to accommodate a broad range of ways
of using artefacts and learning styles, but there were perceptual differences in the use value of
content and test participants preferred features of both digital and physical learning
environments in affording different types of artefact use.

7.2.2 How can the theory of communities of practice help in understanding the people and
processes involved in the supply and use of digital artefacts?

Wenger’s theory of communities of practice provides a way of understanding the influence of
practitioner groups involved in the creation and use of digital artefacts, compared to how
individuals interact with cultural artefacts. As noted above, general patterns were detected in
the way that all individuals who took part in the study interact with artefacts, described in the
seven categories of use listed in Table 37 (in Section 7.2.1). However, using CoP theory,
variations in usage were also found in the dataset which seem to relate to the identity,

330

interests, experience and perspective of communities of practice who produce and use content.
One possible reason for variations between the way that different CoPs use artefacts is that the
domain of knowledge around which the community is formed might be directing the
perception of members to particular features of the artefact. Another related reason could be
the manifestation of a particular learning style through artefact use; most individuals who took
part in the research appeared to share a preference with members of the same CoP for
‘educational conditions’ (Stewart and Felicetti 1992, 15) under which they are most likely to
learn. In other words, ways of using artefacts might mirror ways of learning within a CoP. These
forms of use might also be affected by distinctive ways of tackling recurring problems among
practitioner groups as evidenced in particular perspectives on the value and use of digital
artefacts which emerged during research. Whatever the reason, Wenger’s theory of
communities of practice exposes linkages between who is using artefacts and how this is done
which might otherwise go unnoticed.

Using Wenger’s theory, the use of cultural artefacts in digital learning environments appears to
be both a subjective and objective phenomenon. Although there are generic ways in which all
individuals appear to interact with digital artefacts, common traits shared by communities of
practice appear to strategically direct the attention of individuals to particular aspects of the
artefact. For example, all users appear to try to identify an artefact by examining its material
composition and general typology, contextualise it physically and chronologically, interpret the
artefact by thinking about authenticity, provenance, and value, and engage with it on an
affective level by assessing its size, weight and colour. However, particular communities of

331

practice placed different emphases on each of these forms of use and exhibit usage behaviour
peculiar to their CoP.109

7.3 Theoretical implications
This study makes three contributions to theory on communities of practice and the use of
digital artefacts. Firstly, developing a method of extracting meaningful qualitative and
quantitative data from a field in which only qualitative forms of analysis have predominated, is
innovative.110 The method used in this study derives qualitative and quantitative data to assess
priorities among users in aspects of artefact usage that are important to them. The same broad
categories of use found in both phases of research would be expected were the method to be
used elsewhere, although one would also predict specific use types to arise in the same way
that occurred in Phase 2. Although further development and testing is needed, the method is,
therefore, transferrable and capable of reuse in different scenarios, digital and physical. The
implications of this are far reaching. Not only might it be possible to develop metrics for
evaluating the efficacy of artefact-based content (both formatively in its creation and
summatively in its use) in digital environments but, more widely, it ought to be possible to
measure the impact of any type of digital content, especially given the expected expansion of
109

For example only Shakespeare Studies students who took part in Phase 2 of the research identify an artefact
using a maker’s mark, while only Digital Cultures students, who also took part in Phase 2, would contextualise an
artefact using a reverse search engine.
110

Although some valuable work on the use of Grounded Theory has been done by, among others, Ellis in his study
on information retrieval at the University of Sheffield (1993), this did not pursue a numerical end-point and was
confined to broad patterns of information-seeking behaviour among academic researchers rather than usage of
artefacts per se.

332

content over the next two decades (Gantz and Reinsel 2012, 1). Being able to generate data on
use should allow more usable content to be created and for smarter systems of evaluating
usage. This would help justify investment made in content creation and to guide future
investments as usage patterns change. More generally, this methodology breaks the impasse
created by using only qualitative methods of analysis in this area.

Secondly, making an association between types of artefact use and learning styles is also new.
Although Kolb describes the ‘force’ of acculturation or the performance of ‘primary tasks’ and
its influence on shaping learning style among members of a discipline (Kolb 1984, 97), this has
yet to be applied to the phenomenon of artefact use. Conversely, the influence of learning
styles on how members of a CoP interact with artefacts has also not received due research
attention. This opens up the possibility of studying the psychometric properties of cultural
artefacts, and investigating new pedagogies around artefact use in digital environments.

Finally, although work has been done on the connection between cultural background or
educational discipline, and learning style, proposing a link between a community of practice
and a dominant learning style is novel. Wenger (Wenger and Lave 2009) and Kolb (1984, 163)
have both developed theories of social learning among practitioner groups, but the two
theories have so far remained unbridged. The development of a quantitative method of
analysing artefact use has facilitated the creation of linkages between membership of a CoP
and learning style but other manifestations of learning style could be also be investigated
including language use.

333

7.4 Practical implications
The findings from this research also have considerable practical implications for both the
cultural and HE sectors. Three real problems shared by the cultural and HE sectors and raised in
Chapter 2, are addressed in turn to show how findings could be used to tackle pressing issues
for both sectors.

7.4.1 How can we create more usable digital content?
This research has exposed the role of people and the types of processes involved in the supply
and use of digital artefacts. In so doing, it points to problems in the supply and use of artefactbased content and ways of improving usability. Firstly, knowing about the mechanics of artefact
use provides valuable criteria for the creation and usability of content. Utilising the seven
categories of use (itemised in Section 7.2.1) to evaluate how forms of capture and presentation
facilitate the identification, contextualisation, interpretation, location, curation, and promote
inductive and affective use of the artefact would allow collections’ institutions to create
smarter and more usable digital content. Moreover, these categories also provide a more
precise framework for evaluating forms of use post-capture; for example, evaluating risk to
rights holders and collections institutions for rights-sensitive material by looking at potential
forms of use, and, conversely, for assessing which material should be collected and sustained
by museums, libraries and archives in the long term based on likely use. Knowing that artefactbased content is likely to appeal to general audiences as well as particular groups is good news
for the creation of artefact-based open educational resources (OERs). Equally, knowing that

334

CoPs’ interests in particular aspects of the artefact varies provides direction for tailored forms
of digitisation for different audiences.

Secondly, data from Phase 1 has highlighted weaknesses in the digital supply chain which have
the potential to reduce the usability of content. It has shown that even when end-users
stipulate how cultural artefacts should be digitised, decisions made during capture significantly
affect the use value of digital artefacts. Diversifying methods of capturing content and making
decisions taken during digitisation more transparent could help ameliorate the dissatisfaction
users expressed in the digital artefacts. Also, involving end-users in every aspect of the codesign of digital artefacts might also reduce levels of dissatisfaction with the usability of
material. More radically, recruiting the artefact to generate and transmit its own data by
embedding sensors or processors to generate information on temperature, colour, pressure,
humidity and so on, could help tackle weaknesses in the supply of metadata. In this way,
inherent information which was not obvious following the digitisation of artefacts in Phase 1
could be conveyed, by-passing decisions made by practitioners.

Thirdly, research data has also shown potential boundary issues between communities of
practice which might affect the usability of digital artefacts produced collaboratively. This is
important because pressure from funding bodies to collaborate on the creation of digital
content from research collections has made interdisciplinary working more crucial. The
discovery that CoPs have distinctive ways of using artefacts, particular perspectives on how
they should be used, possibly different ways of learning collaboratively, and different shared
protocols for stewarding knowledge, raises the potential for friction and dissonance. However,

335

data has also hinted that greater awareness of the strengths and weaknesses of CoPs could also
make for the creation of more usable digital artefacts. Since Kolb suggests that a combination
of different learning styles is required to promote creativity and learning, achieving a balance of
learning styles among practitioner groups involved in cross-disciplinary digital projects is not
only more likely to deliver more interesting content but also content that appeals to those with
different learning styles. This endorses the importance of user-generated content since it will
necessarily reflect the different learning styles of a multitude of content creators. Also, being
aware of potential discoursal barriers between CoPs working in collaboration (as evidenced in
the word use analysis undertaken in both phases of research) would also help improve the
delivery of content. Confronting boundary issues around ownership, control, and value
between suppliers and users of content might also be a way of improving interdisciplinary
working and encouraging professional self-awareness especially in the case of professions who
feel threatened by the opening up of content and use.

7.4.2 How can we create value from digital artefacts?
The creation of content without any clear understanding of how it might be used has inevitably
led to a situation where it is likely that content providers will not be able to understand how
effective that content is for different end-users and how they can share value with those users.
Data from this research helps tackle this problem in two main ways: knowledge about generic
types of use, and knowledge about specific types of use. Being aware of how all users are likely
to interact with digital artefacts should give museums, libraries and archives a huge advantage
in stimulating demand by adjusting how they prepare content. As noted above, drawing on

336

categories of use as a yardstick for the generation of content is more likely to appeal to
potential users. In so doing, the cultural sector would adopt a demand-led rather than supplydriven approach to digitisation but, importantly, be driving demand through knowledge of
artefact use rather than simply responding to demands for more content without any clear
understanding of how it will be used. As noted in Chapter 1, value for the user has moved from
access to participation; being aware of ways that users interact with digital artefacts should
allow museums and universities to create opportunities to enable end-users not just to access
content but to participate in its use. By identifying key ways of measuring usage of digital
artefacts, the cultural and HE sectors should also be able to prove demand by generating
statistical data required by funding bodies.

Equally, knowing that CoPs engage with digital artefacts differently should allow the cultural
sector to tailor creation to potential use and thereby create value with those users in mind. For
example, Brightsolid’s partnership with the British Library to create content for family history
researchers could be strengthened by regarding end market users as a distinct community of
practice with common motivations and needs (Brightsolid 2013). Data and services could be
packaged and delivered in ways which complement end-users’ usage and learning styles. On a
wider scale, knowing how artefacts are used could also help return value to the museum,
library or archive by informing the development of semantic searching. Basing algorithms which
find digital artefacts on actual patterns of use could allow end-users to locate content more
easily and give museums, libraries and archives direction in where value lies for the end-user,
bringing the processes of finding and using artefacts closer together, and promoting the
discoverability agenda of funders such as JISC (Marchionni 2013). In this way, two business

337

models emerge from the findings which complement each: the generation of generic digital
resources which appeal to a mass market but provide no monetary return per se, and the
creation of tailored digital resources which users are willing to pay for and, in turn, support the
wider remit of the HE and cultural sectors.

However, realising that artefacts are engaged with in the same basic ways by all users, and that
greater variety of content is widely welcomed, might not make comfortable reading for
members of the museum, library and archive profession concerned about controlling the value
of digital artefacts and, by consequence, the traditional role of curator, librarian or archivist as
gatekeeper. Data from Phase 1 revealed a defensiveness among heritage practitioners on their
role as managers of digital artefacts and an uneasiness about the value of user-generated
content (UGC). Realising what users want and increasing self-awareness among heritage
practitioners about issues which might be curtailing these forms of use, might help curators,
librarians and archivists come to terms with a perceived loss of control of the supply and use of
digital artefacts. Although categories of use might help as a way of improving the quality and
usability of digital artefacts, learning from the way that UGC is created and used is more likely
to lead to the co-creation of use value in the digital artefact for the cultural sector.111

111

In other words, appreciating that UGC and producer-generated content is subject to the same types of use
should allow museums, libraries and archives to focus on ways of creating content more effectively with others. In
the same way that museums, libraries and archives are responding to calls for the use of ‘big data’, acknowledging
the value of all artefact-based content by embracing UGC could allow museums, libraries and archives to maintain
their position as subject and object specialists or providers of ‘deep data’ by leading on the creation of more
usable content with end-users.

338

7.4.3 How can digital learning environments be used more effectively?
This research endorses the potential of both artefact-based learning and digital learning
environments. Data suggests that formal and informal digital learning environments support a
broad range of learning styles when artefact-based content is used. This is important given the
difficulties associated with proving the value of object-centred learning and the uncertainty
surrounding the efficacy of new learning environments such as mobile learning environments
(MLEs) and MOOCs. The discovery of categories of digital artefact use should lead to
improvements in tracking systems within proprietary digital learning environments to allow
course tutors to evaluate the efficacy of content and comply with calls for greater
accountability across the HE sector.

However, data also shows that the differences between using digital artefacts on the world
wide web and within institutional VLEs are slight and relate largely to the selection of suitable
content by course tutors as opposed to unprovenanced material found online. Incorporating
user-extensible features so that students can add their own content and share this with others
would allow VLEs to embrace student activity outside the VLE, while maintaining something of
its perceived integrity. Equally, greater integration of institutional data repositories with VLEs
and MOOCs would strengthen the value of digital learning environments for end-users.
Pedagogies that encourage digital and visual literacies would allow the diversity of content
found on the internet to be used more effectively within the VLE or MOOC rather than seeking
to deny its value by perpetuating a ‘walled garden’ (Cunningham 2009) approach to online
learning.

339

Data also suggests that blended learning or hybrid environments are more attractive for a
range of learners rather than a straight choice between physical or digital environments. This is
an encouraging finding for the development of mobile learning environments and, more
generally, for any-time-any-place learning which is increasingly in demand (Irvine 2003, 5). A
preference for hybridity of physical and digital environments is also a positive finding for
promoting the use of digital and physical artefacts in museums, libraries and archives and
should help depolarise the persistent debate surrounding physicality and virtuality. More
generally, the overwhelming preference of test participants for elements of both physical and
digital environments is an affirmation of the learning potential of an ‘internet of things’,
blurring the boundary between the physical and the virtual, and for the intelligent use of digital
technologies in the museum, library and archive environment.

7.5 Directions for future research
This is the first study to examine the influence of membership of a community of practice on
the ways that cultural artefacts are produced and used. It is also the first to use a mixed
methods approach to describe and measure artefact use. The extraction of numerical data from
an area of study where qualitative methods have dominated must be considered an
achievement. However, this was done using small sample sizes and particular forms of data
capture and analysis. Larger sample sizes and other types of data capture such as eye tracking
or motion sensing would provide additional datasets for analysis. Although this study
represents an important step forward in indicating how digital artefacts are used and what
influences this process, the connection between artefact use and learning style, the role of

340

language in communities of practice, and the affordances of a wider variety of digital learning
environments (including MOOCs) all require further research.

This study observed pressure points in the digital supply chain but a closer examination of
digitisation is needed to assess the impact of the people and processes involved. This could
perhaps be done in vitro by studying a real digitisation project from beginning to end.
Subjecting digitisation to new theoretical perspectives such as Actors Networks (Law and
Hassard 1999; Whittle and Spicer 2008) which attempts to account for non-human activity, has
the potential to analyse the material and semiotic role of the artefact in use as well as the role
of technical equipment in determining usage of digital artefacts. Since content and context
were found to influence artefact use in Phase 2, further research on the role of features of the
artefact in usage would seem to be warranted.

7.6 Impact of work
In February 2012, the AHRC awarded the University of Birmingham £20,679 for a project
entitled, Digital CoPs and Robbers: Communities of Practice and the Transformation of Research
as part of the AHRC’s Digital Transformations scheme. Although the primary focus of this
project was on the question of how artefact-based research is transformed by digital
technologies rather than the social context of the transformation process, Digital CoPs and
Robbers generated data for Phase 1. Findings from the Digital Transformations project were
contained in a report to the AHRC submitted in October 2012 (Hopes and Chapman 2012).

341

To enable the dissemination of findings from Phase 1 to the HE and cultural sectors, three
papers were written for publication during the period of research. A findings paper entitled,
‘What’s the Use? Learning from Digital Artefacts, Learning about Users’(Hopes 2013c) was
published in Rosetta in Autumn 2013. A methods paper, ‘Being Objective: A Nomothetic
Methodological Approach to Describe Usage of Physical and Digital Artefacts among
Communities of Practice’ was submitted to the professional journal Museum Management and
Curatorship in December 2013 and is expected to be published in 2014. This paper explains the
methodological approach adopted to describe and measure artefact use, and examines the
connection between usage and learning styles. Finally, a positioning paper intended to pass on
some of the main findings from Phases 1 and 2 will be published online by the University of
Birmingham’s Digital Humanities Hub (formerly Do.Collaboration) in 2014. The paper, ‘Around
the Digital Artefact: Improving the use of Cultural Collections in Higher Education’, seeks to
make the findings from both phases of research meaningful and useful for the HE and cultural
sectors (Hopes 2012).

The research contained within this thesis has been presented at a variety of conferences and
events. A paper was delivered by the author in April 2013 to the Institute of Archaeology and
Antiquity Colloquium at the University of Birmingham Colloquium outlining methods and
findings from Phase 1 of the research. Another paper was given by the author at the Ashmolean
Museum, Oxford, in November 2012 relating some of the main findings of Phase 1 to the main
themes of the AHRC-funded ‘Ways of Seeing the English Domestic Interior, 1500-1700: the case

342

of decorative textiles’ research network.112 Building on findings from the ‘Digital CoPs and
Robbers’ project, a large grant application was made to the AHRC by the University of
Birmingham in January 2013. Although unsuccessful, the bid, entitled, ‘All The World’s A Digital
Stage’, received the support of a number of departments across the University and from
external partners including the RSC, the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust (SBT), and the Chicago
Shakespeare Theater. Finally, a pilot project run by the University of Birmingham and the SBT to
create a prototype to gauge visitor responses to the use of digital representations of artefacts
in historic properties managed by the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust draws on the findings from
Phases 1 and 2 of this research with a view to submitting a fuller application to the Digital
Research and Development Fund,113 and to the AHRC’s Digital Transformations Amplification
Fund. These projects were developed from the findings of this research and respond directly to
the circumstances which brought the research about: a shifting of the research and funding
agenda to understand more about the user and use.

112

This project involved past and present reception of textiles in historic domestic interiors and shared a focus on
communities of practice and ways of experiencing artefacts, principally through sight. There has also been crosspollination between this research project and a number of other initiatives involving digital technologies and
artefact-based research.
