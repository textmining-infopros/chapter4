ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
Upon reflection on my road to complete my dissertation, I have realized that I have had so many
supporters, mentors and champions on my long journey. I really appreciate all of your warm
hearts for me. I especially offer my sincere thanks to Dr. Nancy Everhart, who led me to success.
She showed me an entirely different world of research, and willingly shared her wisdom to solve
many problems that I encountered. Without her encouragement, I could not have completed this
process with this sense of triumph. Also, I was able to truly share in the bounty of my doctoral
committee members. Dr. Don Latham was very generous with his time, helping me to develop
the content and style of my dissertation. Dr. Kathleen Burnett was a great leader who helped me
set my research direction. I will never forget Dr. Vanessa Dennen’s passion and enthusiasm
toward students’ success. The experience that I gained from her research group has been a
foundation for my research.
In addition, I would like to take a moment to say thank you to the faculty members at Florida
State University. They have provided a rich soil of research and allowed me to grow healthy and
strong with their affection and support. I’ve learned a lot from Professor Ken Armstrong and
FSU's Program in Interdisciplinary Computing team, not only about teaching skills, but also
having a positive attitude toward innovations.
I am extremely grateful to all my iSchool friends for their help. The friends and colleagues who I
met during the program became my lighthouse. Whenever I lost my direction, they were always
there to illuminate my way home. A chat with my cohorts—Jon, Julia, Laura, Lisandra, Lynnsey
and MinSook—was always a special source of care and healing. I express my deepest gratitude
to the friends I gained from in the Education Department for your their supportive advice. The
help from my Mommy-Long-Legs, Jennifer, is unforgettable. Also, thanks for the unwavering
support I received from my friends in Korea, including Ssuk, Hui, Sun, Eunmi, my Chamkkae
bros, and my former colleagues at LG Sangnam Library and Sungkyunkwan University.
I cannot finish the acknowledgements without mentioning how much I love my family. The love
from all of you to the (very) firstborn child makes the impossible possible. Most especially, my
love and gratitude goes to my eternal helper and soul mate, my hubby! You made my
unrealistically sublime dream real. Thank you for always being my man and encouraging me to
go forward. (I know, Claire you are reading this to find your name!) Without the happiness and
joyfulness that my bright Claire has brought into my life, I would not keep smiling. Mom and
Dad, you are the source of my curiosity and energy. I still remember those nights when you
taught me while working. I’m so proud that you are my parents.
Finally, my Lord God, thank you for allowing me to be your gift and filling my heart and mind
with a spirit of gratitude.

ABSTRACT
In our fast-paced, high-tech society, school librarians’ leadership role in technology
integration has been receiving particular attention. Because school libraries are usually the first
place to introduce new educational technologies, school librarians are expected to have a positive
attitude and perspective regarding the effectiveness and merits of new technologies. Meanwhile,
simultaneous implementation of digital textbooks is planned in K-12 schools in the U.S. state of
Florida and the country of South Korea, and school librarians are supposed to play a pivotal role
in this adoption. However, there have been very few studies conducted to identify any patterns or
consistencies in librarians’ perceptions of innovation.
The purpose of this study is to identify and describe the concerns of Floridian and South
Korean librarians during the initial phases of the implementation of digital textbooks. For each
setting, the study not only determines the stages of concern as per school librarians’ practices and
experiences, but also classifies those stages of concern by demographic backgrounds.
This study used the Concerns-Based Adoption Model (CBAM) as a theoretical
framework. The comparative research design applying a survey method was used, incorporating
the Stages of Concern Questionnaire (SoCQ) with other demographic questions. The SoCQ
percentile scores were used to identify school librarians’ Stages of Concern (SoC) in Florida and
South Korea. T-tests explored the similarities and differences of SoC in two locations.
The study revealed that school librarians in both places expressed the highest response in
Stage 0, Unconcerned, implying they were more concerned about a multitude of other
obligations, activities, or innovations. The CBAM theory anticipates that there will be potential
resistance from school librarians towards digital textbook implementation in two locations, as the
SoC from Florida school librarians presented a Negative One-Two Split user pattern and those
ix

from South Korea presented a typical non-user pattern. Also, this study found that, according to
their characteristics, school librarians showed the biggest gaps of concerns in the Impact stages
(Stages 4, 5, and 6) while having relatively high concerns in the Self stages (Stages 0, 1, and 2).
In Florida’s case, all profiles presented a relationship between SoC and participants’
characteristics, with the biggest gaps occurring in Stage 5, Collaboration. South Korean school
librarians’ SoC profiles found the largest gaps in the Impact stages. Research Question 3
revealed that South Korean school librarians expressed more concern over the three stages: 0,
Unconcerned; 1, Informational; and 2, Personal.
Based on the CBAM theory, the findings underscore a need for various interventions.
Since school librarians’ were found to be apathetic even though digital textbook integration will
be put into effect soon, an intervention to inform them of the characteristics and strong points of
digital textbooks, as well as restrictions for using them, is urgent (Stage 0). Moreover, the study
findings argue that it is urgent to introduce various interventions for specific groups of
participants. For example, South Korean school librarians, who had the second-highest concern
in Stage 1, Informational, need to receive general information including benefits and costs of
digital textbooks. Florida school librarians, who had the second-highest concern in Stage 2,
Personal, need guidance to prioritize digital textbooks, and they also need continuous
encouragement.
The results from the study stress the importance of professional development for school
librarians. Data from the study provides administrators with information regarding interventions
that were targeted and customized according to school librarians’ characteristics. Moreover, for
policy makers, the theory recommends gradual implementation of digital textbooks in Florida

x

and pilot test opportunities in South Korea. Lastly, the study urges library and information
science education to have short- and long-term strategies for embracing digital textbooks.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION
As the knowledge economy has grown and evolved, the idea of “leadership for all” has
become an accepted notion within the sphere of twenty-first century libraries (Kampylis et al.,
2013). This new paradigm of leadership requires librarians to gather and consider the opinions of
all knowledge seekers in terms of volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity (VUCA)
when making decisions concerning their libraries (Davis & Macauley, 2011).
Leadership principles for school libraries are no exception to this development.
Beginning with Mohajerin & Smith’s study (1981), which sought to identify school librarians’
perceptions regarding effective school leaders in the early 1980s, even more researchers have
inquired about the leadership roles of school librarians (Fitzgibbons, 1980; Mohajerin & Smith,
1981; Smith, 2013). Especially in our fast-paced technological society, the leadership of
technology integration has been receiving particular attention. School librarians are supposed to
help students “develop information skills that will enable them to use technology as an important
tool for learning, both now and in the future” (American Association of School Librarians,
2009). Library media programs should make available “the expansion and enhancement of new
formats and resources” (National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, 2012).
The increasing number of studies and guidelines pertaining to school librarians, however,
hints at the emerging role of leadership in school libraries. First of all, the current guidelines of
the American Association for School Librarians (AASL), as identified in Empowering Learners:
Guidelines for School Library Media Programs, include a section addressing the appropriate
leadership roles of school librarians with the goal of attaining new standards for the twenty-first
century learner. The guidelines state (AASL, 2009):
1

The school library media program is built by professionals who model leadership and
best practices for the community to ensure that learners are equipped with the skills and
knowledge they need to succeed in the technological society of the 21st century. (p. 45)
Leadership is integral to developing a successful 21st-century school library program. As
information literacy and technology skills become central to learning, the school librarian
must lead the way in building 21st-century skills throughout the school environment.
Doing so involves a willingness to serve as a teacher and a learner who listens to and acts
upon good ideas from peers, teachers, and students. Leadership also requires increased
professional commitment and thorough knowledge of the challenges and opportunities
facing the profession. By becoming an active member of the local and global learning
community, the school librarian can build relationships with organizations and
stakeholders to develop an effective school library program and advocate for student
learning. (p. 17)
This declaration is critical, because not only do these standards introduce new leadership
roles, but they also reorient school library media professionals to initiate advocacy programs for
teaching and learning. In the guidelines, the leadership roles that will support school librarians in
creating new models of teaching, learning, and organization for twenty-first century learners are
reconfirmed.
Along with the statement of the AASL, the National Board for Professional Teaching
Standards also makes an effort to create definitive and comprehensive standards defining the
responsibilities of accomplished librarians. The standards for school library media clarify the
importance of the roles of school librarians in technology integration and leadership. Although
the concepts of leadership and integration of technologies are incorporated in all of the standards,
2

the fourth and sixth standards particularize leadership and the integration of technologies. In
terms of leadership, the standards argue that accomplished specialists encourage collaboration,
build relationships with communities, and strengthen library media programs. For instructional
leadership, library media specialists apply current technologies to invigorate library media
programs. In addition, in terms of providing professional leadership, school librarians need to
focus on effective professional development. The standards also specify integration of
technologies, stressing its importance not only in teaching and learning, but also in managing,
maintaining, and administering programs. The standards address “the expansion and
enhancement of new formats and resources available to the library media program” (p. 17).
Moreover, the standards demonstrate the school librarians’ vigorous roles, such as differentiating
instruction, providing assistive technologies, analyzing programs and activities, generating
reports for the budgeting process, or offering solutions for problems.
Similarly, various studies have focused on defining leadership roles for school librarians
(Branch-Mueller & DeGroot, 2011; Dotson & Jones, 2011; Gewertz, 2012; Johnston, 2011;
Lankford, 2006; Lowe, 2000; Martin, 2011; Oliver, 2003; Turner, 2011). A great number of
studies also indicate that when school librarians take on these leadership roles, a positive effect
on both teaching and learning occurs school-wide. It appears that the more leadership school
librarians exhibit, the better the overall academic achievement levels of the students. Despite the
growing importance of technology integration leadership and the emergence of professional
guidelines and organizations, most efforts have been on defining school librarians’ roles.
While the importance of school librarians’ technology integration leadership roles has
taken on added significance, school librarians have encountered the advent of new educational
technologies more rapidly than can be addressed. One example is that, over the last several years,
3

the importance of digital textbooks in schools has grown. In the U.S., seven states have launched
Open Educational Resources (OER) initiatives, and 12 states have announced textbook
innovation policies, including plans for funding (Fletcher, Schaffhauser, & Levin, 2012). In
addition, some European countries, as well as Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore and South Korea,
have launched projects related to the introduction of digital textbooks (Kampylis, 2013).
In particular, Florida plans to transition to an all-digital environment, including the
exclusive use of digital textbooks, by 2015 (Mardis & Everhart, 2011). South Korea is another
place where digital textbooks are being embraced. Among its plans for school reform, the
Education Ministry of South Korea has enacted a set of digital textbook initiatives (J. H.-Y. Kim
& Jung, 2010). According to this mandate for new technology, school libraries will experience
the transition from print textbooks to digital textbooks alongside K-12 classrooms. Indeed,
digital textbooks provide a great opportunity for school librarians to demonstrate their leadership
skills, specifically in the area of technology integration (Dotson & Jones, 2011; Mardis &
Everhart, 2011; Mardis, Everhart, Smith, Newsum, & Baker, 2010).
1.1 Problem Statement
Various standards and previous studies compel school librarians to play pivotal roles in
integrating educational technologies. In fact, school librarians are already involved in advocating
for technology in schools, disseminating information about those technologies, and educating the
community about uses for new technologies (Everhart, Mardis, & Johnston, 2012). However,
few school librarians are found to have achieved full or substantial leadership, advocacy, and
community partnerships.
This mandate for school librarians to help integrate digital textbooks is common to both
Florida and South Korea. Regardless of the opinions of teachers and staff members, the new
4

educational innovation of digital textbooks will be introduced into schools in Florida and South
Korea by 2015 (Kang & Everhart, 2014c; Mardis & Everhart, 2011). More importantly, the
changes that digital textbooks will bring have already been reported (Kang & Everhart, 2014c).
One function of digital textbooks is that users can create, share, and use the content. Digital
textbooks provide support tools for educators to make and collect digital content coinciding with
their use, to customize the textbooks for their curriculum, and to tailor chapters for their state’s
standards (J. H.-Y. Kim & Jung, 2010; Mardis et. al, 2010). Educators can also share and
exchange their content virtually with students and other educators. In fact, schools that have
adopted digital textbooks are now operating virtual libraries to collect, share and use content
(Mardis et. al, 2010).
Previous studies involving educational innovations show that the opinions held by
librarians vary in certain circumstances (Aharony, 2009; Bianco, 2008; Huston, 2009; Stephens,
2008). Although those studies agree that personal traits influence those opinions, the studies
could not identify any patterns or consistencies among the librarians’ perceptions about
innovation. Remarkably, while numerous studies have contributed to the research on digital
textbooks, none have carried out as an initial research focus an empirical analysis that identifies
human attitudes towards digital textbooks with the exception of a pilot study by Kang and
Everhart (2014b).
Therefore, in order for school librarians to serve as leaders in adopting the new
educational facet of digital textbooks, their perceptions and concerns need to be studied in order
for them to move forward.

1.2 Purpose Statements and Research Questions
The purpose of this study is to identify and describe the concerns of Floridian and South
Korean librarians during the initial phases of the implementation of digital textbooks. For each
setting, the study does not only determine the stages of concern as per school librarians’ practices
and experiences, but also classify those stages of concern by demographic backgrounds. By
doing so, the researcher can suggest customized interventions for each group of school librarians
for their leadership development. In addition, a cultural comparison of the two settings offers
potential implications for other places where digital textbooks will be integrated. Further, the
researcher provides practical interventions based on the Concerns Based Adoption Model
(CBAM) in order to help school librarians enhance their leadership in embracing digital
textbooks.
•

Overarching question: What are school librarians’ concerns during the initial
implementation of a digital textbook initiative in K-12 settings in Florida and South
Korea?
• Research Question 1: Based on the Stages of Concern (SoC), what are the school
librarians’ stages of concern regarding the mandated implementation of digital textbooks
in Florida?
1) Based on the Stages of Concern Questionnaire (SoCQ), what are the school librarians’
highest stage of concern surrounding implementation of digital textbooks?
2) Is there a significant relationship between school librarians’ stages of concern
regarding digital textbooks and those teachers’ experience in years?
3) Is there a significant relationship between school librarians’ stages of concern
regarding digital textbooks and those teachers’ technology adoption style?
6

4) Is there a significant relationship between school librarians’ stages of concern
regarding digital textbooks and those teachers’ personal experiences with e-books?
5) Is there a significant relationship between school librarians’ stages of concern
regarding digital textbooks and the training sessions provided for those librarians?
• Research Question 2: Based on the SoC, what are the school librarians’ stages of
concern around the implementation of digital textbooks in South Korea?
1) Based on the SoCQ, what are the school librarians’ highest stages of concern
surrounding the implementation of digital textbooks?
2) Is there a significant relationship between school librarians’ stages of concern
regarding digital textbooks and those teachers’ experience in years?
3) Is there a significant relationship between school librarians’ stages of concern
regarding digital textbooks and those teachers’ technology adoption style?
4) Is there a significant relationship between school librarians’ stages of concern
regarding digital textbooks and those teachers’ personal experiences with e-books?
5) Is there a significant relationship between school librarians’ stages of concern
regarding digital textbooks and the training sessions provided for those librarians?
• Research Question 3: Are there significant statistical differences in the stages of
concern identified for school librarians in Florida and South Korea?
1) What are the differences between the highest and second highest stages of concern for
school librarians in Florida and South Korea?
2) What main factors influence the differences in these two marginal stages?

7

1.3 Significance of the Research
The projected study identifies both Floridian and South Korean school librarians’ stages
of concern about implementing digital textbooks. In addition, the study examines relationships
between teacher characteristics and their concerns. Lastly, by comparing the two settings’ stages
of concern, the study identifies similarities and differences between librarians in Florida and
those in South Korea and identify the factors that influence preparation for successful
implementation.
The results of the study helps school librarians gain a deeper understanding of both
digital textbooks and how their colleagues perceive them. Moreover, the process of conducting
the study including promotion surveys and recruiting participants may establish more dynamic
interest in a new innovation and encourage librarians to consider their roles.
Besides school librarians, the knowledge from the study assists school administrators,
who are in charge of school reforms like digital textbooks, in facilitating the adoption of digital
textbooks via their school librarians. The findings from the study also provides school
administrators with timely information about personalized professional development for both
school librarians and teachers. By understanding the stages of concern, school administrators can
provide appropriate human resources. Furthermore, the comparison of two settings allows school
administrators to understand and benchmark successful cases in another location. South Korean
administrators can be able to understand the backgrounds, issues and solutions put forth in
Florida, and vice versa, helping both settings identify their own strengths and weaknesses.
The study helps educational policy makers identify issues and circumstances that school
librarians encounter in mandated initiatives involving digital technology. Moreover, the results

8

of the study allows policy makers to recognize areas that require further attention and resources,
and to establish school librarians’ leadership roles.
For library professionals, this study is significant because it is an opportunity to share
other librarians’ stages of concern regarding an innovation. Above all, the methodology of this
study informs researchers about new theories and research tools by incorporating the CBAM
theory and the Stages of Concern Questionnaire into the library field. Library educators are able
to use the results of the study to determine how school librarians serve as leaders for
incorporating innovations.
To other educators, this study plays a leading role in studying school librarians’ cognitive
reactions about innovations. While the previous research focused more how school librarians
apply and implement innovations, this study emphasizes how school librarians think, perceive
and prepare an innovation for students, teachers, administrators and community members. The
study encourages further research into a wide variety of issues related to school librarians.
1.4 Theoretical Framework
In order to study school librarians’ concerns about digital textbooks in Florida and South
Korea, the researcher utilized the CBAM because it is widely used as both theory and
methodology to identify an individual’s concern while implementing innovations and new
technologies. Also, the CBAM provides leaders with a unique way to facilitate innovation
integration (Hord, Rutherford, Huling-Austin, & Hall, 2006; Hord & Thurber, 1982) . In
addition, since the CBAM deals with top-down changes, the assumptions of the CBAM are in
accord with the research on digital textbook initiatives, which are also top-down projects.
Based on the importance of individuals and their adoption patterns, the CBAM was
devised to provide a theoretical framework and methodology to identify individual educators’
9

levels of concern and usage when implementing new technologies and innovations. During a
probationary period of twenty years, starting in the late 1980s, the CBAM was used to evaluate
educational innovations (Hollingshead, 2009; Lueddeke, 1997; Shoulders & Myers, 2011).
In order to answer the research questions, the study integrated the CBAM as a model, and
the Stages of Concern Questionnaire (SoCQ) in the CBAM as an instrument. The CBAM
“consists of three diagnostic dimensions that provide evidence of the current extent and quality
of implementation, which leaders can use to drive decisions and actions” (SEDL, 2015, para. 7).
The CBAM includes the concepts of stages of concern (SoC), levels of use (LoU), innovation
configurations (IC), change facilitator styles, and interventions (Anderson, 1997; Dirksen &
Tharp, 1997).
Among the three methods, this study focuses on the first tool, SoC, in order to make a
diagnosis of school librarians’ stages of concern as a preliminary study. There are three
techniques to assess the stages of concern about an innovation: one-legged conferencing, openended concern statements, and the SoCQ. These methods are explained further in Section
3.4.4.1. The study mainly applies the SoCQ as a tool to assess concerns, but the researcher also
added one open-ended question, such as “When you think about digital textbooks, what are you
concerned about?” (Hall & Hord, 1987, p. 66).
1.5 Research Design
This research leverages the advantages of survey research, providing “a quantitative or
numeric description of trends, attitudes, or opinions of a population” (Creswell, 2009, p.12).
Surveys enable researchers to collect large amounts of data by applying various types of
questions. Consequently, it is possible for the researcher to describe librarians’ understandings
about the innovative phenomena of digital textbooks, making the results statistically meaningful.
10

When employing survey method in research geared toward librarians’ perceptions, the researcher
can examine the responses of any sample of individuals. It is also possible for the researcher to
collect data at a relatively low cost and test that data relatively quickly. In addition, if the sample
size is statistically big enough, survey research can represent the attitudes and characteristics of a
larger population (Schutt, 2009). Therefore, the researcher employed the Stages of Concern
Questionnaire (SoCQ) to identify school librarians’ stages of concerns.
The population of this study was made up of school librarians who work in elementary
and secondary school libraries in Florida and South Korea; in both settings, there is an
impending mandate to utilize digital textbooks. The study employed an availability sample
method, requiring the researcher to select subjects based on certain characteristics (Schutt, 2009).
As school librarians act as educators, they fit without conflict into the CBAM’s framework as a
research population. Other limitations related to research design can be eliminated by applying a
comparison study. The study compared each stage within one profile, and also compared two
profiles from two different settings. The researcher believes that comparing each stage within
two profiles, unlike the first- and second-highest stage score interpretation, allows a closer look
at each specific stage without ignoring any one stage.
1.6 Conclusion
This chapter has discussed an overview of the study designed to identify school
librarians’ stages of concern in Florida and South Korea. In addition, the relationship between
personal characteristics and stages of concern is studied. Comparative research applying a survey
method examines societies or nations over time in comparison with each other (Schutt, 2009).
Cross-national surveys, which are conducted across multiple places, are becoming more popular
as the need for global data increases (Babbie, 2010). The study findings for each setting not only
11

determined the stages of concern in the context of school librarians’ practices and experiences,
but also compared the stages of concern depending upon those librarians’ demographic and
technological backgrounds. The study provided an opportunity for school librarians to share their
concerns, and it will help to inform librarians about digital textbooks in both Florida and South
Korea.
This chapter includes problem and purpose statements, research questions, a significance
of the study and an overview of the CBAM theory and research design. Chapter Two presents a
literature review related to school librarians’ leadership roles in technology integration, digital
textbooks, and CBAM.

CHAPTER 2
LITERATURE REVIEW

Chapter 1 describes the current status of digital textbook initiatives and the importance of
school librarians in the adoption and implementation of those initiatives. Research questions in
the study center on the relationship between school librarians’ concerns and the innovative
education technology of digital textbooks in Florida and South Korea in order to promote
librarians’ leadership roles in technology integration.
This chapter reviews literature related to school librarians’ leadership roles, examines
educational innovations regarding digital textbooks and details the conceptual framework of the
study. First, changes in school librarians’ leadership roles in technology integration is described.
Second, a note about the definition and characteristics of digital textbooks is followed by a
description of digital textbook initiatives. Lastly, the chapter gives the particulars of the
theoretical framework, CBAM and SoCQ.
2.1 School Librarians’ Leadership Roles in Technology Integration
Libraries have traditionally “housed the ‘universe of knowledge’ contained in books”
(Callahan, 1991) and librarians have provided users with tools to access this knowledge.
However, quickly evolving information technology has changed the ways in which information
is stored, presented, retrieved, and managed. In light of this change, librarians must meet
information needs by bridging the gap between new technological innovations and library users
(Callahan, 1991). Thus, librarians must understand and adapt to these innovations (Dority, 2006;
Martin, 2011). They must also unearth a body of knowledge within emerging information
resources and create added value for the information.
13

2.1.1 Studies Defining School Librarians’ Leadership Roles in Technology Integration
Previous studies have focused on identifying a range of definitions and prototypes for
school librarians’ leadership roles. Studies examine school librarians’ various roles and some
studies confirm that the leadership qualities of school librarians are complex and
multidimensional, rather than fragmentary (Everhart, 2011; Smith, 2013).
As a representative study, Everhart, Mardis, & Johnston (2012) conducted a national
survey with 295 National Board Certified school librarians in order to demonstrate those
librarians’ roles in integrating technology. Everhart et al. conclude that most school librarians
have a strong commitment to technology leadership by offering invaluable expertise to their
respective schools, including to faculty and students. Librarians were found to be involved in
disseminating information about technology use in the school and about advances in technology
to the community, as well as in advocating for the use of technology in schools.
Smith (2013) scrutinizes the perceptions of educators including school librarians,
administrators and lead teachers about the role of the school librarians at the elementary level.
Based on the literature review, the author analyzes three factors that lead to changes in the new
definition of the role of school librarians: technological advancements, accountability movement
and new demands for leadership. With the focus group discussion, Smith affirms that the
expectation for school librarians to be leaders in collaboration, instruction, leadership, student
learning, research, and advocacy is evident. The study finds that seven of the eleven items related
to leadership are loaded on the first factor, the Contemporary role, and the nearly one-third of
school librarians’ behaviors given in the Contemporary role are representative of leadership
roles.

14

Powell (2013) determines that there are no differences in saliency ratings on items related
to collaboration, leadership, and technology between Alternately Certified School Library Media
Specialists (AC SLMS) and Traditionally Certified School Library Media Specialists (TC
SLMS) by employing a survey, interviews, and analysis of reflective blogs. When Powell uses a
5-point criticality survey scale (1=unimportant to 5=crucial), the mean rates for the job task
analysis theme leadership (AC=2.91, TC=2.98) and technology (AC=3.09, TC=3.15) are close to
‘moderately important’ (=3). In terms of leadership theme, school librarians spent more time for
all 10 items, except two items related to facilitating an advisory committee and parent
organizations. Among the 10 items, school librarians spent the most time in informing other
faculty of new media center services, materials, and technology. In terms of the technology
theme, seven items out of 10 indicated that school librarians spent more time on this. It was
found that school librarians spent the most time in providing formal instruction in information
skills to students in classroom or small group settings. Through the comparison of studies in
1996, 2006, and 2012, the author establishes that school librarians have increased engagement in
technology.
In their attempts to define school librarians’ leadership roles and the factors impacting
those roles, the studies are more focused on describing particular phenomena and enumerating
factors (Johnston, 2011). However, these recent studies, in common, offer an important starting
point for this study demonstrating the growing importance of school librarians’ leadership roles
and the emergence of technology integration.
2.1.2 Studies Identifying the Factors Affecting Leadership Roles in Technology Integration
There have been attempts to identify the factors affecting the adoption of technology
innovations by school librarians. Forrest (1993) conducted an ethnographic case study applying
15

observations, interviews, document analyses and member checks. The author reveals that the
school librarians’ personal attitudes about information technologies—as well as their overall
profession—influenced the creation of an effective school library program and technology
environment. Also, the school librarians’ educational and professional activities are important in
facilitating innovation diffusion. In terms of supporting diffusion, the teachers’ and
administrators’ perceptions as co-workers and their supportive stance affected the roles of the
school librarians. Interestingly, school librarians could influence other faculty members’ attitudes
and behaviors toward technology innovation, and vice versa. Lastly, the author finds that
innovation diffusion in school libraries differs depending on teachers’ attitudes, individualized
training, and variable characteristics of the innovations.
Hughes-Hassell and Hanson-Baldauf (2008) report competencies and barriers related to
information and communication technologies. The authors find that 420 school librarians in
North Carolina had the highest level of competence with respect to e-mail, presentation tools,
and digital cameras, while they were unfamiliar with (level 0) or possess the lowest level of
competency with (level 1) such emergent technologies as social networking and file-sharing
tools, as well as virtual modeling tools and computer simulation. The barriers to technology
integration identified includes the lack of time, resources, and knowledge about how to use
technology personally and instructionally, as well as the lack of administrative support.
Johnston (2011) also determines the factors that enable school librarians to demonstrate,
and prevent them from demonstrating, their leadership in technology integration. The following
factors contribute to school librarians’ abilities to integrate technology: a supportive principal
(9.67%), opportunities for leadership roles and responsibilities (9.53%), the desire to make a
difference in students and teachers (9.53%), professional development opportunities (8.29%) and
16

a sense of obligation (6.63%). Conversely, the following factors act as barriers: time (25.68%),
exclusion from leadership roles and responsibilities (10.93%), lack of funding (9.02%),
inadequate staffing (6.83%), a competitive instructional technologist (5.74%), a climate of
competition with district technology departments (5.74%) and technology resources (5.74%).
Martin (2011) also points out the enabling factors for practicing leadership roles:
supportive administrators, collaboration and planning opportunities, assuming leadership,
professional development opportunities and activities, and supportive faculty (p.87). The limiting
factors found in this study are lack of time, lack of clerical support and other assigned duties,
lack of administrative support, lack of support and interest by teachers, and lack of adequate
funding (p.88).
2.1.3 Gaps between Research and Practice
While some researchers have found that school librarians express concern about their
leadership roles in technology integration, other researchers have found that, in practice, school
librarians are not as involved with technologies as they are supposed to be. Hughes-Hassell and
Hanson-Baldauf (2008) find that, despite school librarians’ low perceptions of emergent
technologies, 34.84% of the responders felt “well prepared” and 57.52% of them reported feeling
“somewhat prepared” to integrate technology into their instruction. Dotson and Jones (2011)
identify that, although a wide variety of leadership activities were reported, school librarians
remained notably traditional in their approach. The librarians studied seemed to contribute little
to the planning of activities and events in the schools. It has also been observed that school
librarians have become members of media and technology committees, yet less than 30% of
participants actually worked for those committees. Martin (2011) also finds that school librarians
ignore the survey statement about collaborating with the technology staff, finding that the
17

librarians ranked this collaboration as 7th in importance and 6th in practice among 15 statements
related to instructional leadership. By comparing studies conducted in 1996, 2006, and 2012,
Powell (2013a) concludes that school librarians are less aware of tasks that are not included in
their job descriptions for collaboration and technology.
While there are more studies emphasizing the importance of school librarians’ emerging
leadership roles in technology integration, in practice, school librarians are not aligned with
studies yet. Moreover, the studies have not provided a procedural guide for improving school
librarians’ leadership abilities or for providing the tools necessary to effectively evaluate their
leadership. This lack may provoke controversy about how to increase or demonstrate the
leadership, or what the best practices truly are. A study is required to demonstrate what the
stages of school librarians’ leadership are, and to illustrate the interventions to help them develop
their roles in technology integration.
2.2 School Librarians and a New Innovative Technology - Digital Textbooks
Since school libraries are usually the first place to introduce new educational
technologies, it is vital for school librarians to understand the significance of each technology. In
addition, school librarians are expected to have a positive attitude and perspective regarding the
effectiveness and merits of new technologies. In particular, a recent information innovation, the
e-book, already plays an important role in librarianship. While the transition from print books to
digital books has not been as rapid as anticipated, the paradigm is most certainly shifting,
creating opportunities for librarians to take on additional leadership roles (J. H.-Y. Kim & Jung,
2010; Mardis & Everhart, 2011). Within this changing environment, research offering cause
analyses and strategies for school librarians to refine their leadership roles would be of great
value.
18

2.2.1 Emerging Roles of School Librarians in Digital Textbook Implementation
The increasing number of studies and guidelines for school librarians emphasizes the
emerging role of leadership in all areas of schools. Especially in our fast-paced technological
society, school librarians’ leadership in terms of technology integration has received particular
attention. School librarians are requested to help students “develop information skills that will
enable them to use technology as an important tool for learning, both now and in the future”
(American Association of School Librarians, 2009, p. 13). Library media programs should make
available “the expansion and enhancement of new formats and resources” (National Board for
Professional Teaching Standards, 2012, p. 17).
Although job descriptions of school librarians regarding digital textbooks have not yet
been updated, the literature agrees that digital textbooks present another opportunity for school
librarians to consolidate their positions as the vital leaders in teaching and learning (Mardis et al.,
2010).
Digital textbooks represent another opportunity for school librarians to enhance their vital
leadership in teaching and learning. Librarians, of course, are experts at identifying,
collecting, and organizing the best content, free or for a fee…. In an age when many
school librarians are not sure about the continued relevance of their promotion of reading
and love of books, ebooks and digital textbooks may represent a fresh way to continue
advocacy for the importance of reading as well as for the school librarian's crucial
leadership role in technology integration (p. 14).
As digital textbooks are introduced, school librarians will continue their primary tasks
while their job assignments evolve to incorporate a new set of tasks. The traditional
responsibilities of selecting materials and finding resources corresponding to curriculum needs
19

and students’ reading interests and levels will continue (Fredrick, 2011). As Mardis and Everhart
(2011) demonstrate, the roles school librarians play in transitioning to digital textbooks will be
expanded to include testing e-reader functions, registering them, developing collections and
conducting pilot studies. An extension of the current job for physical textbook circulation, school
librarians’ duties surrounding digital textbooks will create new job responsibilities, including
developing circulation strategies and action plans, creating new ways to collaborate with teachers
and considering technology issues. In other words, school librarians use their expert knowledge
and experience at “identifying, collecting, and organizing the best content” (Mardis et al., 2010,
p. 14) to build and implement open-content learning resources. The additional point from Kang
and Everhart (2014a) is that because most school librarians are responsible for print textbooks in
schools, they are more likely to continue this job with digital textbooks.
2.2.2 Unique Characteristics of Digital Textbooks in Relation to School Librarians
Compared to traditional textbooks, digital textbooks have unique characteristics and for
this reason, digital textbooks have various definitions. Mardis et al. (2010) emphasize various
formats of digital textbooks that include “electronic textbooks (digital textbooks) specially
created for a reader, read-on-demand computer-based textbooks, print-on-demand digital
textbooks, and modular assemblages of audio, visual, interactive, and text resources” (p. 3).
Chesser (2011) includes in the definition of digital textbooks replicas of traditional print
textbooks, wiki version open textbooks and nontraditional content such as games, animations,
online labs and online assessments. S. J. Kim, Park, Seo & Lee (2011) define a digital textbook
as “a medium that converges analogue with digital in the teaching and learning field in schools,
and possesses the advantages of both online and offline media” (p. 432). The authors highlight

20

the connectivity between analogue and digital and discern differences between two formats, as
shown in Table 1.

According to Table 1, since digital textbooks provide abundant information from the
internet, and that information includes not only textbooks, references, workbooks and self21

teaching guides, but also rich multimedia content including games, animations, video-audio
clips, internet-based virtual laboratories and virtual reality (J. H.-Y. Kim & Jung, 2010; Mardis
et al., 2010), school librarians should develop more and various digital collections, and make
sure that the library collection is up to date (American Association of School Librarians, 2009).
In fact, previous research has found that school librarians are in charge of identifying and
implementing digital content and purchasing or downloading books (Mardis & Everhart, 2011;
Wolf, Jones, & Gilbert, 2014). Another feature of digital textbooks is working in a device. Since
textbooks are non-exclusive, all students need devices. In order to build the learning environment
(American Association of School Librarians, 2009), school librarians take care of creating a
policy regarding devices such as a "Bring Your Own Device” (BYOD) or “Bring Your Own
Technology” (BYOT) program, purchasing and registering devices and maintaining e-readers
(Mardis & Everhart, 2011; Wolf et al., 2014).
Pedagogically, digital textbooks enable differentiation within instruction. Since digital
textbooks can differ depending on each student’s level, teachers can offer personalized and
customized teaching, and this differentiated strategy allows teachers to set student-centered
immersive activities and assignments (J. H.-Y. Kim & Jung, 2010). Digital textbooks also enable
educators to do more collaborative work and promote social interaction with other educators
(McKiernan, 2011). Therefore, school librarians need to recognize the new way to promote
students’ creativity, to collaborate with other educators and support them in use of digital
textbooks (Mardis & Everhart, 2011).
2.2.3 Digital Textbook Initiatives: World-wide, Florida and South Korea
The US federal government is pouring much effort into digital textbook initiatives. In
2012, the federal government declared a plan to bring digital textbooks to every student by 2017.
22

Trying to initiate this plan and accelerate this transition, the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) and the United States Department of Education (USDOE) have developed
the Digital Textbook Collaborative and released the “Digital Textbook Playbook,” a blueprint for
steering educators towards digital learning implementation (Tomassini, 2012).
However, textbook adoption is primarily considered a statewide convention (Mardis et
al., 2010); in fact, many states are embarking on adoption initiatives. According to Fletcher et al.
(2012), seven states, including Alabama, Florida, Idaho, Nebraska, North Carolina, Texas and
Virginia have launched digital initiatives, and five states, including California, Maine, New
York, Utah and Washington, have launched Open Educational Resources (OER) initiatives.
Moreover, 12 states, including Illinois and Ohio, have definitive textbook innovation policies
that come with funding. As a pioneer, California started its three-phase initiative for free digital
textbooks in 2009, and the California Learning Resources Network (CLRN) now coordinates
expert educators and content specialists who conduct reviews (Hill, 2010). As described above,
Florida is heeding this crucial initiative. In June 2011, Florida’s governor signed a bill mandating
all Florida’s public schools use entirely digital textbooks and assessments by 2015. Within two
years, the U.S. will invest about two billion dollars in digital textbooks (Kwang, 2011).
By no means is the U.S. the only nation rolling out digital textbook initiatives. According
to the European Commission’s report, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore and South Korea, as well as
several European countries, have embarked on digital textbook projects (Kampylis et al., 2013).
In particular, As a part of a school reform, the Education Ministry of South Korea announced a
digital textbook initiative on March 8, 2007 (J. H.-Y. Kim & Jung, 2010). In order to solve
private education problems and strengthen the competitiveness of schools, the plan to develop
digital textbook systems include six phases occurring between 2007 and 2011. The
23

implementation is expected to create a learner-centered environment, extend an overseas market,
and reduce the learning and digital gap in hopes of raising achievement among a neglected class
of students. Since then, the Korean government has been developing digital textbooks that
combine various ubiquitous technologies (B. G. Lee, Kim, Park, Kim, & Jeong, 2012). The
South Korean Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (MEST) is conducting pilot
studies (J. H.-Y. Kim & Jung, 2010). Hundreds of elementary and middle schools around the
country during 2014 were using digital textbooks, and full enforcement is to be determined in the
first half of 2015.
2.3 CBAM
The Concern-Based Adoption Model (CBAM) provides a theoretical framework because
the theory can identify the developmental process that individual school librarian experience as
they implement digital textbooks.
Ongoing efforts to educate people more efficiently have brought about various changes in
education. Teachers, administrative staff, principals, and policy/law makers, as well as parents
and even sometimes students themselves, have been leaders and agents in various educational
reforms. Persistent changes in education professionals’ thoughts and actions were induced not
only by changes in the educational environment such as the enactment of new regulations and
guidelines, theoretical developments, educational paradigm shifts, and the advent of
technologies, but also by various educational initiatives such as changes in site-based
management and professional development, high-stakes testing, adoption of new curricula and
materials, and evolution of teacher evaluative methods (Donald & Sharon, 1992; George, Hall, &
Stiegelbauer, 2013). Much of the research on the adoption of innovation has emphasized
individual educators’ adoption patterns, which are decisive factors in new technology
24

implementation. An individual can have an impact on an entire organization’s ability to adopt
innovations, as well as the outcome of those adoptions (Jantz, 2012; Straub, 2009).
Although decisions about educational innovation integrations are frequently dependent
on higher levels of authority rather than on each school or teacher, the actual implementation of
innovation is applied on a personal level (Hall & Hord, 1987; Hord et al., 2006; Straub, 2009).
Therefore, when one attempts to understand the adoption of innovation, it is necessary to ask
certain questions: Why does an individual adopt a specific innovation rather than some other
alternative? How does an individual feel about the innovation? What are the roles of social
contexts in this decision? (Straub, 2009).
2.3.1 Rationale for Applying the CBAM
The researcher chose the CBAM not only “to diagnose individual staff concerns,” but
also “to decide which interventions might be helpful in facilitating staff effectiveness” (Hord &
Thurber, 1982, p. 20). As the CBAM offers leaders “a unique approach to the facilitation of
instructional improvement and to the support of faculty involved in school improvement efforts”
(p. 3), the researcher has taken advantage of this approach to determine the developmental
process that school librarians experience as leaders as they integrate a new innovation, digital
textbooks, and to recommend various events and methods to make them even more effective
leaders.
It is worth noting that, in this context, the CBAM regards leadership as “a prescriptive
activity which includes the use of reliable data for making informed decisions about actions to be
taken. The model contains procedures for collecting such data” (p. 20). Therefore, the theory
assumes that it is possible for educational leaders to take action with the information provided by
the CBAM, thereby strengthening their leadership (p. 20). The researcher used this assumption in
25

applying the SoCQ as a diagnostic tool and the Intervention Taxonomy, which is a framework to
describe “the actions and events that teachers’ use of an innovation” (Hall & Hord, 1987, p.15)
as a tool “in choosing interventions to increase effective leadership” (Hord & Thurber, 1982, p.
5) in the discussion section.
The term “concern” does not mean simply someone’s psychological state or cognition.
The concept of concern has a broader meaning, and the operational definition of concern in the
CBAM is the composite representation of humans’ feelings and knowledge about a specific
event or issue. Furthermore, it includes an individual’s human experience - including attitudes,
concerns and beliefs (Buckner, 2013) referring to “questioning, analyzing, and re-analyzing,
considering alternative actions and reactions, and anticipating consequences” (Hall & Hord,
2011, p. 72). It is clear that the CBAM is not only a simple tool to describe the process of
individuals who experience an innovation, but also a comprehensive tool to determine “how to
plan for and manage change more efficiently and effectively” (Hord et al., 2006, p. 74).
2.3.2 Core Concepts
The principal measure of CBAM is concern, and this term contains broad significance
reflecting a complex environment. “Concern” is defined as:
The composite representation of the feelings, preoccupation, thought, and consideration
given to a particular issue or task is called concern. Depending on our personal make-up,
knowledge, and experience, each person perceives and mentally contends with a given
issue differently; thus there are different kinds of concerns. The issue may be interpreted
as an outside threat to one’s well-being, or it may be seen as rewarding. There may be an
overwhelming feeling of confusion and lack of information about what “it” is. There may
be ruminations about the effects. The demand to consider the issue may be self-imposed
26

in the form of a goal or objective that we wish to reach, or the pressure that results in
increased attention to the issue may be external. In response to the demand, our minds
explore ways, means, potential barriers, possible actions, risks, and rewards in relation to
the demand. All in all, the mental activity composed of questioning, analyzing, and
anticipating consequences is concern (Hall, George, & Rutherford, 1977, p. 5).
Overall, a concern is a psychological action based on personal make-up, prior knowledge,
and prior experience when facing new experiences or environments and evaluating the need for
improvement or change (Hall & Hord, 1987). This definition encompasses all stages of concern,
examined below. Concern carries with it no negative or positive connotations, and CBAM
considers a concern to be a dynamic phenomenon. When an individual has more intense concern,
this person is considered more likely to have “greatly increased mental activity, thought, worry,
analysis, and anticipation” (Hall et al., 1977, p. 5). Regardless of an educator’s classification
(classroom teacher, librarian, principal, or administrator), each educator has a different stages of
concerns (SoC); therefore, each SoC has a different level of intensity.
However, it is true that the concept of concern is sometimes misunderstood by both
researchers and participants. The study from Newhouse (2001) serves as an example. While
determining teachers’ concerns about the implementation of portable computers in schools,
Newhouse employed SoCQ. The author found that 53% of teachers’ concerns fell in Stage 0,
Unconcerned. When the author analyzed this data, he mentioned that “some of these teachers
may have interpreted the term ‘concern’ to mean ‘worried’ and, therefore, rather than lacking
awareness or interest they may have been indicating confidence and lack of worry” (p. 10-11).
These findings show that it is critical for researchers and participants to understand the real
meaning of concern, and it is important to discuss the accurate definition of concern.
27

In terms of understanding what an innovation is innovation originates from concerns
according to the CBAM. Rogers (1983), author of the famous book Diffusion of Innovations,
extends the definition of innovation in his research to adoption of that innovation. Therefore,
Hall et al. (1977, p. 5) define an innovation as “the general name given to the issue, object,
problem, or challenge, the thing that is the focus of the concerns”. On the other hand, Rogers
(1983, p. 11) defines an innovation as an “idea, practice or object that is perceived as new by an
individual or other unit of adoption.” In other words, an innovation is novel and includes both
new abstract ideas and concrete technologies. This study focuses in particular on the new
innovation of digital textbooks to identify school librarians’ mental statuses with regard to this
technology.
The study focuses specifically on a new piece of technology, a digital textbook, to
identify school librarians’ mental statuses with regard to this technology. The research topic,
however, is not limited to the digital textbook itself, but rather focuses on various matters related
to digital textbooks, such as culture, policy, education system, role of educators, etc. Therefore,
the concept of innovation should extend its scope, so that research to fully explore an innovation
can fit the concept of innovation.
2.3.3 Assumptions / Perspective
The CBAM developed hyper-sophisticated assumptions (Hord et al., 2006, pp. 5-7).
i. Change is a process, not an event.
ii. Change is accomplished by individuals.
iii. Change is a highly personal experience.
iv. Change involves developmental growth.
v. Change is best understood in operational terms.
28

vi. The focus of facilitation should be on individuals, innovations, and the context.
Change is a process for and by participants, and anyone can participate. The authors
emphasize the importance of an individual’s decision about whether or not to adopt or reject the
innovation. The success or failure of an implementation is predicated upon participants’ thoughts
about interventions “made at appropriate times, places, or in ways perceived by the clients as
relevant” (Hall & Hord, 1987, p. 8). Also, this perspective stresses the significance of time. The
CBAM hypothesis is that educational innovation adoption takes time, and that there are several
phases to go through to implement new plans.
These assumptions have been verified by studying school changes, and they have become
the basis of the current version of the CBAM. The latest assumptions put more emphasis on the
importance of each individual’s role in an adoption, while continually stressing the significance
of progress and stages of implementation. Hord et al. note that only changes in people’s
behavior, not changes in materials or equipment, bring actual change. The new element here is
that the CBAM focuses on front-line educators and the contexts in which they practice. The
CBAM considers that only individual users can enable change through their appropriate actions.
2.3.4 Change Facilitator and Three Diagnostic Dimensions
One of the distinctive concepts of CBAM is the Change Facilitator (CF). In CBAM, CF
is the smallest unit to embrace an innovation. Change facilitators can be “principals, teachers,
district personnel, intermediate and higher education personnel, and others who, for brief or
extended periods, assist various individuals and groups in developing the competence and
confidence needed to use a particular innovation” (Hall & Hord, 1987, p. 11). The CF acts an
assistant for others to become skilled in using a new innovation. The term CF was developed as a
counter to the traditional term, change agent, which was suggestive of a top-down, one-way and
29

coercive approach. In order for change facilitators to work effectively, they need to identify
teachers’ requirements. Also, facilitators can ensure that resource systems are used properly.
To maximize the change in facilitators’ roles, administrators should understand the
individuals or groups that embrace the innovation. Therefore, for this diagnosis, CBAM designs
three diagnostic dimensions: 1) Stages of Concern (SoC), which is the main idea employed in
this study; 2) Level of Use (LoU); and 3) Innovation Configurations (IC) (Anderson, 1997;
Dorksen & Tharp, 1997). The SoC measures the intensity of individuals’ feelings and
perceptions regarding an innovation. LoU demonstrates how well the staff members are using an
innovation. IC maps provide a big picture of the operational components.
In this research, the detail of the stages of concern (SoC) is provided. The SoC
encompasses seven categories defined in Table 2. In each stage, an individual experiences a
particular concern (George et al., 2013). Although these seven stages have distinctive
characteristics, they are not exclusive of one another. The model assumes that when individuals
encounter a new innovation, they are interested in all stages, but score more highly in a particular
stage. As time goes by and an individual’s concern in a certain stage subsides, then other
concerns will emerge.
In Stage 0, Unconcerned (formerly called awareness), individuals are not concerned
about the innovation or involvement (George et al., 2013). Stage 1, Informational, indicates
individuals are generally aware of the innovation and begin to cultivate an interest. Those
individuals, however, focus on more impersonal, substantive aspects of the innovation than on
personal concerns. In Stage 2, Personal, individuals begin to have concerns related to personal
matters. They are inquisitive about expected demands, their roles in meeting these demands, the
renewal structure of their organization, and any potential conflicts with other personnel’s
30

31

commitments. In Stage 3, Management, individuals consider how to implement the innovation
efficiently, and how to make the best use of information and resources. Issues around managing,
organizing, and scheduling may occur. In Stage 4, Consequence, individuals have intensive
concerns about the impact on students, including the relevance of the innovation, evaluating
students, and changes to improve students’ outcomes. In the collaboration stage, Stage 5,
Collaboration, individuals focus on how to collaborate or cooperate with others to apply the
innovation. In the last stage, Stage 6, Refocusing, individuals focus on how to improve the
innovation’s applications, how to maximize the benefits of the innovation or how to revise
current usage to a more cogent alternative.
The seven stages of concern consist of three different types of concerns: Self, Task, and
Impact. Self concerns are low level concerns which “evolve around general characteristics,
effects, requirement of use and financial or status implications of the innovation” (Samiei, 2008,
p. 26). Task concerns are associated with the process and task-related matters. Impact concerns
reflect a more advanced level of involvement than the other types of concern. These dimensions
are also provided in Table 2.
At the initial phase of an innovation’s use, educators typically have intensive Selfconcerns (Stage 1, Informational; Stage 2, Personal). They would like to know more about the
innovation and discover any changes that the innovation might bring. Educators are also curious
about when the innovation will be implemented, who will be charge of the change, and how the
new model is expected to work. Even though educators may not state it openly, they may still
have intense personal concerns in the pioneering phases. Teachers may also worry about their
abilities, responsibilities, the possibility of mistakes, and changes to their work routines.

32

Task-concerns (Stage 3, Management) are likely to be most intense in the latter part of
innovation preparation (Hord et al., 2006). In the early stages of use, educators will consider
management concerns such as meeting various student needs and differing learning styles,
maximizing the effectiveness of learning materials, planning for additional prep-time prior to
instruction, and arranging classroom procedures and materials.
When the innovation catches on across schools, all educators may develop intense
Impact-concerns (Stage 4, Consequence; Stage 5, Collaboration; Stage 6, Refocusing). Only a
few educators will reach the impact level. Such concerns may include the outcome of activities
related to the innovation, how they will work together with others, or how they may find better
ways to apply the innovation.
The Levels of Use (LoU) is the second dimension. As mentioned earlier, the primary
responsibility of the facilitators of the change is to guide individuals to the successful
implementation of the innovation. To do this, they need to know how well individuals are using
the innovation. LoU describes “the behaviors of the users of an innovation through various
stages—from spending most effort in orienting, to managing, and finally to integrating use of the
innovation” (Hord et al., 2006, p. 54). LoU attempts to categorize individuals operationally in
terms of what they are doing, rather than identifying the causality or attitudinal, motivational or
other affective aspects of the user (p.54).
The Innovation Configuration (IC) is the third diagnostic dimension of CBAM. The IC
determines characteristics of the innovation, and it works as a frame of reference when the
innovation is implemented. The IC is developed to gather and summarize data “identifying the
basic components of an innovation and, within each component, identifying the variations that

33

describe how individual teachers might use the components in their classrooms” (Hall & Hord,
1987, p. 116).
The IC can be a meaningful tool for various reasons (LaTurner, Lewis, & Litke, 2013, p.
28). For research, an IC map standardizes what participants in a control group should do to
guarantee consistency. To disseminate an innovation, an IC map can demonstrate what a new
practice looks like, and what it does not look like. It also provides data to identify characteristics
regarding an innovation which could be needed for future development. Moreover, it is a useful
tool to illustrate the scope of the innovation that has been implemented.
2.3.5 Intervention Taxonomy
Although the three diagnostic dimensions of the CBAM provide a deep understanding
about educators’ concerns and their use of a particular innovation, they do not offer action plans
to change facilitators on the basis of the assessment. In order to address such shortcomings,
CBAM researchers developed the concept of interventions. An intervention is “an action or event
or a set of actions or events that influences use of the innovation” (Hall & Hord, 1986, p. 143).
Six levels of intervention have been determined: policy, game plan, strategy, tactics, incident,
and theme (Hall, Zigarmi and Hord, 1979, p. 23). (1) In implementing an innovation, policy
dictates the procedures and actions of the organization overall; (2) the game plan is the actual
action plan used to implement the innovation, and includes six components; (3) the strategy is a
framework for action that demonstrates how to actualize the design of the game plan; (4) tactics
are the methods used to operationalize the strategies. They are used for a relatively short period
of time and are likely to be applied to a particular innovator rather than to all of the educators;
(5) an incident is a single action or event implemented for a very short time period, and (6) a

34

theme is the only unsponsored intervention and refers to “the set of actions and their cumulative
effect on the change effort” (p.21).
For people who are responsible for the innovation in schools, the CBAM suggests some
possible interventions for each stage (Hord & Loucks, 1980; Hord et al., 2006). For example, the
model proposes the following interventions to educators who have high Stage 2, Personal
concerns, “establish rapport, encourage and assure the teacher s/he can do it” (Hord & Loucks,
1980, p. 29). When the researcher developed a discussion section of the study in section 5.5, the
researcher took advantage of these interventions according to the results from the surveys.
2.3.6 Application of CBAM in Leadership Studies
Since the 1980s, the CBAM has been applied to evaluate educational innovations.
Several researchers have applied the SoCQ to enhance educators’ leadership roles in
implementing new innovations. For example, Hord and Thurber (1982) trained principals how to
use the SoCQ to enhance their leadership skills when integrating a new curriculum. According to
the authors, principals in Florida identified school teachers’ concerns and applied interventions
to address them. Most principals reported that the given interventions solicited teachers’
concerns, and this study confirms that principals’ engagement with the leadership tools helped
the teachers address each of the stages of their concerns.
Wells (1999) studied the concerns of nine school leadership personnel with regard to
implementing the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) curricular requirements. He
conducted surveys and semi-structured interviews with principals, superintendents and
technology coordinators within the Salk Fork Educational Technology Consortium. Applying the
CBAM theory, Wells finds that the participants are primarily at the TASK level, indicating that
they are likely to have more advanced concerns. He also discovered seven thematic concerns
35

about attitudes, power, student learning, distance learning, staff training, infrastructure, and
finances. This study is an example of how to apply the SoCQ to a school leadership cadre, but
the author does not introduce any interventions in order to increase their leadership.
Hoyt (2000) analyzed the comments from the transcripts of the recorded focus group
sessions to identify the three sources of data: what are the training needs of educators; who are
responsible for implementing inclusive education; where their concerns are located based on the
CBAM model; and how transformational leadership works. In order for educational
administrators to provide the tools to inform themselves about educators’ concerns, the author
applied the CBAM model. As a result of the study, the author determines that educators have
high intensity in Stages 0, 1 and 2, and suggests some useful interventions to enhance schoolbased administrators’ leadership. For example, the author urges that administrators should
present general descriptive information about the new program and how this impacts educators.
Buckner’s (2013) research has the most similar design with this present study. The author
explored elementary principals’ perception about the implementation of Response to Intervention
(RtI) in North Carolina. The author finds that while Unconcerned (Stage 0) is the most frequent
peak concern area, Consequence (Stage 4) is the lowest area of concern. The descriptive and
statistical results from the study are suggested as implications for leadership practices.
2.4 Conclusion
In this chapter, a review of the literature related to school librarians’ leadership roles in
technology integration and the emergence of digital textbooks and the CBAM theory is
presented. Previous studies demonstrate that school librarians should play a critical role in
technology integration and studies show which factors can promote this role. Despite the studies’
emphases on the importance of school librarians’ roles, other studies report a discrepancy
36

between research and practice. School librarians still need more effort to be leaders, and they
should have more knowledge to prepare for new innovations. However, there is a dearth of
research evaluating school librarians’ current stages of concern and providing a practical
procedural guide for them. A formal study of their concerns when this new innovation is being
imposed could provide research data that will contribute in providing this leadership guide.
The current study, as an attempt to bridge this gap, identifies the current stages of
concern that school librarians have associated with digital textbooks by applying the SoCQ, one
of the techniques for the CBAM. The data from the surveys is associated with the CBAM, and
can be used to align interventions such as professional development to enhance school librarians’
leadership roles in technology integration.

CHAPTER 3
METHODOLOGY
3.1 Introduction
The research methodology is determined by considerations about not only the nature of
the research questions, but also the researchers’ experiences and target audiences. Research
methodology, therefore, is a spiral stream that covers research design, sampling, ethics,
coding/measurement, and analysis (Vogt, Gardner, & Haeffele, 2012). Indicating those factors,
this chapter provides a framework for the design and execution of the study of school librarians’
concerns in the implementation of digital textbooks. The content of this chapter covers a
description of the design and research questions; survey design; instruments; data collection
procedures; validity and reliability of that data; benefits, assumptions and limitations; ethical
considerations; and a conclusion of the chapter.
3.2 Research Design
This study postulates that survey is an essential method in the investigation of school
librarians’ concerns, including perceptions, feelings and attitudes regarding digital text-books in
two different geographical settings, Florida and South Korea. The researcher collected archival
data by employing the Stages of Concern Questionnaire (SoCQ) and added to that questionnaire
10 questions regarding demographics which seek to explore relationships between the SoC and
individual’s characteristics. Applying the SoCQ, the researcher employed the two analytic
methods that were recommended by Hord et al. (2006): raw scores and percentile scores.

38

3.3 Research Questions
The study is framed by the research questions that were previously delineated in Chapter
One.
• Research Question 1: Based on the Stages of Concern (SoC), what are the school
librarians’ stages of concern regarding the mandated implementation of digital textbooks
in Florida?
1) Based on the SoCQ, what are the school librarians’ highest stage of concern
surrounding implementation of digital textbooks?
2) Is there a significant relationship between school librarians’ stages of concern
regarding digital textbooks and those teachers’ experience in years?
3) Is there a significant relationship between school librarians’ stages of concern
regarding digital textbooks and those teachers’ technology adoption style?
4) Is there a significant relationship between school librarians’ stages of concern
regarding digital textbooks and those teachers’ personal experiences with e-books?
5) Is there a significant relationship between school librarians’ stages of concern
regarding digital textbooks and the training sessions provided for those librarians?
• Research Question 2: Based on the SoC, what are the school librarians’ stages of
concern around the implementation of digital textbooks in South Korea?
1) Based on the SoCQ, what are the school librarians’ highest stages of concern
surrounding the implementation of digital textbooks?
2) Is there a significant relationship between school librarians’ stages of concern
regarding digital textbooks and those teachers’ experience in years?

39

3) Is there a significant relationship between school librarians’ stages of concern
regarding digital textbooks and those teachers’ technology adoption style?
4) Is there a significant relationship between school librarians’ stages of concern
regarding digital textbooks and those teachers’ personal experiences with e-books?
5) Is there a significant relationship between school librarians’ stages of concern
regarding digital textbooks and the training sessions provided for those librarians?
• Research Question 3: Are there significant statistical differences in the stages of
concern identified for school librarians in Florida and South Korea?
1) What are the differences between the highest and second highest stages of concern for
school librarians in Florida and South Korea?
2) What main factors influence the differences in these two marginal stages?
These three main questions describe in detail the school librarians’ level of concerns. The
first research question elaborates Florida school librarians’ levels of concern regarding digital
textbooks, while the second research question elaborates those of school librarians in South
Korea. The third research question focuses on the differences between the two groups and
analyzes the main factors that influence these variations.
3.4 Survey
A survey is a common research method that studies a relatively small sample to
determine trends involving, attitudes toward, or opinions held by a population about a given
phenomenon (Babbie, 1973; Connaway & Powell, 2010; Creswell, 2009). The literal meaning of
survey is to look carefully or examine some situations thoroughly. In a broad sense, therefore, to
survey is to observe something. In the purposed study, a survey is a method in which the
researcher collects data from individuals, using questionnaires, with the intent of generalizing
40

results from a smaller group, sample, to a larger group, population. The original purposes of a
survey were description, explanation and exploration studies, but today survey purposes are
specialized to cross-sectional study, trend study, cohort study, panel study, approximation of a
longitudinal study, parallel samples study, contextual study, sociometric study and critical
incident study (Babbie, 1973; Connaway & Powell, 2010).
3.4.1 Rationale for Employing a Survey
With its lengthy history, survey research has numerous proven advantages. The strongest
element of a survey is that researchers can clarify and understand new concepts, problems, and
phenomena by studying a small number of samples. By following scientific and logical
procedures, researchers can draw inferences about a large group from the results of the sample.
Survey research enables researchers to gather contemporary data more easily, as it collects a
relatively small amount of data, and facilitates studying more personal factors such as opinions,
beliefs, attitudes, values, and experiences, as well as objective facts (Connaway & Powell, 2010).
These characteristics also make survey research cost-effective and reduce geographical issues for
researchers (Schutt, 2009).
Perhaps the greatest strength of survey research is in the way it is conducted.
Standardized surveys and advanced statistical analysis techniques allow researchers to test
observations numerically, avoiding conflicts regarding validity and reliability (Creswell, 2009).
Since a survey is facilitated by following and carefully implementing a researcher’s own logic,
and because survey research has developed step-by-step over time, researchers can test
comprehensive propositions with various variables (Babbie, 1973, p. 46).

41

3.4.2 Unit of Analysis
This study combines two kinds of units of analysis: individual school librarian and
groups of school librarians in Florida and South Korea. For the first two research questions, the
researcher collected data from an individual school librarian and analyzed that librarian’s scores.
In fact, studying an individual librarian’s concern is essential to the CBAM theory because it is
designed to measure “the personal side of change” (Hall & Hord, 1987, p. 53). Moreover,
individuals’ adoption patterns of innovation are decisive factors in successful implementation
(Straub, 2009) and the individual can impact the organization’s ability to adopt the innovation
and its outcomes as well (Jantz, 2012). Data for the research questions one and two were
collected from each K-12 school librarian working in Florida and South Korea.
In contrast, the third research question deals with a comparison of two cases and the unit
of analysis for the question is the two groups of school librarians. The researcher manipulated the
two groups’ average levels of concern in four basic areas: Impact, Task, Self and Unconcerned.
The difference between the two groups is that one group is comprised of school librarians in one
state, while another group is comprised of school librarians in one nation. In terms of applying
multilevel unit of analysis, it is worthwhile to refer to Manzon’s (2007) assertion. Manzon
emphasizes the importance of establishing parameters for the initial comparability of units of
analysis, while elaborating the use of geographic entities as a unit of analysis. According to
Manzon, there are seven geographic entities as units of analysis: world regions/continents,
countries, states/provinces, districts, schools, classrooms and individuals. Recently, however,
Manzon argues that the number of studies dealing with multilevel analysis is increasing, and
studying these geographic entities could be considered a balanced and holistic way to understand
educational phenomena (Manzon, 2007, p. 116). The spiral process across the macro, meso and
42

micro levels of units enables researchers to study not only globally and universally but also
individually or situationally. Scheuch (1989) also agrees that the unit of explanation should differ
according to the purpose of research. The author purports that using a country as a unit of
research is practically easy, but it is not always unique. Therefore, when designing a survey, as
Scheuch (1989) argues, researchers should consider intervening and contextual factors and
choose a data collection frame based on those theories. This study targets two population groups
which are distinguished by geography and culture. School librarians in Florida and South Korea
are not the same geographical entities. However, practically, there are many occupational
similarities between those two population groups, and both groups have systematic educational
departments and regulations. By comparing two different units facing similar challenges in
adopting the same innovations, this study attempts to more specifically describe the culture
related to school library systems in Florida and South Korea in terms of their respective stages of
concern.
3.4.3 Population and Sampling
3.4.3.1 Population. The population of this study includes all school librarians who work
for primary and secondary school libraries in the state of Florida and the nation of South Korea.
Often called “school media specialists” or “teacher librarians”, this population engages in a
diverse range of roles as leaders, instructional partners, information specialists, teachers, and
program administrators (American Association of School Librarians, 2009, pp. 17-18).
3.4.3.1.1 School Librarians in Florida. 2,182 school librarians—including “audio-visual
workers”—worked in Florida as of fall 2013 (The Florida Department of Education, 2014).
2,165 full-time school librarians worked in 68 school districts and there were 17 part-time
librarians (K. Ward, personal communication, December 31, 2014). According to Florida state
43

law, school librarians are responsible for library services, making information resources
available, and holding a proper professional certificate (Florida Statutes, 2012). In Title
XLVIII—which deals with education issues including student and parental rights, public
education, educational financial assistance, and funding—Chapter 1012 Section 01 lists
personnel roles, defining school librarians/media specialists as the following:
Staff members responsible for providing school library media services. These employees
are responsible for evaluating, selecting, organizing, and managing media and technology
resources, equipment, and related systems; facilitating access to information resources
beyond the school; working with teachers to make resources available in instructional
programs; assisting teachers and students in media productions; and instructing students
in the location and use of information resources (para.5).
3.4.3.1.2 School librarians in South Korea. The 2013 Korea Library Yearbook (Ministry
of Culture Sports and Tourism & Korean Library Association, 2014) reports 5,087 school library
personnel (including 674 school librarians) who were classroom teachers with library certificates
and 4,413 practical education teachers. Furthermore, the Libraries Act (Ministry of Culture
Sports and Tourism, 2012) describes school librarians’ roles as administrators, educators, and
information service providers. Article 38 of the Libraries Act, however, places more emphasis on
school librarians’ traditional roles. Although the law mentions some roles related to educational
technology, these roles are confined to those that “assist in the teaching and studying activities of
students, [and] teachers” (para. 38) rather than roles specifically as technology leaders. This role
includes the following requirements: Collection, organization, preservation, and provision of
services of materials necessary for school education;

44

x

The collection, organization, preservation, and provision of services for materials

necessary for school education;
x

A combined administration and provision for use educational materials kept by a school;

x

The development, manufacture, and provision for use of audio-visual materials and

multimedia materials;
x

The construction of an information sharing system utilizing information management

systems and communication networks, as well as the provision for use of such a system;
x

The education of information utilization through education on library use, reading,

cooperative teaching, etc.; and
x

Other duties necessary for the execution of functions as a school librarian.
3.4.3.2 Sampling. To select the participants for the survey, the researcher applies

availability sampling, sometimes known as accidental, convenience, grab, or opportunity
sampling, which can increase the likelihood of sampling error. In availability sampling,
participants are recruited because they are available or easy to find (Schutt, 2009, p. 170).
Despite this convenience, the results can differ from those that might be obtained from an entire
population, thus leading to possible systematic bias. Along with that bias, availability sampling
has a limited value in generalizing and making inferences about the population, which may
reduce opportunities for applications to settings with other populations or treatments. Despite
these potential errors, however, availability sampling is often appropriate in social research, and
is widely used in social science research because it is convenient, inexpensive, and easy to
conduct. Availability sampling can thus be particularly useful when researchers examine a new
setting, attempt to ascertain prevailing attitudes, or conduct initial research using a new set of
questions (Schutt, 2009).
45

Availability sampling can increase the likelihood of sampling error (Leeuw, Hox, &
Dillman, 2008; Pickard, 2007; Schutt, 2009). This survey was well-designed, however, and the
screening criteria is given to reduce sampling errors. The researcher endeavored to promote the
research and recruited the greatest possible number of participants to better analyze the results.
Also, this study provides the demographic information of integrated samples and the population
itself to allow readers to compare the two data sets and infer the similarities and differences
between them.
3.4.3.3 Participants. The participants in this study were volunteers among school
librarians who were invited by promotional emails during the 2014 school year. An assumption
from the availability sampling was made that the participants’ demographics were statistically
similar to the target population. The three demographic questions collected during the surveys
were used to evaluate this assumption that each sample group was identical with the population.
The details about the survey process to obtain participants is shown in section 3.4.5.4 and the
section 4.2 covers the details of participants’ characteristics.
3.4.4 Instrument Design: the SoCQ and Demographic Survey
3.4.4.1 The description of the SoCQ. The SoCQ is the primary method to identify
where an individual’s major concern is in the stages alongside one-legged conferencing and
open-ended concerns statements (George et al., 2013; Hall et al., 1977; Hall & Hord, 1987).
While one-legged conferencing consists of brief moments of conversation with teachers to assess
concerns and deliver an intervention, open-ended concerns statements let teachers “describe in
writing their concerns about a particular innovation” (Hall & Hord, 1987, p.66). The other way is
The SoCQ enables researchers to conduct more systematic study and a study with more reliable
data (Hall & Hord, 1987). It consists of 35 items, using a seven point Likert scale, and it is
46

designed for teachers to respond completely in ten to 15 minutes. The SoCQ is widely used
because of its usefulness in helping explain developing patterns for perceived concerns and
attitudes that individuals experience.
The Southwest Educational Development Laboratory (SEDL) in Austin, Texas, holds the
copyright to the Stages of Concern Questionnaire and charges $.50 per questionnaire completed.
The online questionnaire allows up to 15 multiple choice questions using a subgroup question
set-up function. Moreover, it offers an ‘optional custom prompts’ function which enables one to
customize up to 10 open-ended text questions to obtain additional information.
Measurements should be developed to minimize errors by presenting questions clearly
and with effective organization. Since modifying the statements of the questionnaire of the SoCQ
can be a threat to the reliability or validity of the study (George et al., 2013), the researcher does
not revise any items. Moreover, since the SoCQ is not designed to be combined with other
assessment tools, personality assessment in particular, the researcher adds to the SoCQ only
some demographic items and independent variables.
The SoCQ has several advantages. First, it is convenient and simple for a researcher to
manipulate as well as for participants to answer, because its format is systematic and all question
items can be placed on one page (Hollingshead, 2009). In other words, the SoCQ questionnaire
enhances survey scalability and expandability. Its strong reliability and validity have been
confirmed over time. The SoCQ’s test-retest correlation results ranged from 0.65 to 0.86 of
Cronbach’s alpha (Samiei, 2008). Moreover, its internal consistency ranged from 0.64 to 0.83 of
Cronbach’s alpha. The testability of SoCQ is verified and it provides abundant interpreted level:
Peak Stage Score Interpretation, First and Second High Stage Score Interpretation, and Profile
Interpretation (Hall & Hord, 1987; Samiei, 2008).
47

3.4.4.2 A comparison study applying the SoCQ. Particularly when researchers conduct
comparative studies, the way questions are asked is critical. Harkness (2008) categorizes three
approaches of comparative survey research: (1) simultaneous, parallel, and sequential
approaches, (2) Ask-Different-Questions (ADQ) and Ask the Same Question (ASQ) models, and
(3) emic and etic approaches. Among these various models, the most frequently adopted in
comparative survey research is the sequential ASQ approach, because of its convenience. In this
approach, a source questionnaire is developed in one context and other versions are translated
later. The same questionnaires translated into other languages are applied to different
populations. This method allows researchers to create an item-for-item comparison; but this
method may also lack cross-cultural input (Harkness, 2008). In order to solve this problem,
researchers added some emic, culture-specific, questions. In his conclusion, the author
emphasizes the importance of translation and several practical tips (Harkness, 2008). In this
study, the researcher applied the sequential ASQ approach with two modified items for each
country as open-ended questions.
Because the Korean version of the SoCQ, which obtained permission from SEDL, did not
exist before, the researcher needed to develop the official Korean SoCQ with assistance of one of
the CBAM founders. In order to ensure that the process of translation does not distort the
meaning of the SoCQ, the researcher applied two approaches. Basically, the researcher followed
TRAPD (Translation, Review, Adjudication, Pre-testing and Documentation) approach, which
requires a draft translation, a review session with translators and reviewers, adjudication for
unresolved is-sues, adaptation of the survey and production of a translation (Harkness, 2008).
For the translation and review processes, the researcher employed a back-translation approach.
First, the researcher translated the latest SoCQ, form 075, into Korean referring to the previous
48

Korean studies. Two other bilingual (Korean-English) doctoral students in the College of
Education at Florida State University, who have never seen the English SoCQ, translated the
Korean items back into English. Then, one of the CBAM founders compared the back-translated
English version with the original version and identified the items with discrepancies in meaning.
The team had a plan if disagreements were found, three researchers would discuss them and find
a common resolution; but, no disagreements were found. To test the Korean SoCQ, the
researcher conducted a pilot survey with two Korean school librarians to confirm that they
believed the Korean SoCQ was measuring the correct concerns.
3.4.4.3 Demographic survey. The second section of the survey instrument includes 10
items: six items for independent variables, two items for demographic information and two openended questions. The researcher developed the questions and scales to measure independent
variables based on the previous studies. The two items for the first independent variable ask
about participants’ teaching experience and pace of adoption. Since the CBAM model assumes
that the stages of concern progress according to individuals’ experience and expertise (Fuller,
1969; Mardis, 2007), this item is essential to be asked. The second item is chosen based on
Rogers’s Diffusion of Innovation theory (DOI) (Rogers, 1983). Rogers categorized individuals
according to the amount of time they take to adopt an innovation, thereby producing the
diffusion curve, commonly called S shape or a normal curve. Innovators are a group of first
individuals that take the risk of accepting the innovation. They are characterized as having the
highest social standing, wealth, and closest contact to scientific sources. Early adopters, the
second fastest group, also have high socioeconomic status and advanced education. Early
adopters are typically on the forefront of holding a certain opinion and help spread an innovation.
The early majority adopt an innovation after some time goes by. The late majority and laggards
49

are the two groups that are the slowest to adopt an innovation. The remaining independent
variables stem from the previous research; the researcher scrutinized 10 studies, which employed
the SoCQ to study teachers’ or school librarians’ concerns regarding technology innovation. As a
result, experience with previous technology (El-Saleh, 2011; Joffrion, 2014; E. Lee, 2012; Yang
& Huang, 2008), in this case e-books and training sessions (Buddy, 2002; Hadjipavli, 2011), are
chosen.
The two other items pertain to participants’ positions and part-time or full-time status.
Two open-ended questions asked to find out this group’s opinions and concerns.
3.4.5 Data Collection Procedures
This section addresses the procedures the researcher conducted to collect data from the
pretest to validate the research model in the distribution and compensation to the participants.
3.4.5.1. Pretest. Since multinational survey research is a part of scientific research, a
solid understanding of this study’s research methods is required. Researchers should remember,
however, that increased complexity leads to increased study costs: because all expenses are paid
multiple times, it is often difficult to find sufficient funding sources (Harkness, 2008). The
researcher, of course, recognizes that a comparison study requires doubled time and cost.
In order to reduce expense, the researcher conducted a small-scale version of the SoCQ
with 170 Florida school librarians and interviewed 20 Korean school librarians. The experience
gained through conducting this SoCQ allowed the researcher to better understand the important
processes and functions of the questionnaire. It was also helpful for the researcher to establish
relationships among independent and dependent variables to collect preliminary data. In
addition, the opportunity to conduct interviews provided valuable insights about Korean school

50

librarians as well as about research protocol. The know-how and experience from the previous
research thus helped the researcher in reducing disadvantages related to survey design.
3.4.5.2. Approval process. In order to initiate the study, the researcher contacted two
representative third parties for school librarians in two places: the Bureau of Standards and
Instructional Support in Florida Department of Education and the Korea School Library
Association. The researcher consulted the research methodology with them and gained
permission to conduct surveys. Prior to recruiting participants, but after having obtained these
two associations’ permission, the researcher obtained an approval from the Human Subjects
Committee at Florida State University (Appendix F) with two versions of an informed consent
form (Appendices C and D). The consent form introduced a study and survey; asked for their
voluntary participation; described the study’s risks and benefits; detailed how data would be
secured; and provided contact information of the researcher and Human Subjects Committee as
well.
After the prospectus presentation, the researcher modified the Human Subjects
Committee’s approval in accord with the changes of the survey questionnaire.
3.4.5.3. Online survey. The researcher conducted the surveys online. Online surveys
have become an excellent option because of their unique advantages: they are easy for
researchers to create using various visual/audio features, and the convenience of checking
responses nearly negates any data entry errors. By the same token, participants find online
surveys easy to complete, and will often provide truthful and detailed responses (Andrews,
Nonnecke, & Preece, 2003; Schutt, 2009). Also, Andrews et al. (2003) assert that an electronic
survey can remedy the imperfections of a survey research design due to several distinctive
characteristics, including cost effectiveness, speedy distribution, short response cycles,
51

multimedia capabilities, automatic verification, and survey response capture. Regarding the
survey for Florida school librarians, the researcher maintained the survey using SEDL’s
encrypted SoCQ since the Southwest Educational Development Laboratory (SEDL) holds the
copyright. The website allowed the researcher to customize survey questionnaires, data output,
and the password for the survey.
Regarding Korean school librarians, the researcher created the survey via Qualtrics, a
survey tool provided by the Florida State University. Qualtrics provided the researcher with a
user-friendly interface for setting up the survey for participants to access via various devices,
including computers and mobile phones. The limitations to applying two different versions of
questionnaire are detailed in section 3.6.
3.4.5.4. Conducting surveys and promotion. In order to recruit potential participants,
the researcher promoted surveys by sending email invitations. For the survey in Florida, the staff
in the Office of Library Media Services and Instructional Technology in the Florida Department
of Education sent out the invitations on November 14, 2014. Despite the request to spread out the
invitations, however, they reached only district media specialists and instructional materials
specialists: only 20 school librarians participated before that Thanksgiving break on November
23rd. After the break, the researcher accessed each school’s homepage and located school
librarians’ email addresses. From December 1 through 12, the researcher sent 1,800 invitations
across 63 school districts, excepting nine districts including the school districts of Hernando,
Lafayette, Lee, Levy, Liberty, Nassau, Palm Beach, Putnam and the Florida School for the Deaf
and the Blind. There were several reasons for not sending invitations to these districts: one
district required the district’s research and evaluation process, which would take over a month.
Some districts did not have school librarians, and most of them did not provide each teacher’s
52

email addresses. 45 emails were returned because of incorrect addresses, and the reminder emails
were distributed after the initial invitations were sent. The researcher received several
encouraging messages, enabling follow-up interviews with practicing school librarians. The
survey closed on December 19th. During the four weeks (except for Thanksgiving week), 209
school librarians completed the survey. The SEDL system did not provide any information about
the number of participants who viewed or started the survey, as it charges based on the number
of completed surveys.
Regarding the survey in South Korea, the survey was conducted over one month, from
November 12th through December 13th, 2014, local time. The staff of the Korea School Library
Association sent out the first promotional emails to about 2,000 school librarians on November
14th. The remaining emails were distributed twice during the survey on November 19th and
December 2nd. During this month, the survey was opened 769 times: 291 participants started the
survey, while 259 of them actually completed it.
3.4.5.5. Post surveys. Of the 1,755 invitations that were sent to school librarians in
Florida, 209 (11.9%) responded, which represent 9.6% of the population (2,182). Among the 163
participants who wanted to receive gift cards, the researcher selected 25 participants at random,
whereupon $10 Amazon gift cards were distributed via email on December 21st, 2014, and the
reminders were sent on January 5th, 2015 to participants who did not redeem their cards.
Of the invitations that were sent to about 2,000 school librarians in South Korea, 259
completed the survey (about 13.0%), representing 5.1% of population. The same method was
applied to select the winner who would receive ᪴10,000 (Korean Won, the equivalent of $9.2)
in online gift cards. The researcher selected 27 winners among the 167 participants who applied
for the gift cards, which were sent on December 21st, 2014. The announcement about how to use
53

the card and contact the researcher were sent right after the gift cards, since the system did not
allow the researcher to trace the online cards sent to each individual.
3.4.5.6. Data management. All results retrieved from the two surveys were converted
into Microsoft Excel 2013 to allow for proofreading. The Excel files were protected, with the
password known only to the researcher. The researcher screened to find outliers and missing
values. For statistical analysis, the raw data in both places were entered in the Statistical Package
for Social Sciences (SPSS), version 21.0. Since the South Korean version of SoCQ was
employed for the first time, data reliability for each variable was checked by Cronbach’s alpha,
the most frequently used test for internal consistency (Gliem & Gliem, 2003), ranging between 0
and 1, closer to 1.0 indicating greater internal consistency. As a rule of thumb, if Cronbach’s
alpha is greater than 0.9, the internal consistency is considered to be excellent, alpha between 0.7
and 0.9 indicates good internal consistency, and between 0.6 and .7 alpha implies acceptable
internal consistency. The overall Cronbach’s alpha for the Korean SoCQ was 0.955, showing
that the survey questionnaire had a strong internal consistency. As Table 3 indicates, each stage’s
Cronbach’s alpha is greater than 0.6, confirming that each stage has good internal consistency.

3.4.6 Data Analysis
In an effort to comprehend school librarians' concerns on the integration of digital
textbooks as a new technology, the researcher analyzed the data in descriptive, correlational, and
exploratory ways.
The SoCQ model assumes that every user or potential user involved in a change has some
degree of concern across all seven stages (Hord et al., 2006). However, each individual may
experience different intensity levels during each stage of concern. To measure school librarians’
level of concern for each stage, the researcher employed the Stages of Concern Questionnaire
(SoCQ), which comprised of 35 items, using seven stages of concerns having five items for each
stage. Each item had eight scales ranging from 0, “This statement is not true of me” to 7, “This
statement is very true.” In order to calculate the intensity of each stage, a three-step process was
used.
First, each stage’s sum was aggregated from the scores for all five items. For example,
items 3, 12, 21, 23, and 30 belong to Stage 0, Unconcerned. To find the total for Stage 0,
therefore, the total score of items 3, 12, 21, 23, and 30 was added together. Second, the average
score was calculated by dividing the sum of raw scores by the number of total participants. These
raw scores were used for statistic tests, including t-tests to answer Research Question 3. Lastly,
the resulting percentiles were determined by a raw score-to-percentile conversion table, which
provided the prior percentiles for each stage by Hall, George, & Rutherford (1977). The
percentiles of the different levels of concern were calculated by matching the average score of
each stage to the established percentiles. These percentile scores thus enabled the researcher to
obtain a SoCQ profile. Applying the SoCQ, which has been verified many times, without any

55

modification or merging with other tools, freed the researcher from concerns about the effective
organization of questions, as well as issues about reliability or validity.
3.5 Validity and Reliability
3.5.1. Validity of the SoCQ
Validity refers to the state that conclusion of study concerning empirical reality is correct
(Schutt, 2009). To establish this important concept, George et al. (2013) report that the authors
have applied inter-correlation matrices, confirmation of concerns based on interview data and
verification of group differences and changes over time.
The initial step to develop the SoCQ began in 1973 with various methods such as openended questions, Likert scales and adjective checklists, and interview protocols (George et al.,
2013; Hall, Wallace, & Dossett, 1973). The 544 potential statements were given at the very first
step. Through several tests, the statements were condensed to 400, and again to 195, statements.
After employing a factor analysis, the researchers selected 35 items, five for each of the seven
stages. The authors have made an effort to update the SoCQ by modifying or replacing items.
3.5.2. Reliability of the SoCQ
Reliability refers to a measurement process achieve consistent results under the identical
condition (Schutt, 2009). The internal reliability of the SoCQ has been proven. Hall et al. (1973)
tested items to demonstrate whether items correlated more with “responses to other items
measuring the same stage than with responses to items on other scales” (p. 11). The alpha
coefficients of its internal consistency in the seven stages indicated reliability of .64 to .83 with
six of seven coefficients above .70 (Hall et al., 1973). Two weeks later, the authors conducted
the retest survey, and they obtained high test-retest correlations, as seen in Table 4.

(*Source: Hall et al., 1973)

One of the practical issues the SoCQ used to face was the ambiguity of Stage 0,
Unconcerned (Hall & Hord, 1987; Schoepp, 2004). Before its modification, in order to interpret
a peak Stage 0 score, researchers had to look at other stages because Stage 0 did not clearly
explain whether or not users were aware of a given innovation or if they were merely interested
in the innovation. To clarify this vagueness, George et al. (2013) revised both items in Stage 0
and their norms, which was undertaken for their recent publication. Stage 0, Unconcerned,
means “the degree of interest in and engagement with the innovation in comparison to other
tasks, activities, and efforts of the respondent” (p. 33). Therefore, if there is a higher score in
Stage 0, Unconcerned, researchers can interpret that “there are a number of other initiatives,
tasks, and activities that are of concern to him or her” (p. 33). That means the respondent is
concerned about not only the innovation, but also other issues. On the other hand, if there is a
lower score in Stage 0, Unconcerned, researchers can interpret that “the innovation is of high
priority and central to the thinking and work of the respondent” (p. 33).
3.6 Assumptions, Benefits and Limitations
An assumption is made that participants’ demographics, such as gender, age, working
experiences and ethnicity, are statistically similar to the school librarian population.
School librarians may have benefited from the research results and suggestions in
recognizing the process of implementation of digital textbooks, identifying their concerns and,
57

ultimately, considering advanced methods to improve their leadership roles regarding integrating
new educational technologies. As a result of the study, students, the ultimate beneficiaries, may
also receive the improved service of school libraries.
Although the risks to participants are minimized, several limitations can be found. A
primary limitation of the investigation is inherent in the nature of a survey method. The
participants may have been alert to the intention of the instrument. Also, not all school librarians
are equally articulate and perceptive regarding digital textbooks. Each librarian has a different
command of language and different ways of expressing themselves. One more potential
limitation comes from the process of translation of the survey questionnaire. Although the
researcher translates the questionnaire flawlessly, the percentile tables from the CBAM theory
remain in their English versions. Therefore, employing the English percentile tables with Korean
responses may threaten the statistical analysis. In addition, the fact that the researcher applied the
two different survey sites can be a threat to instrumentation validity, refers to the changes of
instruments (Shadish, Cook, & Campbell, 2002).
3.7 Ethical Considerations
In order to promote the aims of research, a researcher should practice ethical research by
protecting participants, establishing trust, upholding personal accountability, monitoring
scientific misconduct and managing difficulties (Schutt, 2009). Based on the topics that Babbie
(1973) raises, the researcher identifies the issues below.
Babbie (1973) proposes five ethical issues related to survey methods. One major tenet is
voluntary participation. All respondents should participate in a survey of their own free will,
unforced. Survey research should not be physically or mentally harmful to any participants who
are willing to cooperate with a researcher. The study only recruited participants who wanted to
58

contribute to the study by their own free will. In addition, participants could opt out at any time
or refuse to answer any of the questions.
A researcher needs to be aware of any possibility for respondents to feel offended, and
guide them to avoid this. Nardi (2006) underlines that the informed consent process is critical, in
discussing potential effects of the survey on participants’ privacy and any physical or mental
danger. A researcher should let participants know about intended harm by explaining what would
happen during a survey, so that participants can be informed about how much their privacy will
be compromised and decide whether they desire to participate in the survey at all. In this study,
although there is no risk beyond what one would normally face in everyday situations, the
researcher informed participants about the purpose of the study and assured them that their
responses do not affect their current jobs or positions as school librarians.
The third issue is the protection of the participants’ identities, that is to say anonymity
and confidentiality. Anonymity means that a researcher ensures that there is no way to connect
any identifying information with any of the survey respondents (Nardi, 2006, p. 35). Babbie
(1973) points out that in case a researcher needs to conduct any kind of follow-up research,
anonymity can be fragile. In particular, he argues that there is always a chance for participants to
be identified in a survey, and a researcher should get rid of any possible identifying survey item,
for example, a question about a detailed occupation to a specific group of people. The concept of
confidentiality is that any information that can be linked to a respondent’s personal identity “is
revealed only to the researchers for the main goals of the project” (Nardi, 2006, p. 35). Various
techniques can be suggested for confidentiality. For example, a researcher uses identification
numbers instead of names or addresses. In addition, a researcher encrypts raw data or discards
them after a period of time. To solve these issues, the study implemented the following. Since
59

this study did not apply any personal information, such as name, contact information, name of
school or position, contact information was be collected. Data from the online survey were coded
into an Excel spreadsheet and the files were protected with a password that the only researcher
knew. The files were saved in a secure external hard drive with encryption. The data will be kept
for five years in locked filing cabinets and will be deleted when the research is done.
There is the possibility that the researcher’s purposes may affect the respondents’
answers. This outside pressure can be attributable to specific variables, and it can lessen the
construct validity of research and it can be a threat to the construct validity of cause. When
participants are aware that they are involved in a study, they may respond in a way to please or
displease researchers. Also, participants can get hints from researchers and may change their
answers according to researchers' expectations. In cases where the research topic is novel,
participants are more likely to have positive attitudes. In order to avoid this violation (Babbie,
1973) suggests the following guidelines:
(1) The researcher should tell nothing about the purpose of the study that is likely to
affect the reliability of responses. (2) At the same time, he should tell respondents
whatever he can about purposes where such information will not likely affect responses.
(3) Explanations of purpose should be kept general rather than specific. (4) The
researcher should never offer fictitious reasons for the study.
Following this advice, the researcher was very careful to offer the objective and impartial
purpose of the study to participants, since the researchers’ intentions could influence the
participants’ responses.
The last ethical issue that Babbie presents is that when researchers analyze and report
research, they have obligations to their readers. Researchers should describe the shortcomings
60

and limitations of their research, including any omission of sampling, respondents’
misunderstandings, or any defect in the design. Even if researchers obtain negative results,
unexpected findings, or unanticipated correlations which affect the results, they should report
these. Both understanding and interpreting meanings accurately remain an issue for methods.
Vogt et al. (2012) address the same issue. Researchers assume all respondents have understood
questions in the way that researchers intended. However, there may be a gap between what
researchers meant and what respondents understood. Although researchers can spend more time
to provide longer questions and lengthier descriptions during in-depth interviews, such
interviews provide greater chances for respondents to misunderstand meanings. Also, as
researchers interpret and decode meaning, there is always a risk of missteps in the process of
semantic disambiguation. To consult the last issue, the researcher stated limitations related to
methodology in section 3.6 and the limitations related to the study in section 5.7.
3.8 Conclusion
Chapter 3 details the method and procedures that the researcher has conducted. A survey
method enables researchers to collect not only personal/internal information but also less
personal/external information (Vogt et al., 2012). A survey is a useful tool for obtaining both
objective and subjective answers. By applying a survey, the researcher assured that the study
identified and described the Florida and South Korea school librarians’ concerns in the initial
phases of the implementation of digital textbooks. Becoming a medium through which school
librarians’ voices were heard on the subject of digital textbooks, this research can impact key
areas of cognitive research on people influenced by innovation and human factors related to
digital textbooks such as leadership, collaboration, and social norms.

61

Also, comparative research, applying a survey method, examines societies or nations over
time in comparison with each other (Babbie, 2010). Cross-national surveys, which are conducted
across multiple places, are becoming more popular as the need for global data increases
(Harkness, 2008). The study findings, for each setting, not only determined the stages of concern
as per school librarians’ practices and experiences, but also compared the stages of concern
depending upon their demographic backgrounds and technologies. The study provided an
opportunity for school librarians to share their concerns, and helped to inform librarians about
digital textbooks in Florida and South Korea as well.
Subsequently, Chapter 4 describes the findings from the two surveys and analyses of the
data. Lastly, the discussion of findings, implications and suggestions of the study is presented in
Chapter 5.

62

CHAPTER 4
PRESENTATION OF THE FINDINGS

4.1 Introduction
The primary purpose of this study is to identify school librarians’ Stages of Concern
(SoC) during the first stage of implementing digital textbooks. In addition, the study is designed
to discern SoC profiles according to specific characteristics in Florida and South Korea, where
K–12 schools plan to embrace digital textbooks by requiring school librarians to be leaders in
this transition.
This chapter thus presents an analysis of the data collected by the methods delineated
earlier, organized in order of research questions. It begins with an analysis of the survey in
Florida, followed by the results of the survey in South Korea, with a comparison between the
two. The chapter concludes with a summary of findings regarding the three research questions. A
synthesis and discussion of said findings will be presented in Chapter 5.
4.2 Data Sample
This study obtained 468 participants from the both locations (209 participants in Florida
and 259 participants in South Korea). Accordingly, the study had an adequate number of
participants for statistical analyses. In order to determine the sample size, Cohen’s power
analysis was conducted using G*Power 3.1.9.2 (Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, & Buchner, 2007).
Utilizing a repeated measures t-test, expecting an effect size 0.5 and power (1-β prob) 0.95, each
location needed a sample size of 105, with a total combined sample size of 210.

63

4.2.1 Participants in Florida
209 school librarians completed the survey in Florida. The first question in the
demographic portion of the survey asked participants about their position: 78.9% of respondents
were school librarians and state-certified as both teachers and library media specialists (n=165).
11.5% were school librarians and state-certified as library and media specialists or held a
Master's degree in library and information science, but were not certified as a teacher (n=24).
The remaining 9.6% held other positions such as administrators, students, university faculty,
supervisor teachers, etc. (n=5).
The next demographic question pertained to employment status: the majority (96.2%) of
participants worked as full-time school librarians (n=201). Five participants worked part-time in
two different schools, the equivalent of a full-time position (2.4%). Only three teachers worked a
part-time job (1.4%). According to the Florida Department of Education’s statistics, there were
17 (.8%) part-time librarians during the 2013–14 school year (The Florida Department of
Education, 2014). This survey, similar to those statistics, also had only a few part-time school
librarians.
The last demographic question asked participants to indicate the number of years worked
as a school librarian. The average number of years’ experience was 11.1. Both the mode (the
most frequently appearing number) and the median (the middle number in the given value order)
were 8.0 years.
4.2.2 Participants in South Korea
Just as above, the first question in the demographic portion of the survey asked
participants about their position: half (54.4%) were library teachers with a library teacher’s
certificate under Article 21 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (n=141). 97 (37.5%)
64

school librarians were librarian staff qualified under Article 6, Paragraph 2 of the Library Act.
There were 12 (4.6%) practical education teachers with a certificate for practical education
teaching after the completion of library and information science or library science (under Article
21 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act). The remaining 9 (3.5%) held such positions
as administrators, students, university faculty, etc.
The next demographic question pertained to employment status: 129 (49.8%) participants
worked full-time. 108 responders worked part-time in one school (41.7%) and 10 worked parttime in two schools (3.9%). 8 responders had part-time jobs in more than two schools. The
remaining four participants answered their positions as other (1.5%).
The last demographic question asked participants to indicate the number of years worked
as a school librarian: the average number of years’ experience was 7.5, with a mode of 5.0 years
and a median of 7.0 years.
4.3 Data Analysis for Research Question 1
The following section describes the findings concerning Research Question 1 and its
corresponding sub-research questions, which asks about school librarians’ stages of concern
regarding the mandated implementation of digital textbooks in Florida based on the Stages of
Concern Questionnaire (SoCQ). The first sub-question presents the overall SoC for Florida
school librarians, while the following four questions describe the SoC according to individual’s
characteristics.
4.3.1 Research Question 1.1
RQ 1.1 was “Based on the SoCQ, what are the school librarians’ highest stages of
concern surrounding implementation of digital textbooks?” In order to identify the SoC of
Florida school librarians, the first sub-research question pertained to the highest stage of concern
65

surrounding implementation of digital textbooks. The Concerns-Based Adoption Model (CBAM)
refers to the highest stage of concern as peak stage, which indicates the stage with the highest
intensity among the seven stages of concern (Unconcerned, Informational, Personal,
Management, Consequence, Collaboration, and Refocusing). In this study, the peak score
indicates the specific stage that school librarians experienced the most concern at a point of time
during the implementation of digital textbooks. In the context of the CBAM, percentiles are not
absolute but rather relative to other stage scores (George et al., 2013).
Figure 1 shows an overall picture of Florida school librarians’ SoC. The data indicate
Stage 0, Unconcerned, as the peak stage of concern of school librarians with a 91% intensity of
concern, meaning that participants had little concern about digital textbooks or involvement with
them (George et al., 2013; Hall & Hord, 2011). According to the CBAM, the higher Stage 0,
Unconcerned, does not address whether participants were users or nonusers (George et al.,
2013). Rather, the higher Stage 0, Unconcerned, points out that participants were more
concerned about the multitude of other obligations, activities, innovations, or tasks.
Overall, the profile represents ‘Negative One-Two Split’ user patterns. The SoC profile
has a higher percentile in Stage 2, Personal, than Stage 1, Informational, indicating a possibility
of negative reactions from participants. This demonstrates that school librarians’ concern for
personal position or job security was greater than their desire to study digital textbooks. The
following detailed description from George et al. (2013, p. 8) discusses the individual who has
the most concern in Stage 2, Personal:
The individual is uncertain about the demands of the innovation, his or her adequacy to
meet those demands, and/or his or her role with the innovation. The individual is
analyzing his or her relationship to the reward structure of the organization, determining
66

his or her part in decision making, and considering potential conflicts with existing
structures or personal commitment. Concerns also might involve the financial or status
implications of the program for the individual and his or her colleagues.
Although Hall and Hord (1987) take it for granted that non-users are likely to have high
Stage 2, Personal concerns, focusing on their ability to employ an innovation or their uncertainty
of what that innovation may bring, school librarians with high intensity in Stage 2, Personal, may
not be able to consider digital textbooks objectively until their personal concerns have lessened
(George et al., 2013). That is to say, it is worth noting that not only are school librarians
concerned about their status, rewards, or the effects of digital textbooks, but this intense personal
concern might obstruct more substantive concerns about digital textbooks (George et al., 2013).
The deeper discussion about Florida school librarians’ SoC is provided in section 5.2.

4.3.2 Research Question 1.2
RQ2 was “Is there a significant relationship between school librarians’ stages of concern
regarding digital textbooks and those teachers’ experience in years?” It asked about the
relationship between their stages of concern regarding digital textbooks and their teaching
experience. As section 3.4.3.3.1 describes, a total of 209 participants completed the surveys.
While three participants replied “N/A”, 206 school librarians answered the question about their
teaching experience, with an average number of years of 11.1. Both the mode and median were
8.0 years. The demographic information consists of five categories: less than 4 years (n=51,
24.8%), 4–7 years (n=37, 18.0%), 7–10 years (n=33, 16.0%), 10–15 years (n=21, 10.2%), and
more than 15 years (n=64, 31.1%).
Figure 2 depicts school librarians’ SoC according to their teaching experience: overall,
librarians who had more experience expressed less intensive concerns about digital textbooks
over the stages, while new teachers expressed more concerns over the stages. Interestingly,
however, the group of least experienced school librarians and the middle level teachers (10-15
years of experience) expressed more concerns than the most experienced group. School
librarians with fewer than four years of experience demonstrated the most intensive concerns in
Stage 1, Informational (80%), Stage 2, Personal (83%), Stage 3, Management (52%), Stage 5,
Collaboration (55%), and Stage 6, Refocusing (38%). In addition, school librarians with 10–15
years of experience showed the most intensive concerns in Stage 2, Personal (83%), Stage 3,
Management (52%), Stage 4, Consequence (30%), and Stage 6, Refocusing (38%).
The results found that the profile pattern in case of digital textbooks is not exactly
equivalent with Fuller’s findings, who argues that teachers’ concerns follow the trend from
unrelated, self, task and impact concerns as they have more teaching experience (Fuller, 1969).
68

According to Fuller’s theory, school librarians who have the most work experience are supposed
to have less intense concerns at the lower stages and more intense concerns at the higher stages.
The results, however, show the least experienced group and middle level group of school
librarians focusing more on digital textbook initiatives.
The differences between the new and experienced school librarians are more pronounced
in Stage 5, Collaboration (19%) and Stage 2, Personal (13%). In those stages, the novice group
expressed the greatest intensity of concerns, while the most experienced group expressed the
least. These differences imply that new school librarians are much more concerned about their
roles, the reward structure (Stage 2, Personal), and how to coordinate and cooperate with their
colleagues to integrate digital textbooks (Stage 5, Collaboration).

4.3.3 Research Question 1.3
RQ 1.3 was “Is there a significant relationship between school librarians’ stages of
concern regarding digital textbooks and those teachers’ technology adoption style?” It explores
the relationship between school librarians’ stages of concern regarding digital textbooks and
those teachers’ styles of adopting technology. As mentioned in section 3.4.4.3, according to
Rogers Diffusion of Innovations theory (DOI) (Rogers, 1983), this survey categorizes school
librarians within five “adopter” groups: innovators (the first to adopt, n=19, 9.1%), early
adopters (the ones to adopt innovation before most other people do, n=49, 23.4%), early majority
(the careful ones who adopt innovation after seeing it used successfully, n=89, 42.6%), late
majority (the skeptical and traditional, n=32, 15.3%), and laggards (the last to adopt, n=20,
9.6%).
The group with the highest intensity of concern in each stage was the late majority in
Stage 0 (96%), laggards in Stages 1 thorough 3 (80%, 80%, and 52%, respectively) and Stage 6
(38%), and innovators in Stages 4 through 6 (27%, 68%, and 38%, respectively). Figure 3 clearly
demonstrates that the more quickly school librarians adopt innovations, the more intensive their
concerns during the Impact stages (Stages 4, 5, and 6). It also shows that school librarians who
were prudent and skeptical about the innovation were more concerned during the Self and Task
stages, Stages 0 through 3. Innovators had uniquely high concerns in Stage 5, Collaboration. The
innovators’ intensity (68%) was 40% more than the late majority’s (28%). This implies that
innovator school librarians focus on working with other teachers in using digital textbooks, and
are more likely to work as administrators, coordinators, or team leaders (George et al., 2013,
p.54).

4.3.4 Research Question 1.4
RQ1.4 was “Is there a significant relationship between school librarians’ stages of
concern regarding digital textbooks and those teachers’ personal experiences with e-books?” It
examines the relationship between school librarians’ stages of concern regarding digital
textbooks and their personal experiences with e-books. The researcher investigated such personal
experiences with two survey questions asking about the length and frequency that participants
read/use electronic or digital books per week. For length, 206 school librarians (excepting the
71

three participants who wrote “N/A”) replied that they read/used e-books an average of 5.1 hours
per week, with both the mode and median hours at 3.0. The researcher categorized length within
the following four categories: less than one hour per week (n=48, 23.3%), more than one hour
but less than three hours per week (n=52, 25.2%), more than three hours but less than seven
hours per week (n=50, 24.3%) and more than seven hours per week (n=56, 27.2%).
Figure 4 shows that school librarians who used electronic or digital books more often had
more intensive concerns in the Impact stages (Stages 4, Consequence, 5, Collaboration, and 6,
Refocusing, while those who used them less had more intensive concerns in the Self stages
(Stages 0, Unconcerned, 1, Informational, and 2, Personal). Along with Figures 2 and 3, Figure
4-1 also indicates that Stage 5, Collaboration, had the biggest gap between heavy and light
electronic book users (19%). Although Figure 4 demonstrates the differences among categories,
the gaps among these categories were narrower than in Figures 2 and 3. This hints that,
regardless of the reading duration, school librarians demonstrate very similar patterns of
concerns.
As the second factor for investigating the relationship between school librarians’ Stage of
Concern and their experience with e-books, the researcher examined their SoC with their
frequency of using e-books. This survey question contained five categories to choose from: daily
or almost every day (n=59, 28.2%), a few times a week (n=46, 22.0%), a few times a month
(n=37, 17.7%), less often (n=46, 22.0%), and not at all (n=21, 10.0%). Excepting that there were
fewer participants who did not read e-books, participants were evenly distributed across the
categories.

Figure 4. The Stages of Concern Profile with School Librarians in Florida According to Their EBook Reading Time
In a macro view, Figure 5 indicates that school librarians who read e-books frequently
had more intensive concerns over the stages. In a micro view, however, an exceptional
phenomenon occurs: for most stages, the second most frequent group “a few times a week’”
were the most concerned about digital textbooks in Stage 1, Informational (75%), Stage 2,
Personal (80%), Stage 3, Management (56%), Stage 4, Consequence (27%), and Stage 6,
73

Refocusing (38%), rather than daily users. The most intensive gap between the “few times a
week” group (56%) and the “less often” group appears in Stage 3, Management (39%), with a
gap of 17%. The one notable point for the “daily or almost every day” group was the intensity of
Stage 5, Collaboration (59%), which was almost double than “less often” and “not at all” (31%).

4.3.5 Research Question 1.5
RQ 1.5 asked “Is there a significant relationship between school librarians’ stages of
concern regarding digital textbooks and the training sessions provided for those librarians?” It
pertained to the relationship between school librarians’ stages of concern regarding digital
textbooks and the training sessions provided for those librarians. 202 school librarians responded
to the question about training time, while seven participants wrote “Not available.” Among the
202 participants, 161 participants indicated their number of hours, with an average training
session time of 10.4 hours, a mode of 0, and a median of 5. The remaining 41 participants
claimed that they have been educated for over a year, and were thus included in the “more than
12 hours” group. Four categories were developed based on the survey replied: less than one hour
(n=32, 15.8%), more than one hour but less than five hours (n=47, 23.3%), more than five hours
but less than 12 hours (n=45, 22.3%), and more than 12 hours (n=78, 38.6%).
Figure 6 demonstrates that participants claiming “more than 12 hours” showed higher
intensity in most stages: Stages 1, Informational (72%), Stage 2, Personal (78%), Stage 4,
Consequence (27%), Stage 5, Collaboration (52%), and Stage 6, Refocusing (38%). Stages 1
through 3 had very similar intensities among the categories, with gaps between the max and min
scores of 3%, 2%, and 9%, respectively. The stage that showed the biggest gap was Stage 5,
Collaboration, while the group with the least training experience demonstrated notably lower
intensive concerns (36%) in the Collaboration stage. Two groups, “more than 12 hours” and “512 hours” expressed 52% of intensity, while “less than 1 hour” group expressed 36% of
intensity. It can be interpreted that these two high-concerned groups have more possibilities to be
leaders in digital textbook integration.

4.4 Data Analysis for Research Question 2
The second main research question pertained to South Korean school librarians’ SoC
regarding digital textbooks. It asked “Based on the SoC, what are the school librarians’ stages of
concern around the implementation of digital textbooks in South Korea?“ Similar to research
question 1, question 2 consists of five sub-questions: the highest stages, relationships between
stages of concern and teaching experience, adoption style, personal experience with e-books, and
training sessions. The following sections describe the survey’s results from the 259 South
Korean school librarians.
4.4.1 Research Question 2.1
RQ 2.1 asked "Based on the SoCQ, what are the school librarians’ highest stages of
concern surrounding the implementation of digital textbooks?" The first sub-question identifies
the peak stage of concerns for South Korean school librarians, as illustrated in Figure 7. The
intensity of each stage was 99% in Stage 0, Unconcerned, 88% in Stage 1, Informational , 83%
in Stage 2, Personal, 77% in Stage 3, Management, 33% in Stage 4, Consequence, 55% in Stage
5, Collaboration, and 57% in Stage 6, Refocusing. All stages demonstrated a higher intensity
than with Florida school librarians. Except for Stage 4, Consequence, the peak stage is Stage 0,
Unconcerned (99%), indicating that, similar to Florida school librarians, Korean school librarians
have little concern about digital textbooks and were not yet involved with the transition (George
et al., 2013). In other words, other innovations or activities attract school librarians’ concerns
now over digital textbooks.
Figure 7 indicates that school librarians had higher percentiles in Stage 0, Unconcerned;
Stage 1, Informational; and Stage 2, Personal. This signifies a typical non-user profile, which
shows more intensity during the Self stages (Stage 0, Unconcerned; Stage 1, Informational; and
77

Stage 2, Personal) (Hall & Hord, 1987). For non-users, the intensity at Stage 0, Unconcerned, is
not as important as the variations in Stages 1, Informational and 2, Personal (George et al.,
2013), meaning that school librarians focused more on learning about digital textbooks and were
concerned about their personal roles while they were occupied simultaneously with other
innovations.
Korean school librarians also expressed relatively significant concerns during
Management, Stage 3. The last notable pattern is a slightly tailing-up pattern in Stage 6,
Refocusing, which implies that participants might be resistant to digital textbooks. A detailed
discussion and interpretation is provided in section 5.3.

4.4.2 Research Question 2.2
RQ 2.2 was "Is there a significant relationship between school librarians’ stages of
concern regarding digital textbooks and those teachers’ experience in years?" The second
research question asked about the relationship between school librarians’ stages of concern
regarding digital textbooks and their years of teaching experience. 259 school librarians have
worked for an average of 7.5 years, with a mode of 5 years and a median of 7 years. Participants
were evenly distributed across the categories: 55 in “less than 4 years” (21.2%), 61 in “4–7
years” (23.6%), 72 in “7–10 years” (27.8%), 58 in “10–15 years” (22.4%), and 13 in “more than
15 years” (5.0%).
Overall, the more experience school librarians had, the lower their intensity of concern.
School librarians with more experience demonstrated a lower intensity of concern across all
stages, while new teachers demonstrated higher concerns. One thing to note was, while
experienced school librarians in Florida expressed lower concerns in the Self and Management
stages, those in South Korea had lower concerns across every stage. On the other hand, new
school librarians had the highest intensity in all stages except for Stage 3, Management (7–10
years): Stage 0, Unconcerned (99%), Stage 1, Informational (96%), Stage 2, Personal (94%),
Stage 4, Consequence (59%), Stage 5, Collaboration (76%), and Stage 6, Refocusing (73%).
This implies that they were very eager for, and looking forward to, the innovation. The stage that
showed the biggest gap between the highest and lowest intensity was Stage 5, Collaboration with
a 21% gap. While the groups “less than 4 years” and “4–7 years” expressed 76% intensity, the
group “more than 15 years” expressed only 30% intensity.

4.4.3 Research Question 2.3
RQ 2.3 asked "Is there a significant relationship between school librarians’ stages of
concern regarding digital textbooks and those teachers’ technology adoption style?" The third
research question aimed to find out the relationship between school librarians’ stages of concern
regarding digital textbooks and their style for adapting technology, as described in section
3.4.4.3. The survey categorized school librarians in five categories of adopters: innovators (the
first to adopt, n=4, 1.5%), early adopters (the early ones who adopt innovation before most other
80

people do, n=27, 10.4%), early majority (the careful ones who adopt innovation after seeing it
used successfully, n=172, 66.4%), late majority (the skeptical and traditional, n=35, 13.5%), and
laggards (the last to adopt, n=21, 8.1).
As Figure 9 portrays, school librarians who adopt technology quickly show more intense
concerns over the stages. The early adopter group, however, had more concerns than the
innovator group throughout every stage except Stage 6, Refocusing (innovators at 92% and early
adopters at 87%).

Bigger gaps appear on Impact concerns, particularly Stage 4, Consequence; while the
innovator and early adopter groups show 76% intensity, the late majority and laggards groups
show only 30%. Participants who adopt innovations quickly are thus more concerned about the
impact of digital textbooks on students. Also, Stage 5, Collaboration (44%) and 6, Refocusing
(35%), displayed bigger gaps between school librarians who adopt innovation either quickly and
slowly, implying that school librarians who adopt innovations rapidly are interested in
coordination and cooperation with other teachers to explore more benefits regarding digital
textbooks.
4.4.4 Research Question 2.4
RQ 2.4 was "Is there a significant relationship between school librarians’ stages of
concern regarding digital textbooks and those teachers’ personal experiences with e-books?" The
fourth research question sought to find out the relationship between school librarians’ stages of
concern regarding digital textbooks and their personal experiences with e-books. The first factor,
how long participants used electronic or digital books, placed participants in one of four
categories: less than one hour per week (n=151, 58.3%), more than one hour but less than three
hours per week (n=81, 31.3%), more than three hours but less than seven hours per week (n=16,
6.2%), and more than seven hours per week (n=11, 4.2%).
Overall, the longer users of electronic or digital books expressed higher intensity of
concerns across all stages, while shorter users of e-books expressed lower intensity of concerns.
Except for Stages 3 and 5, those who used e-books more than three hours but less than seven
hours per week had the most intense concerns: Stage 1, Informational (99%), Stage 2, Personal
(96%), Stage 4, Consequence (76%), and Stage 6, Refocusing (87%). In this data, the biggest
difference between intensity of concerns appears in Stage 4, Consequence (33%). While the
82

group who used e-books less than one hour per week only had 43% intensity, those who used ebooks between three and seven hours expressed 76%.

Figure 10. The Stages of Concern Profile with School Librarians in South Korea According to
Their E-Book Reading Time
The second factor for identifying school librarians’ personal experiences with e-books
was the frequency with which they used electronic or digital books. For this, the survey question
contained five options: daily or almost every day (n=10, 3.9%), a few times a week (n=19,
7.3%), a few times a month (n=21, 8.1%), less often (n=98, 37.8%), and not at all (n=111,
83

42.9%). Unlike participants in Florida, where most participants read e-books, almost half of
participants (42.9%) in South Korea did not.
Without exception, “daily or almost every day” users expressed the most intense
concerns over the stages: Stage 0, Unconcerned (99%), Stage 1, Informational (99%), Stage 3,
Management (94%), Stage 4, Consequence (82%), Stage 5, Collaboration (93%), and Stage 6,
Refocusing (90%). As Figure 11 depicts, the bigger gaps appear in Impact concerns in the same
way as in Figure 11, the biggest gap appearing in Stage 4, Consequence (44%). Whereas “daily
or almost every day” users had 82% intensity in Stage 4, Consequence, non-e-book users only
had 38% intensity. In addition, Stage 5, Collaboration (34%), and Stage 6, Refocusing (30%),
expressed relatively large differences.

4.4.5 Research Question 2.5
RQ 2.5 was "Is there a significant relationship between school librarians’ stages of
concern regarding digital textbooks and the training sessions provided for those librarians?" The
last research question demonstrates the relationship between school librarians’ stages of concern
regarding digital textbooks and the training sessions provided for those librarians. Participants in
the survey took training sessions for an average of 1.5 hours, with a mode and median of 0. Four
categories appear for training sessions based on the replies: less than one hour (n=226, 87.3%),
more than one hour but less than five hours (n=20, 7.7%), more than five hours but less than 12
hours (n=2, 0.8%), and more than 12 hours (n=11, 4.2%).
On the whole, the school librarians with more training showed higher intensity of
concerns. Interestingly, however, the group with more than five hours but less than 12 hours
expressed the highest concern in Stage 2, Personal (96%), Stage 4, Consequence (76%), and
Stage 5, Collaboration (93%) over the group with the longest training time. The stages of
concern profile demonstrated the biggest gap in Task concerns during Stage 3, Management
(28%). This indicates that school librarians with more than five hours but less than 12 hours
training experience have fewer concerns about managing digital textbooks (George et al., 2013),
and are rather concerned about the consequences of students using digital textbooks (Stage 4,
Consequence). Such school librarians expressed a desire to learn from what other teachers know
and are doing (high Stage 1, Informational, and high Stage 5, Collaboration). In Stage 3, the
group that expressed the highest concern was “more than 12 hours” group with 97%.

4.5 Data Analysis for Research Question 3
Research Question 3 asked "Are there significant statistical differences in the stages of
concern identified for school librarians in Florida and South Korea?" The last research question
asks whether there are significant statistical differences between the SoC profiles identified for
school librarians in Florida and South Korea. To answer this question, two sub-research
questions were developed: (1) identifying the differences between the highest and second highest
stages of concern for school librarians in Florida and South Korea; and (2) determining the main
factors influencing those differences.
The researcher applied a Paired difference test (t-test) statistical analysis by comparing
the raw scores of each stage in the two settings. The t-test determined if there was a statistical
significance in the means between dependent variables (school librarians’ highest and second
highest stages of concern) and the independent variable (location, i.e. Florida and South Korea).
4.5.1 Research Question 3.1
Based on RQ 3.1, "What are the differences between the highest and second highest
stages of concern for school librarians in Florida and South Korea?", Figure 11 compares the two
stages of concern profiles in Florida and South Korea, revealing that Stage 0, Unconcerned, was
the highest intensity stage for both locations, while Stage 4, Consequence was the lowest
intensity stage. Figure 13 also indicates that the second highest stages for Florida and South
Korea were Stages 2, Personal, and 1, Informational, respectively. Since this study focuses more
on the highest and second highest stages for each region, the researcher examined the similarities
and differences between Stages 0, Unconcerned; 1, Informational and 2, Personal to test research
question 3.1.

Table 6 demonstrates a significant difference in school librarians’ SoC scores in Stage 0,
Unconcerned, between the two locations: Florida (M=16.37, SD=5.99) and South Korea
(M=22.48, SD=6.22); t(451.86)= -10.782, p = 0.00. This suggests that school librarians in South
Korea are more preoccupied with other activities or educational innovations over digital
textbooks.
For Stage 1, Informational, a large statistic results in a small probability [t(458.03)=-6.90,
p = 0.00], indicating that the means in Florida (M=19.67, SD=6.86) and South Korea (M=24.25,
SD=7.46) are significantly different from one other. In other words, school librarians in South
Korea were more eager to learn about digital textbooks and desired more relevant information
about their implementation.
In addition, the results report that the means of Stage 2, Personal, significantly differ
from one other as well: [t(419.73)=-4.20, p = 0.00] in Florida (M=21.21, SD=8.78) and South
Korea (M=24.47, SD=7.79), implying that school librarians in South Korea were genuinely
curious about their roles in integrating digital textbooks and the impact it would have upon them.
Detailed analyses on which factors created these differences are provided in section 4.4.2,
which compares each survey question item.
4.5.2 Research Question 3.2
RQ 3.2 sought to identify the main factors that create significant differences between
school librarians in Florida and South Korea. In order to scrutinize the strongest and second
strongest intensity of school librarians’ concerns among the seven stages, the researcher chose
the peak and second peak stages to analyze.
Table 7 indicates that all survey questions consisting of Stage 0, Unconcerned (Questions
3, 12, 21, 23, and 30), significantly differed on the peak stage between the two locations.
90

Although school librarians in both locations expressed a high intensity of concerns in Stage 0,
Unconcerned, there was a significant difference between them in Stage 0. Throughout the
questions consisting of Stage 0, South Korean school librarians showed more intensity.
When compared to school librarians in Florida, South Korean school librarians were not
concerned about digital textbooks [(Q12), t(464.78)=-4.07, p = 0.00], due to concern for another
innovation [(Q3), t(454.73)=-12.13, p = 0.00], or items other than digital textbooks [(Q21),
t(388.65)=-6.18, p = 0.00]. These other priorities thus prevent South Korean school librarians
from focusing on digital textbooks [(Q30), t(395.97)=-4.30, p = 0.00]. South Korean school
librarians also argued that they did not have time for digital textbooks [(Q23), t(429.20)=-6.16, p
= 0.00].

For South Korean school librarians’ SoC. Stage 1, Informational, is the second highest.
As Table 8 indicates, there is a statistically significant difference between Florida and South
Korea in Stage 1. Table 8 shows that, among the five question items consisting of Stage 1, only
three questions were significantly different: although both groups have higher concerns in Stage
1, Informational, school librarians in South Korea indicated that they have a more general
awareness and interest in learning about digital textbooks than Florida school librarians (George
et al., 2013). This statistical difference is due to South Korean school librarians’ limited
knowledge [(Q6), t(454.89)=-5.97, p = 0.00]; their eagerness to discuss the possibility of using
digital textbooks [(Q14), t(431.76)=-6.27, p = 0.00]; and their desire to know how digital
textbooks are better than the paper textbooks [(Q35), t(365.33)=-8.31, p = 0.00].

The researcher also examined the details of Stage 2, Personal, the second peak stage for
Florida school librarians’ SoC. As Table 9 indicates, there is a statistical difference between the
two locations in this stage. Among the five survey items for Stage 2, Personal, three items' mean
scores are significantly different from those in the other region: South Korean school librarians
expressed much more intensity of concerns in Stage 2, Personal, because of their concern about
the changes in their professional status, [(Q7), t(399.44)=-5.48, p = 0.00], changes in teaching
[(Q17), t(403.42)=-5.35, p = 0.00], and changes in their roles [(Q33), t(401.41)=-4.22, p = 0.00],

4.6 Summary
The findings of this study confirm that school librarians in both Florida and South Korea
express relatively high concerns about digital textbooks as an educational innovation. Florida
school librarians’ SoC represents ‘Negative One-Two Split’ user patterns, which has a higher
percentile in Stage 2, Personal, than Stage 1, Informational, the highest percentile occurring at
Stage 0, Unconcerned. This implies a resistance to digital textbooks as an innovation. Stage 0
also reveals that school librarians are more occupied with other activities or tasks. The researcher
examined the four factors in determining the relationship between SoC and school librarians’
characteristics, and all SoC profiles created in this study had the highest intensity of concern in
Stage 0. All profiles presented a relationship between SoC and participants’ characteristics, with
the biggest gaps occurring in Stage 5, Collaboration: participants’ teaching experience (19% gap
= ‘Less than 4 years‘ (55%) – ‘More than 15 years‘ (36%)), teachers’ technology adoption style
(40% gap= ‘Innovator‘ (68%) – ‘Late majority‘ (28%)), length of reading electronic or digital
books (19% gap= ‘More than 7hrs/ wk‘ (55%) – ‘Less than 1 hr & 1~3 hrs/wk‘ (36%)) and
frequency of reading electronic or digital books (28% gap = ‘Daily or almost every day‘ (59%) –
‘Less often & Not read e-books‘ (31%)).
South Korean school librarians’ SoC profile, on the other hand, represented a typical nonuser profile, which has more intensity in the Self stages: Stage 0, Unconcerned; Stage 1,
Informational; and Stage 2, Personal. All SoC profiles had the most intense concerns in Stage 0,
Unconcerned, implying participants’ concern towards other innovations, issues, or activities.
South Korean school librarians’ SoC profiles, in comparison to those in Florida, revealed the
largest gaps in the Impact stages. SoC profiles according to South Korean school librarians’
personal experiences show the biggest gaps in Stage 4, Consequence: how long the participants
94

use electronic or digital books (34% gap= ‘Between three and seven hours‘ (82%) – ‘Less than
one hour per week' (48%)) as well as how often participants used electronic or digital books
(43% gap= ‘Daily or almost every day users‘ (86%) – ‘Non-e-book users‘ (43%)). The profile
pertaining to South Korean school librarians’ years of experience shows the biggest gap in Stage
5, Collaboration (21% gap= ‘Less than 4 years‘ and ‘4-6 years‘ (80%) – ‘More than 15 years‘
(59%)). In contrast, Stage 6, Refocusing, shows the biggest gap for teachers’ technology
adoption style (49% gap= ‘Innovator‘ and ‘Early adopter‘ (82%) – ‘Late majority‘ and
‘Laggards‘ (33%)).
RQ 3 asked about significant statistical differences in the stages of concern between
school librarians in Florida and South Korea. To answer this, independent t-tests were applied:
since Stage 0, Unconcerned, was the peak stage for both regions, and that Stages 1,
Informational, and 2, Personal, were the second peak stages both as well, the researcher tested
the mean differences of these stages between Florida and South Korea, revealing that South
Korean school librarians expressed more concern over these three stages. To investigate the
factors that created such differences, the researcher used a t-test for every survey question item.
For Stage 0, Unconcerned, South Korean school librarians’ higher means over the five questions
statistically differed from those in Florida in Stage 1, Informational due to South Korean school
librarians’ (a) limited knowledge, (b) strong desire to discuss the possibility of using digital
textbooks, and (c) desire to know how digital textbooks are better than the paper textbooks.
Moreover, stronger concerns about changes to professional status and teaching roles created
more intense concerns in Stage 2, Personal, for South Korean school librarians.
Based on the data presented in this chapter, Chapter 5 discusses interpretations,
implications, and recommendations by examining the conclusions based on the CBAM and the
95

literature. In doing so, the researcher suggests interventions for school librarians to improve their
leadership roles in implementing digital textbooks.

96

CHAPTER 5
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

This final chapter discusses meanings of the Stages of Concern (SoC) profiles in two
different settings, Florida and South Korea. The research questions are restated and the
methodology of the study and results that were found are summarized. Also, the implications and
recommendations that can help school librarians enhance their leadership role in digital textbook
implementation are presented. Finally, the chapter covers limitations of the study and indications
for future research regarding school librarians’ leadership.
5.1 Summary
With rapidly advancing technology, information specialists must meet growing
information needs in order to bridge the gap between the new innovations and users (Bronstein
& Aharony, 2009; Callahan, 1991). In particular, school librarians’ leadership role in technology
integration has been growing (Dotson & Jones, 2011; Everhart, 2007; Everhart et al., 2012;
National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, 2012; Powell, 2013a). However, as stated
in Chapter 1, despite the growing importance of technology integration leadership and the
emergence of professional guidelines and organizations, there have been only a few studies
addressing how to actually improve librarians’ leadership. Therefore, this study suggests
customized interventions for each group of school librarians based on the stages of concern
regarding their leadership development. The research questions ask the peak stage of concern
and relationship between school librarians’ stages of concern regarding digital textbooks and
their characteristics in Florida and South Korea. Moreover, the last research question compares
the similarities and differences between the two places.
97

To answer the research questions, the researcher applied the Stages of Concern
Questionnaire (SoCQ), a part of the Concerns-Based Adoption Model (CBAM). The CBAM
both provides a structure for testing research questions and guides the study to reach conclusions
about adoption concerns of school librarians (Hall & Hord, 1987; Hollingshead, 2009). The
survey questionnaire used for the study is the SoCQ—one of the methods used to assess the
stages of concern as interpreted by one-legged conferencing and open-ended concern statements.
The SoCQ is widely applied because of its usefulness in helping explain developing patterns for
perceived concerns and attitudes that individuals experience. The SoCQ is convenient and simple
for a researcher to manipulate and for participants to answer, because it consists of thirty-five
items using a seven-point Likert scale. Surveys enable researchers to collect a large amount of
data. When employing the survey method in research on the perception of librarians, the
researcher had the ability to examine sample individuals’ responses. The researcher could also
collect data at relatively low cost and test it relatively quickly.
Over a month-long period from the middle of November through the middle of December
in 2014, two surveys were conducted in Florida and South Korea. They obtained 209 and 259
completed responses respectively.
In order to answer the research questions, the researcher created the SoC profiles based
on the CBAM theory and found that school librarians had high concerns about digital textbooks.
The SoC of Floridia school librarians represents ‘Negative One-Two Split’ user patterns with the
peak at Stage 0, Unconcerned. All other profiles containing relationships between school
librarians’ stages of concern regarding digital textbooks and their characteristics likewise had the
highest concern at Stage 0, Unconcerned. Also, the biggest gaps in all profiles were found on
Stage 5, Collaboration. The SoC profile of Korean school librarians, however, presents a typical
98

non-user profile. Interestingly, when it comes to the SoC profiles pertaining to school librarian
characteristics, the biggest gaps appeared over all the Impact concerns.
5.2 Discussion of Florida School Librarians’ SoC Regarding Digital Textbook Adoption
In section 4.2, a sufficient body of results are presented to investigate the first research
question. This section provides a closer look at the findings from Florida school librarians to
interpret the implications. Specifically, section 4.2 details the overall pattern of the Florida
school librarians’ SoC and the potential resistance that the findings suggest, and offers a closer
look at the peak stage.
Above all, the overall SoC profile depicts “Negative One-Two Split” user patterns, which
have a higher concentration at Stage 2, Personal than Stage 1, Informational. This pattern
suggests that participants are doubtful about digital textbooks, and that this hesitance can signify
future resistance to an innovation (George et al., 2013; Hord et al., 2006). The theory predicts
that when those introducing the innovation do not attempt to reduce the personal concerns of
school librarians this blocks them from giving objective consideration about digital textbooks
(George et al., 2013).
In addition to the One-Two Split, the researcher could discern one more caution sign to
note. Among the various categories pertaining to school librarians’ characteristics, the strongest
disparity between the high Stage 2, Personal, and low Stage 1, Informational (11% gap), was
discovered in the profile of school librarians with 10-15 years of working experience. While the
10-15 year work experience group had a 72% intensity of concerns in Stage 1, Informational,
their strength of concerns in Stage 2, Personal, was 83%. Since more intensive personal concerns
(Stage 2) can ruin the evolution of the process of implementing the higher stages, this group of
school librarians is likely to refuse to accept the implementation. Hall and Hord (1987) exhort
99

the immediate resolution. The intervention to solve the expected issues with the intensive Stage
2, Personal, is detailed in section 5.5.
In addition, a profile with a “tailing-up Stage 6, Refocusing”—one that has a higher
concern on Stage 6, Refocusing than Stages 4, Consequence and 5, Collaboration —can provide
another warning that participants might react negatively to the innovation (George et al., 2013;
Hord et al., 2006). At its basic definition, Stage 6, the Refocusing stage, intimates that
participants focus on trying other ways to get more benefits from the innovation and devising
new ways to use or replace it with a more influential alternative. However, tailing-up Stage 6,
Refocusing, means that participants see more merit in other opportunities and are more interested
in how to do things differently (George et al., 2013) rather than being immersed in the use of
digital textbooks. The more precipitously a profile graph tails up, the more alarm it should raise.
In Florida’s profile, two cases displaying tailing-up Stage 6, Refocusing, were detected. The
biggest gap occurred in the late majority group, those who are skeptical about adopting an
innovation and are fond of tradition. While participants who were included in the late majority
group expressed a 28% intensity of concern on Stage 5, Collaboration, they possess a 34% of
concern on Stage 6, Refocusing. Moreover, participants who do not read e-books suggest the
same potential resistance. Their intensity of concern on Stage 6, Refocusing (34%) was slightly
higher than Stage 5, Collaboration (31%). The leaders and policy makers should take note of this
potential resistance.
On a closer view of Stage 0, Unconcerned, the findings of the SoC profile correspond
with previous studies. Among the five items contained in Stage 0, Question 21, “I am
preoccupied with things other than digital textbooks” and Question 30, “Currently, other
priorities prevent me from focusing my attention on digital textbooks” had the highest average
100

answers (M=4.45 and M=4.19 respectively). As several studies point out, one of the main factors
which inhibit school librarians’ technology integration is lack of time (Johnston, 2011; HughesHassell and Hanson-Baldauf, 2008; Martin, 2011), and these questions also confirm that the
survey subjects were pressed for time. The findings also support Martin’s (2011) assertion that
one of the identified barriers for school librarians to demonstrate leadership is other assigned
duties. In sum, for the successful implementation of digital textbooks, it is required for school
librarians to have more time involved with digital textbooks and the opportunity to plunge deeper
into this innovation.
Lastly, the study affirms that participants who have more than 15 years of teaching
experience, are innovators, read e-books longer and more often and have more than 15 hours
training had lower Unconcerned (Stage 0) scores. This suggests that prior teaching experience
and technology use, along with an assertive attitude toward the innovation, are key elements in
lowering the scores on Stage 0.
5.3 Discussion of South Korean School Librarians’ SoC Regarding Digital Textbook
Adoption
The concerns of the Korean school librarians tended to fall within the first three stages,
Stages 0, Unconcerned; 1, Informational; and 2, Personal. This section examines the overall
pattern of the Korean school librarians’ SoC, including the meaning of highly concerned Stage 1,
Informational, and the potential resistance to embracing digital textbooks.
Overall, Korean school librarians expressed high Self concerns in Stages 0, Unconcerned;
1, Informational; and 2, Personal. This mirrors a typical non-user profile, and indicates that
school librarians were not fully aware of digital textbooks and were more focused on other
responsibilities. However, the high percentages of concern in Stages 1, Informational, and 2,
101

Personal, also suggest that they are open to digital textbook implementation and need more
information about the innovation (George et al., 2013). Moreover, high concerns at Stage 3,
Management, imply that the librarians focused on the processes and tasks of using digital
textbooks and were interested in the best use of information and resources related to digital
textbooks. They were interested in issues about how to improve efficiency, organize jobs,
manage times and schedule the implementation. For the whole pattern, the Stage 6, Refocusing
tailed down at the end of the curve. This conveys that Korean school librarians did not have an
opinion about opportunities that could compete with digital textbooks.
If Stage 0, Unconcerned, is eliminated from consideration in the Korean SoC profile,
Stage 1, Informational, is the stage with the highest concern. George et al. (2013, p. 8) describe
the high concern on Stage1, Informational:
The individual indicates a general awareness of the innovation and interest in learning
more details about it. The individual does not seem to be worried about himself or herself
in relation to the innovation. Any interest is in impersonal, substantive aspects of the
innovation such as its general characteristics, effects, and requirements for use.
This result is in accord with Hughes-Hassell and Hanson-Baldauf’s (2008) research,
which states that one of the barriers to technology integration was a lack of knowledge about
how to use the technology, both personally and instructionally. Since the Stage 1, Informational,
score was higher than the Stage 2, Personal, score, it can indicate that Korean school librarians
retained “a positive and proactive perspective, with little fear of the personal effects a specified
innovation might have” (George et al., 2013, p. 40).
An analysis of the findings determined that the factors stimulating Stage 1, Informational,
concerns were having less teaching experience, a faster innovation adoption style, reading e102

books longer and more often and longer training sessions. In particular, the SoC profile of novice
school librarians noted those who have the least teaching experience have the greatest need for
information about digital textbooks.
In terms of the potential resistance, there was only one group that showed both the onetwo split pattern—which was rarely discovered—and tailing-up Stage 6, Refocusing, as well. A
group of e-book non-readers has higher intensity of concern at Stage 2, Personal (98%), than
Stage 1, Informational (93%). Also, their Stage 6, Refocusing, concern (60%) showed more
intensity than Stage 5, Collaboration (59%). When it comes to the digital textbook
implementation, the non-readers can be a serious counterforce. For this group, since they do not
have any experience or interest in using e-books, an active discussion about the needs for the
new type of education innovation and detailed instruction about digital textbooks, are needed, as
opposed to relying on one-directed compulsion.
In Korea's case, various groups expressed tailing-up Stage 6, Refocusing, which implies
a negative attitude of school librarians toward digital textbooks. Among the four characteristics,
the sub-category pertaining to how fast they adopt the innovation was the one that showed the
biggest gaps. “Innovators” had an 8% (Stage 5=84% and Stage 6=92%); “late majority” had a
9% gap (Stage 5=48% and Stage 6=57%); and “laggards” had a 13% gap (Stage 5=44% and
Stage 6=57%). Participants who had more than 15 years working experience had a 14% gap
(Stage 5=55% and Stage 6=69%). In particular, this most experienced group showed the biggest
gap among all categories. In terms of working experience, the longer the librarians had been
working, the bigger the gap that was noticed. School librarians with 7 to 10 years of working
experience had a 5% gap (Stage 5=68% and Stage 6=73%); those with 10 to 15 years working
experience showed a 1% gap (Stage 5=68% and Stage 6=69%). Unexpectedly, the most highly103

trained school librarian group demonstrated the tailing-up Stage 6, Refocusing, pattern. The
strength of concern at Stage 6, Refocusing, of the group with more than 12 hours training
reached 12%, while Stage 5, Collaboration remained at 80%. In addition to these groups, the
groups who read e-books for less time and less frequently showed one to three percent gaps.
5.4 Discussion of Educational Culture in Florida and South Korea
In this section, the researcher analyzes the educational systems that influence individual
school librarians’ concerns about digital textbook implementation based on the results from
Research Question 3. Since the SoCQ is specialized to identify individual perceptions and is a
part of understanding the dynamics of school and changes, more consideration to affecting
individual concerns is required (Hall, 2013). By describing the school ecology and education
culture related to the highest and second highest stages of concern, the study attempts to provide
broader perspectives to look at the concerns of individual participants and to address context
pertaining to the dissemination of digital textbooks that previous literature revealed.
Research Question 3 discerned the differences between the Florida and South Korea SoC
profiles. The differences between the highest and second highest stages of concern were
identified and the main factors influencing the differences were determined. Table 10 outlines
the results from Research Question 3.
In terms of Stage 0, Unconcerned, school librarians in both settings expressed the highest
intensity of concerns. The study confirmed that there was widespread apathy about digital
textbooks among the participants. This finding echoes previous research. Hughes-Hassell and
Hanson-Baldauf (2008) report the lowest competency in emergent technology tools use. Powell
(2013b) concludes that school librarians are less likely to be aware of tasks dealing with
collaboration and technology that are not included in their job descriptions.

Stage 2,
Personal

One of reasons behind school librarians’ indifference, as analyzed by previous research,
is that the decisions related to digital textbooks were directed and organized by a governing body
via centralized administrative structure (Daft, 1978; Hannon, 2009; Rouse, Hannaway,
Goldhaber, & Figlio, 2013; Sánchez, Salinas, & Harris, 2011; Shin, 2010). The studies agree that
various top-down projects and initiatives for school reform did occur; the process, though, made
105

school culture more rigid, and educators were therefore easily unconcerned about the innovation.
In particular, Korean school librarians expressed a level of indifference that was statistically
significantly higher. As a result, the literature paid particular attention to the imbalance between
a bureaucratic, government-led project and autonomic teachers (Park & Jeong, 2013; Sánchez et
al., 2011). Since the Korean War, the Korean government has led various educational
innovations. This top-down structure incurred not only inflexible curricula and one-sided
lectures, but also a very conservative use of information and communications technology (ICT)
in classes (Sánchez et al., 2011). However, based upon deep-rooted Confucian tradition, teachers
have more autonomy over the courses and they exercise more leverage in deciding the use of
educational technologies, regardless of the obligatory nature of school reform (Shin, 2010). This
disproportion between a government-driven school reform initiative and teachers’ resistance to
the reform has brought a conservative use of ICT and insufficient instructional models (Park &
Jeong, 2013; Sánchez et al., 2011). The study repeats this state of tension in digital textbook
implementation.
The results verified that school librarians in both locations also have higher concern
about Stage 1, the Informational stage. The survey discovered that school librarians were
interested in obtaining more information about digital textbooks. Specifically, as Table 8 depicts,
school librarians expressed great interest in the available resources in Florida (M=4.86, the
highest intensity among five survey items for Stage 1, Informational) and South Korea (M=5.11,
the second highest intensity). It may reflect the fact that neither place has prepared any concrete
plans for digital textbooks. Furthermore, school librarians in Florida faced challenges when it
was decided that each district school board should spend at least 50% of the instructional
materials funds to purchase digital or electronic instructional materials beginning in the 2015106

2016 fiscal year (The Florida Senate, 2011). School librarians are responsible for making
informational materials available (Florida Statutes, Title XLVIII K-20 Education code, 2012).
Changes in collection development without corresponding adjustments to budget would require
school librarians to monitor this resource issue.
Kang and Everhart (2014e) find that Florida school librarians' greatest concerns related to
the adoption of digital textbooks are focused on resources - budgeting (20.5%) and infrastructure
issues such as Internet access (9.6%), devices (8.9%), and hardware (7.9%). In particular, Florida
recommends schools adopt a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policy to meet the 1:1 goal
(Florida's Digital Instructional Materials Work Group, 2013) but has not provided a solution for
students who cannot afford devices. It seems logical that each school district should support
students from low-income families, but this presents an equity issue such as in Miami-Dade
county public schools. Noted in their digital classrooms plan (Miami-Dade County, 2014) is that
only 14-25% of families are likely to participate in BYOD programs. For a successful
introduction of digital textbooks, equity issues need to be addressed and improved.
On the other hand, Korean school librarians have unique anxiety about resources, since
the Korean government has provided the necessary resources to push for innovative ICT
practices, and some private companies are collaborating with research organizations to expand
educational hardware and software (Sánchez et al., 2011). This one-way adoption would exclude
school librarians from the discussion about the use of digital textbooks and the process to
develop collections. Again, it is possible for this absence of conversation to bring more eagerness
to discuss the possibility of using digital textbooks and an increase in the desire to know how
digital textbooks are better than the existing resources.

107

In terms of Stage 2, Personal, concern, school librarians in both locations expressed a
high level of concern. As mentioned above in section 2.2.1, the altered role of school librarians
has yet to be agreed upon. However, the environment that school librarians have encountered in
school libraries is not currently amenable to e-books, which can be an initial model of digital
textbook service. Library Journal, and School Library Journal (2014) conducted a survey of
1,271 school librarians which indicated that only 66% of library media centers nationwide
provide e-books to students and faculty. Also, the collection size for e-books remains fairly low;
there are an average of 189 digital titles per school library while the median number of print
books is 11,300. The small collection size is not the only hindering factor; the lack of e-readers is
another obstacle for e-book service. Still, the top method by which students utilized the e-book
collection was “school desktop computers,” selected by 68% of respondents.
In South Korea, no statistics can be found in regards to the relationship between school
libraries and e-book services when the libraries are providing e-book service through the local
Ministry of Education (D. Lee, personal communication, July 3, 2013). Distinctly, the rate of
concern that Korean school librarians expressed on the Personal stage is statistically significantly
higher than those in Florida. One of the various reasons that Korean school librarians are worried
about their roles is the complicated position structure and job insecurity. Although school
librarians’ job security in Florida has been lowered, there is only one level of school librarian
position and the path to achieving the position is very clear. In the U.S., one needs one needs
certification earned from the state's board of education to be a school librarian. According to
Florida Statutes (2012), in chapter 1012.55 “Positions for Which Certificates Required,” the
Statutes clarify that library media specialists in Florida should “hold the certificate required by
law and by rules of the State Board of Education in fulfilling the requirements of the law for the
108

type of service rendered” (para. 1). However, in Korea, the School Library Promotion Act, by the
Ministry of Education (2008), identifies three kinds of school librarians in its Article 2 in Section
4, 5 and 6. The certification processes vary according to the position.
4. The term "library teacher" means a person who is in charge of the affairs of a school
library with a library teacher certificate under Article 21 of the Elementary and
Secondary Education Act;
5. The term "practical education teacher" means a person who is in charge of the affairs
in a school library with a certificate of practical education teacher after the completion of
library and information science or library science under Article 21 of the Elementary and
Secondary Education Act;
6. The term "librarian staff" means a person who works in a school library with the
qualifications under Article 6, Paragraph 2 of the Library Act (para. 2).
According to the law, only a “library teacher” has an educational background and a
school library degree. This becomes critical because the School Library Promotion Act allows
schools to hire practical education teachers or librarian staff instead of library teachers. Practical
education teachers and librarian staff do not need to have an educational background, and most
of them are part-time employees. More seriously, the total number of these three kinds of staff
working in schools does not reach even half of the country’s libraries (Ministry of Education,
2013).
In conclusion, this section includes some aspects of school culture that affect school
librarians’ concern. In order to address human resource issues pertaining to the diffusion of
digital textbooks and to provide timely support and appropriate assistance to facilitate the
adoption of digital textbooks, this study analyzes the similarities and differences of culture and
109

educational background that influence individual school librarians’ concerns about digital
textbook implementation. Not only various similarities, such as the textbook reforms and their
roles, top-down innovation or continuous attempts to improve students' achievement, but also the
differences, such as school librarians’ roles, use of e-books, purpose of digital textbook
implementation or teacher resistance provide an opportunity to closely look at school librarians’
concern. For successful implementation of digital textbooks, it is worth noting Waldron and
McLeskey’s (2010) assertion. They argue that collaborative cultures are required, and distributed
leadership is indispensable in order to overcome the culture where teachers typically work in
isolation utilizing traditional professional development, which has been shown to be ineffective.
5.5 Interventions for School Librarians in Florida and South Korea
This study aims to identify the most efficient way for school librarians to be leaders in
integrating digital textbooks in their schools. A simple assessment of their personal concerns,
however, is insufficient for providing practical plans of action (Hall & Hord, 1987). CBAM
researchers therefore developed incident intervention, “an action or event or a set of actions or
events that influences use of the innovation” (Hall & Hord, 1987, p.143). This series of events
comes in various shapes and sizes, the key criteria for which are 1) the presence of action(s) or
event(s) and 2) an observable effect (or potential for an effect) from using the innovation (Hall,
1979, p.31).
To provide practical advice for school librarians implementing digital textbooks,
therefore, this section introduces interventions used by CBAM theorists, integrating various
events, which can in turn become interventions for school librarians. To offer comprehensive
suggestions, the researcher integrated at the end of the section professional development ideas
from previous research that have dealt with support strategies for school librarians.
110

Hall and Hord (1987) offer example interventions for each stage of concern. For Stage 0,
Unconcerned, the authors emphasize the requirement of expressing little concern about
innovation. Events that link the innovation to teachers’ significant areas of interest are very
important—sharing information to increase school librarians’ interest and encouraging
individuals to talk about the innovation with others are helpful in particular. In this study, school
librarians in Florida and South Korea expressed highest concerns during Stage 0. It is therefore
critical to provide them the opportunity to converse and exchange information about digital
textbooks.
For school librarians who were highly unconcerned, interventions, including “involving
teachers in discussions and decisions, sharing information to arouse interest and taking steps to
minimize gossip and inaccurate information,” can be provided (Hord et al., 1987, p. 44). For
example, information-exchange strategies, such as daily conversation, guest speakers, brochures,
periodicals, one-on-one conversations, and vendor presentations, can arouse interest for digital
textbooks. As professional development methods this study recommends attending
college/graduate school, participating in conferences, school visits, short media presentations,
and workshops. Administrators can help school librarians to develop supportive organizational
arrangements, broadcast information/materials, and provide consultations so as to reinforce
administrator advocacy and support by holding sessions to share educators' feelings about digital
textbooks and trainings. Associations such as the Florida Association for Media in Education
(FAME), listservs such as LM_NET, and public libraries’ e-book classes will excite school
librarians’ interest in digital textbooks. Most 21st century professional development methods will
prove beneficial to unconcerned school librarians.

111

For Stage 1, Informational, educators need to know the realistic expectations related to
benefits and costs of an innovation by providing them with general information. Educators need
to learn how the innovation would differ from current practices, as well as have the opportunity
to experience the best practice by visiting other schools, classes, or meeting others involved with
the innovation.
Most information exchange strategies, including “face-to-face conversations, brief reports
during staff meetings, newsletters, and press releases” (Hall & Hord, 1987, p. 71) as well as
administrator advocacy, support, and rap sessions, will prove useful for school librarians to
obtain more information. Also, various information exchange strategies such as guest speakers,
brochures, periodicals, small groups, staff meetings and vendor presentations, professional
development and administrative can work as interventions for school librarians who have
intensive Stage 1 concern. In addition, previous research shows that various 21st century
professional development methods are the effective ways to deliver the related information to
school librarians.
Since all participants in Florida and South Korea expressed high levels in Stage 1,
Informational, these findings indicate that both a) less-experienced school librarians, laggards,
and school librarians who read e-books a few times a week in Florida and b) less-experienced
school librarians, early adopters, and school librarians who read e-books frequently and longer in
South Korea require interventions for Stage 1, Informational.
To assist those with high concerns in Stage 2, Personal, on the basis of personal concerns,
educators need help to understand how they should prioritize innovations over other jobs in
terms of time and energy. Hall and Hord (1987) strongly emphasize, moreover, the importance

112

of encouraging the gradual use of innovation. The authors thus take precautions against allencompassing or coercive applications.
Individuals with high Personal concerns will benefit from most information exchange
strategies and 21st century professional development. The most important of these is
administrative support: Hord and Thurber (1982) pinpoint several ways that can provide personal
support, such as developing supportive organizational arrangements, broadcasting information
and materials, holding grade-level meetings, providing consultations/reinforcements, rap
sessions, and trainings. For example, school librarians who have already demonstrated their
leadership in digital textbooks can work with education authorities to develop role models for
other school librarians and would be an important intervention in this stage.
Although school librarians who participated in this study did not have higher concern in
Stage 3, Management, they have become a subject of interest in digital textbook implementation.
In fact, Florida state reports urge school librarians to play pivotal roles in the transition to digital
learning. According to Florida Statutes K-12 education codes, school librarians should be on the
“Digital Content Committee” to evaluate digital content (Florida's Digital Instructional Materials
Work Group, 2013). They also argue that computer vendors should provide training for school
librarians, so that they can run IT help desks.
In order to provide practical advice for school librarians with higher concerns in Stage 3,
Management, Hall and Hord (1987) suggest 1) providing hands-on answers to demonstrate how
to “fit” the innovation rather than add a new job; 2) establishing a plan or timeline to accomplish
simple and specific jobs; and 3) demonstrating exemplary cases for successful or unsuccessful
practice. The authors, however, are strongly wary of providing all day “how to” workshops to

113

demonstrate the innovation. Instead, they suggest the employment of in-house experts, hot lines,
regular newsletters, and manuals.
Specific mediums for providing interventions are small groups, staff meetings, supportive
organizational arrangements, rap sessions, and trainings. Above all, professional development
technologies are most valuable. The Web 2.0 technologies such as blogs, Facebook, instant
messaging, live streaming videos, online chats, online courses, podcasts/vidcasts, Twitter,
videoconferencing (Skype), webinars, and Wikis allow school librarians to communicate with
each other, vendors, or administrative personnel. The simple understanding of using these
technologies is a strategy that school librarians may embrace and employ.
School librarians with concerns in Stage 4, Consequence, need continuous
encouragement rather than unilateral instructions. People in this group require opportunities to
refine their use and promote their skills. School librarians who are interested in Stage 4,
Consequence, might locate free and downloadable educational resources or training materials for
digital textbooks, or build a collection which links digital textbook curriculum with relevant
resources.
Although they did not require interventions as much as other groups, Florida school
librarians with 10–14 year working experiences who read e-books a few times a week and had
long training experience were motivated by encouragement from others. For South Korean
school librarians who are e-book heavy users, however, the special attention is required in Stage
4, Consequence. Since Korean school librarians expressed the biggest gaps in Stage 4,
Consequence, according to the length and frequency of e-book use, interventions should be
implemented for heavy users of e-books first. Again, the 21st century professional development

114

technologies would help school librarians better serve students better because they are
convenient to share and illustrate prime examples of digital textbooks.
Since school librarians with concerns in Stage 5, Collaboration, are more likely to be
leaders of a change effort, it is beneficial to engage them with advocacy and the promotion of
collaborative work and committee activities to bring out their expertise in educating other
colleagues. Identical interventions in Florida are not advisable for Stage 5, Collaboration, as
Florida school librarians revealed very different intensities of concerns in this stage. It is thus
necessary to customize interventions for novices, innovators, and heavy users of e-books. For
South Korea, on other hand, novice school librarians need tailored, special care to promote their
collaboration since they had the biggest gap in Stage 5, Collaboration.
The specific interventions to facilitate and encourage Stage 5, Collaboration, include
exchanging ideas, improving group work skills and resources through an organizational
development expert, and demonstrating school librarians’ work with colleagues who have less
knowledge (Hall & Hord, 1987). However, the best promotion of collaboration and awareness is
engagement with the community, which includes participating in associations, obtaining mentors
or peer support, and collaborating with public libraries. In Florida, professional organizations
such as the Florida Association for Media in Education (FAME) and the Florida Educational
Technology Conference (FETC) could recognize model programs with awards.
School librarians with Stage 6, Refocusing concerns, are self-initiated and have their own
goals. In this respect, appropriate directive actions are required to change those goals towards
productive uses of the innovation. It is important to allow principals and team leaders to take
action regarding those concerns.

115

Stage 6, Refocusing, suggests that school librarians with high concern should be
encouraged to take action through productive direction (Hall and Hord, 1987). This stage allows
them to conduct a pilot test with the support of resources and materials. Various conversation
exchanging opportunities such as small groups, staff meetings, conferences, workshops, online
chats, podcasts/vidcasts, Twitter, videoconferencing, and webinars might encourage school
librarians to explore more benefits from digital textbooks.
Table 11, Intervention Strategies for Addressing User Concerns for Digital Textbook
Integration, exhibits the possible strategies that can support school librarians to develop their
leadership or alleviate school librarians’ concerns at a certain level. The overall categories and
suited strategies were adopted from the research of Petherbridge (2007), consisting of the five
categories: information exchange, professional development, support – administrative,
community and 21st century professional development. The researcher marks the suggestions
that CBAM theorists’ make in bold. The 21st century professional development methods were
newly added according to previous research.
Interventions will be useful to the groups that expressed the higher concerns all over the
stages or the specific stages. These are especially suggested for laggards, late majority groups,
heavy users of e-books, highly trained groups in Florida, as well as less experienced school
librarians, innovators, heavy users of e-books, and highly trained groups in South Korea. In
particular, Korean school librarians expressed the biggest concern gap according to the speed
with which they adopt innovation. Interventions should therefore be designed for innovators and
early adopter groups.

5.6 Implications and Recommendations
This study investigates the perceptions and concerns of school librarians in Florida and
South Korea about using digital textbooks within a planning period. Based on the results given
above, this section considers the implications and offers recommendations—not only for the
sample populations, but also for a broader audience of school administrators, educational
policymakers, other educators, and library professionals.
5.6.1. Recommendations for Practice
5.6.1.1 School librarians. This study confirms that school librarians in both Florida and
South Korea represent populations that are non-users of digital textbooks. The SoC profiles from
participants in both regions were thus able to offer predictions on the areas of potential
resistance: Florida school librarians expressed more personal rather than informational concerns,
while Korean school librarians showed refocusing rather than collaboration concerns. The peak
stage for both regions was in Stage 0, Unconcerned, which means that participants were
occupied with other issues besides digital textbooks.
As the implementation of digital textbooks is imminent, thus, a top priority for school
librarians would be to initiate conversations about digital textbooks and introduce interventions
to relieve such concerns. For example, there are clear signs of school librarians lacking an
understanding required for integrating technology (Stage 0, Unconcerned), and that school
librarians feel they do not have enough time to spend on digital textbooks. Thus, efforts to share
relevant information, encourage and motivate school librarians’ use, and enhance publicity of
digital textbooks are imperative. Martin, V. D. (2011) indicates that as concrete measures
professional development opportunities help school librarians.

119

Lastly, school librarians should acknowledge the need for interventions on Impact
concerns (Stages 4, Consequence; 5, Collaboration and 6, Refocusing). As soon as schools
incorporate digital textbooks, school librarians are more likely to become leaders in
disseminating that technology: providing formal instruction or classes on technological skills is
perceived as school librarians’ task (Powell, 2013c; Smith, 2013). School librarians should thus
not only understand how to model the best instructional practices and advocate educational
programs for all learners, but also develop programs and curricula that meet schools’ or districts’
initiatives (National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, 2012). Also, school librarians
need to educate students and teachers on educational multimedia equipment and materials.
5.6.1.2 School administrators. The study identifies several potential groups to have
resistance. As digital textbooks’ implementation is about to be realized, it is strongly recommend
to provide training, assistance, emotional and technological support as quickly as possible,
especially for groups who expressed more intense concern. At the same time, it cannot be
ignored that proper curriculum and pedagogy need to be developed for school librarians who
have more concerns at higher stages; thereby, they can keep developing their leadership in
embracing digital textbooks.
School administrators should also remember that supporting interpersonal relationships is
key for practicing leadership roles in technology integration (Johnston, 2011; Smith, 2013). In
particular, supportive principals and teachers are the most critical aspects to technology
integration (Johnston, 2011), and introducing digital textbooks will be no different.
5.6.1.3 Educational policy makers. Florida expects the transition to digital textbooks
will reduce school spending (Natale & Cook, 2012) while South Korea expects to slowly
eradicate chronic private education by implementing digital textbooks (J. H.-Y. Kim & Jung,
120

2010). Whatever educational policymakers believe, if the government truly believes that digital
textbooks are necessary for education systems in the 21st century, they should be aware of school
librarians’ concerns: providing relevant interventions is vital to digital textbook implementation.
In addition, policymakers need to listen to Hall & Hord (1987), the authors of the CBAM,
who underline that 1) Florida school librarians with strong concerns in Stage 2, Personal, need
continuous encouragement and 2) it is useless to impose the values of digital textbooks on school
librarians—rather, constructive and encouraging conversations with a full exchange of views is
required. For South Korean school librarians with strong concerns in Stage 6, Refocusing, policy
makers should establish clear-cut lines of authority and responsibility. Since such school
librarians have a great potential to become leaders in integrating digital textbooks, policymakers
should allow them to pilot test digital textbooks by offering opportunities to access relevant
materials and resources.
5.6.1.4 Library and information science education. As previous research states, school
librarians’ educational and professional activities are essential parts in leading technology
integration (Forrest, 1993; D. Smith, 2010), as they provide educational programs with curricula
that stimulate librarians to have more leadership and change their perceptions. Therefore, this
study suggests that library and information science educators meet the requirements of the 21st
century by strengthening their education programs. In the short run, programs need to cover the
issues for Self SoC by providing general information for school librarians about digital
textbooks, offering substantive aspects of digital textbooks, and explaining school librarians’ role
and relationship within the school structure. In the long run (at least within three years), the SoC
profile is predicted to move towards higher stages of concern. Thus, consideration about how to
maximize the impact of digital textbooks on students, how to collaborate with other colleagues
121

and community members, and how to explore additional benefits must be taken. For those
beyond their college degrees, universities can offer professional development opportunities for
successful ways to integrate digital textbooks.
5.6.1.5 Other educators. The introduction of new technology will not be successful if
school librarians are on their own. Collaboration within learning communities is very important
when school librarians introduce instructional technology (International Society for Technology
in Education (ISTE), 2012; Johnston, 2011; National Board for Professional Teaching Standards,
2012; Powell, 2013c). This collaboration, however, is not as common as it should be (Everhart et
al., 2012) and school librarians are no longer considered the only technology integration experts
within schools (Johnston, 2013). In order to successfully implement digital textbooks, other
educators need to cooperate with school librarians in introducing innovations, sharing their
strategies and communicating as a team.
5.6.2. Theory
Although the CBAM is a convenient tool for measuring individual’s concerns, it
possesses a theoretical weakness. As mentioned in section 2.3.2, the concerns in CBAM refer to
a psychological action based on personal make-up, prior knowledge, and prior experience when
facing new experiences or environments to evaluate the need for improvement or change (Hall &
Hord, 1987). It cannot, therefore, measure teachers’ positive perceptions (Straub, 2009). Since a
concern in and of itself does not have any negative or positive meaning, researchers should
recognize that the CBAM does not measure individual preference levels.
According to this study, librarians may resist through their concerns, but they may also
enjoy digital textbooks. It was hard for not only the researcher but also participants to grasp the
real meaning of an operational definition of concern, particularly, when the researcher developed
122

the Korean version of the SoCQ, wherein selecting each word to translate the meaning of
“concern” proved convoluted. The term “concern” can be misunderstood as either a positive
word, such as “interest,” or as a negative word, such as “worry” (Newhouse, 2001; Straub,
2009). It would thus be better for the CBAM to provide a memo or promote helping researchers
and participants fully understand the intended meaning of “concern,” as it seems worthwhile to
categorize, subdivide, and thus define that word.
5.7 Limitations and Future Study
Special caution should be exercised for the implications and recommendations from this
study because of the limitations presented below.
5.7.1. Limitations
George et al. (2013, pp. 55–56) confirm that SoCQ can serve as a diagnostic tool, but
should not be used for screening or judging. As an initial research, this study does not aim to
screen or judge school librarians’ concerns, even though this is true that the results can be used
for judging participants’ skills or abilities and the interventions can be distorted. Again, the
researcher believes that identifying and understanding the issues and concerns from school
librarians can help inform human resource departments of librarians’ concerns. Also, the findings
provide implications and recommendations to help educational policymakers and school
administrators identify school library issues that require further attention and resources.
This study also did not fully apply all three dimensions of the CBAM theory. In order to
answer the research questions, the study integrated the CBAM while using the SoCQ in the
CBAM as an instrument. Although all three dimensions of the CBAM were not applied in this
study, the SoCQ made a diagnosis of school librarians as a preliminary study. As digital
textbooks are disseminated, LoU and IC can be employed in future research in order to
123

comprehend an overall view of digital textbook initiatives. Moreover, this study tested one of
three offered techniques—the SoCQ—to assess the stages of concern about innovation. Also,
since CBAM researchers provide three various ways (one-legged conferencing, open-ended
concern statements, and SoCQ) to identify school librarians’ concern, further studies need to
apply the other two methods. At the very least, researchers should analyze open-ended questions,
such as “When you think about digital textbooks, what are you concerned about?” (Hall & Hord,
1987, p. 66). This additional question will enable researchers not only to obtain an individual’s
own narrations about digital textbooks, but also to obtain “a great deal more about what the
concerns are about” (p.67).
The results from this study may not be applicable to all educators. Although the research
questions were derived from the previous literature and the CBAM framework, the results from
this study should not be generalized to represent other school librarian groups. Nevertheless, the
investigation of school librarians’ understanding and current appreciation in two distinctive
places—Florida and South Korea—provide practical frames of reference for other states or
nations embarking on digital textbook innovation.
As with other research methods, the analyses of the data can be influenced by the
researcher’s own disposition or world view. The researcher applied a reliable tool, which is the
SoCQ, and tried to determine school librarians’ stages of concern in a detached way, and tried to
respect any participants’ advice, comments, and feedback about their stages of concern. With a
belief that whatever respondents’ comments were, their reactions reflect their concerns, the
researcher tried to take note of participants’ reactions.

124

5.7.2. Future Studies
As an initial study, this project can be continued with various directions. Here are several
suggestions for further investigation:
1. Conducting longitudinal studies to identify the dynamics of school librarians’ concern
and evaluating the effectiveness of various trials. Further research, moreover, should
track strategies that have successfully supported school librarians in adopting digital
textbooks (depending on their SoC). Such studies would also supply a model for future
technological innovations, providing a salutary lesson for their implementation by
measuring SoC before and after particular interventions or comparing several areas which
have different interventions.
2. Determining school librarians’ Levels of Use (LoU) of digital textbooks depending on
their level of involvement in librarian practices and experiences, thus enabling school
administrators to determine more efficient ways to help school librarians’ use digital
textbooks. This can also act as an initial inquiry examining school librarians’ LoU of
educational technology. Since LoU assesses people’s behavior, researchers should use a
focused interview with intensive observation (Hall & Hord, 1987), starting with openended questions and then closing in on a particular step.
As a simpler technique, the “one-legged conference” format is suggested, which
starts with broad questions and gradually focuses to category-specific probes (p.96).
Again, LoU provides “the framework considering and describing the change process in
ways that respond to policymakers’ needs for accountability” (Hall & Hord, 1987, p.
103). Also, LoU can be a milepost demonstrating rate of progress, specifics of progress
on the innovation, or completion of progress.
125

3. Developing Innovation Configuration (IC) maps in order for school librarians to have a
clear picture of what constitutes “high-quality” use of digital textbooks. IC helps “how
facilitators identify and describe the various forms an innovation can take, showing the
most ideal form of the innovation” (George et al., 2013, p. 5). In order to create an IC
map, researchers must follow the following six steps (LaTurner et al., 2013a, pp. 41-47).
(1) Carefully consider an innovation by visualizing, brainstorming, and exploring parts of
the practice or change with respect to what the user would be doing. (2) Decide which
components are major operational features of that practice. (3) Express the main behavior
components using verbs. (4) Go over those components and determine sequential order.
If required, reorder or group the components to make the best sense. (5) Knowing now
what actually occurs, generate variations of each component, from ideal to less-than-ideal
observable actions. (6) Lastly, improve the variations by reviewing, refining, and editing
the entire document for various stakeholders.
4. Applying a mixed method, or an explanatory approach, to provide deeper understanding
of librarians’ perceptions. By combining qualitative and quantitative methodologies
(Creswell, 2009), mixed method research will not just “collect and analyze” data, but
rather converge, integrate, and combine paradigms related to adopting digital textbooks.
Greene (2007) formulated a mixed method paradigm for better understanding and
engaging with multiplism. This method would lead to a better understanding of the
complexity of digital textbook implementation, generating a “broader, deeper, more
inclusive understanding” to “honor the complexity and contingency of human
phenomena” (Greene, 2007, p. 21). Multiplism signifies that a mixed method accepts
and respects multiple philosophical perspectives and theories of knowledge, helping to
126

verify diverse claims related to research questions. For engaging with difference, “value
commitments” inspire and motivate a mixed method (Greene, 2007, p. 27) through three
intertwining dimensions: philosophy, methodology, and ideology. Thus, mixed method
research brings various philosophies together by gathering narratives from school
librarians. An explanatory design would start with a quantitative study (in this case, the
survey) to determine statistically significant differences. The research would then
conduct an in-depth qualitative study to explicate these results (Creswell & Plano Clark,
2007). The study would then follow a participant selection model, which researchers
apply when they need quantitative results to “identify and purposefully select participants
for a follow-up, in-depth, qualitative study” (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2007, p. 74).
5. Studying a smaller, more homogenous sample size of school librarians’ SoC. This initial
study compared two different geographical settings, and the researcher therefore
considered it desirable to understand, investigate, define, and delineate the entire
population of librarians impacted by technological innovation. Since there was no
existent empirical research on school librarians’ concerns, the most urgent priority was
identifying such issues. As a second step, a future study can be done within a smaller
area, such as a school district, to offer a comprehensive analysis of school librarians’
attitudes. Throughout this study, the researcher seeks to deepen the understanding of
respondents’ perceptions in a given situation. Since not all school districts have the same
plans or schedules for adopting digital textbooks, however, a focused study would allow
researchers to obtain more prompt and practical responses.
6. Conducting further comparison studies that deal with various issues in different places.
As described in section 2.2.3, many U.S. states as well as other nations (such as Hong
127

Kong, Japan, Singapore, and several European countries) have a specific plan for digital
textbook implementation. A study comparing two different places would explain how
digital textbooks can be efficiently implemented, the strong or weak points in a given
environment, and where digital textbooks excel when compared to other regions. An even
further study could compare school librarians’ concerns and perceptions with those of
another state to show how top-down administration affects such concerns.
7. Exploring further information specialists’ perceptions on technological innovations by

employing the Stage of Concern Questionnaire and the CBAM theory. While the CBAM
was originally developed for school educators, it can also be applied for various groups,
including parents and students (Hall & Hord, 1987). While information science has not
employed the CBAM much, it should be actively utilized for other innovations. As more
technological innovations are introduced, thus requiring information specialists to be
leaders in integrating those technologies, more studies must be done to identify those
specialists’ concerns so as to support them with proper interventions.
5.8 Conclusion
While offering different educational cultures, Florida and South Korea are both about to
embrace digital textbooks. The purpose for this implementation, however, is quite different for
each region: Florida expects digital textbooks to reduce education expenses, while South Korea
expects to slowly eradicate chronic private education through digital textbooks. Considering this
top-down decision, both educators and school librarians will be required to support this
innovation. Meanwhile, as school librarians are expected to play a leadership role in integrating
technology— this study thus explored school librarians’ concerns in two regions, comparing the

128

results in order to address human resource issues pertaining to the diffusion of digital textbooks
so as to provide timely support in facilitating their adoption.
In order to identify school librarians’ stages of concern and the relationship between
those stages and their four characteristics, this study applied the CBAM theory and SoCQ: 209
school librarians in Florida and 259 school librarians in South Korea completed both the SoCQ
and a demographic survey. The researcher analyzed the data using SoCQ analysis as well as ttests. SoCQ has proven effective in identifying school librarians’ stages of concerns. The SoC
from Florida school librarians presented a ‘Negative One-Two Split’ user pattern, while those
from South Korea presented a typical non-user pattern. The CBAM theory anticipates that there
will be potential resistance from school librarians towards digital textbook implementation. Also,
this study found that, according to their chracteristics, school librarians showed the biggest gaps
of concerns in the Impact stages (Stages 4, Consequence; 5, Collaboration, and 6, Refocusing)
while having relatively high concerns in the Self stages (Stages 0, Unconcerned; 1,
Informational, and 2, Personal).
Based on the CBAM theory, the findings underscore a need of various interventions.
Since school librarians’ apathy was found while digital textbook integration will be put into
effect soon and, the intervention to inform school librarians of characteristics and strong points
of digital textbooks as well as restrictions for using them is urgent (Stage 0, Unconcerned).
Moreover, the study findings argue that it is urgent to introduce various interventions for specific
groups of participants. For example, South Korean school librarians, who had the second highest
concern in Stage 1, Informational, need to receive general information including benefits and
costs of digital textbooks. Florida school librarians, who had the second highest concern in Stage
2, need guidance to prioritize to digital textbooks as well as continuous encouragement.
129

The results from the study stress the importance of professional development for school
librarians. Data from the study provides administrators with information that targeted and
customized interventions according to school librarians’ characteristics. Moreover, to
policymakers, the theory suggests gradual implementation of digital textbooks in Florida and
pilot test opportunities in South Korea. Lastly, the study urges library and information science
education to have short and long term strategies to embrace digital textbooks.

The leadership role of school librarians in the adoption of digital textbooks: Evaluating school
librarians' stages of concern in Florida and South Korea
My name is Ji Hei Kang and I am a doctoral candidate under the advisement of Dr. Nancy
Everhart at Florida State University School of Information doing research on digital textbooks
and school librarians.
We would appreciate your professional help and expertise in answering this survey.
The purpose of this study is to identify the level of concerns that school librarians have with
respect to adoption of digital textbooks. A survey, consisting of the Stages of Concern
Questionnaire (SoCQ, 35 items) and demographic questions (10 items), is applied as a means to
identify the answers to the research questions. The study involves answering an online survey
and should take approximately 10-20 minutes. The benefits of the research are helping further
our knowledge of the level of concerns on digital textbooks. There are no foreseeable risks to
participating in this study.
Your participation is completely voluntary and you are free to withdraw you consent and
discontinue participation in the survey at any time. There are no consequences if you decide not
to complete the survey. Individual results will remain confidential to the extent allowed by law
and we do not collect any individual information. All those who complete the survey will be
entered into a drawing to get online bookstore gift cards. [Korean: All those who complete the
survey will be entered into a drawing to get Kyobo bookstore online gift cards.]
If you have any questions or concerns about this survey, feel free to contact Ji Hei Kang at
jk11e@my.fsu.edu- / 1-716-650-8430 [Korean: 070-9034-4097] or Dr. Nancy Everhart at
everhart@fsu.edu 850-644-8122 [Korean: 1-850-644-8122]. If you have any questions or
concerns regarding this study and would like to talk to someone other than the researcher, you
are encouraged to contact the Human Subjects Committee at Florida State University at 2010
