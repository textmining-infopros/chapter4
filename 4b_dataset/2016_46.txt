CROXTON, REBECCA A., Ph.D. Undergraduate Students and Academic Library
Utilization: A Quantitative Dominant Mixed Methods Study of Information Seeking
Needs, Preferences, and Motivation. (2016).
Directed by Dr. Dale H. Schunk and Dr. Anthony S. Chow. 308 pp.
Higher education institutions across the United States are asked to do more with
less. This has come at a time when the current presidential administration is calling for
the education of every American (White House, 2009). While Americans are enrolling in
universities at higher rates than ever before, attrition remains high. Maintaining student
enrollment has become a high stakes endeavor as loss of students directly affects
institutional budgets. Tinto (1975) posits that student engagement plays an important role
in a student’s decision to persist or drop out of college. The academic library is poised to
play a key role in engaging and retaining students, though not without a disruption to the
status quo.
This study seeks to explore factors relating to undergraduate student engagement/
disengagement with the academic library and to explore whether university libraries
should expand their role beyond providing academic resources and services into more
“real-life” areas that are important to the daily lives of undergraduate students and in
support of university retention goals. A quantitative dominant four-phase sequential
mixed methods design was implemented at three purposely selected large, public 4-year
universities geographically distributed across the United States. Data collection involved
1,291 participants and included semi-structured interviews with academic librarians
(n=8), university enrollment and retention officials (n=3), and undergraduate students
(n=18), an online survey completed by 1,280 randomly selected undergraduate students,

and an analysis of 50 randomly selected academic library websites. Study findings
suggest that there is a viable place in the campus community for the library to serve in an
expanded role in support of university student retention goals. Such change, however,
may require a realignment of library priorities, rebranding of the library in a new role,
and significant marketing. A critical component for the success of a new model relates to
building students’ perceptions of relevance of the library.

CHAPTER I
INTRODUCTION
Statement of the Problem
In universities throughout the United States, student retention is a critical issue.
The U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics (2015)
recently reported that 59% of first-time full-time students who began seeking a bachelor’s
degree at a 4-year institution in fall 2007 completed the degree at that institution by 2013.
While institutions of higher education across the country are making concerted efforts to
retain their students, a largely untapped resource in support of retention efforts is the
university academic library. The academic library is equipped to play a critical role in
engaging students in both the formal and informal systems of the institution by bringing
together both the academic and everyday life information that students need to thrive and
succeed, thus having the potential to positively affect student retention. However, current
trends suggest undergraduate students are turning away from their academic libraries in
favor of more attractive alternatives for their information seeking (Colón-Aguirre &
Fleming-May, 2012; Denison & Montgomery, 2012). In support of university goals for
students’ academic success and retention, the primary purposes of this study are to
develop a deeper understanding of why undergraduate students are turning to sources
beyond the academic library to meet their information needs and to explore ways by
which to reverse these trends.

1

Underutilization of Academic Libraries
There is a widening gap between the undergraduate digital information seekers of
today and their academic libraries. While academic libraries have long been heralded as
the heart of the university (Leupp, 1924), today’s undergraduate learners are opting for
quick, easy, and more convenient alternatives to meet their information needs that do not
include the library (Colón-Aguirre & Fleming-May, 2012; Denison & Montgomery,
2012; Head, 2008; Mizrachi, 2010). Findings from a 2010 large-scale international study
on library trends suggest that search engines dominate among college students of all ages
as the electronic source used to find online content (93%), while results show a decline in
use of library Web sites, electronic journals, and online databases since 2005 (De Rosa,
Cantrell, Carlson, Gallagher, Hawk, & Schwartz, 2011, p. 52). These researchers noted
that the decline in library usage appears to be driven primarily by college students 25
years of age and older. In this same study, reported usage of library websites (58%), ejournals (39%), and online databases (39%) among the 18-24 year old college student
population in 2010 was found to be moderate at best (De Rosa et al., 2011, p. 52).
This turning away from the academic library by undergraduate students elicits
cause for concern as significant, positive correlational evidence suggests library
utilization is closely related to both students’ academic performance (Barkey, 1965;
Goodall & Pattern, 2011; Knapp, 1966; Robinson & Schlegl 2004; Wong & Webb, 2011)
and university retention (Haddow, 2013; Mezick, 2007, 2015; Soria, Fransen &
Nackerud, 2013, 2014). In other words, when students are more engaged with academic
resources they are also more likely to achieve academic success and graduate (Haddow,
2

2013; Mezick, 2015). The concept of student engagement has largely emerged from
models of student persistence frameworks such as those proposed by Tinto (1975; 1987)
and Bean (1980) which posit that students’ engagement in their universities plays a
critical role in their commitments to persist in their studies through graduation (Ryan,
2004).
Student Engagement, High Impact Practices, and Academic Libraries
Tinto’s social integration theory, which has achieved near paradigmatic status, is
one of the dominating theories used to understand and explain student retention, and
subsequently library engagement, in recent decades (Murray, 2015). In this theory, Tinto
(1975, 1987, 1993) posits that students need integration into formal (academic
performance) and informal (faculty/staff interactions) academic systems and formal
(extracurricular activities) and informal (peer-group) social systems (Rovai, 2003).
Tinto’s model holds that students’ integration into both the formal and informal academic
and social systems of the university through academic success, faculty interactions, and
social involvement helps to strengthen their academic intentions, goals, and commitment
to their institutions, making them more likely to graduate. When integration fails,
students are more likely to drop out.
Student engagement has associated high-impact practices, which many colleges
and universities have adopted not only in attempt to improve retention rates but also to
promote overall student intellectual development (Kuh, O’Donnell, & Reed, 2013). These
high impact practices, identified by the Association of American Colleges & Universities

3

(AAC&U) in their Liberal Education and America’s Promise (LEAP) report (Kuh et al.,
2013), include:


First Year Seminars and Experiences



Learning Communities and Residential Colleges



Common Intellectual Experiences



Writing Intensive Courses



Internships, Capstone Courses



Undergraduate Research



Service Learning



Collaborative Assignments, and



Diversity/Global Learning
Many academic libraries have begun to shift their focus to creating an atmosphere

conducive to both teaching and learning to provide both a formal and informal
environment that may foster engagement in these high impact practices (Kuh & Gonyea,
2003, 2015). In a recent study, Murray (2015) examined the perceptions of 271 academic
library deans or directors at public comprehensive universities in the United States on the
alignment between library services and resources with high impact practices identified by
the AAC&U (Kuh et al., 2013). Findings from this study suggest that library deans or
directors tend to view library instruction as the element of the library most involved with
high impact practices, particularly in first-year seminars, learning communities, writingintensive courses, and capstone projects. Other efforts by academic libraries relating to
these high impact practices include embedding librarians into learning communities as
4

liaisons, satellite reference, co-curricular programming, providing library liaisons for
each university department or program, 24/7 online access to electronic collections of
library materials, online research and instruction support, student internships within the
library, collaboration with other student support service entities including digital media
and student affairs, and provision of space for student collaboration (Crowe et al., 2013).
Among the high impact practices relating to libraries, Sproles, Detmering, and
Johnson (2013) noted from their review of 2,052 articles published from 2001 to 2010 on
information literacy and library instruction that the prevailing thread running throughout
the decade was faculty and librarian collaboration. A second theme noted in this study
was the provision of library and information literacy instruction via technology. Other
noteworthy trends include proactively embedding librarians within courses to foster
information literacy throughout a semester in the user’s environment – connecting with
what students and researchers do daily (Rudasill, 2010). Finally, one of the most prolific
models to promote student engagement with the library is the one-shot instruction session
in which students meet with a librarian in a single 50-75 minutes session. Helping
students become informationally literate, savvy users who value the library’s resources is
in direct support of university efforts to engage, integrate, and retain students. The
alignment between current university and library efforts in support of student retention
and Tinto’s (1975) social integration theory model is illustrated in Figure 1.
Essentially, students come to their universities with unique contextual and social
cognitive factors that may influence their overall integration into a higher education
institution. Contextual factors are many and include students’ family backgrounds, their
5

academic skills and abilities, and prior schooling experiences. Students’ intentions of
what they expect to gain from their higher education experiences (e.g., social, career/job
readiness, educational excellence, and independence from parents), their academic and/or
career goals, and personal commitment to graduating from a particular institution, along
with external commitments such as family obligations or outside employment may
further impact students’ academic and social integration into a university.

Figure 1. Current Model of Library Utilization in Support of University
Retention

6

Tinto (1975) posits that once students are enrolled in a university, it is critical for
them to become both formally and informally integrated into both the academic and
social systems of the university through positive academic performance, frequent and
meaningful interactions with university staff and faculty, informal social interactions with
peers, and involvement in more formal peer interactions such as through extracurricular
activities. It is within with this realm of university integration that Tinto suggests students
decide if a university is a right fit for them, thereby influencing their decision to stay or
withdraw. As illustrated in Figure 1, universities are working to positively affect student
integration through their High Impact Practices, including the coordinating efforts on the
part of academic libraries, to engage students in support of their academic success and
retention through graduation.
Effectiveness of Library Engagement Efforts Lies in Question
Despite efforts on the part of the library to improve information literacy and
increase students’ willingness to use the library, the efficacy of this work lies in question
(Coulter, Clark, & Scamman, 2007; Detlor, Booker, Serenko, & Julien, 2012). Rempel
and Cossarini (2013) noted that many students rely on Google for finding materials to
support their research, despite the fact that these students have received library
instruction that highlighted the value of using library resources to enhance and streamline
the research process. In this same study, researchers noted “…lackluster student
engagement, difficulty in garnering faculty buy-in and collaboration, an unclear
perception of librarian roles, a lack of defined learning outcomes for information literacy,
and lack of assessment tools” (Rempel & Cossarini, 2013, p. 51). Lending support to
7

these findings, Colón-Aguirre & Fleming-May (2012), in their qualitative study with
undergraduates, noted that undergraduates do not find library instruction sessions
relevant to their practical information needs and many students do not come away from
library information sessions feeling fully prepared or willing to move beyond Google and
into the library for conducting their information searches. Postulating about reasons why
students choose not to engage with library resources, even after receiving library
instruction, Walker and Pearce (2014) suggest, “…Engagement cannot be effectively
driven by one-shot library instruction alone” (p. 287).
Recognizing that many undergraduates find library resources confusing and
difficult to use, many libraries have undertaken usability studies with students and
implemented changes to improve student access to online library resources (Denison &
Montgomery, 2012; Foster & MacDonald, 2013; Fuller et al., 2009; Wong,
Stelmaszewska, Bhimani, Barn, & Barn, 2009). Though librarians continue to work to
promote information literacy among their student populations and improve accessibility
to their online resources, many undergraduates continue to turn to other, more attractive
alternatives such as Google to meet their information needs (Connaway, Prabha, &
Dickey, 2006; De Rosa, 2005, 2006).
What may be missing from this equation is an approach that attends not only to
the contextual and social cognitive factors that influence students’ information seeking
behavior, but also the motivational variables that affect students’ willingness to engage
with academic library resources. In the present study, Taylor’s (1991) information use
environments framework is used to better understand the context of undergraduate
8

students by looking at the set of people, settings, social networks, problems that prompt
action, and barriers. Social cognitive career theory, proposed by Lent, Brown, and
Hackett (1994, 2000), is used to examine the social cognitive career and academic factors
that influence students’ behavior and information needs. Students’ underutilization of
library resources and factors that may motivate students to engage with these resources is
explored using the expectancy-value theory of motivation proposed by Eccles et al.
(1983). Motivation is defined as the “process whereby goal-directed activity is instigated
and sustained” (Schunk, Pintrich, & Meece, 2008, p. 4).
While library and information professionals can work to create useful and easyto-use library systems and teach students how to access these resources, if undergraduates
are not motivated to use these systems, then efforts to change will be for naught. To
better meet the needs of information seekers and influence their motivation to engage
with the library, the information seeker must be placed at the center of the study and
research efforts taken to understand who they are by looking at both their contexts as well
as the social cognitive factors that influence their information seeking needs and
behavior. With an understanding of undergraduate students in context, efforts can then be
taken to explore the motivational factors that drive their information seeking behavior
and consider ways by which to engage students with their academic libraries. As a
profession, we must ask ourselves why things are the way they are, why do we do things
the way we do, and challenge ourselves to more effectively meet the needs of our users.

9

Purpose Statement
The purpose of this study is two-fold: (a) to better understand the factors relating
to undergraduate student engagement/disengagement with the academic library (e.g.,
contextual and social cognitive factors, information needs, preferences, relevance, and
motivation) and (b) to explore whether university libraries should expand their role
beyond providing academic resources and services into more “real-life” areas that are
important to the daily lives of undergraduate students and in support of the university
goal of retention. To filter these complex ideas most completely and efficiently, a multiphase mixed methods approach was utilized in order to identify the reasons that may
underlie undergraduate students’ underutilization of libraries and the ability of academic
libraries to meet these needs. Better understanding of the underlying reasons for this
underutilization may bring about ways to increase utilization of academic libraries and
better connect students to the information they need in support of academic success and
university retention. Mixed research and analysis was utilized for this study as it can
allow a more complete picture of an event, process, or situation through the varied
perspectives provided by each qualitative and quantitative strand.
Research Questions
Four primary research questions are addressed in this study:


RQ1: What motivational variables best predict library utilization by
undergraduate students?



RQ2: What are the social cognitive information needs of successful students?



RQ3: How do undergraduate students prefer to meet their information needs?
10



RQ4: To what extent is addressing the everyday life information needs of students
a viable option for academic libraries?

CHAPTER II
CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK AND LITERATURE REVIEW
In order to develop a conceptual framework by which to design this research
study, to understand the current context of undergraduate student information needs and
information seeking behavior, to identify where gaps in the literature exist, and to
develop the research questions for the present study, a comprehensive review of the
extant literature related to student engagement, academic retention, information seeking,
library utilization, usability, and motivation was conducted. Based upon the findings of
this review, a conceptual framework was developed and used as a guide to frame this
study. To explore the concepts outlined in this conceptual framework and to identify the
constructs for the present study, the relevant literature was examined to explore
undergraduate students’ information needs and preferences and their acceptance of and
motivation to use library resources.
Conceptual Framework
Tinto’s social integration theory (1975) was used as the guiding theory for this
study as it relates to why and how the identification of and meeting undergraduate
students’ information needs through academic library engagement may help support
university retention goals. The viability of expanding the role of the academic library to
holistically meet the everyday life information seeking (ELIS) (Savolainen, 1995) needs
of undergraduate students in support of retention is one key component of this framework

14

that was also explored. Overall, the conceptual framework for this study begins by
placing undergraduate students in context using Taylor’s (1991) information use
environments model to understand them as a set of people, settings, social networks,
problems that give rise to action, and barriers to information. Closely related to
contextual factors, social cognitive factors relating to students’ information needs and
behaviors are examined using social cognitive career theory, which brings into
consideration students’ perceptions of academic ability, academic self-efficacy, outcome
expectations, performance goals, person aspects, and the environment (Lent et al., 1994).
With an understanding of students’ contextual, social, and cognitive factors, Wilson’s
(1997) information seeking theory can then be used to outline how a person moves from
having an information need to actively searching for information to satisfy this need
using a particular resource. Within this framework, the expectancy-value theory of
motivation developed by Eccles et al. (1983) and key principles of the technology
acceptance model (TAM, Davis, 1989) are used to examine students’ reasons for
selecting particular information resources to meet their needs and to explore ways to
instigate and sustain engagement with the library.
The conceptual framework for this study is illustrated in Figure 2 and outlined
below. This model posits that in order for academic libraries to be accepted by
undergraduates as a means by which to meet their information needs, they must be
designed around students’ contextual, social, and cognitive needs and be perceived to be
both useful and easy to use (Davis, 1989). According to the expectancy-value theory of
motivation (Eccles et al., 1983), if using the library is perceived to have high task value,
15

Figure 2. Academic Library as Center for Information, Engagement, and Social
Integration

16

then perceptions of “usefulness” of the library are expected to be high. If students have
high expectancies for success in using the library, they are more likely to accept the
library as a technology to meet their information needs and activate their information
searches using library resources. Value and relevance of library resources are further
enhanced by meeting both the academic and everyday life information seeking needs
(ELIS) (Savolainen, 1995) of students in support of retention. By holistically meeting the
needs of students, they are more likely to become engaged in both the academic and
social formal and informal systems of the university in support of integration and
retention (Tinto, 1975).
Tinto’s Social Integration Theory
Student integration plays an important role in the choice to persist or dropout of
an academic environment. As postulated in Tinto’s social integration theory (Tinto, 1975;
Tinto & Pusser, 2006), students need integration into both the formal and informal
academic and social systems of the university. Tinto’s model (outlined in the top portion
of Figure 1) holds that integrating students into both the formal and informal academic
and social systems of the university through academic success, faculty interactions, and
social involvement helps to strengthen their academic intentions as well as their goals and
commitment to their institutions, making them more likely to graduate. Kuh, Kinzie,
Buckley, Bridges, and Hayek (2006) further explain that academic integration represents
both satisfactory compliance with explicit norms such as earning passing grades and the
values of the institution, while social integration represents the extent to which a student
finds the institution’s social environment to be congenial with his or her preferences
17

which are shaped by a student’s background, values, and aspirations. Central to Tinto’s
model of social integration is the interaction between the student and other members of
the institution, particularly during the critical first year of college (Tinto & Pusser, 2006).
The academic library is equipped to play a critical role in engaging students in both the
formal and informal systems of the institution (Tinto, 1975) through an information
science approach, thus having the potential to positively affect student retention.
Undergraduate Students in Context
To understand undergraduate students’ information seeking needs, preferences,
and motivation to seek information, including engagement with academic libraries, these
students must first be understood in context. Both Taylor’s (1991) information use
environments framework and the social cognitive career theory (Lent et al., 1994) are
used to develop a holistic understanding of the unique information needs of
undergraduate students. These contextual and social cognitive frameworks as they relate
to Tinto’s social integration theory are outlined in Figure 3 and further discussed below.
First, Taylor’s information use environments framework, which “…looks at the
user and uses of information and the contexts within which those users make choices
about what information is useful to them at particular times” (Taylor, 1991, p. 218), is
particularly well suited for this study as it helps to establish a holistic context for
understanding undergraduate students’ information needs by looking at these students as
a set of people, their information seeking settings, social networks, problems prompting
action, barriers to information or goal attainment, and problem solutions. Use of this
framework to understand people, situations, and problems is well documented in the
18

library and information seeking literature across a variety of groups (Agada, 1999;
Hersberger, Murray, & Sokoloff, 2006; Kazmer, Glueckauf, Ma, & Burnett, 2013;
Olatokun & Ajagbe, 2010; Rosenbaum, 1996).

Figure 3. Situating Students in Context
Social cognitive career theory (SCCT), proposed by Lent et al. (1994, 2000), is
also useful for helping situate undergraduate students in context as well as understanding
their motivation to engage with their academic libraries and their likelihood of
persistence at the university. Social cognitive career theory is derived primarily from
Bandura’s (2001) social cognitive theory which posits that learning and knowledge are
19

shaped by the interaction a student has with others and the context within which the
interactions occur. Building on social cognitive theory, SCCT attempts to explain the
“central, dynamic processes and mechanisms by which (a) career and academic interests
develop, (b) career-related interests are forged and enacted, and (c) performance
outcomes are achieved” (Lent et al., 1994, p. 80). More specifically, SCCT suggests that
in addition to students’ academic abilities/past performances, persistence is influenced by
their confidence in their academic abilities (self-efficacy), anticipated consequences of
persisting and graduating (outcome expectations), and the determination to persist and
graduate (performance goals) (Kahn & Nauta, 2001). Kahn and Nauta (2001) used social
cognitive career theory as their guiding framework to determine significant predictors of
college freshman-to-sophomore persistence. Their findings lend support to a body of
previous literature that has linked academic ability indices to persistence (Bean, 1980,
1985; Cabrera, Castañeda, Nora, & Hengstler, 1992; Cabrera, Nora, & Castañeda, 1993;
Pascarella & Chapman, 1983; Tinto, 1975). Kahn and Nauta (2001) also noted that
students’ social support and barriers relative to goals related significantly to their
academic self-efficacy across a sample of undergraduate students across multiple
universities. Together, these findings suggest that both contextual and social cognitive
variables may be important factors for understanding undergraduate students’
information seeking needs, preferences, behaviors, and utilization of library resources.
Information Seeking Theory
With a holistic understanding of students in context, it is then possible to begin to
explore how students prefer to seek information. This requires an understanding of the
20

underlying theoretical bases for information seeking behavior in order to consider ways
by which to tailor information seeking/information retrieval tools to meet these needs.
Wilson’s information seeking model (1981, 1997) is useful for understanding information
seeking behavior as it applies to this research study.
Wilson’s (1981, 1997) model of information seeking behavior is drawn from a
psychological perspective in which he proposes that basic needs can be defined as
physiological, cognitive, or affective. This model presents a macro-level view of
information seeking behavior and suggests how information needs arise (stress/coping),
what intervening variables play a role in a choice to initiate behavior, and what may
prevent or facilitate information searching. The information seeker is situated at the
center of this model with the understanding that information needs are contextually
specific (Wilson, 1997). Information searching behavior is activated in response to
stress/coping in which one’s information needs are unmet. Intervening variables play a
role in activating search behavior, particularly as they relate to psychological,
demographic, role-related or interpersonal, environmental, or source related
characteristics. Risk/reward theory and social learning theory/self-efficacy help to explain
why some sources of information may be used more than others by a given individual.
(This ties in very closely with the expectancy-value theory of motivation (Eccles et. al.,
1983) in which it is posited that users are motivated to initiate and sustain an activity task
such as information seeking when they expect to succeed (related to self-efficacy) and the
value of the reward is high, while cost is low (risk/reward)). Therefore, it is a student’s
context and social cognitive variables, the stress of having an information need unmet, an
21

individual’s expectancy for success in undertaking search behavior (expectancy), and the
risk/reward (value) of these efforts to fulfill a need that activates/initiates information
seeking behavior. The initiating factors will determine the degree to which one searches
for information, ranging from passive attention (no information seeking intended, but
information acquisition occurs), passive searching (one type of search results in
acquisition of information that happens to be relevant), active searching (individual
actively seeks out information), and ongoing searching (occasional continuation of
searching to update understanding) (Choo, Detlor, & Turnbull, 2000). It is the active
searching behavior that is applied to this current research study. Based upon this theory, it
is critical to reduce the risk of failure for the user when engaging in information retrieval
systems, thus improving self-efficacy and expectancies for success, while at the same
time making the system high on reward and low on risk (i.e. low cost - useful results that
are quick, convenient, and easy to access).
Expectancy-Value Theory of Motivation
Though efforts are widespread to promote information literacy and engage
students with library resources, students’ motivation to utilize these resources may be a
critical component that has been missing from the conversation. Motivation is defined as
the “process whereby goal-directed activity is instigated and sustained” (Schunk et al.,
2008, p. 4). The expectancy-value model of achievement motivation and behavior,
developed by Eccles et al. (1983) is a useful model to explore students’ underutilization
of library resources and to consider ways to motivate students to engage with these
resources. Expectancy-value theories have been popular in the field of education and
22

learning (e.g. Hodges, 2004) and communication studies (Cooper, Burgoon, & Roter,
2001), though have been seldom used in the study of information seeking behavior
(Savolainen, 2012). However, Marchionini (1995) explains that information seeking can
be approached as a type of learning, even though the processes are not identical. Learning
demands retention while in the case of information seeking, the information may be used
for a task at hand.
According to the expectancy-value theory of motivation, “…individuals’
expectancies for success and the value they have for succeeding are important
determinants of their motivation to perform different achievement tasks and their choices
of which tasks to pursue” (Wigfield & Eccles, 2002, p. 91). In other words, while library
and information professionals can work to create useful and easy-to-use library systems
and teach students how to access these resources, if undergraduates are not motivated to
use these systems, then efforts to change will be for naught.
In a recent interview, Wigfield explained,
According to this theory, the most direct influences on performance and choices
are the beliefs individuals have about their ability in different areas and how well
they expect to do on them, and the values or incentives different activities hold for
individuals (Bembenutty, 2012, p. 2).
This theory, which grew from a social cognitive perspective based in personal, social and
developmental psychology, focuses on the role of students’ expectancies for academic
success and their perceived value for academic tasks (Schunk et al., 2008). This aligns
well with the “Evaluate Sources” component of Wilson’s information seeking theory
(1997) in which risk, reward, and self-efficacy of using an information source is
23

evaluated by an information seeker. Schunk et al. (2008) explain, “Students may be
confident that they can do well and expect to succeed, but if they do not value the task
they will be less likely to engage in it” (p. 44). Placing these expectancy-value
motivational elements in terms relating to undergraduates’ utilization of library resources,
though students may (or may not) expect to be able to effectively use academic library
resources to meet their information needs, if they perceive other, more familiar
alternatives (such as using Google) are convenient, quicker, and easier to use and that the
results they obtain when using these alternatives are “good enough,” then the library will
continue to be underutilized, even when students understand the quality of material that
can be obtained by using these library resources (Brophy & Bawden, 2005).
Expectancies.
The two key elements of this theory are expectancies and values. Expectancies
and values are largely impacted by students’ social environment, cognitive perceptions
about their abilities based on their self-schema (self-concept about oneself),
success/failure in past experiences, expectations of the difficulty of a task, affective
memories of these experiences, and short and long-term goals. Expectancies are people’s
beliefs about their ability to perform a task successfully and relate to the question, “Can I
do this?” Most individuals will not choose to engage in a task in which they expect to fail
(Schunk et al., 2008). Findings presented in the library and information studies literature
suggest undergraduate information seekers experience high failure rates in their library
information seeking (Foster & MacDonald, 2013; Fuller et al., 2009). Therefore, it seems
essential that libraries and academic faculty continue to collaborate to ensure
24

undergraduate students are informationally literate and know how to utilize library
resources in order to improve their expectancies for success. Complementary to
expectancies for success is a task’s subjective value, which refers to a student’s beliefs
about the reasons he or she might engage in a task and relates to the question, “Do I want
to do this?” (Schunk et al., 2008). In terms of library engagement, if undergraduate
students place greater value in search engines to meet their information needs, the utility
of digital library resources and students’ willingness to use these resources becomes
tenuous.
Subjective task value.
Task values are a crucial part of the model because they affect individuals’
choices (Eccles et al., 1983; Wigfield & Eccles, 1992). Eccles and Wigfield (1995)
defined four components of task value, which include attainment value, intrinsic value,
utility value, and cost belief. Schunk et al. (2008) further help to operationalize these
components:
1. Attainment value (or importance) refers to the importance of doing well on a
task.
2. Intrinsic interest or intrinsic value refers to enjoyment people experience when
doing a task, or their subjective interest in the content of a task.
3. Utility value refers to the usefulness of the task for individuals in terms of their
future goals, including career goals.

25

4. Cost belief refers to the perceived negative aspects of engaging in the task,
including the amount of effort required for the task and the anticipated emotional
state.
Because each student comes to the university with a unique set of beliefs based
upon his or her social world, cultural milieu, past experiences, self-schema, and differing
long-term and short-term goals, it is difficult to suggest what one student may value
compared to another. For example, one student may be intrinsically motivated to use
library resources for research because it is enjoyable (intrinsic value), while another may
feel that doing so will take too much time away from other activities (cost belief) such as
working on other assignments, socializing with friends, or working at one’s place of
employment. At the same time, a student may use library resources because doing so is
required by the professor in order to obtain a good grade (attainment value) and getting
good grades is critical for gaining acceptance into a particular undergraduate degree
program (e.g., pre-service teacher education), graduate school, or getting a desired job
(utility value).
Technology Acceptance Model
Aligning closely with the expectancy-value theory of motivation, the Technology
Acceptance Model (TAM) (Davis, 1989) is a useful model by which to explore factors
relating to acceptance of academic library resources by undergraduates as a relevant
resource for them to meet their academic and everyday life needs. The TAM is a wellaccepted model of user acceptance of new information technologies. According to the
TAM, perceived usefulness and ease of use are the overall determinants of acceptance
26

and usage of a new technology. Perceived usefulness is the extent to which a user
believes that a particular technology will enhance job performance. Perceived ease of use
is the degree to which a user believes use of the technology will be free from effort. Ease
of use of digital library systems is explored in this study through the principles of
usability, particularly as they relate to efficiency, effectiveness, and satisfaction.
Perceived usefulness in the present study is examined through the lens of motivation.
For websites and online tools, usability is critical. If a site is found to be difficult
to use, does not easily convey its purpose to convey value, if navigation is confusing, or
if it doesn’t meet a site visitor’s needs, they will leave and pursue other, more convenient
methods by which to meet their information needs. Usability, according to the
International Organization for Standardization – standard 9241 is, “The extent to which a
product can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness,
efficiency, and satisfaction in a specified context of use" (Usability.Net, 2006). In
laymen’s terms, Nielsen (2012) defines usability as “a quality attribute that assesses how
easy user interfaces are to use.” Key components of usability (Nielsen, 2012) include:
1. Learnability (How easy is it to accomplish tasks on the first visit?)
2. Efficiency (How quickly can users perform tasks?)
3. Memorability (How easily can users reestablish proficiency when returning to a
site after a period of not using it?)
4. Errors (How many errors do users make, how severe are the errors, and how
easily can they recover from the errors?)
5. Satisfaction (How pleasant is it to use?)
27

Findings in the literature suggest many undergraduate students find their library
websites to have poor usability (Denison & Montgomery, 2012; Foster & MacDonald,
2013; Fuller et al., 2009; Wong et al., 2009). Usability must be a developmental keystone
of a successful library experience, for if users cannot access information easily, there is
little point in expending the time, effort, and expense it takes to provide digital services
(Dee & Allen, 2006). Chow (2012) explains that taking a human centered design
approach that emphasizes pervasive usability with representative users will help ensure
the digital environment is high on utility and ease of use. Analyses of the usability of
digital library services must reach beyond the actual interface design of the tools and
consider what factors make websites effective, efficient, and satisfying for users. Chow
(2012) further explains that designers frequently develop digital information spaces using
their own paradigms, thereby creating a gap between the designer and the user.
To properly serve the diverse information needs of the undergraduate student
population, it is important to gain an understanding of the unique characteristics and
needs of students by taking a user-centered design approach. User-centered design is the
process of designing a tool from the perspective of how it will be understood and used by
the user (Nielsen & Loranger, 2006; Usability First, n.d.). Taylor (1991), in his
discussion of a model of information use environments, explains that information choices
are impacted by who are the users, their settings, social networks, problems that lead to
their information needs, and barriers (including situational, institutional, dispositional,
and academic skills). Designing online library tools that address students’ academic and
everyday life needs increases the likelihood that they will be perceived to be useful,
28

efficient, satisfying, and user friendly for the user/learner, thus increasing expectancies
for success in using these library resources. According to the principles of the
expectancy-value theory of motivation (Eccles et al., 1983), this will help to build value
for users as they find that it efficiently and effectively meets their information needs at a
low cost.
Everyday Life Information Seeking
The everyday life information seeking needs of undergraduate students are
included as part of this conceptual framework in order to explore whether academic
libraries should extend their efforts beyond the academic and shift towards holistically
meeting the information needs of undergraduate students in support of student retention.
Savolainen (1995) first defined the research field of everyday life information seeking
(ELIS) research. Applying Bourdieu’s (1984) concept of habitus as a way to
conceptualize information seeking as a natural component of everyday practices,
Savolainen (1995) developed the ELIS framework for understanding information seeking
behavior in work and at home. Savolainen (1995) broadly defined the concept of ELIS as
that which, “…refers to the acquisition of various informational (both cognitive and
expressive) elements which people employ to orient themselves in daily life or to solve
problems not directly connected with the performance of occupational tasks” (pp. 266267). These everyday life information needs are those that are not necessarily associated
with daily work or activities occurring in the work or school environment. In this model,
Savolainen (1995) posited that work-related (e.g., academic) and everyday life
information needs should be treated as overlapping and complementary rather than being
29

treated as dichotomous. Returning to Tinto’s (1975) social integration theory, academic
libraries have the opportunity to play an important role in retaining students by providing
bringing together both academic and everyday life information resources that can serve to
engage students into both the formal and informal academic and social systems of the
university.
Summary: Conceptual Framework
The theories and concepts presented above relating to the information use
environments (Taylor, 1991), social cognitive career theory factors (Lent et al., 1994),
information seeking theory (Wilson, 1997), expectancy-value theory of motivation
(Eccles & Wigfield, 2002), the technology acceptance model (Davis, 1989), and
principles of user-centered design and usability all interplay to help the researcher
understand user behavior and explore ways by which to instigate and sustain library
engagement. Relating these concepts to information seeking, when a user experiences
stress or a need to cope, a mechanism is activated by which they recognize they have an
information need. The willingness of a person to address this need is influenced by his or
her background and social cognitive factors. The decision to actively engage in
information seeking is further influenced by the perceived risk and reward of doing so.
When the risk/reward ratio is acceptable to an information seeker, search behavior will be
activated. An information seeker may be motivated to use a particular technology or
online resource (e.g. website, library, etc.) when it is perceived to be both useful (high
task value) and easy to use (low cost), thus building an expectancy for success.
Information seekers will be motivated to sustain their activity on a site when they feel the
30

“information scent” is strong enough that they are confident they will find what they need
(Pirolli, 2007). If the costs (e.g. takes too much time or effort, is frustrating) of using a
site outweigh the benefits, they will leave the site. Thus, while perceptions of ease of use
and utility will influence a person’s choice to adopt a technology according to the TAM,
their willingness to sustain their behavior (use of a site or tool) is dependent upon actual
experiences as they relate to their expectancies for success and subjective task value.
According the conceptual framework outlined in Figure 2, when students are able
to easily access information available online via their academic libraries that is both
valued and relevant for meeting both their scholarly and everyday life information needs,
there is a greater likelihood that these individuals will be motivated to engage with these
resources. Returning to Tinto’s (1975) social integration theory, academic libraries have
the opportunity to play a key role in retaining students by bringing together information
and resources that can serve to engage students in both the formal and informal academic
and social systems of the university in support of university retention.
Literature Review
A comprehensive review of the literature was conducted to further explore the
concepts outlined in the conceptual framework and to develop a deeper understanding of
the factors relating to undergraduate student engagement/disengagement with the
academic library and to explore whether university libraries should expand their role
beyond providing academic resources and services into more “real-life” areas that are
important to the daily lives of undergraduate students and in support of the university
goal of retention. This review further allowed the researcher to identify gaps in the
31

literature as well as to determine the constructs and research questions for the study. To
this end, this literature review is organized into four overarching categories: (1)
Information Needs of Undergraduates, (2) Information Seeking Preferences of
Undergraduates, (3) Undergraduates’ Information Needs, Preferences, and the
Technology Acceptance Model, and (4) Gaps in the Literature.
Information Needs of Undergraduate Students
The information needs of undergraduates are defined by both the university and
the students themselves. Often information needs of undergraduate students are defined
by their professors who require them to use scholarly resources available through their
academic libraries to meet assignment requirements and receive favorable grades. At the
same time, students’ academic and everyday life information needs are many and are
often met via sources that do not include the library.
Formal information needs.
Numerous studies have shown that academic success is positively correlated with
library usage (Goodall & Pattern, 2011; Hiscock, 1986; Soria et al., 2013, 2014; Wong &
Webb, 2011). In an early study looking at library usage and academic achievement,
Hiscock (1986) examined students’ use of the academic library catalog and reference
materials and found that catalog usage was positively correlated with students’ academic
performance. More recently, in an analysis of library usage patterns and achievement of
students enrolled in approximately 200 courses at a single university, Goodall and Pattern
(2011) noted that library usage varied between academic schools and there were often
pedagogic reasons for low usage (defined by the researchers as less than five visits to the
32

library or borrowing books less than five books, or logging into university’s electronic
resource collection less than five times). The researchers did note that in some subjects,
students who “read” more, measured in terms of borrowing books and accessing
electronic resources, achieved better grades (Goodall & Pattern, 2011).
Similarly, Wong and Webb (2011), in a study of 8,701 library records and GPAs
of individuals who recently (2007 to 2009) completed their degrees, noted that 31 of the
48 total sample groups (65%) had statistically significant, positive correlations between
GPA and check-outs of library materials. Finally, Soria et al. (2013, 2014) examined the
relationship between student academic achievement (GPA) and library usage among firstyear non-transfer students (N=5,162) at a public, research intensive university in the
United States as documented through 10 collection points (e.g., online databases,
electronic books, electronic journal logins, library website logins, loans, interlibrary
loans, library workstation logins, usage, and engagement with library staff through
instruction sessions or reference interactions). Among the first year class, 71.3%
(n=3,818) had used at least one library service, while 28.7% did not use any library
services. The findings of this study suggest statistically significant differences exist
between the cumulative GPAs of first year students who used at least one library service
(mean GPA=3.18) compared with the average GPA of students who did not use the
library (mean GPA=2.98), holding constant the other predictor variables in the model. In
this same study, ordinary least squares regression analyses were conducted to predict
students’ GPA by the total frequency of their use of the 10 different types of library
services and was found to be statistically significant. The results of this study suggest
33

four types of library services were positively and significantly associated with students’
cumulative GPA: database logins, book loans/renewals, electronic journal logins, and use
of library workstations (Soria et al., 2013, 2014).
Though research data suggest that student achievement is positively correlated
with usage of academic libraries (Goodall & Pattern, 2011; Hiscock, 1986; Soria et al.,
2013, 2014; Wong & Webb, 2011), findings from other studies suggest students are
largely extrinsically motivated and turn to their academic libraries only when required to
do so by their professors to earn a passing grade (Colón-Aguirre & Fleming-May, 2012;
Davis & Cohen, 2001; Robinson & Schlegl, 2004). In a qualitative study in which 21
undergraduates were interviewed about their information seeking for course-related
research, Colón-Aguirre and Fleming-May (2012) noted that the majority of respondents
reported their main reason for using library resources was that the course instructor either
requested that they do so or required that students include a list of references as proof of
having used library resources. In this same study, when there was no instructor imposed
restriction on the type of information required, most students said they browsed for
information using an online search engine.
Likewise, in a review of the bibliographies of 67 term papers prepared by Cornell
University undergraduates, Davis and Cohen (2001) noted a tendency for undergraduates
to use non-scholarly online resources unless provided with “clear and enforceable
guidelines” by a professor or instructor. Taking this line of research further, Robinson and
Schlegl (2004) conducted a comparison study of the quality of resources selected by
undergraduates for research papers between a control group, a class that received library
34

instruction and encouragement to use scholarly resources, and a class that received
library instruction and enforceable guidelines for using scholarly resources. Study
findings suggest that instruction and encouragement had very little effect on the quality
of student research, but instruction-and-penalty had a statistically significant, positive
effect on the number of scholarly sources cited (Robinson & Schlegl, 2004).
Taken together, findings from these studies suggest that while academic success
has been found to be positively correlated with library usage (Goodall & Pattern, 2011;
Hiscock, 1986; Soria et al., 2013, 2014; Wong & Webb, 2011), the driving force for
undergraduate library usage largely stems from students’ extrinsic motivation to achieve
favorable grades on course assignments due to instructor imposed guidelines (ColónAguirre & Fleming-May, 2012; Davis & Cohen, 2001; Robinson & Schlegl, 2004). In
other words, while academic library resources are available to meet the formal
information needs of undergraduates, students largely utilize these resources only when
extrinsically motivated and “feel they must.”
Informal information needs.
Findings from recent studies suggest lack of preparation for higher education
study, academic issues, feelings of isolation and /or not fitting in, and concerns about
future aspirations are the primary reasons students report for dropping out of higher
education study (Murtaugh, 2012; Stoessel, Ihme, Barbarino, Fisseler, & Stürtmer, 2015;
Thomas, 2012). Closely related to the above noted factors, findings from numerous
studies suggest that even persons with well-developed career paths will be unlikely to
pursue that path if they perceive substantial barriers to achieving their goals (Brown &
35

Lent, 1996; Luzzo & McWhirter, 2001; Raque-Bodgan, Klingaman, Martin, & Lucas,
2013) including, but not limited to parental support, financial worries, others’ perceptions
related to gender and ethnicity, academic readiness and study skills, social “fitting in,”
and outside concerns such as employment and childcare. It is worthwhile to explore
whether educational barriers and reasons cited for dropping out of university study have
associated information needs that may be addressed via the academic library. There is no
such study noted by this researcher in either the library and information studies or
academic retention literature that has specifically addressed this intersection between
academic barriers, information needs, and university retention from an information
science perspective.
The common reasons cited for dropping out of higher education study closely
align with Savolainen’s (1995) everyday life information seeking (ELIS) model in which
he suggests that everyday life and work-related (e.g., academic) information needs are
overlapping and complementary. The informal, everyday life, information needs of
undergraduate students have been scarcely addressed in the LIS scholarly literature
regarding academic libraries. Among the few studies available, research findings by
Croxton (2015), Head and Eisenberg (2011), and Given (2002) lend support to
Savolainen’s (1995) ELIS model, noting that students’ reported academic/course related
assignments, health and wellness, purchasing a product or service, work/career
information, and news/current events are the most commonly cited information needs
among undergraduate students.

36

Affirming this concept of interconnectivity between everyday life and workrelated information needs, Given (2002), in a qualitative interview study involving 25
mature undergraduates (age 25 and above), noted that once enrolled in college, the
interviewee’s needs, though primarily focused on academic work (e.g., locating course
readings), also sought information for everyday concerns that arose out of their
engagement with the university. Given (2002) further explains,
The intellectual work involved in university study seeps into all students’
everyday lives; the time-budgeting required to meet deadlines demand evening
and weekend hours, and students must work everyday and academic information–
seeking into these tight schedules (p. 28).
More recently, Head and Eisenberg (2011) conducted a study of both course
related and everyday life information seeking behavior of college students on 25 U.S.
campuses (2008 through 2010) as part of Project Information Literacy, a large-scale
study of college students and their research habits. Data collection included a survey of
8,353 college students, focus groups conducted on 11 campuses with 86 participants, and
follow-up interviews with 25 students. Overall, the results suggest that participants were
“more caught up” and “more engaged” in everyday life research than with course related
research (Head & Eisenberg, 2011). A large majority of the sample (79%) reported
looking for news, information about a product or service (74%), and/or health and
wellness topics (74%). Other everyday life information needs reported from the survey
included searching for information about work/career (67%), travel (61%), social
contacts (51%), domestic life (e.g., housing) (45%), work questions (36%), advocacy

37

(32%), spiritual (24%), and search for experts (e.g., medical doctor) (20%). Student
participants reported using a variety of sources to satisfy their everyday life information
needs, including search engines (95%), friends/family (87%), Wikipedia (84%),
classmates (81%), personal collection (75%), social networks (70%), government sites
(63%), instructors (53%), research databases (40%), blogs (37%), encyclopedias (37%)
library shelves (28%), and librarians (14%). Finally, results from the survey component
of this study suggest participants struggled most with sorting through all they had found;
filtering relevant from non-relevant results (41%) was more difficult than anything else.
Taken together, the results from this study suggest that academic libraries, while they do
not typically play a major role in undergraduates’ everyday life information seeking at
this time, hold great potential in holistically meeting the needs of undergraduates by
serving as a vetted source for information.
In a qualitative study about the information seeking needs of urban teens (age 1417), Agosto and Hughes-Hassell (2005, 2006a, 2006b) noted that participants rarely
thought of libraries as places where their everyday life information needs can be met.
While the teenagers in this study identified schoolwork as their primary everyday life
information need, they reported that they do not use libraries or books (Agosto &
Hughes-Hassell, 2005). What is of particular interest as it relates to the information needs
of undergraduates is the empirical model that Agosto and Hughes-Hassell (2005, 2006b)
developed from their analysis of their data. Building off the 11 developmental tasks of
adolescent development originally identified by Havighurst (1972), the researchers added
12 additional tasks to the model. The 23 developmental tasks were then collapsed into
38

seven variables that ELIS behaviors serve to support, including: (1) social self
(friends/peer/romantic relationships, social activities, popular culture, fashion,
social/legal norms), (2) emotional self (family, emotional safety, religion), (3) reflective
self (self-image, philosophical concerns, heritage/cultural identity, civic duty, college,
career, self-actualization), (4) physical self (daily life routine, physical safety, goods and
services, health, job responsibilities), (5) creative self (creative performance, creative
consumption), (6) cognitive self (academics, school culture, current events), and (7)
sexual self (sexual safety, sexual identity) (Agosto & Hughes-Hassell, 2006b). Further,
findings from this study suggest participants largely rely upon easily accessible, familiar
sources and channels to meet their information needs (Agosto & Hughes-Hassell, 2005).
As academic libraries consider ways by which to become more relevant (perceived
usefulness per the TAM model, Davis, 1989) to their undergraduate student population
and help to engage students into both the formal and informal academic and social
systems of their academic institutions, they may consider holistically addressing the
information needs of their students including, but not limited to, their scholarly needs.
In addition to the ELIS needs outlined by Given (2002), Agosto and HughesHassell (2005, 2006a, 2006b), and Head and Eisenberg (2011), numerous other studies
have identified everyday life information needs of subsets of undergraduate populations
that may be met through service entities on campus beyond the library, but are largely
untapped (Kitzrow, 2003; Mupinga, Nora, & Yaw, 2006; Schaller, 2011; Sin & Kim,
2013). In a comprehensive literature review of the mental health needs of today’s college
students, Kitzrow (2003) noted that while the literature suggested students are more
39

likely to stay in school when their mental health related information needs are met,
students themselves are often not aware of the mental health resources available on
campus or may be reluctant to use them.
Similarly, online students are a vulnerable population with regard to student
retention, with rates of online course dropout ranging from as low as 10% to as high as 50
to 75% (Carr, 2000; Jun, 2005; Rochester & Pradel, 2008). In a study conducted to
examine the learning styles, expectations, and needs of undergraduate online students,
Mupinga et al. (2006) noted that the top four needs of online students were technical
help, flexible and understanding course instructors, advanced course information, and
sample assignments. In particular, 93% (n=131) expressed a real need for technical help
with computers, logging onto the university network, and navigating through the course
management platform (Mupinga et al., 2006). Similarly, Chow and Croxton (2013)
conducted a survey study of online graduate students (N=50) with respect to their needs
as online learners. On a 7 point Likert-type scale, participants valued a technology help
desk (M=5.7), followed closely by a high level of student support services (M=5.5) (e.g.
academic advisor, real-time chat, etc.) and faculty virtual office hours (M=5.4).
In an in-depth focus group and survey study (N=8) of the information needs of
lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) college students, Schaller (2011)
noted that this subset of undergraduates has unique information needs relating to their
sexuality. The information needs identified by study participants included material
relating to social, political, and legal marginalization, matters relating to LGBTQ and
religion, coming out to family and friends, coping with LGBTQ-based discrimination,
40

dating, activism, and social gatherings. While the university site in Schaller’s (2011)
study has a Safe Zone campus group and corresponding website to support gay, lesbian,
bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning, intersex, and asexual individuals, none of the
participants had ever seen the resources and links hosted on Safe Zone website. Further,
based on analysis of the study data, Schaller (2011) noted that the anxiety of possible
disclosure in addition to general library anxiety can turn into barriers for LGBTQ
individuals. These findings suggest the academic library website may prove to be a useful
resource by which to provide carefully vetted information to LGBTQ students in a safe
and anonymous platform.
Finally, Sin and Kim (2013) explored international students’ everyday life
information seeking and the informational value of social networking sites (SNS) by
conducting a survey study of 180 international graduate (68%) and undergraduate (32%)
students at a large American university. In rank order of importance, the top five
everyday life information needs noted by participants included finance, health, news of
one’s home country, housing, and entertainment. It is interesting to note that 97% of the
participants used social networking sites to meet their ELIS needs (apart from social
networking as a way of connecting with others). With a maximum score of 5 (used very
frequently), the mean use of SNS to satisfy ELIS needs was 3.93 (SD=1.13). In this same
study, the mean for using web search engines for ELIS was 4.57 (SD=0.74). Like the
student subgroups noted in the studies discussed above, international students have many
unique information needs that extend beyond their academic, course-related needs. While
Sin and Kim (2013) did not suggest that these needs go largely unmet, academic libraries
41

can serve as an information resource for this student population that brings together
credible information that has been vetted by librarians and information about campus
services that may be particularly useful to international students, but often go largely
unused.
The research studies noted above suggest that both the formal (academic, courserelated) and the informal, “everyday life information seeking” needs of students are
essential for the overall well-being and success of undergraduate students. While
academic libraries have historically focused upon providing access to highly credible
resources to meet students’ academic/scholarly information needs, there remains a largely
untapped realm of possibilities for academic libraries to also serve as information and
engagement centers that can provide access to resources and services beyond scholarly
resources, thereby holistically serving to meet the needs of the whole individual.
Returning to Tinto’s (1975) social integration theory, academic libraries have the
opportunity to play a significant role in retaining students by bringing together
information and resources that will help engage students into both the formal and
informal academic and social systems of the university.
Information Seeking Preferences of Undergraduate Students
Historically, because scholarly information resources were scarce, students and
academic scholars focused largely upon accessing resources needed to produce scholarly
work through their academic libraries (Connaway, Radford, Dickey, De Angelis
Williams, & Confer, 2008). However, with the ubiquity of information available on the
Internet, academic information seekers’, particularly undergraduates’, attention to library
42

resources is becoming scare (Connaway et al., 2006; Connaway et al., 2008; De Rosa,
2006; Prabha, Connaway, & Dickey, 2006). Today’s undergraduates, largely between the
ages of 18-24 (NCES, 2014), have been found to largely satisfy their research and
information needs via Google with resources that are often considered less credible and
reliable than may be available through the academic libraries (De Rosa, 2006; Prabha et
al., 2006; Wong et al., 2009). Additionally, findings from numerous studies suggest
undergraduates value speed, convenience, and ease of use (Connaway et al., 2006; CURL
& Research Information Network, 2007; De Rosa, 2006) of information systems, with
“convenience” as the most important factor in choosing among information sources
(Radford & Connaway, 2008).
Convenience is a priority for undergraduates.
Today’s information seekers are largely turning to the web and using search
engines that are freely available (e.g., Google) to satisfy their information needs. De Rosa
(2005), in a survey study of 3,348 “information consumers” which included both
academic and general public information seekers, found search engines to be the primary
source to begin an information search. In this study, De Rosa (2005) found that 84% of
all users indicated that they began an information search with a search engine, while only
1% indicated they began their search on a library website. De Rosa (2005) further
reported that 90% of the respondents were “very satisfied” or “satisfied” with their most
recent searches for information using a search engine and respondents overall tended to
trust the results from a search engine “about the same” as results from libraries. In this
study, search engines were rated higher than libraries by respondents on five performance
43

attributes: reliability, cost effectiveness, ease of use, convenience and speed. More
specifically, 85% of respondents indicated search engines are best described by the
attribute ease of use, 89% indicated search engines are best described by the attribute
convenient, and 92% indicated search engines are best described by the attribute fast (De
Rosa, 2006).
Using a subset of the data set discussed above, De Rosa (2006) highlighted and
contrasted the views of 396 college students (from the U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia,
Singapore, and India) and 691 U.S. 14-17 year olds, all of whom responded to the
original survey. Similar to the findings from the larger 2005 study, De Rosa (2006) noted
that 89% of all college student respondents reported that using search engines for an
information search is their first choice, compared to 2% who said they begin an
information search with a library website. Overall, 93% of student respondents stated that
they were “very satisfied” or “satisfied” with their most recent search for information
using a search engine, while 84% said they were satisfied with their most recent
interaction with a librarian for an information search. Findings from De Rosa’s two
studies (2005, 2006) suggest information seekers may not be particularly motivated to
access digital library resources, as the results they obtain from using search engines are
perceived to be “just as good” as what could be obtained via the library, thereby
satisficing their information needs. Considering that participants perceived search engines
to be easier, more convenient, and quicker than using library resources, the return on
investment of time and energy by using search engines may be higher than when using
library resources.
44

Similar findings were noted in a four-phase study in which researchers explored
how undergraduate and graduate students and faculty get their information for personal
and academic or professional purposes. In this large-scale study, researchers conducted
online surveys and telephone interviews (n=307), focus group interviews (n=78), and
semi-structured interviews (n=15) (Connaway et al., 2006; Dervin, Reinhard, Kerr, Song,
& Shen, 2006; Prabha et al., 2006). Key findings from this study suggest participants
made rational decisions, which are contextually based, as they carried out their
information searches, choosing a strategy and level of effort based on situational needs
and differentiating between quick and thorough searches (Connaway et al., 2006; Prabha
et al., 2006). While participants acknowledged the value of library databases and other
online sources, some users did not understand what resources were actually available in
libraries nor could they distinguish between databases held by a library and sources
merely available online (Connaway et al., 2006). All types of participants in this study
noted that library online catalogs are difficult to use (Connaway et al., 2006). Overall,
study findings suggest information seekers value familiarity, convenience, currency, and
authority in their information searches and, regardless of academic demographics,
demonstrate a “heavy reliance on Google and other web information sources” (Connaway
et al., 2006, pp. 10-11). One element that sets the findings from this study apart from the
De Rosa (2006) study is the contextuality of information search strategies and confusion
about and difficulties using library resources. While information seekers may heavily rely
upon Google to meet their needs, their level of effort and search strategies may be

45

dependent upon the situation (Connaway et al., 2006; He, Wu, Yue, Fu, & Vo, 2012;
Prabha et al., 2006).
Like Connaway et al. (2006), Dervin et al. (2006), and Prabha et al. (2006), Wong
et al. (2009), noted that situational contextuality influenced information seeking
behaviors of undergraduates, postgraduates, and expert researchers. In a two-stage study
exploring user behavior in resource discovery, Wong et al. (2009) conducted focus group
interviews (n=9) and user observations (n=34) . The researchers observed that search
strategies changed by context during the course of the research process. They noted,
When using freely available Internet resources, Google is top of the list, followed
by Google Scholar, Wikipedia, and YouTube. Participants’ decisions about which
resources to use were based on their prior knowledge and experience with a
resource and a belief that resources provided by Google and Google Scholar are
reliable and relevant most of all always return a list of results. On the other hand,
library resources were perceived as credible, providing quality material from a
broad subject coverage (Wong et al., 2009, p. 7).
In this same study, Wong et al. (2009) identified several difficulties users encountered
when using library resources, including confusion and frustration with navigating library
database interfaces, finding full text items from library databases, and finding appropriate
resources via the library website to fulfill their information needs. Altogether, the
findings of this study suggest that while academic information seekers change their
search strategies according to the needs of the situation, preference lies with information
that is largely available through Google searches, particularly when digital library
resources are perceived as difficult to use.

46

Bringing together findings from the four-phase study noted above (Connaway et
al., 2006; Dervin et al., 2006; Prabha et al., 2006) and results from a study about the
needs, behaviors, and preferences of users, non-users, and librarians regarding virtual
reference services (Radford & Connaway, 2008), Connaway, Dickey, and Radford (2011)
conducted a more focused evaluation of the two data sets for evidence of convenience
related findings. Findings from this study of combined datasets identified “convenience”
as central to information seeking behaviors. The centrality of convenience is especially
prevalent among the millennial subjects [born between 1982 and early 2000s) (Howe &
Strauss, 2000)] in both studies, but is true across all demographic categories—age,
gender, academic role, and user or non-user of VRS [virtual reference services]”
(Connaway et al., 2011, p. 186).
Lending further support to these findings, Connaway and Dickey (2010), in a
review of 12 large-scale user behavior studies in the United States and United Kingdom,
noted that convenience permeated as a significant factor that influenced information
seeking behavior. In this study, convenience included choice of source, ease of access
and use, and time. Offering further credence to these findings, Brophy and Bawden
(2005), in a case study in which college students were asked to retrieve documents using
the Internet or library resources that corresponded to four academic course-related
scenarios, noted that while Google was superior for coverage and accessibility, library
systems were superior for quality of results. Brophy and Bawden (2005) noted that
accessibility was found to be favored by participants over quality as a determinate of
choice by the student users. Lack of comprehensiveness in retrieval was not found to be a
47

strong motivator to use any retrieval system in addition to an Internet search engine for
study participants, nor was the prospect of undertaking extra training to make better use
of library databases (Brophy & Bawden, 2005). The findings from these studies (Brophy
& Bawden, 2005; Connaway et al., 2006; Connaway et al., 2011; Connaway & Dickey,
2010; Dervin et al., 2006; Prabha et al., 2006) suggest that, when given a choice,
undergraduate information seekers will turn to the search options that are most
convenient, often willing to sacrifice quality of library resources in favor of the
convenience and accessibility of Google.
Undergraduates find library resources difficult to use.
Despite being born in a time in which access to computers and digital information
has been seemingly ubiquitous and information seekers are largely Internet and computer
savvy, undergraduate students classified as Millennials and of the “Google Generation”
[(born after 1993) (Rowlands et al., 2008)] often experience frustration with the
information search process (Denison & Montgomery, 2012) and find library information
technologies (e.g., online databases and library catalogs) difficult to use (Connaway et
al., 2006; Hampton-Reeves et al., 2009; Large, 2006; Williams & Rowlands, 2007; Wong
et al., 2009). A frequently occurring theme noted in information seeking user behavior
studies with undergraduates is that many users easily become frustrated when searching
for information using academic library resources such as online databases, often turning
to information sources available outside the library (Denison & Montgomery, 2012;
Foster & MacDonald, 2013; Wong et al., 2009). In their study of user behavior of
undergraduate, postgraduate, and expert researchers (n=34), Wong et al. (2009) noted
48

that participants frequently had difficulty navigating the web-based library resources,
thus “distract[ing] users from focusing on the content, analysis, and evaluation that would
help them learn and make sense of what they have discovered” (p. 6). Participants in this
study became frustrated when they were unable to obtain full text documents using
library databases, prompting them to turn to external resources like Google and Google
Scholar, “where despite having no promise of the article, and where the scholarly quality
cannot be assured, one still has a much higher chance of finding the article to download”
(p. 8) and “always return[s] a list of results” (p. 78). Based on their findings, Wong et al.
(2009) made a number of recommendations for libraries including development of a
standardized platform for resource discovery with attributes that help users find their way
around the systems while also making it easier for users to identify appropriate resources
for their study (including free resources).
Studies conducted by Denison and Montgomery (2012) and Foster and
MacDonald (2013) yielded similar results to those obtained by the Wong et al. (2009).
Denison and Montgomery (2012) evaluated the perceptions of 20 undergraduates using a
combination of a sorting-board activity relating to a condition of library instruction and
interviews with a smaller sample from the participant pool. The dominant theme that
emerged from their study is that the participants found the process of information
searching and retrieval using library resources to be difficult and frustrating.
Consequently, many of the undergraduates compromised by choosing information
resources that were not judged as being of high academic caliber.

49

Foster and MacDonald (2013), in a usability study in which undergraduates (n=6)
were observed as they interacted with two different library discovery systems, noted that
participants were able to complete little more than 50% of the research scenarios
presented to them. Half of the participants said they would be more likely to leave any
library site and do the search in Google, particularly when they did not understand what
happened with their search using the library resources. Lending further support to the
notion that undergraduate information seekers may not perceive their academic library
systems to be usable, findings from a usability study (n=5) conducted by Fuller et al.
(2009) indicated that undergraduate participants failed to complete the given research
tasks of the study 66% of the time. Taken together, the results of the Foster and
MacDonald (2013) and Fuller et al. (2009) studies suggest that when undergraduate
information seekers find library resources frustrating to use, their motivation to use them
diminishes, thus turning to Google where their return on investment of time and energy is
more fruitful.
It appears that much of the frustration that results from interacting with web-based
library tools and resources stems, in part, from difficulties interacting with library tool
interfaces (Colón-Aguirre & Fleming-May, 2012; Connaway et al., 2006; Dermody &
Majekodunmi, 2011; Wong et al., 2009). Colón-Aguirre and Fleming-May (2012)
interviewed 21 undergraduate students (sophomore and above) about their approaches to
gathering information sources for an assignment. Overall, participants expressed some
level of frustration with the process of interacting with the online library catalog and
database search platforms. In particular, participants expressed frustration with
50

identifying appropriate electronic resources among the vast array of databases. Those
who were classified by the researchers as “library avoiders,” individuals who only use the
library if explicitly required, noted having trouble navigating the mechanics of locating
material and working with the equipment. These findings suggest that undergraduate
information seekers may benefit from more simplified interfaces that are less
overwhelming and more attuned to their needs.
Dermody and Majekodunmi (2011) conducted a usability study with university
students with print disabilities to better understand their library search experiences and
identify barriers to information. Overall, participants rated their experiences of using the
databases to retrieve and read full text articles as “difficult” to “somewhat challenging.”
Their comments further suggest that in order to find the articles they need, a simplified
search interface and clear and proper placement of full text links to articles is necessary.
One participant noted, “for every extra … button that can be clicked, the likelihood of
people becoming confused increases” (Dermody & Majekodunmi, 2011, p. 155). Two of
the participants noted that they prefer using Google Scholar because of its simple search
interface compared to the databases used in this study (Dermody & Majekodunmi, 2011).
Taken together, the results from the Colón-Aguirre and Fleming-May (2012) and
Dermody and Majekodunmi (2011) studies help to illuminate the need for library web
interfaces that are simple, easy to use, and elicit full text documents with few clicks of the
mouse.
Noting similar results to those found by Colón-Aguirre and Fleming-May (2012)
and Dermody and Majekodunmi (2011), Connaway et al. (2006), in their study of 307
51

academics noted that participants, regardless of status (faculty, graduate student, or
undergraduate), found the library online catalogs difficult to use, reverting to other online
sources to find items traditionally held by libraries. Focus group participants in this study
suggested the library “…make the library catalog more like search engines” (Connaway
et al., 2006, p. 16).
Expanding upon this desire for library digital interfaces that behave more like
search engines, several researchers (Georgas, 2015; Holman, 2011; Turner, 2011) noted
students’ preferences for using natural language that is more conducive to successful
searching using search engines than in library databases and online catalogs. For
example, in study in which 32 undergraduates were observed searching for materials via
both Google and a library search tool, Georgas (2015) noted that participants largely
performed searches using natural language syntax (in both Google and library databases).
Use of natural language syntax (e.g. “What are the effects of fracking on the economy of
Ohio?”) instead of keyword searches using Boolean operators such as and, or, and not
(e.g., fracking and economy and Ohio) is typically not conducive for yielding successful
results in library databases, while the algorithms that underlie online search engines such
as Google are designed to accommodate such language. In a separate study, Turner
(2011) conducted a comparison study in which 10 college students and 18 library staff
members were observed as they conducted prescribed search tasks using the library
website. Study findings suggest that librarians and students differ in their selection of
search tools, syntax used for searching, expectations of library search tools and their
content, and level of searching persistence (Turner, 2011). Library staff demonstrated use
52

of their prior knowledge of library systems and library holdings, while student
participants did not use the specialized syntax required for many library databases and
catalogs. Finally, in library usability studies conducted by Holman (2011) and Porter
(2011) with undergraduate students (n=21, n=24), researchers noted that natural language
searching was the most observed behavior of students performing searches, followed by
key word searching. Holman (2011) further noted that misspellings had a significant
impact on students’ success and highlighted a major distinction between search engines
and database algorithms, with search engines being more forgiving of such errors.
Because undergraduate information seekers are largely inclined to use natural language
syntax over the Boolean logic or keyword strategies typically required of library
databases, libraries must consider whether to focus their energies on teaching students
more effective syntax or redesigning the library information interfaces to behave “more
like Google.”
Technology preferences for information seeking.
While understanding undergraduate students’ preferences for particular types of
information resources is critical in meeting their needs, it is also important to consider the
types of technology devices students prefer to use when seeking information digitally. In
a recent survey study of 50,274 undergraduate students, Educause researchers noted that
smartphone ownership among this population was at 92%, exceeding laptop ownership
(91%) for the first time in the 11 years of tracking this data (Dahlstrom, Brooks, Grajek,
& Reeves, 2015). Tablet ownership among this population was reported to be at 54%,
while desktop ownership among undergraduate students hovered near 40%. Findings
53

from this study also revealed that nearly all of the respondents (92%) had at least two
internet capable devices, with 64% having three such devices (Dahlstrom et al., 2015).
With nearly ubiquitous prevalence of smartphones among college students, mobile
website optimization, including academic library websites, has become increasingly
important. Current research regarding mobile academic library websites has found that
many students desire simple, streamlined navigation in mobile library sites that focuses
upon only the most relevant services and information (Pendell & Bowman, 2012). Of
particular relevance to academic libraries, findings from two recent studies suggest
information seekers are interested in searching library databases through mobile sites,
despite the fact that some databases are not optimized for mobile access and may be
difficult to access from a phone (Pendell & Bowman, 2012; Seeholzer & Salem, 2011).
Undergraduate Students’ Information Needs, Preferences, and the TAM
Usefulness of the digital library resources.
Returning to the TAM, a technology (e.g., library website) must be perceived to
be both useful and easy to use for users to accept it. Numerous quantitative studies have
identified the “usefulness” (i.e., value) of libraries such that library usage has been found
to be positively correlated with graduation rates (Haddow, 2013; Mezick, 2007, 2015;
Soria et al., 2013, 2014) and student academic achievement (e.g., GPA) (Goodall &
Pattern, 2011; Hiscock, 1986; Soria et al., 2013, 2014; Wong & Webb, 2011). Further,
students recognize the utility of the library for completing assignments in which course
instructors require use of library resources (Colón-Aguirre & Fleming-May, 2012; Davis
& Cohen, 2001; Robinson & Schlegl, 2004).
54

While undergraduate students may recognize the utility of the library such that
they are extrinsically motivated to use library resources when required by their instructors
in order to receive favorable grades, their intrinsic motivation to use these resources lies
in question. Findings from numerous studies suggest that, regardless of context
(academic or everyday needs), undergraduates are not intrinsically motivated to use the
library and are inclined to turn to online search engines such as Google to fulfill their
information needs for reasons of convenience, speed, and ease of use (Connaway et al.,
2006; De Rosa, 2005, 2006; Dervin et al., 2006; Prabha et al., 2006; Wong et al., 2009).
Further studies suggest undergraduates are largely satisfied with the results obtained
through Google searching to meet their academic needs (De Rosa, 2005, 2006) and are
willing to sacrifice quality of materials that could be obtained by using the library over
the convenience and accessibility of Google (Brophy & Bawden, 2005). Through the lens
of the expectancy-value theory of motivation, undergraduates’ expectations of quick,
convenient, easy, and satisfying information seeking experiences when using a search
engine such as Google outweigh the value of resources that could be obtained by using
online library resources. As undergraduates place greater value in search engines to meet
their information needs, the utility of digital library resources for these users becomes
tenuous.
Ease of use of digital library resources.
Overall, findings in the literature suggest undergraduate information seekers
experience high failure rates in their academic library information seeking (Foster &
MacDonald, 2013; Fuller et al., 2009), become easily frustrated using library resources
55

(Denison & Montgomery, 2012; Foster & MacDonald, 2013; Wong et al., 2009), and
often turn to search engines such as Google for reasons relating to speed, convenience,
and ease of use. (Connaway et al., 2006; De Rosa, 2005, 2006; Dervin et al., 2006;
Prabha et al., 2006). According to the TAM, when digital interfaces such as online
academic library resources have low usability with respect to parameters of efficiency,
effectiveness, and satisfaction, user motivation to adopt these technologies is weakened
as information seekers find other, more usable means (such as Google) to satisfy their
needs.
When undergraduate information seekers encounter frustration and/or failure in
their use of academic library interfaces, their self-efficacy comes into question, as
“Individuals tend to select tasks and activities in which they feel competent and confident
and avoid those in which they do not” (Schunk & Pajares, 2009, p. 37). Further, because
many undergraduate information seekers find online library resources difficult to use,
expectancy of success may not match the value they place in using these resources,
making online search engines such as Google the more attractive alternative (Connaway
et al., 2006; De Rosa, 2005, 2006). Consequently, as undergraduate information seekers
find using the online academic library resources to be difficult and find greater utility
(efficiency, effectiveness, and satisfaction) in using online resources outside of the
library, their motivation to use library resources is low.

56

Gaps in the Literature
Motivation in library and information seeking research.
Factors relating to undergraduate students’ motivation to engage with library
services have been scarcely addressed in the library and information seeking body of
literature. Of the studies analyzed for this literature review, only a small selection
included terminology relating to motivation (Colón-Aguirre & Fleming-May, 2012;
Denison & Montgomery, 2012; Dermody & Majekodunmi, 2011; Haigh, 2013) and none
of these studies used a motivational framework to guide their studies. Rather, researchers
in three of the studies reviewed (Colón-Aguirre & Fleming-May, 2012; Denison &
Montgomery, 2012; Haigh, 2013) suggested that students are only extrinsically motivated
to use the library when required for a particular assignment. Dermody and Majekodunmi
(2011) speculated that self-efficacy in using library resources may play a role in a
student’s choice to engage with the library.
Articles discussed in this literature review were further analyzed to determine
whether key elements relating to the expectancy-value theory of motivation including
expectancies for success, value in using the library, and cost factors relating to motivation
were addressed. Of the studies reviewed, only two discussed students’ expectancies for
success (Dermody & Majekodunmi, 2011; Porter, 2011), two specifically mentioned
value from the students’ perspective (Denison & Montgomery, 2012; Rempel, Buck, &
Deitering, 2013), while a large number of studies (e.g., Dermody & Majekodunmi, 2011;
Foster & MacDonald, 2013; Fuller et al., 2009) noted issues relating to cost factors. In
particular, findings by Dermody & Majekodunmi (2011) and Porter (2011) suggest
57

students do not have high expectations for success when using the library, even after
receiving instruction. Similarly, students’ perceptions of the value of the library as a
motivator to engage with these resources were scarcely noted in the literature. Findings
by Denison and Montgomery (2012) and Rempel et al. (2013) suggest students use
quality resources available in the library so as not to compromise their education or when
they need a scholarly work from a particular field. Cost, however, a critical component of
value according to the expectancy-value theory of motivation (Eccles et al., 1983; Flake,
Barron, Hullerman, McCoach, & Welsh, 2015) bears much mention in this body of
literature. Across these studies, researchers frequently noted that time, frustration, high
failure rates, convenience/familiarity (preference for Google), and difficulty were major
cost factors that may adversely affect students’ motivation to use the library (ColónAguirre & Fleming-May, 2012; Dermody & Majekodunmi, 2011; Foster & MacDonald,
2013; Fuller et al., 2009).
Student perspectives.
Olsson (2009), in a critique of the library and information science scholar, states,
“Despite claims to have moved beyond a systems-centric approach … most prevailing
approaches [to information behavior research] manifest a task-orientation that is a legacy
of the field’s origins in library and information system evaluation” (pp. 22-23). The
current body of literature presented in this review suggests that LIS researchers have not
yet moved away from this prevailing orientation to scholarship and discourse. In other
words, the majority of studies analyzed for this review have focused upon if, whether, or
how users engage with the library systems in order to achieve particular tasks rather than
58

looking upon these information seekers as “knowing subjects” and “cultural experts”
(Talja, 1997) who may value both library resources as well as information available
through the Internet via search engines and collaborative, online knowledge sharing tools.
What is often missing from these user behavior studies are the voices of the individuals
and their perspectives of why they act as they do and what they imagine would better
meet their needs. To begin to fill this gap and more fully understand undergraduate
students’ information seeking needs, preferences, and behaviors in support of university
retention goals, this study utilized a mixed method design in which trends can be better
understood and potential ways by which libraries can better meet undergraduate students’
information needs are explored by placing students at the center of the design and seeking
their input about their information use environments (Taylor, 1991). This design allows
for a better understanding to emerge with regards to who the users are, what are their
settings, social networks, problems that lead to information needs, and the barriers they
encounter in meeting their information needs.
Summary: Literature Review
Regardless of research methods (e.g., surveys, experimental, citation analysis,
interviews, usability studies), findings from this literature review suggest convenience,
speed, and ease of use of search engines (e.g., Google) are the primary selection criteria
for undergraduate students when choosing among information sources. A second
prevailing theme that emerged from this review is that undergraduate students find library
resources difficult to use. Despite efforts by libraries to make their systems more usable
through interface design changes, increasing instruction, embedding librarians in learning
59

communities, introductory writing/research courses and first-year seminars, and more, the
gap continues to exist between undergraduate students and their academic libraries. The
absence of research that acknowledges the contextual and social cognitive factors of
students and considers motivational issues relating to information seeking presents a
great opportunity for exploration in this study, as this approach may help to bring about
answers to the perplexing problem of undergraduate students’ disengagement from their
academic libraries. The expectancy-value theory of motivation (Eccles et al., 1983) was
selected as the overarching framework by which to explore these motivational issues
relating to academic library underutilization, as this model allows for both the
expectancies for success (closely aligned to usability) and subjective task value (closely
aligned to usefulness) to be assessed in a way that puts the user at the center of the
design. Undergraduate students’ everyday life information seeking needs and preferences
were also included in this model as a way by which to explore whether the academic
library can viably reinvent itself as an information hub of the university that brings
together both scholarly and non-scholarly resources, thereby increasing the relevance of
the library by holistically meeting the information needs of students in support university
retention.
Research Questions and Propositions
To better understand the factors relating to undergraduate student engagement/
disengagement with the academic library and to explore whether university libraries
should expand their role beyond providing academic resources and services into more
“real-life” areas that are important to the daily lives of undergraduate students and in
60

support of the university goal of retention, this study seeks to answer four primary
research questions and 10 corresponding propositions:
1. What motivational variables best predict library utilization by
undergraduate students?
Proposition 1: Motivational variables are predictive of undergraduate students’
utilization of academic library resources.
Proposition 2: Group differences exist among undergraduate students with
respect to their utilization of academic library resources.
2. What are the social cognitive information needs of successful students?
Proposition 3: There are common educational barriers among undergraduate
students.
Proposition 4: Group differences exist among undergraduate students with
respect to their common educational barriers.
Proposition 5: Undergraduate students’ contextual background and social
cognitive factors are predictive of their utilization of academic library resources.
Proposition 6: Undergraduate students’ contextual background and social
cognitive factors are predictive of their overall academic success.
3. How do undergraduate students prefer to meet their information needs?
Proposition 7: There are commonalities among undergraduate students with
respect to the types of information resources they prefer to use for information
seeking.

61

Proposition 8: There are commonalities among undergraduate students with
respect to the types of technology they prefer to use for information seeking.
Proposition 9: Group differences exist among undergraduate students with
respect to their preferences for information seeking.
4. To what extent is addressing the everyday life information needs of students
a viable option for academic libraries?
Proposition 10: There is a clear overlap between the everyday life information
needs of undergraduate students and the ability of academic libraries to meet these
needs.

CHAPTER III
METHODS
Introduction
To address the four research questions and ten corresponding propositions
outlined for this study, a quantitative dominant four-phase sequential mixed methods
design was implemented at three purposely selected public 4-year colleges and
universities across the United States. Mixed research and analysis was utilized, as
quantitative and qualitative data, when used alone, were insufficient to answer the
research questions identified for this study (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2011). More
specifically, the multi-phase design of this study allowed for an in-depth examination of
factors relating to undergraduate student information seeking through an “iteration of
connected quantitative and qualitative studies that are sequentially aligned, with each new
approach building on what was learned previously” (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2011, p.
100). In other words, mixed methods allowed a more complete picture of an event,
process, or situation than using a single method. Johnson, Onwuegbuzie, and Turner
(2007) explain,
Mixed methods research is the type of research in which a researcher or team of
researchers combines elements of qualitative and quantitative research approaches
(e.g., use of qualitative and quantitative viewpoints, data collection, analysis,
inference techniques) for the broad purposes of breadth and depth of
understanding and corroboration (p. 123).

63

While quantitative designs can be used to produce large data sets and allow for
statistical testing, the qualitative component, particularly the students’ voices, has often
been absent from the conversation about undergraduate students’ information needs,
preferences, and behaviors. Though libraries are beginning to recognize that their systems
may be difficult to use and are working to address these issues, findings from a critical
review of the library utilization literature suggest that the voices of the students are often
muted in the conversations (Croxton, 2015). Consequently, undergraduate students
continue to turn to more convenient sources such as Google to meet their information
needs (Connaway et al., 2006; Prabha et al., 2006), even when they recognize the value
of library resources (Brophy & Bawden, 2005). Therefore, by taking a pragmatic
approach that brings quantitative and qualitative data together, a deeper, more relevant
understanding of undergraduate information seeking needs, preferences, and motivational
behavior is expected to emerge from this study.
Study Design and Rationale for Selection
A quantitative dominant four-phase sequential mixed methods design (Figure 4)
was selected for this study in order to allow each subsequent phase of data collection to
developmentally build off the findings from the preceding phases. A mixed design
approach for this study was further justified as it allowed the researcher to seek
triangulation of findings across methods that are complementary such that data from later
phases of the study helped to clarify findings in earlier phases (Green, Caracelli, &
Graham, 1989). In this design, the quantitative (QUAN) data collection and analysis
conducted during Phase II was the dominant phase of the study, while the qualitative data
64

(qual) collected in Phases I and III and the quantitative data (quan) collected in Phase III
largely served to provide deeper insights into the Phase II quantitative findings.

Figure 4. Quantitative Dominant Four Phase Sequential Mixed Methods Design
Phase I was comprised of qualitative data collection in which interviews were
conducted with university enrollment and retention officers, academic librarians, and
undergraduate freshman in order to gain an understanding of the common information
needs, educational barriers, and information seeking preferences of undergraduate
students. Phase I data underwent thematic analysis and were also transformed into

65

quantitative data, a form of “mixing during data analysis” (Creswell & Plano-Clark,
2011, p. 67), in order to calculate frequency counts of most commonly cited information
needs, barriers, and preferences of undergraduate students. This data transformation
allowed trends from Phase I data to be compared to data trends noted in subsequent
phases of the study.
Mixing of methods occurred between Phases I and II via a strategy of
“connecting” in which the qualitative results from Phase I helped build to the collection
of quantitative survey data in Phase II (Creswell & Plano-Clark, p. 67). While the Phase
II survey instrument was originally developed based upon findings from the literature,
numerous modifications and additions were made to the instrument as a result of Phase I
findings. This survey instrument was designed to assess undergraduate students’
information seeking needs, preferences, library motivation, educational barriers, and
social cognitive factors that may impact their information needs and university
persistence on a large scale. Predictive models for factors contributing to both library
utilization and academic success were developed and tested for significance using Phase
II data.
In Phase III, semi-structured follow-up interviews with volunteers from the Phase
II survey completers were conducted with a purposely selected sample of participants in
order to bring greater depth and understanding to the survey results. Again, a mixing
strategy of “connecting” was utilized in which findings from Phase I qualitative data and
Phase II quantitative data helped to build to the collection of Phase III qualitative data.
Phase III data underwent thematic analysis and, similar to Phase I procedures, were
66

transformed into quantitative data, thereby allowing a comparison of trends across Phases
I through III.
Finally, in Phase IV, academic library websites were reviewed using a checklist
developed from a mixing of the quantitized Phase I and III data and the Phase II
quantitative survey data in order to assess the alignment between what students need and
want with respect to information seeking and what libraries currently have. At the
conclusion of Phase IV, qualitative and quantitized interview data and quantitative
findings from the survey and library website review were mixed for interpretation,
allowing for conclusions and inferences to be drawn across all data sets to answer to
Research Questions 1-4 and their corresponding propositions. Each phase of the study is
discussed in greater depth below, giving particular attention to sampling of participants,
instrumentation and data collection, data analysis, and validity and reliability
considerations.
Maximization of Legitimation in Research Design
In mixed research, the term legitimation has been proposed as a term to describe a
third, separate set of expectations for evaluation of the quality (validity, trustworthiness,
credibility, etc.) of mixed methods studies (Creswell & Plano Clark, 2011; Dellinger &
Leech, 2007; O’Cathain, Murphy, & Nicholl, 2008). A legitimation criteria for mixed
research is necessary to address the problems that may arise due to mixing of data and
methods that are not particularly associated with mono-method designs (Onwuegbuzie &
Johnson, 2006). In quantitative research, validity refers to whether one can draw
meaningful and useful inferences from particular instruments (Creswell, 2009). Creswell
67

and Plano Clark (2011) explain that quantitative validity means that scores received from
participants are meaningful indicators of the construct being measured. In qualitative
research, terms such as trustworthiness, authenticity, credibility, transferability, and
dependability are used to discuss whether a study authentically captures the lived
experiences of people (Creswell, 2013; Lincoln & Guba, 1985).
To maximize legitimation in mixed research, a variety of evaluation frameworks
have been proposed, including
those suggested by Creswell and
Plano Clark (2011), Dellinger and
Leech (2007), Onwuegbuzie and
Johnson, (2006), and O’Cathain et
al. (2008). O’Cathain et al.’s
(2008) “Good Reporting of a
Mixed Methods Study”
(GRAMMS) criteria was selected
and adapted for this study as it
provides a practical, yet
comprehensive set of criteria that
evaluators can consider when
designing and evaluating mixed
method studies. An evaluation
rubric modeled after the

Figure 5. Validity/Legitimation Evaluation Rubric
68

GRAMMS criteria was developed by the researcher (Figure 5) to serve as a checklist to
ensure the results are valid, trustworthy, or legitimate by attending to the specific validity
considerations of both the quantitative and qualitative methods individually as well as
those relating to mixing, including how subsequent phases build off preceding phases and
how data is merged and analyzed to explain and bring a richer understanding about
undergraduate students’ information seeking behavior, preferences, and motivation.
Participants
Study Context
The primary population of interest in this study consists of undergraduate students
between the ages of 18-24 who are pursuing a Bachelor’s degree. This age group was
selected for this study, as the National Center for Education Statistics (2014) identified
this age group as being largely reflective of the overall undergraduate student population.
The sampling frame of participants in this study included undergraduate students enrolled
in large, 4-year public universities and colleges in the United States. In addition,
university retention officers and academic librarians employed by these public
institutions of higher education were included in the sampling pool for this study.
Research Sites
Three large, primarily residential, 4-year or above public universities, as classified
by the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education (Carnegie, 2015) were
purposely selected as research sites for this study. According to the Carnegie
Classifications (2015), this designation is defined as,

69

Fall enrollment data indicate FTE enrollment [2010] of at least 10,000 degreeseeking students at these bachelor's or higher degree granting institutions. 25-49
percent of degree-seeking undergraduates live on campus [institutionally –owned,
-controlled, or –affiliated housing] and at least 50 percent attend full time.
Further, each of the universities selected for this study has an enrollment profile
designated as High Undergraduate, which is defined by Carnegie (2015) as having “Fall
enrollment data includes both undergraduate and graduate students, with the latter group
accounting for 10–24 percent of FTE enrollment.”
The universities selected for this study are geographically distributed across the
United States, with one
university selected from
each of the three regions
delineated in Figure 6.
These universities are
henceforth referred to in this
study as University 1,

Figure 6. Three Large Public Universities

University 2, and University
3 according to their corresponding regions. University sites invited to participate in this
study fit the designated profile (large, residential, 4-year or above, high undergraduate)
and had a university librarian or dean who was known to the researcher or a member of
the researcher’s advisory committee. A sample letter to University Librarians/Deans,
inviting them to participate in this study, is available in Appendix A. Once written
confirmation of interest in participating in this study was received from each of the
70

university librarians, formal permissions were sought to conduct research at each of these
three institutions. Institutional Review Board (IRB) applications to conduct research were
submitted and approval was granted to conduct research at University 2 and University 3
during the Spring 2016 academic semester. With formal IRB approval in place from these
two universities, the Vice President for Research and Creative Scholarship at University
1 deemed that the already approved IRB applications at the other institutions were
sufficient and also granted permission to conduct research at this university during the
Spring 2016 semester. The undergraduate demographic profiles and graduation rates at
each of these universities, as reported on their websites as of Spring 2016, is outlined in
Table 1 below. (Note: To ensure the anonymity of the participating universities and study
participants, the citations for this information are not listed.)
Phase I Participants
In Phase I of the study, 13 individuals were purposely selected and participated in
one-on-one semi-structured interviews with the researcher (n=8 academic libraries, n=3
university enrollment and retention officials, n=2 freshman students). Academic
librarians who were particularly knowledgeable about undergraduate students’
information seeking needs, preferences, and motivation were identified for participation
by each University’s academic library dean. Upon identification of potential librarian
volunteers, a follow-up letter was sent to these individuals by the researcher, inviting
their participation (Appendix B) in the study. Eight librarians agreed to participate in
semi-structured interviews and are henceforth referred to with the following designations:

Because university enrollment and retention officers are intimately aware of
student drop-out trends and university initiatives related to student success, enrollment,
and retention initiatives at their universities, key leaders at each university were invited to
participate in one-on-one semi-structured interviews with the researcher (see Appendix C
for invitation letter). Ultimately, three university officials agreed to participate in semistructured interviews and are subsequently referred in this study with the following
designations:


University 1 (Associate Vice President for Enrollment and Student Success): R2



University 2 (Assistant Director for Academic Achievement): R1



University 3 (Vice Chancellor for Enrollment and Student Success + 11
committee members): R3
Finally, two freshman students from University 3 (S1 and S2) participated in one-

on-one semi-structured interviews with the researcher. Student interviews during this
phase of the study were restricted to freshman in their first year of study, as findings in
the literature suggest these students are the most vulnerable for dropping out (Schneider,
2010; Tinto & Pusser, 2006). At each university, names of potential freshman student
participants were solicited from the librarians who participated in interviews in order to
gain insights into undergraduate students’ information needs, preferences, and motivation
to use library resources. While students from all three universities were invited (see
Appendix D for invitation letter), only two freshman from University 3 agreed to
participate. These individuals were awarded a $10 Amazon gift card that was purchased
by the researcher as an incentive and token of gratitude.
73

Phase II Participants
In Phase II of the study, undergraduate students from the three participating
universities were invited to complete an online survey. From each of these universities, a
randomized list of 25% of the undergraduate students enrolled for courses in the Spring
2016 semester was provided by each institution’s research office. Ultimately, 13,268
undergraduate students were invited to participate in this phase of the study, with a 9.63%
response rate (n=1278) and 71.20% completion rate (n=910). These data are further
outlined in Table 2 below.

In the aggregate, survey respondents were primarily non-first generation students
(76.0%, n=971), female (64.6%, n=290), less than 25 years (89.0%, n=754), white
(Caucasian) (59.7%), enrolled full-time (91.7%, n=775), and spoke English as their first
language at home (74.1%, n=625). Student majors were varied and largely included
Science, Technology, and Math (STEM) (26.9%, n=227), Social Sciences (17.4%,
n=147), Business (15.5%, n=131), Health and Human Services (14.5%, n=122), and Arts
and Humanities (13.0%, n=100). Participants largely reported their GPAs to be above
74

average (3.1 and above) (77.2%, n=643). Reported family household incomes of
participants fell largely into the middle class ($35,000 - $99,999/year, 36.1%, n=305),
with 18.5% (n=156) falling below this threshold (< $35,000/year) and 26.0% (n=220)
falling into the upper middle class or higher threshold ($100,000/year or above). The
majority of participants (64.1%, n=542) reported that their parents held a Bachelor’s
degree or higher (Bachelor’s = 27.1%, n=229; Master’s = 25.1%, n=212; Doctoral =
11.9%, n=101). Undergraduate survey respondents’ demographics are outlined in further
detail in Appendix E.
Phase III Participants
In Phase III of the study, 22 undergraduate students were invited and 16 elected to
participate in one-on-one semi-structured interviews with the researcher. The Phase III
participants are henceforth referred to in this study by their participant identification
codes assigned by the researcher (PS1 – PS16). Each student who participated in an
interview received a $10 Amazon gift card that was purchased by the researcher as an
incentive and token of appreciation.
The Phase III participant pool was comprised of 198 Phase II participants who
expressed a willingness on the online survey to participate in a follow-up interview with
the researcher. In this strand, purposeful, nonprobability sampling for heterogeneity
(Tashakkori & Teddlie, 1998) was employed such that prospective interviewees were
selected in a way that provided a cross-sectional representation among participants with
respect to year in school, gender, and race/ethnicity in attempt to accurately reflect the
demographic makeup of the participating universities. Additionally, GPA, first generation
75

status, and academic major were considered in participant selection as findings in the
literature and early analysis of the Phase I and Phase II data suggested these factors may
impact students’ information seeking needs, preferences, and/or behaviors. Participants
represented all three universities (University 1, n=5; University 2, n=5; University 3,
n=6), were nearly evenly distributed with respect to gender (male, n=7; female, n=8;
other, n=1), were slightly more heavily represented in the earlier years in school
(freshman, n=6, sophomore, n=4, junior, n=3; senior, n=3), and had varied GPAs (2.0 or
below, n=1; 2.1-2.5, n=2; 2.6-3.0, n=4; 3.1-3.5, n=4; and 3.6-4.0, n=5). Of these
participants, five (31.25%) were first generation college students, and 15 were between
the ages of 18-24 years (one participant > 24 years). Attendance at a library instruction
class varied (0 classes, n=1, 6.25%; 1 class, n=11, 68.75%; 2 + classes, n=4, 25.0%), as
did their reported usage of both the physical library and online library resources. Of the
16 interviewees, nearly half (43.8%, n=7) reported visiting library less than 5 times
during the previous semester (0 times/semester, n=2, 12.5%; <5 times/semester, n=5,
31.25%; 1-3 times/mo, n=2, 12.5%; 1+ times/week, n=7, 43.75%). Similarly, slightly
more than half (56%, n=9) of the participants reported that they had utilized the online
library resources less than 5 times during the previous semester (0 times/semester, n=2,
12.5%; <5 times/semester, n=7, 43.75%; 1-3 times/month, n=4, 25.0%; and 1+
times/week, n=3, 18.75%). The demographic and library use profile of the Phase III
participants as well as the profiles of the two Phase I student interviewees is outlined in
greater detail in Appendix F.

Phase IV Participants
In Phase IV, 50 four-year, large, primarily residential, public universities were
randomly selected from a list of 107 universities fitting these criteria as identified by the
Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education (Carnegie, 2015). For each of
these institutions, the university’s library website underwent a feature analysis that was
conducted by the researcher. The three original university sites for this study were
randomly selected to be included in this university list and continue to be identified in
this phase as University 1, 2, and 3. The additional 47 universities reviewed for this phase
are henceforth referred to as University 4 – 50. The randomly selected universities were
distributed across the five regions of the United States (West, n=9; Southwest, n=3;
Northeast, n=8; Midwest, n=13, and Southeast, n=17) and were largely classified as
selective or moderately selective (selective, n=24, 49%; moderately selective, n=24,
49%; inclusive, n=1, 2%; or not listed, n=1, 2%). The majority of the universities were
classified as “balanced arts & science/professions” (n=26, 52%), with the remainder
classified as “professions plus arts & sciences” (n=15, 30%), “arts & sciences plus
professions” (n=6, 12%), and “arts & sciences focus” (n=3, 6%). The profiles for each of
the selected universities are further outlined in Appendix G.
Instrumentation
Based upon a review of the literature related to the research questions, six primary
constructs were identified and used to develop six separate data collection instruments.
Instruments included three interview protocols that were administered during Phase I, an
online survey implemented in Phase II, an interview protocol administered in Phase III,
77

and a website feature checklist that was implemented in Phase IV. Primary constructs of
the study include: (1) motivation to use library sources, (2) social cognitive factors for
career and academic persistence, (3) perceived barriers to achieving educational barriers,
(4) resource preferences for information seeking, (5) technology tool preferences for
information seeking, and (6) viability of the library in addressing the everyday life
information needs of students in support of retention. Several of these constructs were
further subdivided, as outlined in Table 3 below.

To ensure all research questions, constructs, data collection instruments, and
individual scale items were aligned, a research crosswalk was created (Appendix H) by the
researcher that illustrates how each data collection strategy was utilized to answer each
research question and proposition. All research questions had a minimum of three data
sources for triangulation, a common validity approach in mixing methods studies in
78

which “the inquirer builds evidence for a code or theme from several sources or
individuals” (Creswell & Plano-Clark, 2011, p. 212). The crosswalk further provides an
outline of operational definitions, dependent and independent variables, data analysis
plans, data collection strategies, and instrument question numbers.
Phase I Instrumentation
Three semi-structured interview protocols were developed by the researcher based
upon findings from the literature review and were administered during Phase I. The
interview questions were aligned to address the unique research questions of the study
(see Research Crosswalk, Appendix H). A 24-question librarian interview protocol
(Appendix I) was developed to address Research Questions 1-4. A 12-question retention
officer interview protocol (Appendix J) was developed to address Research Questions 2
and 4 and a 25-question freshman interview protocol (Appendix K) was developed to
address Research Questions 1-4. Doctoral advisory committee members, one doctoral
student, and one doctoral candidate, all with expertise in qualitative research methods,
reviewed these protocols for question clarity as well as face and construct validity.
Further, the freshman interview protocol was field tested with two undergraduate students
who were known to the researcher. All Phase I interviews lasted between 20 – 30 minutes
and occurred via telephone.
Phase II Instrumentation
During Phase II, the quantitative dominant phase (QUAN) of the study, data were
collected using undergraduate student participant responses to a 47-question online
survey (Appendix L) that was developed by the researcher. Invitations to participate in
79

this study were sent via email to a randomly selected pool of participants during the midpoint of the Spring 2016 semester with two follow-up email reminders sent at one-week
intervals (Appendix M).
Survey data were collected via Likert-type numerical ratings, check boxes, and
open-ended responses to allow trends and predictability of library use and academic
success to be assessed. Demographic variables including gender, age, race, credit hours,
GPA, student status, major, first generation student, family income, parents’ highest level
of education, language spoken at home, international student status, and attendance at
library instruction sessions were included in order to determine whether group
differences were present. Scale items were measured using a 7-point agreement scale
with 1 representing the lowest agreement rating and 7 representing the highest agreement
rating. A 7-point scale was selected per findings from Krosnick and Fabrigar (1997) who
argued that seven points seem to represent the best compromise between rating scales
with too few choices that may fail to discriminate between respondents’ judgments and
scales with too many choices that may make it difficult for respondents to distinguish
between categories (Groves et al., 2009).
Survey development process.
Survey development followed a seven-step design process developed by Artino,
La Rochelle, Dezee, and Gehlbach (2014) in a guide they prepared for the international
Association for Medical Education in Europe (AMEE) to aid education researchers in the
design of self-administered surveys or questionnaires. In this guide, Artino et al. (2014)
outline seven steps that synthesize multiple survey design techniques, including those
80

endorsed by the American Education Research Association (AERA), American
Psychological Association (APA), and the National Council on Measurement in
Education (NCME) in their 1999 Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing.
Artino et al. (2014) suggest that “Addressing each of these steps systemically will
improve the probability that survey designers will accurately measure what they intend to
measure” (p. 463). These steps include: (1) conduct a literature review, (2) conduct
interviews and/or focus groups, (3) synthesize the literature and interviews/focus groups,
(4) develop items, (5) conduct expert validation, (6) conduct cognitive interviews, and (7)
conduct pilot testing.
During Step 1, a comprehensive review of the literature was conducted prior to
the development of any portion of the survey. This helped the researcher to identify key
constructs outlined for this study (Table 3) as well as prior instrument scales of relevance
to this study’s survey including those developed and tested by Bean (1985), Cabrera et al.
(1992), Eccles & Wigfield (1995), Flake et al. (2015), Kahn and Nauta (2001), Lent et al.
(1997), Luzzo and McWhirter (2001), and Singh, Zhang, Horton, and Boekhorst (2012).
Step 2 of the survey development coincided with Phase I of the present study in which
interviews were conducted with key librarians (n=8), enrollment and retention officers
(n=3), and freshman students (n=2). The freshman student interviews were particularly
important to the survey development as they helped the researcher better understand how
the undergraduate student population conceptualizes and describes the constructs of
interest. In Step 3 of the survey instrument development, interview findings were
analyzed, synthesized, and compared to the findings in the literature. As a result of this
81

mixed methods strategy of “connecting,” gaps in currently existing scales as they relate to
the goals of this study were identified and additional aspects of interest were identified.
These additions included aspects relating to barriers to achieving academic goals,
information needs, potential components relating to students’ social cognitive
background, and previous attendance at an academic library workshop/information
session. These additional points of consideration are outlined in Table 4.

During Step 4, survey items were developed and/or adapted to correspond with
the six primary constructs and 10 sub-constructs identified for the study (Table 3). These
items were compiled into a 47 item online survey instrument (Appendix L) using the
online survey development tool, Qualtrics. The survey included 17 demographic
questions, 17 quantitative questions, 9 questions inviting open-ended responses, and 4
questions at the end of the survey inviting volunteers to participate in follow-up
interviews with the researcher and/or participate in a drawing for a $50 Amazon gift card
drawing incentive for completing the survey.
Finally, pilot testing (Step 7) commenced with the collection of data from
undergraduate students (n=1,278) representing the three participating university sites for
this study. While initial subscales that were adapted for this study were found to have
good to strong Cronbach’s alpha reliability scores (0.7 or above) as documented in prior
research studies reported in the literature (see Appendix N), a comprehensive analysis of
subscale reliability and normality was conducted for the present study. All Cronbach’s
alpha scores for the subscales in the present study were found to be good to excellent at α
= .85 or above, with the exception of two subscales for which Cronbach’s alpha scores
fell slightly below α = .80 (Financial Issues, α = .744; Social Belonging/Mental Health α
= .789). These findings are outlined below and described in greater detail in Appendices
O, P, and Q.
Subscale development.
Many scale items were adapted from previously developed and tested instruments
reported in the literature that were reported to have good to strong reliability (Cronbach’s
83

alpha 0.7 or above) (Bean, 1985; Cabrera et al., 1992; Eccles & Wigfield, 1995; Flake et
al., 2015; Kahn & Nauta, 2001; Lent et al., 1997; Luzzo & McWhirter, 2001; Singh et al.,
2012). Initial constructs, items, original scale sources, and reliability measures of the
original scales are outlined in Appendix N.
Motivation to use library resources was measured in the present study using
subscales adapted from Eccles and Wigfield’s (1995) expectancy-value theory of
motivation relating to expectancies for success and subjective task value as well as a cost
belief subscale that was adapted from a cost dimension subscale developed by Flake et al.
(2015). Overall, reliability analysis suggests the three library motivation subscales used
in this study have good to excellent reliability, with all Cronbach’s Alpha scores greater
than α = .85 (Library Expectancies for Success Subscale, α = 0.873; Library Value
Subscale, α = .920; Library Cost Subscale, α = .921). These values meet or exceed
Cronbach’s alpha scores found in the original source instruments (Appendix N) relating
to the expectancy-value theory of motivation (Eccles & Wigfield, 1995) and very closely
align with reliability reported for Flake et al.’s (2015) cost belief subscale (α = .97).
These favorable comparisons between the use of the modified scales in the current study
with the original source instruments help to establish consistent internal reliability of this
instrument. To further assess whether the items identified to comprise the three subscales
of the expectancy-value library motivation scale formed reliable constructs, Cronbach’s
alpha, corrected item total correlations, Cronbach’s alpha if deleted, mean of inter-item
correlations, and subscale normality were reviewed and found to fall within acceptable

84

parameters. The findings of this comprehensive subscale reliability and normality
analysis are outlined in detail in Appendix O.
To assess social cognitive needs of undergraduate students, individual questions
and/or subscales were adapted from studies by Cabrera et al. (1992), Kahn and Nauta
(2001), Bean (1985), Lent et al. (1997), and Luzzo and McWhirter (2001). All subscales
for the original social cognitive career constructs were found to have a high degree of
internal reliability as reported in previous studies, with reported Cronbach’s alpha scores
at 0.81 or greater (see Appendix N). Overall, a reliability analysis of the social cognitive
career subscales utilized in the present study (Performance Goals, Outcome Expectations,
and Academic Self-Efficacy) suggests these subscales have good reliability, with all
Cronbach’s Alpha scores greater than α = .87 with the exception of Performance Goals,
for which Cronbach’s alpha was not calculated, as this construct had only one item
(Outcome Expectations, α = .874; Academic Self-Efficacy, α = .871). These values
mirror very closely the Cronbach’s alpha scores reported in studies that used the original
source instruments (Appendix N), thereby helping to establish consistent internal
reliability of this instrument. To further assess whether the items identified to comprise
the social cognitive needs subscales formed reliable constructs, Cronbach’s alpha,
corrected item total correlations, Cronbach’s alpha if deleted, mean of inter-item
correlations, and subscale normality were reviewed and found to fall within acceptable
parameters. The findings of this comprehensive subscale reliability and normality
analysis are outlined in detail in Appendix P.

85

In addition to factors relating to social cognitive information needs of
undergraduate students, educational barriers were considered to be potentially important
factors in understanding undergraduates students’ information seeking needs,
preferences, behaviors, and motivation to utilize library resources (Kahn & Nauta, 2001;
Lent et al., 1994, 2000). To identify potential barriers that undergraduate students may be
likely to encounter during their time at their universities, Luzzo and McWhirter’s (2001)
21-item Perception of Educational Barriers Scale (α = .93) was modified to include 24
items included in the present study. Reliability analysis was conducted on the full
Educational Barriers scale as well as on four new subscales that were identified through a
Principal Components Analysis using an oblimin rotation that was conducted by the
researcher. These four factors, which accounted for 56.53% of the total variance among
scores, include: (1) Support from Others, (2) Financial Related Issues, (3) Academic
Readiness, and (4) Social Belonging and Mental Health. An analysis of reliability and
normality for the full academic barriers scale and the four newly identified subscales was
conducted and reliability was found to range from respectable to good after four items
(28.15, 28.18, 28.19, and 28.31) that were initially included in the assessment were
removed due to due to misfit with the other items in the scale and/or poor wording. (Full
Scale, α = .921; Support from Others, α = .847; Financial Issues, α = .744; Academic
Readiness, α = .860; Social Belonging and Mental Health, α = 0.789). In addition,
Cronbach’s alpha if deleted scores and corrected item-total correlations were reviewed
and all fell within the limits of acceptability. Analysis of normality of the combined
average score for Educational Barriers suggests the distribution approaches normality.
86

(See Appendix Q for a comprehensive report of the educational barriers scale principal
components analysis, scale and subscale reliability, and review of normality.)
Finally, survey questions regarding information seeking preferences of
undergraduate students were largely adapted from the International Media and
Information Literacy Survey (IMILS) of the Habits and Practices of University Students
when undertaking Research Assignments, a project sponsored by UNESCO (Singh et al.,
2012). All additional questions included on the survey were developed by the researcher
based upon the study’s unique research questions and findings from the literature.
Phase III Instrumentation
As in the preceding phase of the study, the mixing strategy of “connecting” was
utilized in which findings from Phase I qualitative data and Phase II quantitative data
helped to build to the development of the Phase III undergraduate student interview
protocol and corresponding data collection. The semi-structured interview protocol that
was initially used in Phase I interviews with freshman students was revised for
administration to undergraduate students during Phase III (see Appendix R). More
specifically, findings from the analysis of the Phase I interview data suggested that many
new students enter the university feeling underprepared for college level coursework and
have difficulty transitioning to living independently, which may present barriers to their
academic success. As such, questions (item #3 and two follow-up questions) were added
to the new Phase III interview protocol, asking participants to reflect upon their academic
preparation and ability to live independently when they first started at the university.
Further, Phase I data collected from interviews with university enrollment and retention
87

officials suggested some students struggle in their selection of and commitment to their
academic majors as well as in their confidence that they will be able to find meaningful
work in their areas of interest upon graduation. To further explore these potential barriers
to students’ academic success, items 4 and 5 were added to the Phase III protocol, asking
students to explain their choice of major and their confidence that they will be able to
find work in their field after graduation. To better understand potential factors relating to
the social cognitive career theory factors with regards to performance goals and academic
self-efficacy that were addressed in the Phase II quantitative survey, item #6 was added
to the interview protocol, asking students about their confidence in their abilities to be
academically successful while enrolled at the university and their commitment to
graduating from their current universities. Finally, item #15 was added to the Phase III
protocol to facilitate further conversation about interviewees’ attendance at library
instruction sessions, as analysis of Phase II quantitative survey data suggested that there
were significant differences among students with regard to their perception of value of
online library resources, based upon the number of library instruction sessions attended.
Though the initial student interview protocol that was developed and implemented
during Phase I was field tested with two undergraduate students and implemented with
two others, the modifications to this protocol prompted another round of review by
experts in the field as well as additional field testing. The Phase III interview protocol
was reviewed in-depth by one doctoral advisory committee member and one doctoral
candidate for question clarity and alignment with the identified constructs for the full
study. Further, the protocol was field tested with one undergraduate student who was
88

known to the researcher. This helped the researcher identify potential areas of confusion
for interviewees, with minor modifications made accordingly.
Phase IV Instrumentation
To evaluate the alignment between undergraduate students’ information needs
and preferences with what academic library websites have available, a 47-item Library
Website Key Features Analysis Checklist was developed by the researcher (see Appendix
S) using the mixed methods “connecting” strategy in which findings revealed from the
qualitative Phase I and III interview data and Phase II quantitative survey data led to the
building of the quantitative Phase IV instrument. Each item included on this checklist
was either noted by an interviewee (Phase I or Phase III) or received at least an above
average rating on the Phase II survey (> 3.5 on a 7-point Likert scale) with regard to
participants’ likelihood of using particular services, tools, or features if offered by the
university library. This list of identified potential library services, tools, and features and
the study’s data sources in which they were identified is outlined in Appendix T. Several
items included in the checklist were unique to this study, including providing information
at the library about campus resources, academic skills preparation, and financial
information. Other items on the Phase IV checklist were not only identified in Phases I
through III, but were also recognized as being important to students in other research
studies (Dermody & Majekodunmi, 2011; Georgas, 2015; Head & Eisenberg, 2011;
Holman, 2011; Singh et al., 2012; Turner, 2011; Wong et al., 2009). For example, in two
separate large-scale quantitative studies, Head and Eisenberg (2011) and Singh et al.
(2012) noted that information about health and wellness, news and current events, career
89

information, and social contacts were highly valued everyday life information needs of
undergraduate students, further warranting inclusion on the Phase IV checklist. Likewise,
Georgas (2015), Holman (2011), and Turner (2011) noted that use of natural language
syntax when conducting library searches was common practice among undergraduate
information seekers, thereby suggesting that this may be a valued interface design
element of library websites. As such, an option for “allowing natural language searching”
was included on the Phase IV checklist. Finally, findings from studies conducted by
Dermody and Majekodunmi (2011) and Wong et al. (2009) and further reinforced by the
Phase II findings from the present study suggest that undergraduate students may value
both easy access to full-text documents and Google Scholar as a means by which to
search online library materials and Google concurrently. Thus, questions relating to these
options were included in the Phase IV checklist.
All items on this checklist were operationally defined by the researcher in order to
establish specific evaluation criteria. For example, item #4 on the checklist, “Is there a
single search box that can search the university’s online catalog and online databases
simultaneously with a single click?” was operationally defined by the researcher as,
“Typing in the term “juvenile diabetes” provides a list of results that includes print books
and journal articles (minimum) (Yes/No/Other).” One doctoral candidate and one
doctoral student with expertise in both qualitative and quantitative data analysis reviewed
the checklist, paying particular attention to the operational definitions developed by the
researcher, in an effort to ensure question clarity and face validity.

90

The checklist was largely developed using a yes/no format; “yes” if the website
had the feature and “no” if it did not. This type of data collection allowed for efficient
analysis using descriptive statistics, including frequency counts and percentages. For each
university identified for Phase IV, the researcher conducted a Google search for the
university’s library website and then conducted an in-depth examination of the site using
the Phase IV checklist to guide the analysis.
Data Analysis
Phase I
During Phase I, all interviews were conducted by phone, recorded by the
researcher, transcribed verbatim, and coded using the NVIVO 11 Starter software. Initial
codes were devised from the literature review conducted for this study, while other new
codes emerged from the data during an open-coding process adapted from Creswell
(2013) in which raw data collected through interviews were analyzed on an ongoing basis
throughout Phase I. A thematic analysis was conducted by the researcher in which
transcripts were reviewed, coded, and recoded until themes emerged from the data. These
themes were categorized according to the interviewee group (librarians, enrollment and
retention officers, and undergraduate students) and were aligned to the four main research
questions of the study. Phase I interview data were also mixed during analysis via a
transformation technique in which qualitative data were quantitized based upon
frequencies of responses according to each identified theme, thereby allowing for trends
in data to be compared across subsequent phases of the study.

91

Phase II
Statistical analysis of quantitative survey data was conducted using the statistical
software, IBM SPSS Statistics Version 23. Quantitative data analysis included both
descriptive (means, frequency counts, standard deviations, and percentages) and
inferential statistics including stepwise multiple regression analyses and analysis of
variance (ANOVA). Significance thresholds were limited to (p < .05). Qualitative survey
data collected via the open-ended response items were downloaded and compared to
Phase I and Phase III interview findings for consistency using NVIVO 11 Starter.
One-way ANOVAs, a statistical test used to compare mean scores within and
between groups, were calculated only for those samples meeting a minimum sample size,
which was calculated using G*Power 3 using an a priori power analysis (Faul, Erdfelder,
Buchner, & Lang, 2009). The designated significance level, alpha, was set at .05; the
desired statistical power was set to .80; and the anticipated effect size was set at .20. With
the aforementioned specifications, G*Power reported a minimum sample size of 246 for
this study if assessing differences between three groups (e.g. three universities). The
actual study sample of 1278 participants across three universities (University 1, n=107;
University 2, n=769; University 3, n=402) ultimately met the minimum requirements as
specified by G*Power. Because different ANOVA calculations in this study involved
varied numbers of groups, further a priori determinations of sample size per G*Power
analysis were assessed and are outlined below in Table 5. In addition, Levene’s test for
homogeneity of variance was conducted for all ANOVA tests. Assumptions of
homogeneity of variance (Levene’s test, p > .05) were met for all groups unless otherwise
92

noted. In cases in which assumptions of homogeneity of variance were violated, Welch’s
adjusted ANOVA test, a more robust test that is particularly useful with unequal sample
sizes, was used in place of the traditional ANOVA F test. For all significant ANOVAs
that included more than two categories for a demographic variable, Fisher’s Least
Significant Difference (LSD) comparisons were conducted to assess where group
differences occur. The LSD procedure consists of running pairwise comparisons among
the means using a standard Student’s t test. Though the accuracy of the LSD procedure is
sometimes called into question when there are many means to compare, Howell (2013)
explains that it is a very legitimate and accurate procedure to use when there are only a
minimal number of means to compare, as is the case with the present study. In cases in
which assumptions of homogeneity of variance were violated and a Welch’s ANOVA
test was calculated instead of the traditional ANOVA F test, a Games-Howell post hoc
test was conducted in place of Fisher’s LSD.

To answer Research Question 1, which relates to how well motivational variables
predict library usage and to assess the truth of proposition 1, stepwise multiple regression
analyses were conducted using the three motivation subscales (expectancies for success,
value, and cost belief) to predict the dependent variables, in-person and online “library
93

use.” Stepwise multiple regression analysis was utilized, as it allowed the researcher to
explore the data for relationships when there was uncertainty as to whether relationships
did, in fact, exist (Vogt & Johnson, 2011). The truth of proposition 2 was assessed using
ANOVAs and post hoc comparisons across all demographic grouping variables.
Multiple statistical analytical strategies were used to answer Research Question 2
and corresponding propositions 3 through 6, which relate to the social cognitive and
career information needs of undergraduate students. To assess the truth of proposition 3,
frequency counts from survey data relating to educational barriers were calculated. To
assess the truth of proposition 4, ANOVAs and corresponding post hoc analyses when
relevant were analyzed across all demographic grouping variables. To determine the truth
of propositions 5 and 6, stepwise multiple regression analyses were conducted across the
four social cognitive career theory subscales (performance goals, outcome expectations,
academic self-efficacy, and educational barriers) as they relate to the predictability of the
dependent variables “library use” and “academic success.”
To answer Research Question 3 and propositions 7 and 8, which pertain to
information seeking preferences of undergraduate students, descriptive statistics
including means, standard deviations, and percent frequencies were calculated. To assess
the truth of proposition 9, which relates to the presence of group differences, ANOVAs
and post hoc analyses were calculated across all demographic groups.
Phase III
Data analysis of the Phase III undergraduate student interview transcripts
followed the same process outlined above for Phase I data. All interviews were conducted
94

by phone, recorded, transcribed verbatim, and reviewed by the researcher to ensure
consistency of findings and themes across methods. This entailed using the same initial
coding scheme that was devised during Phase I, though expansion of this coding did
occur based upon new themes that emerged from this set of data. Further, as was done
during Phase I data analysis, Phase III interview data were mixed via transformation in
which they were quantitized based upon number of responses per theme, further allowing
a comparison of trends across Phases I through III.
Phase IV
To answer Research Question 4 and proposition 10, which pertain to the viability
of academic libraries in expanding their services to address everyday life information
needs of undergraduate students, descriptive statistics, including means, frequency
counts, and percentages were calculated using Microsoft Excel 2013. Data were initially
collected using an online form created in Google Drive that corresponded to the Phase IV
Library Website Feature Analysis Checklist (Appendix S). This data was automatically
saved into a corresponding Google Spreadsheet, which was then downloaded to an Excel
2013 file on the researcher’s computer where it underwent descriptive statistical analysis.
Validity and Reliability Considerations
Ensuring research methods are both valid and reliable is of utmost importance to
this study. Validity and reliability considerations have been discussed throughout the
description of the Instruments and Data Analysis and are further summarized below. For
the quantitative components of the study, validity refers to whether meaningful and
useful inferences can be made about the study’s constructs from data collected using
95

particular instruments (Creswell, 2009). Rather than discussing validity in qualitative
research, terms such as trustworthiness and credibility are used to assess whether a study
authentically captures the lived experiences of people (Creswell, 2013). Reliability,
which is of primary concern in the quantitative survey component of this study, refers to
the extent to which scores on items within an instrument scale are internally consistent
and stable over time (Creswell, 2009).
Role of the Researcher
In order to address potential threats to validity and increase the credibility of the
conclusions to the study, it is important to acknowledge the role and potential influence
of the researcher. While it is impossible to eliminate the influence of the researcher
(Hammersley & Atkinson, 1995), it is important to acknowledge how one’s values and
background may influence interpretation of the data. The researcher is a white, middleaged female brought up in a middle class, Midwestern, Anglo-Saxon, Protestant
environment. She is a first generation college student raised by parents who placed great
value in education. The researcher has always been a very goal directed, successful
student. Holding a master’s degree in library and information studies, she has worked as
an academic librarian in both a community college and a 4-year university. Further, the
researcher has been involved in conducting research about individuals and their use of
libraries as well as the usability of library and information systems throughout her
professional and academic career. These experiences and background may influence how
the study’s data is interpreted with respect to perceptions and attitudes about academic
library usage and undergraduate students’ information seeking preferences, needs, and
96

motivation. It is a belief of the researcher that the library is a critical component of the
university and that engagement with online academic libraries is an important element of
a student’s academic success. While it is hoped that the study’s data will be analyzed
with an unbiased eye, doing so is an impossibility.
Validity Checks in Study Design
The potential for researcher bias was checked throughout this study in multiple
ways. All interview protocols and the survey instrument used in this study were reviewed
by the researcher’s doctoral committee members and fellow doctoral students and
candidates to ensure that questions were neither poorly worded nor leading. Further,
triangulation was utilized during the data collection phase of the study to reduce the risk
of bias that may result from a specific method (Maxwell, 2013). Data were collected from
multiple sources including interviews, a survey, and a website feature analysis. Further,
rigorous examination of both the supporting and discrepant data was undertaken
throughout the study. The sequential design of the study allowed for findings that were
surprising, discrepant, or inconclusive in earlier phases of the study to be explored in
greater depth in subsequent phases. Though utilization of each of these strategies does not
verify the conclusions of the study, their diligent use helps to lend validity and credibility
to the study findings. Embedding and attending to validity checks throughout the study
has helped to rule out threats to potential interpretations and explanations from the study.
Efforts were made to ensure that the qualitative data collected from interviews
conducted in Phases I and III were rich and descriptive. All interviews were recorded and
verbatim transcripts prepared. Respondent validation was utilized for the interview
97

phases of the study. This involved preparing a written summary report for each set of
interviews, including themes and corresponding respondent quotations. This written
summary was sent to all interview participants (n=29) (see Appendix U for a sample),
seeking affirmation of the findings. Overall, affirmations of the thematic findings were
received from 11 individuals including 5 librarians, 3 enrollment/retention officers, and 3
undergraduate students. No responses were received from the other 18 interviewees.
Validity of the quantitative survey was strengthened by using a randomly selected
sample of undergraduates students enrolled in three universities in the United States.
Content validity of the survey instrument was further addressed by using pre-developed
and tested constructs and scale items from studies published by prominent researchers in
the field. Subject matter experts, including doctoral committee advisory members and
select doctoral students and candidates reviewed the survey instrument for both content
validity and clarity. Finally, 13 undergraduate students field tested the survey instrument
and provided feedback regarding clarity of questions.
In Phase IV, validity was addressed by using a randomly selected sample of 50
universities fitting a predetermined criteria set forth by the Carnegie Foundation (2015).
Further, all websites were analyzed using a concrete, operationalized set of criteria that
was developed by the researcher based upon study findings from Phase I through III. The
design of this instrument allowed for a simple yes/no determination as to whether a
website had the feature in question.

98

Stages of Mixing Data
While attending to validity and reliability concerns of each mono-method phase
of the study is important, in mixed methods research it is also important to address where
and how mixing occurred. In this study, data from Phase I qualitative interviews
underwent thematic analysis and were also quantitized and compared to quantitative
survey data from Phase II to better assess trends. Qualitative data from Phase I were also
used developmentally to help construct the Phase II survey instrument. Both qualitative
and quantitative data collected in Phases I and II were analyzed and used in the
development of the Phase III undergraduate student interview protocol. Data from Phases
I, II, and III were utilized to identify features to be included in the Phase IV library
website feature analysis. Data collected from all four phases were then analyzed and
compared as a whole in order to address the study’s research questions.
Chapter Summary
A quantitative dominant four-phase sequential mixed methods design (Figure 4)
that included six data collection instruments was used to explore the reasons that may
underlie undergraduate students’ underutilization of libraries and the ability of academic
libraries to meet these needs. Data were collected from 1,291 participants representing
three purposely selected large, public 4-year universities across the United States. A total
of 29 participants (n=8 librarians, n=3 enrollment/retention officers, n=2 freshman presurvey, and n=16 undergraduates post-survey) participated in one-on-one semi-structured
interviews with the researcher. A total of 1,278 undergraduate students completed at least
a portion of an online survey implemented at the three designated universities. Sixteen of
99

the aforementioned participants participated in both an interview and completed the
online survey. Additionally, 50 randomly selected library websites were examined for the
presence of key features, services, and tools desired by undergraduate students. Data
triangulation for this study was strong, with each of the four research questions identified
for the study having at least three separate data sources (see Appendix H for Research
Crosswalk). All six data collection instruments underwent rigorous review to ensure
validity and reliability. Data analysis included a mix of both qualitative, thematic
analysis, and quantitative statistical analysis that included both descriptive and inferential
statistics including stepwise multiple regression analyses and ANOVAs. The findings of
this data analysis are outlined in Chapter IV.

CHAPTER IV
RESULTS
Overview
The two-fold purpose of this study was (1) to better understand the factors
relating to undergraduate student engagement/disengagement with the academic library
and (2) to explore whether university libraries should expand their role beyond providing
academic resources and services into more “real-life” areas that are important to the daily
lives of undergraduate students and in support of the university goal of retention. Thus,
this study sought to answer four primary research questions and assess the truth of 10
corresponding propositions. The results of the qualitative and quantitative data analyses
relating to these research questions and propositions are described below. The study
findings are presented under key headings that correspond to the research questions and
propositions for this study. Results include quantitative, qualitative, and merged
(quantitative and qualitative results) data where applicable.
Perception of Value is the Largest Motivational Factor for Library Use
To answer Research Question 1 “What motivational variables best predict
library utilization by undergraduate students?” and to explore the truth of Proposition 1,
“Motivational variables are predictive of undergraduate student’s utilization of academic
library resources,” qualitative data from librarian and undergraduate student interviews

101

and quantitative survey responses were analyzed as they related to library usage (inperson and online) and the three motivational variables identified for this study:
undergraduate students’ expectancies for success in using library resources, their
perceptions of value of engaging with these resources, and their personal cost when using
these resources. Overall, findings from stepwise multiple regression analyses suggest that
perceptions of library value are predictive of undergraduate students’ use of the physical
library, while perceptions of both library value and cost hold predictive value for
students’ use of online library resource.
To begin, mean ratings were calculated for undergraduate students’ frequency of
visits to the academic library building (M=3.24, SD=1.16) and frequency of access of the
library’s online resources (M=2.61, SD=1.14) during the previous semester using a 5point scale with corresponding labels (1=0 visits/semester, 2=< 5 times/semester, 3=1-3
times/month, 4=1-2 times/week, 5=3 or more visits/week). A review of frequency data
suggests the vast majority (79.8%) of the students visited their library in-person at least
one time per semester, but less than 3 times per week (less than 5 times/semester, n=296,
25.5%; 1-3 times/month, n=249, 21.4%, 1-2 times/week, n=382, 32.9%). Frequency data
further suggest that undergraduate students used their online library resources less
frequently than they used the library in-person, with nearly two-thirds of the respondents
(62.8%) indicating they used these resources more than one time per semester but less
than 1-2 times/week (less than 5 times/semester, n=387, 32.9%; 1 to 3 times/month,
n=352, n=29.9%). These findings are further outlined in Table 6.

Mean ratings were also calculated for undergraduate students’ expectancies for
success (M=5.52, SD=1.27) when using library resources, perceptions of library value
(M=4.75, SD=1.31), and perceptions of library cost (M=3.41, SD=1.44). These mean
scores suggest undergraduate students expect to be successful in their online library
searches, have an above average perception of value of the library’s resources, and a
slightly below average perception that using the library will bear a negative cost. These
findings are further outlined in Table 7.

Value of library space is a key factor for predicting in-person library use.
Mean scores for academic library usage and the three motivational factors were
entered into two separate stepwise multiple regression analyses to determine which, if
any, factors were predictive of In-Person and Online Library Use. A stepwise procedure
was selected for this analysis to ascertain what combination of independent variables
(expectancies for success, library value, and library cost) would best predict the
dependent variables (in-person library use and online library usage). Using this stepwise
procedure, predictor variables were entered into the equation one at a time. Rencher and
Christensen (2012) explain that, “…after a variable has entered, the variables previously
selected are reexamined to see if each still contributes a significant amount” (p. 244). The
process is continued only if additional variables add any statistical significance to the
regression equation.
To predict usage of the in-person library, "library value" was entered into the
stepwise regression equation at Step 1 of the analysis and was significantly related to inperson library use (F(1,857)=9.887, p < .002). The R2 value was .011 (Adjusted R2 = .010),
indicating approximately 1.1% of the variance of “in-person library use” could be
accounted for by perceptions of “library value.” Neither "expectancies for success" (t= .443, p > .05) nor "library cost" (t=-.390, p > .05) entered into the equation at Step 2 of
the analysis. Thus, the regression equation for predicting “in-person library use” was:
Predicted In Person Library Use = 2.833 + (.095)(Library Value).

104

Though these findings suggest that perceptions of library value account for only a
small percentage of the variance of “in-person library use,” the qualitative findings from
both the librarian and undergraduate student interviews lend strength to the suggestion
that students value the physical library primarily for study space, and secondarily for
access to technology equipment. In the librarian interviews, comments from 100% of the
participants (n=8) suggested that students’ use of the physical library is largely driven by
a desire for space and access to computer technology. Further, half of the undergraduate
student interviewees (n=9, 50.0%) noted that they value the physical library primarily as
a place to study quietly or work collaboratively with peers, with 22.2% (n=4) noting that
they also value the library as a place to access computers, printers, and other technology
equipment. Librarian L6 (University 1) explained,
Certainly, in the information arena, I think the value in the library still is in the
space. I think they [undergraduate students] would say very positive things about
the ability to be in the building for so many hours a day, to have computers
available, to have comfortable seats, to have such a large space and different
group rooms, and all the things. I think they would still largely say it's the
physical space.
In further support of this finding, librarian L8 (University 2) noted,
We ask questions in the library. We do these little pop-up polls and ask, "Why are
you in the library?" and "What do you like about the library?" A lot of times it's
because it lacks distractions that they might find other places, so they are
sometimes coming in there to focus.
Likewise, comments from undergraduate student interviewees support the notion
that the primary value of the physical library lies in its space, and secondly for the
105

availability of technology equipment. In response to the interview question, “Have you
used the library since you've been a student at this university?” student PS6 (University
3) responded,
I go to the library about once or twice a week … I mean, I try to take as much
advantage of the library as I can. I use a lot of their printing services there just
because it's cheaper … Or… If I'm studying for, like, exams and stuff, I'll go into
one of the little private study or collab rooms and I'll just work on my own, just so
I can get away from my dorm … it's just a good place for me to go and be able to
get away from everything and sort of focus on the task at hand.
Similarly, student S2 (University 3) noted that while she uses the physical library
occasionally as a place to find books, she largely views it as a place to get away and
study quietly. In response to the interview questions, “And when you did use the library,
tell me more about this. Was it in person or was it online? What were you doing that
related to the library?” she responded,
It was in person. A few times it has been for specific book sources. … Often I go
for the technological side for printing or, most often, for scanning. I use the
scanner a lot. And the third reason and probably the biggest reason I go there is
just to study somewhere that's not my room. I've heard that that's best for you to
do, to study in a place where you're not generally sleeping.
Attainment value is key factor for predicting online library use.
A stepwise multiple regression analysis was conducted to evaluate whether
students' "expectancies for success" when using the library, "library value," and "library
cost" were necessary to predict “online library use.” All correlations were statistically
significant at p < .05. The prediction model contained two predictors (library value and
library cost) and was reached in two steps with no variables removed. The model was
106

statistically significant (F(2,869) = 113.021, p < .001) and accounted for approximately
20% of the variance of “online library use” (R2 = .206, Adjusted R2 = .205). Online
library use was primarily predicted by higher levels of “library value” and lower values
of “library cost.” “Expectancies for success” (t=1.250, p =.212) did not enter into the
equation at Step 2 of the analysis. Thus, the regression equation for predicting “online
library use” was:
Predicted Online Library Use = .809 + .353(LibraryValue) - .064(LibCost).
Student interview responses to questions about their prior success in using online
library resources as well as their expectations for future success suggest that
undergraduate students are confident in their abilities to use these resources, thus
expectations for success do not seem to be a key factor in their decisions about whether
they will use the library’s online resources for their academic information searching.
Overall, qualitative analysis of student interview data suggests that these participants
have been successful in previous attempts at using the library’s resources (n=10, 55.6%)
and expect to be successful on future occasions (n=15, 83.3%). Student interviewees’
comments that are representative of the majority of the participants’ sentiments include,
“I’ve had great success finding stuff [using the library resources]” (S1, University 3),
“I’ve always found what I needed to find” (PS2, University 2), and “Pretty often I can
find what I need” (PS11, University 1).
It is worthwhile to note that the majority of librarian interviewees (62.5%, n=5)
perceived that many undergraduate students approach their library online searching
107

experiences with confidence. However, findings from the thematic analysis of this set of
data suggest that the confidence of many students quickly wanes as they experience
frustration when they realize that library searching is not going to be a “Google-like”
experience. Often this frustration seems to stem from issues that are technical in nature;
other times it is conceptually related to developing the right research questions or
identifying keywords for their online searches. Librarian L1 (University 1) explained,
I think that they do [expect to be successful in finding what they need when they
are required to use the library]. … But something that comes up with these
expectations is that I do think there is a Google kind of expectation where you put
in what you want and you find stuff. And most of the time with Google that works
and you find the kind of stuff that you're looking for … I think they expect library
resources to be like that and there is some frustration when they don't work quite
the same way.
Further analysis of the qualitative data collected from both the librarian and
undergraduate student interviews suggests that value of online resources is largely
attributed to the attainment value, or the importance of doing well on a task (Schunk et
al., 2008), that using the library holds. In other words, undergraduate students are largely
extrinsically motivated to use online library resources when required by the professor, for
not doing so would comprise their grades. Librarian L3 (University 3) explained,
They typically will use the eResources when they are told to or when they are
required to do so or after some experience they learned that eResources are indeed
the best, most efficient source to use and the sources that resulted in them pulling
the best grade. So, with motivation from faculty, if the project description says,
"Use this database, use these resources," if you don't use these resources your
grade will probably be low.

108

Librarian L1 (University 1) further noted,
I think that motivation usually comes from encouragement or requirement by a
faculty member that students use a specific type of resource. So, I think that's a
big one. Yeah. I think that's really the primary thing. ... Especially with lower
level students who I work with, they are not necessarily wanting to use this on
their own.
Likewise, comments from half of the undergraduate students interviewed (n=9,
50.0%) suggest that for many students the primary motivator underlying their use of
online library resources is course imposed requirements. PS11 (University 1) explained,
… most of the time it's the professor wants you to have a specific kind of source,
you know, something that has been published in a journal or a magazine or
something. Well, a couple of times I have just kind of known that was the best
place to go for that sort of stuff, but most of the time it's the professor.
Lending further support to these findings, PS9 (University 1) noted, “Yes, that one
[online library databases] I have used, but usually when it is required... like I'm required
to look up research material through a database.”
Findings from a thematic analysis of student interview data suggest that many
undergraduate students (n=12, 66.7%) will select Google as their preferred information
resource when they are not required to use the library’s online resources to complete their
course assignments. Student interview comments suggest Google is valued over the
library for its convenience, familiarity, and ease of use. In response to a question
regarding why many students gravitate towards Google over the library for their
academic information seeking, student PS12 (University 2) explained,

109

Oh, because it is easier. I mean, I think that's it. I feel like they understand it right
away or maybe even they’ve been using Google since, I don't know, how long ...
basically their entire life ... They're making it easier so people can just understand
and get it right away. Whereas, obviously a lot of universities' search engines and
resources are not going to be like Google exactly. So, you just need to learn how
to use and then figure it out. But, I don't feel like people always want to use it
because it might be considered harder.
Similarly, student PS8 (University1) mused,
Yeah. I think kids our age or like the generation know how to search for stuff on
their own, just having been growing up with it. It doesn't mean that library
databases are obsolete or anything, but I just think it is easier and more innate to
people our age to just find answers on their own and know where to look. … if
you just can find stuff online on your own really quickly or it's easier to just to
search online on your own, there's really no use going to the library just to search
more.
Group differences are present with respect to use of library resources.
To assess the truth of Proposition 2, “Group differences exist among
undergraduate students with respect to their utilization of academic library resources,”
one-way ANOVAs and post hoc comparisons (where applicable) were conducted to
determine if and where group differences exist for both in-person and online library
usage. Demographic factors assessed include university, first generation student,
attendance at a library instruction class, gender, race, academic major, GPA, family
income, parent’s education, and language spoken at home. Group differences for age,
enrollment status, and international student status were not calculated, as the sample sizes
in these groups fell below the minimum power threshold (0.80) previously calculated a
priori using a G*Power analysis. Additionally, group differences with respect to race
were analyzed only for White (Caucasian), Black/African American, and Asian/Native
110

Hawaiian/Pacific Islander groups, as the sample sizes in the other racial subgroups for
this study (White (Hispanic/Latino), American Indian/Alaskan Native, and Two or More
Races) were too small to yield reliable results. Statistical findings suggest group
differences do, indeed, exist for undergraduate students with respect to their frequency of
use of the library in-person and online, particularly related to attendance at a library
instruction session, race, family income, and academic major. Significant ANOVA
findings are reported below.
Statistical analysis of the quantitative survey data suggest that prior attendance at
a library instruction session may be an important factor in a student’s frequency of using
either the library’s in-person or online resources. Findings from one-way ANOVA
analysis suggest frequency of in-person library visits differed significantly, though with a
small effect, based upon whether a student attended 0, 1, or 2 or more library instruction
sessions (F(2,1133) = 7.601, p =.001, ηp2 =.013). LSD post hoc analysis indicated that
undergraduate students who had attended two or more library information literacy
sessions visited the library in-person significantly more often than those who had
attended one library class (p =.032) or no classes (p < .001).
Similarly, while the overall trends in data suggest that students will gravitate
towards Google over the library if given the choice, Welch’s adjusted one-way ANOVA
analysis revealed that undergraduate students’ use of online library resources varied
significantly, with a moderate effect size, depending upon whether a student had attended
0, 1, or 2 or more library instruction classes (F(2,613.962) = 31.646, p < .001, ηp2 = .051).
(The assumption of homogeneity of variance was violated for this factor, thus Welch’s F111

ratio is reported.) Games-Howell post-hoc comparisons across groups indicated that
undergraduate students who had attended two or more library information literacy
sessions utilized the library’s online resources significantly more often than those who
had attended one library class (p < .001) or no classes (p < .001). Individuals who had
attended one library information literacy session were also significantly more likely to
utilize the library’s online resources than those who had not attended a session (p =.003).
One student interviewee, PS12 (University 2), who noted that she had attended two or
more library information sessions, explained,
Well, in the beginning we were required to for my courses just because as we've
been told, Google obviously is not going to be giving you scholarly or credible
sources and they're just saying, you know, if you are going to be writing research
in the future, you should be using credible sources and resources, and so ... In the
beginning it was just kind of a training thing and now most of the time if I'm, like,
writing research papers for a class, I guess go to the library … Well I guess just
because I've always been told that's where it's... you know, the more credible
source. Having a library database... The library is full of research and put those
articles out there and I guess ever since high school teachers have told me, "Don't
just Google it. Don't just do this. You're not going to be finding credible sources."
Findings from one-way ANOVA tests also revealed that significant differences
among racial groups exist, though with a small effect, with respect to both in-person (F(2,
711)

= 11.429, p < .001, ηp2 =.031) and online library usage (F(2,720) = 7.467, p =.001, ηp2

=.020). Only data representing students who reported their race as White (Caucasian),
Asian/Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, and Black/African American were included in
this analysis. LSD post hoc comparisons revealed that Black/African American students
(p < .001) and Asian/Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander students (p < .001) visited the
library in-person with significantly greater frequency than did their White (Caucasian)
112

peers. Similarly, LSD analysis revealed that Black/African American students utilized the
online library resources significantly more often than did White (Caucasian) (p < .001)
and Asian/Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (p =.004) students.
Using ANOVA analysis, a significant group difference was also noted between
first generation and non-first generation students, though with a small effect size (F(1,1162)
= 24.087, p < .001, ηp2 = .020) with first generation students using the online library
resources with significantly greater frequency than non-first generation students.
Likewise, Welch’s adjusted one-way ANOVA analysis revealed a significant group
difference among family income groups with respect to use of library online resources,
with a small effect size (F(4,333.764) = 6.466, p < .001, ηp2 = .027). (The assumption of
homogeneity of variance was violated for this factor, thus the Welch F-ratio is reported.)
Games-Howell post-hoc comparisons across income groups revealed that students who
reported their family incomes to be $20,000 - $34,999/year utilized the library’s online
resources significantly more often than those who reported their family incomes as
$100,000/year or above (p =.006).
Finally, Welch’s adjusted one-way ANOVA analysis revealed significant group
differences among academic majors, though with a small effect size, with respect to their
frequency of use of library online resources (F(4,333.764) = 6.466, p < .001, ηp2 = .035).
(The assumption of homogeneity of variance was violated for this factor, thus the Welch
F-ratio is reported.) Games-Howell post-hoc analysis revealed that Arts/Humanities
majors reported utilizing the library’s online library resources with significantly greater
frequency than did students in STEM (p < .001) or Business (p < .001) related majors.
113

Likewise, students majoring in Social Sciences utilized online library resources with
significantly greater frequency than those majoring in Business (p =.014) or STEM
related fields (p =.027).
Students Need Information Related to Campus Environments and Assignments
To answer Research Question 2, “What are the social cognitive needs of
successful students?” librarians, university enrollment and retention officials, and
undergraduate students responded to a series of interview questions relating to what types
of everyday life and academic information students need in order to thrive and be
successful at their universities. Findings suggest that the most pressing everyday life
information needs of university students relate to understanding what services are
available to them and knowing how to navigate the campus infrastructure. From an
academic standpoint, findings suggest undergraduate students not only require
information to complete their academic research/writing assignments, but frequently seek
information from online resources to help them complete their regularly assigned
homework.
Students need information about navigating campus services.
Everyday life information seeking consists of collecting materials to help answer
information needs that arise during the course of one's daily life (Savolainen, 1995).
There was general consensus among the three types of interview participants (enrollment
and retention officers, n=3, 100%; librarians, n=5, 62.5%; undergraduate students, n=6,
33.3%) that students may benefit from more information about how to navigate their
environments, including campus services and university infrastructure. One enrollment
114

and retention official, R2 (University 1) explained, “Well, the life information that they
need is really how to transact business, and I'm not just referring to financial, with the
university. What's our culture...? What's our structure...?” Going into further detail, R1
(University 2) elaborated,
I think the biggest thing is maybe understanding the ... campus resources and how
to contact them. … Being able to find, like, the right resource or the right thing.
So, if I have test anxiety or if I don't know how to take notes or if I am having
difficulty with reading comprehension or if it understanding microeconomics
theory specifically, like ... I think being able to adequately assess what it is that
they are needing support in and who to go to for that, is a big thing too.
Along a similar vein, librarians noted that many students have directional and
navigational information needs related to their everyday lives on a university campus.
Librarian L5 (University 1) noted,
I would say that a lot of them, in my perspective, have on their minds ... you
know... time management, thinking through transportation issues, trying to figure
out institution level access, like, How am I going to get to financial aid and back
to class and where's this office and where's that office?
Findings from a thematic analysis of student interviewee data further suggest that
many students may be unaware of the support services that are available to them and
others are confused as to how to navigate the bureaucracy of higher education. Freshman
student S2 (University 3) explained that one of the most stressful things she has
encountered since arriving at the university has been trying to understand what resources
are available to her and how to access them. She explained,

115

I think a big thing for me was I didn't know where a lot of stuff was as far as the
more helpful stuff that was available to you. Like no one ever told me where the
speaking and writing center was. I never got, you know, a tour of the library or
anything like that. I think, you know, stuff along those lines would be helpful
(S2).
Similarly, sophomore student PS16 (University 1) noted that one of the most stressful
things for her has been,
Probably trying to navigate the bureaucracy of things at the university. Like, if I
have an issue and I don't really know who I need to talk to, it takes like days for
me to actually end up getting the problem solved because it takes so long. I end
up just bouncing around between different offices.
Students need information to complete course assignments.
From an academic standpoint, information needs are largely centered on the
information students require to complete both their course research papers and regularly
assigned homework. Librarians (n=8, 100%) recognize that students need information
about how to find and evaluate resources for their academic research projects. Librarian
L7 (University 2) explained,
I think... not necessarily unique to this institution, but I think in some ways I think
that might be emphasized a little bit more here, is located in the understanding the
purpose of scholarly research, scholarly articles, just scholarly materials in
general. I think that for many students and I work particularly with first year
students you know, this may be something they haven't encountered before and
now they're coming in and it is expected that they understand the role of this type
of scholarship and how they should be engaging with it.

116

Likewise, librarian L1 noted,
So, a lot of students that I work with, especially in first year classes, are asked to
find reliable or credible sources for the purpose of a speech or a research paper. In
some classes, specifically English Composition, they are more likely to be asked
to find scholarly sources.
While librarians noted that students need to learn how to find and evaluate
information for their course research papers and speeches, students emphasized that they
spend a lot of time finding practical information, not necessarily associated with
traditional academic research, to help them complete their homework assignments.
Students’ responses to interview questions about the most common types of information
they look up related to their course work varied. S1 (University 3) noted that he looks up
a lot of material related to biology or psychology, “I would say probably a lot of
definitions of words … that would be a big one ... a lot of kind of historical facts ... names
and dates and specific things.” PS1 (University 2) noted that much of what he researches
online relates to his political science coursework. He explained,
For the classes I'm in right now, lots of politically charged questions. I have to
look up lots of things like (inaudible) production, GDP, public policy, for my
global studies classes I have to ... Every week we talk about different issues that
affect the world like poverty and globalization and things like that. So it's all like
very... sometimes current events related and sometimes global issues kind of
related stuff (PS1).
Finally, PS9 (University 1) noted that he needs a variety of information that is available
online to complete his coursework. He explained that he looks up

117

… a lot of translation stuff for Russian. And then, with a lot of my criminology
courses it is a lot of looking up, like, statistics on US crime rates and
demographics and comparing that against international statistics on the same
subjects (PS9).
Top educational barriers include issues with time management and finances.
Closely related to academic and everyday life information needs, potential
barriers to students’ academic success warrant consideration. These barriers could
conceivably be considered information needs (either everyday life or academic) if not
properly addressed. Thus, to ascertain the truth to Proposition 3 “There are common
educational barriers among undergraduate students,” survey participants were presented a
list of 20 potential educational barriers and asked to rate, on a 7-point scale, the
likelihood that they would encounter each barrier while enrolled at the university. In
addition, librarians, enrollment and retention officers, and undergraduate student
interview participants were asked to respond to questions relating to the greatest stressors
they perceive undergraduate students encounter. Interview participants were also asked to
speculate about the key reasons they believe some students drop out of their universities.
Of the four Educational Barriers subscales identified for this study, undergraduate
students feel that they are most likely to encounter feeling Underprepared to Manage
Academic Rigor (M=3.96, SD=1.58) and issues related to Finances (M= 3.93, SD=1.69).
Lower subscale means for issues related to Lack of Support from Others (M=2.61,
SD=1.31) and Social Belonging/Mental Health (M=3.55, SD=1.65) suggest
undergraduate students expect that they are less likely to encounter these challenges.

118

Particularly noteworthy among the individual scale items of the four subscales,
Money Problems (M=4.71, SD=2.05) and Difficulty Managing Time (M=4.74, SD=1.91)
ranked at the top of the potential barriers list. Both qualitative and quantitative results
also suggest many students expect to encounter feelings of “not being prepared enough”
or “not knowing how to study well” (M=3.93, SD=2.02), while others anticipate
struggles with “loneliness” (M=3.81, SD=2.14), “not fitting in” (M=3.06, SD=2.01), and
“mental health issues” (M=3.74, SD=2.23). These findings are detailed in Table 8.

Difficulties managing time is a common challenge for undergraduate students.
Findings from a thematic analysis of interview data further corroborate the
quantitative findings which suggest time management is a challenge for undergraduate
students (librarians, n=7, 87.5%; enrollment and retention officers, n=3, 100%; and
undergraduate students, n=10, 55.6%). As students transition to independent living for
the first time, learning to manage their time can be particularly challenging. Librarian L2
(University 3) explained,
I think probably time management is a concern and just, you know, kind of the
whole idea of suddenly being solely responsible for, you know, your own time
and how you, you know, how they spend time doing various things. I think that is
hard. I get the sense that a lot of students are doing that for the first time. You
know, they've never really had to prioritize their time like they are being asked to
do all of a sudden, so I think that's a really big thing.
Enrollment and retention officer, R1 (University 2), also noted the difficulty students
encounter when transitioning to the university and learning to manage their time. She
explained,
So then they come into this campus and for the first time they have to learn how
to study and they have to learn how to manage their time and they have to learn ...
the importance of class attendance. … basic things like sleep hygiene and eating
healthy and making exercise and club involvement and just balancing their time, I
think is a huge stressor for students (R1).
Senior student, PS5 (University 3), explained how easy it can be to become
distracted with respect to time. She recalled,
I came here my freshman year and everybody told me, "Oh, college is so hard, so
different." And I just don't think it starts off that way. Like, when I ... was in high
120

school and when I came to college I had less time in class and I was no longer
working and I had a lot of free time and the people I was around also had that, and
we took that as meaning it was easier. And so, by meaning it was easier, we just
spent less time doing it and then kind of like slipped into like a place of... just
kind of like failing classes without knowing it. Because, it was like, "Well I have
plenty of time" and then you get so comfortable in a place that you forget…(PS5).
Another senior student, PS11 (University 1), further explained,
I didn't feel like I couldn't keep up or the information was particularly hard [when
I first started out as a freshman], but the format took me a little while where you
would show up for a lecture and then all homework and stuff was done on your
own time and there was lots more kind of personal responsibility for figuring out
assignments and stuff.
Issues related to finances are commonplace for undergraduate students.
Findings from qualitative analysis of the interview data from librarians (n=4,
50.0%), enrollment and retention officers (n=3, 100%), and undergraduate students (n=4,
22.2%) lend further credence to the quantitative findings that suggest financial issues are
common for many students and, when unmet, can potentially lead to student drop-out.
Enrollment and retention officer, R3 (University 3), explained,
I think finance plays a large role with a lot, depending on the student you're
talking about. We're 50% Pell. … [B]ut it's outside of the financial aid. Financial
aid is covering their tuition and fees and room and board, close enough for room
and board. But, there are still the pressures of being a poor student in the outside
world. … So, finances are always on their minds somewhere in this equation.
Enrollment and retention officer, R1 (University 2), further explained,
For my students in particular, our financial resources are really critical for them.
… So understanding how to find the job that they are looking for and how to
121

apply and then how to put together an application package and who to contact
about that...
Librarians also noted the practical challenges faced by students related to their
finances. Librarian L1 (University 3) explained,
One other big thing that I hear a lot about is financial stress, trying to find a job,
especially for incoming freshman, to be really stressful. … I know that financial
issues are a huge reason ... so... no longer being eligible for financial aid is a big
reason that we lose some students.
Undergraduate students also recognized the challenges many students face with
regard to their finances, including financial aid. S2 (University 3) noted that her freshman
roommate dropped out of the university because, “She did not do well in her classes and
she failed four of them and so her financial aid didn't go through and she could not
afford to go here.” Likewise, freshman student, PS14 (University 3), acknowledged the
harsh learning curve that many students experience with regard to their financial aid. A
friend of hers dropped out of the university because he lost his financial aid. She
explained,
What I've heard from other people is they try and take like 15 credits or
something so if you drop one class you are still a full time. So, he was taking 12
credits and I think he dropped a lab, failed out of the lab or something, so he just
lost [his financial aid] (PS14).
Many students feel underprepared for rigors of university coursework.
Findings from analysis of the quantitative survey and qualitative interview data
(student interviews, n=12, 66.7%, librarians, n=3, 37.5%; enrollment and retention
122

officers, n=2, 66.7%) also suggest that many undergraduate students feel underprepared
for the rigors of academic coursework at their universities. Though survey responses to
questions relating to “not being smart enough” (M=3.92, SD=1.94) and “not knowing
how to study well” (M=3.93, SD=2.02) yielded average ratings, interview results suggest
these issues may be paramount for many students. Sophomore interviewee, PS13
(University 3), explained,
I feel like some of it I was prepared for, but there was others that... I don't know...
Like science, I took an anatomy class and I was not prepared at all for that class.
… I wasn't used to a class where you basically took four tests and that was your
grade. So if you did terrible on one then you're kind of in trouble from the
beginning. … After my first semester I got put on academic probation and I had to
take a class so I figured out all of the little things that can help you and all that.
Freshman student, PS1 (University 2), further explained,
It's a lot harder in college ... In high school you have lots of opportunities, you
know, to get points in class, or if you had a bad exam or something there were
other ways you could make up your grade. But, in college it's a lot more scarce for some classes more than others. It's like very ... You have to perform at a high
level constantly in some classes than ... I would have before.
Librarians have also noted that some students are not yet ready for university
level academics. Librarian L8 (University 2) noted that, “Some students can’t cut it.”
Librarian L4 (University 3) further explained, “[T]here are definitely barriers involved
with academics and also with life and so I think some students need a lot more support
and they need more support than our campus can provide at this point, the way things
are set up.”

123

Many students feel that university life is a poor fit.
Closely related to feelings of being underprepared, findings from student (n=5,
27.8%) and enrollment and retention officer (n=2, 66.7%) interview data suggest that
university study and the collegiate environment may not be the right fit for many
students. For some, feelings of “poor fit” may stem from uncertainty or indecision about
their academic majors or career paths. Undergraduate student, PS4 (University 1),
explained that university study may seem to be a poor fit for some students, though with
more in-depth advising, these individuals may be able to find their place and persist. She
explained
I think it was really like school wasn't their style and their parents saying, “Hey,
you need to go to school. You have to go to school," but it wasn't what they
wanted to do. … I think if they would have given them more options than just
saying, "Hey, this might not be your major, but what if they would find something
they would enjoy learning about rather than like gen ed's” (PS4).
Enrollment and retention officer, R1 (University 2), further explained that there
are many factors that come into play for students who may be questioning if university
study is the right fit for them. She explained,
We have lots of students who have poor academic performance and really pull out
of it and the ones who aren't doing that, oftentimes it's not adjusting those factors
appropriately. And probably with a lot of them, it's that they are persisting
towards a major that they don't seem to be demonstrating the strength in, so they
just... particularly engineering. So, they continue to take STEM coursework and
retake courses and do grade replacement and kind of be averse to the conversation
about alternative plans and so ... We end up losing them because they haven't
taken (inaudible) other options to consider on our campus (R1).

124

While some students question their academic fit with their major or university,
others struggle with finding their “social fit” or developing a sense of social belonging.
Freshman student, PS14 (University 3), described the challenges she faced trying to
become involved in campus life. She explained, “Socially I wasn't ready, but yeah... Like,
they have that thing the first week of school on (inaudible) where they have all the clubs
and you can sign up. But like, if you don't go to that then you don't really hear about any
of the clubs” (PS14). Similarly, sophomore student, PS4 (University 1), described her
challenges in feeling connected on a large university campus. She noted,
It was particularly difficult for me, just because I came from a town where I knew
everybody and everybody knew me to a place where I knew absolutely not one
single person and that was kind of hard to adjust to, you know, after 18 years of
knowing people, so that was really hard for me (PS4).
Enrollment and retention officer, R2 (University 1), explained that a critical
component of a student’s success lies in his or her ability to find their social niche. She
noted,
[I]t's the ability to make the transition from being at home to being in college to
engaging and feeling connected to the university and they actually fit in ... That
they develop a circle of friends and that they begin to be engaged with their
academic program. I think those students … are much more successful (R2).
R1 (University 2) further explained that finding one’s social fit can be critical to their
overall success. She noted, “I think... especially on our campus I think a lot of what I see
is just like social belongingness. You know, feeling like they belong at the university, that
they have a niche that they fit in that...” (R1).
125

Group differences exist with respect to academic barriers.
To assess the truth of Proposition 4 “Group differences exist among
undergraduate students with respect to their common educational barriers” one-way
ANOVA and post hoc analyses were conducted for each of the four Educational Barriers
subscales identified for this study: (1) Support from Others, (2) Financial Related Issues,
(3) Academic Readiness, and (4) Social Belonging and Mental Health. Group differences
were assessed for all demographic variables noted in this study, with the exception of
age, enrollment status, and international student status which were not evaluated due to
small sample sizes in some of the subgroups. Statistical findings suggest group
differences do exist among undergraduate student groups with respect to the types of
educational barriers they expect to encounter. Particularly noteworthy are group
differences based upon race, family income, GPA, and academic major. Statistically
significant ANOVA findings, including corresponding effect size (ηp2) and power (1-β)
are outlined in Table 9. While findings from many of the ANOVA tests support
Proposition 4 that there are common educational barriers among student demographic
groups, those with questionably high power (1-β = .9 or above) and extremely small
effect sizes (ηp2 < .03) suggest that, in these instances, the statistical test may have been
overly sensitive and the significant mean differences may have resulted from the large
sample sizes. Further details regarding all significant ANOVAs (p < .05) are discussed
below.

*Only demographic variables with statistically significant ANOVAs are listed.
** Welch’s adjusted F-ratio reported due to violations of ANOVA assumption of
homogeneity of variance.
“Support from others” varies depending upon race, income, GPA, and
language.
Statistical analysis of the quantitative survey data revealed that students’
perceptions of feeling “supported from others” varies according to their race, family
income, GPA, and language spoken at home. In particular, Welch’s adjusted one-way
ANOVA results revealed that a significant group difference was present among racial
groups, with a moderate effect size, as it relates to feeling supported by others (F(2,140.587)
= 15.533, p < .001, ηp2 =.057). (Assumptions of homogeneity of variance were violated
127

for race groups, thus Welch’s adjusted F-ratio is reported.) Games-Howell post hoc
comparisons suggest White (Caucasian) students feel significantly more supported by
others than do Black/African American students (p < .001) and Asian/Native
Hawaiian/Pacific Islander students (p < .001). Though not entered into the ANOVA
calculations due to small sample size, the mean rating for White (Spanish, Hispanic,
Latino) students (n=53, M=2.91, SD=1.36) relating to “support from others” was also
noticeably higher than that identified for White (Caucasian) students (n=488, M=2.36,
SD=1.15).
Welch’s adjusted one-way ANOVA analyses also revealed that students with
higher GPAs felt significantly more “supported by others” than their peers who reported
lower GPAs, though with a small effect size (F(3,185.498) = 4.779, p =.003, ηp2 = .020).
(Assumptions of homogeneity of variance were violated across GPA groups for this
factor, thus Welch’s adjusted F-ratio is reported.) Games-Howell post hoc comparisons
revealed that students reporting a GPA of 3.6 – 4.0 reported feeling significantly more
supported than those who reported GPAs of 2.6 – 3.0 (p =.021) or 2.5 or below (p
=.039).
ANOVA analyses further revealed that significant group differences were present
among reported family income groups with respect to feeling “supported by others,”
though with a small effect size (F(5,246.155) = 2.900, p =.015, ηp2 =.023). (Assumptions of
homogeneity of variance were violated across income groups for this factor, thus Welch’s
adjusted F-ratio is reported.) Games-Howell post hoc comparisons revealed that students
in the highest income group ($100,000/year or above) felt significantly more supported
128

by others than their peers who reported their family incomes to be $35,000 - $49,999 (p
=.018). Finally, ANOVA analysis revealed that students who speak English as the
primary language in their homes reported that they felt “supported by others” to a
significantly greater degree than the students who speak a language other than English in
their homes, though with a very small effect size (F(1,811x) = 15.892, p < .001, ηp2 =.019).
Anticipation of “financial issues” varies among many demographic groups.
Students’ expectations that they will experience “financial issues” also varied
significantly based upon a variety of demographic factors including family income,
parent’s education, GPA, university, first generation college student status, race, and
academic major. Not surprisingly, ANOVA analysis revealed that perceptions of
“financial issues” differed significantly based upon students’ reported family income,
with a large effect size (F(5,657) = 20.758, p < .001, ηp2 =.136). LSD post hoc analysis
revealed that students from families in the highest income group ($100,000/year or
above) reported that they anticipated “financial issues” to a significantly lower degree
than did their peers in all other income groups (less than $20,000/year, p < .001; $20,000
- $34,999/year, p < .001; $35,000 - $49,999/year, p < .001; $50,000 - $74,999/year, p <
.001; $75,000 - $99,999/year, p =.022). Likewise, students from families in the second
highest income group ($75,000 - $99,999) reported that they anticipated “financial
issues” to a significantly lesser degree than their peers in all other lower income groups
(less than $20,000/year, p < .001; $20,000 - $34,999/year, p < .001; $35,000 $49,999/year, p < .001; $50,000 - $74,999/year, p < .002). Finally, those in the middle
income group ($50,000 - $74,999/year) reported that they anticipated “financial issues” at
129

a significantly lower degree than their peers with family incomes of less than
$20,000/year (p =.002).
Perhaps closely associated to family income, one-way ANOVA analysis revealed
that students’ expectations that they will encounter “financial issues” also differed
significantly based upon their parents’ highest level of education, with a small to
moderate effect size (F(5,765) = 7.967, p < .001, ηp2 =.049). LSD post hoc comparisons
revealed that students whose parents held an associate’s degree or below were
significantly more likely to anticipate “financial issues” than those for whom their
parents’ highest level of education was a bachelor’s degree or above. More specifically,
students whose parents’ highest level of education was a high school diploma or
equivalent were significantly more likely to anticipate “financial issues” than students
whose parents who held master’s (p =.003) or doctoral level degrees (p < .001).
Similarly, students whose parents attended some college but did not earn a degree were
also significantly more likely to anticipate “financial issues” than students whose parents
earned a bachelor’s (p =.031), master’s (p < .001), or doctoral degree (p < .001).
Individuals whose parent’s earned an associate’s degree were significantly more likely to
anticipate “financial issues” than those whose parents earned master’s (p =.038) or
doctoral degrees (p =.002). Finally, students whose parents earned a bachelor’s degree
were significantly more likely to anticipate “financial issues” than those whose parents
had earned a master’s (p < .003) or doctoral degree (p < .001).
One-way ANOVAs also revealed significant group differences among student
GPA groups with respect to their expectation that they will encounter “financial issues,”
130

with a small to moderate effect size (F(3,807) = 15.280, p < .001, ηp2 =.054). LSD post hoc
analysis revealed that students reporting high GPAs were significantly less likely to
anticipate “financial issues” than their peers with lower GPAs. More specifically,
students reporting a GPA of 3.6-4.0 were significantly less likely to anticipate “financial
issues” than students in all lower GPA reporting groups (2.5 or below, p < 001; 2.6-3.0, p
< .001; 3.1-3.5, p =.012). Similarly, students reporting a GPA of 3.1-3.5 were
significantly less likely to anticipate “financial issues” than those reporting lower GPAs
(2.5 or below, p < .001; 2.6-3.0, p =.003).
One-way ANOVA analysis further revealed that students’ anticipation that they
will experience “financial issues” differed significantly based upon their university
affiliation, though with a small effect size (F(2,825) = 11.293, p < .001, ηp2 =.027). LSD
post hoc comparisons revealed that students enrolled at both University 1 (p =.010) and
University 3 (p < .001) were significantly more likely to anticipate “financial issues” than
students enrolled at University 2.
Findings from one-way ANOVA analysis further suggest that students in different
racial groups differed significantly with respect to their anticipation of “financial issues,”
with a small effect size (F(2,700) = 12.198, p < .001, ηp2=.034). LSD post hoc analysis
revealed that Black/African American students expected to encounter “financial issues”
to a significantly greater degree than White (Caucasian) (p < .001) and Asian/Native
Hawaiian/Pacific Islander students (p < .001). While not included in the ANOVA
calculations due to small sample size, the mean rating for White (Spanish, Hispanic,
Latino) students (n=54, M=4.27, SD=1.72) with respect to anticipating financial issues
131

was also noticeably higher than that identified for White (Caucasian) students (n=492,
M=3.45, SD=1.62). Likewise, first generation students reported that they anticipated
“financial issues” to a significantly greater degree than did non-first generation students,
though with a very small effect size (F(1,816) = 16.605, p < .001, ηp2=.020).
Finally, one-way ANOVA analysis revealed significant group differences among
academic majors with respect to their anticipation of “financial issues” (F(4,714) = 4.775, p
=.001, ηp2=.026), though with a small effect size. LSD post hoc comparisons suggest that
students pursuing STEM majors expected to encounter “financial issues” to a
significantly lesser degree than students majoring in Arts/Humanities (p = .002), Social
Sciences (p =.021), and Health related fields (p =.024). Likewise, students pursuing
Business related majors anticipated “financial issues” to a significantly lesser degree than
those majoring in Arts/Humanities (p =.001), Social Sciences (p =.009), and Health
related fields (p =.01).
“Academic readiness” varies depending upon GPA and race.
One-way ANOVA analyses were conducted across demographic variables with
respect to students’ anticipation that they would encounter issues related to their
“academic readiness.” Overall findings suggest that significant group differences exist for
this measure across GPA groups, with a large effect size (F(3,804) = 29.981, p < .001, ηp2
=.101), and race groups (as reported by Welch’s adjusted F-ratio due to violations of
homogeneity), with a small effect size (F(2,147.023) = 6.822, p =.001, ηp2=.001). More
specifically, LSD post hoc comparisons revealed that students with GPAs of 3.6-4.0 were
significantly less likely to anticipate issues related to their “academic readiness” than
132

their peers in all lower GPA groups (2.5 or below, p < .001; 2.6-3.0, p < .001; 3.1-3.5, p
< .001). Likewise, students in the second highest GPA group, 3.1-3.5, reported that they
anticipated issues related to their “academic readiness” to a significantly lesser degree
than students in the lower GPA groups (2.5 or below, p =.002; 2.6-3.0, p < .001). With
respect to race, findings from Games-Howell post hoc analyses suggest White
(Caucasian) students anticipated fewer issues related to their “academic readiness” than
their Black/African American (p =.008) and Asian/Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander
peers (p =.037). Though White (Spanish, Hispanic, Latino) students were not entered in
the ANOVA calculations due to small sample size, the mean ratings for this racial
subgroup (n=53, M=4.24, SD=1.77) suggest these students also anticipated more issues
relating to their academic readiness than White (Caucasian) students (n=494, M=3.77,
SD=1.51).
“Social belonging” varies according to academic major.
Finally, one-way ANOVA analyses were conducted across demographic variables
with respect to students’ expectations that they will encounter issues related to their
“social belonging.” The only statistically significant finding revealed from this analysis
related to academic major, with a small effect size (F(4,710) = 5.550, p < .001, ηp2=.030).
More specifically, LSD post hoc analysis revealed that students pursuing Business majors
anticipated significantly fewer issues related to “social belonging” than did their peers
majoring in Arts/Humanities (p < .001), Social Sciences (p =.005), and STEM (p =.006).
Further, students majoring in STEM and Health related fields anticipated significantly

133

fewer barriers related to “social belonging” than their peers majoring Arts/Humanities
(STEM, p =.006; Health, p =.002).
Social cognitive factors and educational barriers are predictive of online
library use.
To assess the truth of Proposition 5, “Undergraduate students’ contextual
background and social cognitive factors are predictive of their utilization of academic
library resources” mean scores were calculated for educational barriers and social
cognitive factors and then entered into stepwise multiple regression analyses in order to
predict both in-person and online use of the academic library. Mean ratings for the
educational barriers subscales suggest students anticipate near average levels of issues
related to their finances (M=3.93, SD=1.69) and feeling underprepared for the academic
rigor of university study (M=3.96, SD=1.58), with below average expectations that they
will experience challenges related to their social belonging/mental health (M=3.55,
SD=1.65) and feeling supported by others (M=2.61, SD=1.31). SCCT factors including
academic self-efficacy (M=6.40, SD=0.95), outcome expectations (M=6.02, SD=1.09),
and performance goals (M=5.50, SD=1.65) were also entered into the regression
analyses. Each of these SCCT factors received above average ratings on a 7-point scale,
suggesting students, in the aggregate, are determined to persist in their studies and
graduate (performance goals), anticipate that their persistence through graduation will
have positive consequences for achieving their future career or academic goals (outcome
expectations), and are confident that they will be successful in their academic work
(academic self-efficacy). Descriptive statistics for the SCCT factors are outlined in Table
10. (See Table 8 for descriptive statistics relating to educational barriers).

The four educational barriers subscale factors and the three SCCT factors were
entered into the stepwise multiple regression analysis to predict in-person library use. No
factors entered into the model at step 1 of the analysis, thus there was no statistically
significant model for any of the variables, given the stepwise criteria (Probability-of-Fto-enter <= .050, Probability-of-F-to-remove >= .100). Thus, the truth of Proposition 5
with respect to in-person library use was found to be false.
Likewise, a step-wise regression analysis was conducted using the four
educational barriers factors and three SCCT variables to predict online library use. The
prediction model contained three predictors ("social belonging/mental health," "academic
readiness," and "performance goals") and was reached in three steps. The model was
statistically significant (F(3,654) = 4.812, p < .01) and accounted for approximately 2% of
the variance of online library use (R2=.022, Adjusted R2=.017). Thus, higher expectations
of "social belonging/mental health issues," lower expectations of "academic readiness
issues," and higher values of "performance goals" lead to higher values for Online
Library Use. "Support from others" (t=1.928, p = .054), "financial issues" (t=.972, p =
.332), "outcome expectations" (t=.020, p =.948), and "academic self-efficacy" (t=1.146,

135

p =.252) did not enter into the equation at Step 3 of the analysis. Thus, the regression
equation for predicting Online Library Use is:
Predicted Online Library Use = 2.169 +.107(Social Belonging Issues) - .080(Academic
Readiness Issues) + .062(Performance Goals)
Social cognitive factors and educational barriers are predictive of GPA
range.
To assess the truth of Proposition 6, “Undergraduate students’ contextual
background and social cognitive factors are predictive of their overall academic success,”
the four educational barriers factors, “support from others," "financial issues,", "academic
readiness," and “social belonging/mental health” (see Table 8) and the SCCT variables
"performance goals,” “outcome expectations,” and “academic self-efficacy” (see Table
10) were entered into a stepwise multiple regression analysis to predict GPA. The
prediction model contained five predictors (academic self-efficacy, outcome
expectations, academic readiness issues, social belonging/mental health issues, and
financial issues) and was reached in five steps. The model was statistically significant
(F(5,638) = 36.707, p < .001) and accounted for approximately 22% of the variance of
GPA (R2=.223, Adjusted R2=.217). Higher values of "academic self-efficacy,” lower
values for “outcome expectations,” lower values for "academic readiness issues,” higher
values for “social belonging/mental issues” and lower values for “financial issues” were
found to significantly predict higher GPA scores. "Support from others" (t=-.830, p
=.407) and “performance goals” (t=-.907, p =.365) did not enter into the equation at Step
5 of the analysis. Thus, the regression equation for predicting Online Library Use was:
136

Predicted GPA = 1.929 + .409(Acad Self-Efficacy) - .161(Outcome Expectations) .121(Academic Readiness Issues) + .093(Social Belonging Issues) - .075(Financial
Issues)
Search Engines are Most Preferred Information Seeking Resource
To answer Research Question 3, “How do undergraduate students prefer to meet
their information needs?” survey participants were provided with lists of different types
of information resources and technology tools and asked to rate the frequency that they
consult these resources first for everyday life information seeking and then again for
academic/course related research using a 7-point Likert type scale (1=never/7=almost
always). Additionally, librarians and undergraduate student interview participants
responded to a series of questions relating to information resource and technology tool
preferences for undergraduate students. Findings from the quantitative analysis of the
survey data and the qualitative analysis of the interview data overwhelmingly suggest that
Google is the top choice for both everyday life and academic information seeking.
Preferences for technology tools, however, seem to differ depending upon whether an
undergraduate student is conducting everyday life or academic research. These findings
are discussed in further depth below.
Google is the preferred resource for everyday life and academic research.
To assess the truth of Proposition 7, “There are commonalities among
undergraduate students with respect to the types of information resources they prefer to
use for information seeking,” survey participants were provided with a list of information
resources and asked to rate the frequency that they consulted these resources for everyday
life (23 items) and academic/course related research (25 items). Additionally, qualitative
137

data collected from librarian and undergraduate student interviews were analyzed for
common trends related to information resource preferences. For both everyday life and
academic information seeking, “Google or other Search Engines” received the highest
overall rating based upon descriptive analysis of quantitative data. With respect to
everyday life information seeking, the mean rating for “Google or other Search Engines”
was 6.31 (SD=1.03), with 82.1% of the respondents rating this option as a “6” or “7
(almost always)” on a 7-point scale. This was followed by friends/family (M=5.30,
SD=1.55, 53.6% rated as “6” or “7”), non-university websites (M=5.25, SD=1.62, 52.3%
rated as “6” or “7”), smart phone browsers (M=5.10, SD=1.84, 51.8% rated as “6” or
“7”), and Wikipedia (M=4.76, SD=1.80, 40.5% rated as “6” or “7”).
Likewise, survey participants rated “Google or other Search Engines” as the most
frequently consulted resource for seeking information to complete their course-related
assignments (M=6.02, SD=1.29), with 73.8% of respondents providing a rating of “6” or
“7 (almost always).” Tied for second as the most frequently consulted information
resources for course research were course readings (M=5.87, SD=1.27, 67.4% rated as
“6” or “7”) and university websites (M=5.87, SD=1.27, 24.0% rated as “6” or “7”).
Professors are another commonly consulted resource for academic information seeking
(M=5.15, SD=1.55, 46.9% rating a “6” or “7), followed closely by non-university
websites (M=4.90, SD=1.95, 47.3% rating a “6” or “7”), and library online databases
(M=4.89, SD=1.97, 46.7% rated as “6” or “7”). Further details relating to the full list of
both everyday life and course-related information resource preferences are outlined in

Analysis of qualitative data collected from interviews with librarians and
undergraduate students further corroborate the findings which suggest that Google is the
most preferred information resource, particularly relating to everyday life information
139

seeking (librarians, n=6, 75.0%; undergraduate students, n=16, 88.9%). Librarian L7
(University 2) shared her perception that Google is the top choice for undergraduate
students’ for all types of information seeking,
So I would say hands down Google and the sources found through Google. … I
think Google is the first place and I think the reason is that it's easy to use. I mean
I think for all of the pitfalls that we think of that Google is having in terms of
academic research, you know their greatest strength is that they have mastered
that search interface, you know, both for undergraduates and for anybody in
general in their everyday lives. It's just a matter of it is very easy to use and they
really have it figured out, you know, that algorithm, that formula, to make it
functional.
In further support of this finding, librarian L8 (University 2) explained,
No question. We ask a question similar [in our information literacy classes in the
library] to that and, you know, it's a clicker question, "When I need information I
start with..." And Google is an answer and Wikipedia is an answer and the library
is an answer and I think my friends is answer. I think we have five different things
in there. And Google … we know this is going to happen … Google is the
number one answer in all classes. Sometimes it is 100% of the students.
While the majority of student interview participants (n=16, 88.9%) acknowledged
that Google was their most preferred resource for everyday life information seeking,
noticeably fewer student interviewees (n=7, 38.9%) indicated that they would first turn to
Google for their course-related research. Among those who turn first to Google,
regardless of the type of information being sought, senior PS8 (University 2) explained,
I think kids our age or like the generation know how to search for stuff on their
own, just having been growing up with it. It doesn't mean that library databases
are obsolete or anything, but I just think it is easier and more innate to people our
age to just find answers on their own and know where to look.
140

Other students acknowledged that while they may initially start with Google when
beginning their academic research, they will turn to the academic library’s online
resources once they have a sense of their topic. Sophomore student, PS12 (University 2),
explained,
Usually I would probably start on Google to get a basic idea of something I may
be interested in for like a more basic layout. And, if I want to pursue that as my
actual topic, then later I would get legitimate sources and information from actual
articles that are considered scholarly.
Junior student, PS9 (University 1), also noted, “… I use Google a lot for just looking up a
general idea of somewhere I can get the information. Or, there are certain online
databases that are really useful for other stuff, other parts of the information that I really
need.
However, comments from many student interview participants suggest their
choices of resources for course-related research are situationally dependent. While there
are times that undergraduate students may feel it is appropriate to start first with Google,
there are others times where it may make more sense for them to turn first to the assigned
course reading materials or online library materials. Junior student, PS2 (University 2),
shared her perspective,
I would definitely start out with the class resources, just notes and stuff like that.
That would be the first basics of it and then from there I'd probably go to Google
but if that is not really that reliable or depending on how big this research paper is
… then I would probably start going to the library and using the library resources
basically to find better articles and actual scholarly articles.

141

Thus, while findings from the quantitative survey data suggest undergraduate students
most frequently consult Google or other search engines when approaching a course
related research assignment, both quantitative and qualitative interview findings suggest
other more academically related resources such as professors, course assigned reading
materials, and academic library online resources play an important role for students in
their information seeking.
Technology tool preferences vary depending upon type of research.
To explore the truth of Proposition 8, “There are commonalities among
undergraduate students with respect to the types of technology they prefer to use for
information seeking,” undergraduate student survey participants were first asked to
indicate what types of technology devices they owned and then to rate the frequency with
which they used these technology devices to answer both everyday life and course-related
research questions during a typical week of the school year. Librarian and undergraduate
student interview participants also responded to questions related to student technology
tool preferences for both types of information seeking. Findings from analysis of both
quantitative and qualitative data overwhelmingly suggest that students most frequently
turn to their smartphones to answer questions that arise during their everyday lives, while
they most frequently utilize their laptops for course-related information seeking.
Survey participants were first asked to indicate which types of technology devices
they owned that could be utilized for information seeking via a checkbox response item.
Ownership of both laptops (n=821) and smartphones was nearly identical (n=814) among
survey participants, with ownership of tablets (n=361), desktop computers (n=142), cell
142

phone that is not a smartphone (n=43), and other (n=30) noticeably lower. These findings
are outlined in Table 12.

Survey participants were also asked to rate the frequency with which they use
these same technology devices to access the internet to answer questions that arise during
the course of their everyday lives as well as for their course-related assignments and
research papers (7-point scale, 1=never/7=almost always). For everyday life questions,
survey findings suggest students turn most frequently to their smartphones (M=6.63,
SD=0.99), followed closely by their laptops (M=6.45, SD=1.18). Means for usage of all
other devices for everyday life research were below average (Other, M=3.40, SD=2.39;
Tablet, M=3.36, SD=2.34; Work Desktop, M=3.36, SD=2.28; Library Desktop, M=2.89,
SD=1.90; Personal Desktop, M=2.39, SD=1.97). However, if students are seeking
information to complete their course-related assignments and research papers, survey
findings suggest they most frequently turn to their laptop computers (M=6.60, SD=1.07),
with smartphone usage falling next in line (M=4.41, SD=2.10), followed by desktop
computers in the library (M=3.34, SD=2.14), tablets (M=2.89, SD=2.19), desktop
143

computers in residence (M=2.48, SD=2.10), desktop computers at work (M=2.33,
SD=1.99, and other (M=2.82, SD=2.24). These findings are further outlined in Table 13.

Findings from thematic analysis of librarian interview data lend further support to
these findings which suggest choice of technology device varies depending upon the type
of information that is being sought. Librarian L4 (University 3) observed that for
everyday life questions, students seem to be using their smartphones, “That’s what I see a
lot. You know, if they have a question they’ll come up [to the reference desk] and show
me their phone and they’ll ask me.” Librarian L7 (University 2) explained that for
course-related research, she has noted that students are more likely to use their laptops,
explaining, “When I walk around [the library] that’s what I see and I think I see, just in
terms of articles, when they’re pulling up articles to read or just product their writing, I

144

think they just need to be on something that’s a little bit larger.” L1 (University 3) also
suspects that students are more inclined to use their laptops for conducting research
because the “… mobile interface for Google is great, but the mobile interfaces for a lot of
library stuff leaves something to be desired.”
Similarly, findings from the thematic analysis of undergraduate student interview
data lend credence to Phase II survey findings which suggest that while students most
frequently use their smartphones (n=9, 50.0%) for everyday life information seeking,
laptops are another popular choice. Student PS2 (University 2) explained that for daily
life questions, she will “… probably use my phone the most, but if I had my laptop or my
tablet, if I have that up then I’ll just use that. But I definitely use my phone more.”
Likewise, PS14 (University 3) explained, “The phone would be just like for a quick
question that I needed to answer and say if I had a more in-depth question then I would
use my laptop.”
The overwhelming majority of undergraduate student interview participants
(88.9%, n=16) indicated that laptops are the most preferred technology tool for courserelated information seeking. Student S1 (University 3) explained that he prefers to use his
laptop for course-related research because, “Sometimes the information on my
smartphone … I feel like it doesn’t give you as much information as the laptop does. They
kind of make it into a mobile version instead of a full version of something.” Other
students like PS11 (University 3) noted, “It’s just a whole lot easier and quicker to look
up a whole lot of information and to keep it organized [on a laptop] than on my phone.”

Group differences are present with respect information resource preferences.
To assess the truth of Proposition 9 “Group differences exist among
undergraduate students with respect to their preferences for information seeking” oneway ANOVA and LSD post hoc analyses were conducted across demographic variables
for the five most highly rated information resource preferences for both everyday life and
course-related information seeking. One-way ANOVA and LSD post hoc analyses were
also conducted across demographic variables for the two mostly frequently utilized
technology tools for everyday life and course-related information seeking – smartphones
and laptop computers. Significant findings are outlined in Tables 14 and 15. Group
differences were assessed for all demographic variables noted in this study, with the
exception of age, enrollment status, and international student status which were not
evaluated due to small sample sizes in some of the subgroups. Statistically significant
findings suggest that group differences do, indeed, exist among undergraduate students
with respect to their preferences for both information resources and technology devices as
they relate to their everyday life and academic information seeking.
ELIS resource preferences vary across demographic variables.
Findings from one-way ANOVAs of the quantitative survey data suggest that
significant differences exist among many demographic groups with respect to
undergraduate students’ preferences for everyday life information resources. These
groups include those related to university affiliation, gender, academic major, and
parents’ highest level of education. More specifically, undergraduate students’ use of

146

Google for everyday life information seeking differed significantly, though with
extremely low effect sizes, according to gender (F(1,830) = 13.854, p < .001, ηp2 = 016)
and university affiliation (F(2,953) = 5.605, p =.004, ηp2 =.012). With respect to gender,
females consulted Google for their everyday life research significantly more often than
males. LSD post hoc analyses also revealed that students at University 2 were
significantly more likely to use Google for their everyday life research than their peers at
University 1. One-way ANOVA analysis also revealed that differences exist between
gender groups with respect to frequency of consultation with family and friends for
everyday life research (F(1,830) = 25.034, p < .001, ηp2 =.029), with females consulting
family and friends significantly more often than males.
One-way ANOVA analysis further revealed significant group differences with
respect to use of Wikipedia based upon gender (F(1,831) = 14.653, p < .001, ηp2 =.017),
university affiliation (F(2,952) = 10.235, p < .001, ηp2 =.021), academic major (F(4,732) =
9.820, p < .001, ηp2 =.051), and parent’s highest level of education (F(5,779) = 3.086, p =
.009, ηp2 =.019). All significant ANOVA findings relating to Wikipedia had small effect
sizes, with the exception of academic major, which had a moderate effect size. Findings
suggest males consulted Wikipedia significantly more often than females. LSD post hoc
analysis further revealed that students enrolled at University 2 consulted Wikipedia
significantly more often than students at University 3. With respect to academic major, a
LSD post hoc analysis revealed that STEM majors were significantly more likely to
consult Wikipedia for everyday life research than those majoring in Arts/Humanities,
Social Sciences, Business, or Health related fields. Findings further suggest that
147

Arts/Humanities majors consulted Wikipedia significantly more often than students
majoring in Business or Health related fields. Finally, Social Science majors were noted
to consult Wikipedia significantly more often than students majoring in Health related
fields. Additional LSD post hoc analyses also revealed that students whose parents have a
4-year degree or higher consulted Wikipedia significantly more often than those whose
parents who do not hold such degrees. More specifically, students whose parents earned a
bachelor’s, master’s, or doctoral level degree consulted Wikipedia to a significantly
greater degree than students whose parent’s earned a high school diploma or attended
some college but did not earn a degree. LSD findings further suggest that students whose
parents earned a master’s degree consulted Wikipedia significantly more often than those
whose parents earned an associate’s degree.
Course-related resource preferences vary across demographic variables.
Findings from one-way ANOVA analyses of the quantitative survey data suggest
that significant differences also exist among a host of undergraduate student demographic
groups with respect to information resource preferences for course-related assignments
and research papers. Significant group differences were noted based upon university
affiliation, GPA, gender, race, academic major, family income, and attendance at a
library instruction class. The details of these findings are outlined in Table 14.

* Only demographic variables with statistically significant ANOVAs are listed.

One-way ANOVAs revealed significant mean differences among GPA groups
with respect to frequency of consulting family and friends for course-related research.
More specifically, students who reported GPAs in the lowest range (2.5 or below)
149

reported that they consulted family and friends for their academic research significantly
more often than students in all other GPA groups (3.6-4.0, 3.1-3.5, and 2.6-3.0). Students
with GPAs of 2.6-3.0 also reported that they consulted their family and friends with
significantly greater frequency than those with higher GPAs (3.6-4.0 or 3.1-3.5). Finally,
students who reported their GPAs as 3.1-3.5 reported that they consulted their family and
friends for course-related research significantly more often than those earning a GPA of
3.6-4.0. Significant group differences were also noted between genders with respect to
their frequency of consulting university websites (F(1,829) = 12.611, p < .001, ηp2 =.015)
and course readings (F(1,831) = 16.162, p < .001, ηp2 =.019), though with a small effect
noted for each factor. For these measures, females consulted university websites and
course readings significantly more often than males for course-related research.
Similar to findings for everyday life information seeking, one-way ANOVA
analysis revealed numerous significant group differences with respect to the frequency of
using Wikipedia for course-related research. Significant group differences were noted
based upon gender (F(1,820) = 21.438, p < .001, ηp2 =.025), university affiliation (F(2,900) =
10.096, p < .001, ηp2 =.022), academic major (F(4,728) = 8.466, p < .001, ηp2 =.044), and
race (F(2,718) = 8.025, p < .001, ηp2 =.022). All significant ANOVAs relating to the use of
Wikipedia for course-related research had small effect sizes, with the exception of
academic major, which had a small to moderate effect size. Findings from this analysis
revealed that males consulted Wikipedia for course-related research significantly more
often than females. LSD post hoc comparisons further revealed that students from
University 2 consulted Wikipedia significantly more often than students at University 1
150

and University 3. With regard to academic major, students majoring in STEM fields
consulted Wikipedia for course-related research significantly more often than those
majoring in Arts/Humanities, Social Sciences, Business, or Health related fields. Students
majoring in Arts/Humanities also consulted Wikipedia significantly more often than
those majoring in Business or Health related fields. Finally, students majoring in Social
Sciences consulted Wikipedia significantly more often than those majoring in Health
related fields. With respect to race, LSD comparisons revealed that Asian/Native
Hawaiian/Pacific Islander students consulted Wikipedia for course-related research
significantly more often than White/Caucasian or Black/African American students.
One-way ANOVA analysis also revealed statistically significant group
differences with respect to undergraduate students’ use of a smartphone browser for
course-related research. These groups include those related to university affiliation
(F(2,900) = 6.401, p =.002, ηp2 =.014), race (F(2,718) = 6.021, p =.003, ηp2 =.016), and GPA
(F(3,824) = 4.506, p =.004, ηp2 =.016), all with low effect sizes. More specifically, Fisher’s
LSD post hoc analysis revealed that students at University 3 consulted their smartphone
browsers for course research with significantly greater frequency than students at
University 1 and University 2. Post hoc analysis also revealed that Black/African
American students consulted their smartphone browsers for course-related research
significantly more often than White (Caucasian) or Asian/Native Hawaiian/Pacific
Islander students. Across GPA groups, students who reported their GPAs to be between
3.6-4.0 consulted their smartphone browsers for course related research significantly less
often than students in all other GPA groups (2.5 or below, 2.6-3.0, 3.1-3.5).
151

Survey findings suggest professors are another popular choice for course-related
information seeking. One-way ANOVA analysis revealed numerous significant group
differences for this factor, including gender (F(1,830) = 16.880, p < .001, ηp2 =.020),
university affiliation (F(2,900) = 8.888, p < .001, ηp2 =.019), academic major (F(4,728) =
5.056, p < .001, ηp2 =.027), family income (F(5,673) = 2.834, p =.015, ηp2 =.021), and
attendance at a library instruction class (F(2,884) = 8.675, p < .001, ηp2 =.019), all with
small effect sizes. With regards to gender, findings suggest females consulted their
professors significantly more often than males. LSD post hoc comparisons further
revealed that students at both University 1 and University 3 consulted their professors for
course-related research significantly more often than students at University 2. With
regard to academic major, post hoc analysis revealed that students majoring in
Arts/Humanities consulted their professors for course-related research significantly more
often than those majoring in STEM, Business, Social Sciences, and Health related fields.
Findings also suggest students majoring in Business and Health related fields consulted
their professors for course-related research significantly more often than STEM majors.
Post hoc analysis also revealed that frequency of consultation with professors for courserelated research differed among family income groups. Findings from this analysis
suggest those in the lower income groups (less than $20,000/year, $20,000 $34,999/year, and $35,000 - $49,000/year) consulted their professors significantly more
often than students in the highest income group ($100,000/year or above). Findings from
LSD post hoc analysis also suggest that students who attended two or more library

152

instruction classes were significantly more likely to consult with their professors for
course-related research than those who attended only one library class or no classes at all.
Lastly one-way ANOVAs revealed significant group differences with respect to
students’ consultation of library databases for course-related research. Significant group
differences were noted based upon gender (F(1,834) = 12.889, p < .001, ηp2 =.015),
academic major (F(4,731) = 9.285, p < .001, ηp2 =.048), family income (F(5,674) = 3.671, p
=.003, ηp2 =.027), and attendance at a library instruction class (F(2,889) = 38.230, p < .001,
ηp2 =.079). Reported effect sizes for gender and family income were low, while the effect
size for academic major was low to moderate, and that for library instruction class
attendance was moderate. Findings suggest that females consulted library databases
significantly more often than males. LSD post hoc analysis further revealed that students
majoring in Arts/Humanities, Social Sciences, Business, or Health related fields
consulted library databases with significantly greater frequency than students pursuing
STEM majors. Students majoring in the Social Sciences were also noted to consult
library databases significantly more often than students majoring in Business fields.
Differences were also noted among family income groups, with LSD post hoc analysis
revealing that those in the highest income group ($100,000 or above) consulted library
databases significantly less often than those in nearly all other income groups (less than
$20,000/year, $20,000 - $34,999/year, $35,000 - $49,999/year, and $75,000 $99,000/year). Finally, significant group differences were noted, with a moderate effect
size, between groups related to attendance at a library instruction class. More specifically,
LSD post hoc comparisons revealed that students who attended two or more library
153

instruction classes consulted library databases significantly more often than those who
attended one library class or none at all. Further, students who attended one library class
consulted their library’s online databases with significantly greater frequency than those
who had not attended a library class at their universities.
Technology tool preferences vary across demographic groups.
To further assess the truth of Proposition 9, one-way ANOVA analyses and LSD
post hoc comparisons were conducted to assess whether group differences were present
with respect to the two most frequently utilized tools for both everyday life and courserelated research -– smartphones and laptop computers. Statistically significant findings
suggest that group differences do, indeed, exist among undergraduate students with
respect to their preferences for particular technology devices for everyday life and
academic information seeking. These findings are further outlined in Table 15.

ELIS technology tool preferences for laptops vary across demographic
variables.
One-way ANOVAs did not reveal any significant group differences with respect
to the use of smartphones for everyday life information seeking across all demographic
variables. Preferences for laptops for everyday life information seeking, however,
revealed significant group differences among numerous demographic variables including
university affiliation (F(2,832) = 8.927, p < .001, ηp2 =.021), family income (F(5,663) =
2.749, p =.018, ηp2 =.020), and parent’s highest level of education (F(5,771) = 2.754, p
=.018, ηp2 =.018), all with small effect sizes. More specifically, LSD post hoc
comparisons revealed that students at University 2 utilized their laptop computers for
everyday life research significantly more often than students at University 1 and
University 3. Additionally, students who reported their family incomes as middle to
upper middle class ($50,000 - $74,999/year, $75,000 - $99,999, and $100,000 or above)
reported using their laptops for everyday life research with significantly greater
frequency than those who reported their family incomes to be $20,000 - $34,999/year.
Students who reported their family income as $100,000 or above were also noted to
utilize their laptops significantly more often for everyday life research than those with
incomes of $35,000 - $49,999/year. Finally, students whose parents held a master’s
degree utilized their laptops for everyday life research significantly more often than
students whose parents’ highest level of education was high school graduate or
equivalent, some college with no degree, or a bachelor’s degree. Similarly, students
whose parents’ highest level of education was at the doctoral level utilized their laptops

155

for everyday life research significantly more often than those whose parents attended
some college but did not earn a degree.
Course-related technology tool preferences vary across demographic variables.
One-way ANOVAs and LSD post hoc comparisons were also conducted to assess
whether significant group differences were present with respect undergraduate students’
preferences for using smartphones and laptops for course-related research. Significant
mean differences relating to the use of smartphones for academic research were noted
based upon university affiliation (F(2,819) = 9.034, p < .001, ηp2 =.022) and race (F(2,699) =
9.783, p < .001, ηp2 =.027), though with small effect sizes. More specifically, LSD post
hoc comparisons revealed that students enrolled at University 3 reported using their
smartphones for course-related research with significantly greater frequency than
students at University 1 or University 2. With respect to race, Black/African American
and Asian/Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander students reported using their smartphones for
course-related research significantly more often than White (Caucasian) students.
With respect to students’ use of laptops for course-related research, one-way
ANOVAs revealed significant mean differences among groups based upon university
affiliation (F(2,834) = 5.274, p =.005, ηp2 =.012) and academic major (F(4,723) = 3.265, p
=.011, ηp2 =.018), though with negligible effect sizes. More specifically, LSD post hoc
comparisons revealed that students enrolled at University 2 reported using their laptops
for course-related research significantly more often than students at University 3. LSD
post hoc comparisons further revealed that students majoring in the Social Sciences used
their laptops for course-related research with significantly greater frequency than those
156

majoring in Arts/Humanities and Health related fields. Likewise, Business majors utilized
their laptops for course research significantly more often than those majoring in Health
related fields.
Addressing Everyday Life and Academic Information Needs is Viable for Libraries
To answer Research Question 4, “To what extent is addressing the everyday life
information needs of students a viable option for academic libraries?” and to explore the
truth of Proposition 10, “There is a clear overlap between the everyday life information
needs of undergraduate students and the ability of academic libraries to meet these
needs,” data were collected and analyzed for all six data sources for this study including
quantitative survey data, qualitative data from interviews with librarians, enrollment and
retention officials, undergraduate students (pre- and post-survey), and quantitative data
collected from the Phase IV library website feature analysis. Data were then mixed for indepth comparison across data sources. Overall, findings suggest academic libraries are
largely equipped to meet the everyday life information needs of students and, with a
minor restructuring and realignment of priorities, could feasibly serve as a campus
information hub for the university The findings from the analysis of data from these six
data sources as they relate to Research Question 4 and Proposition 10 are discussed in
greater depth below.
First, to assess the viability of academic libraries’ abilities to address the everyday
life information needs of students, an assessment was conducted to determine the degree
of difference between the potential library services, tools, or features that students
indicated they were likely to use if available and the presence of these items on academic
157

library websites. Findings suggest that there is truth to Proposition 10 for some aspects of
students’ everyday life and academic information needs and the ability of libraries to
meet these needs. There are noteworthy gaps, however, between many of the potential
services, tools, or features that undergraduate students feel they need and the presence of
this information on academic library websites.
To assess where gaps exist, survey participants were asked to indicate their
likelihood of using potential library tools, services, and features on a 7-point scale
(1=very unlikely/7=very likely). Mean scores and percent frequencies of items receiving
a rating of 5, 6, or 7 are outlined in Table 16. Findings suggest the six potential library
services, tools, or features with the highest mean ratings also received above average
ratings (5, 6, or 7 on a 7-point scale) by more than 75.0% of the survey participants.
These items include “easy access to full-text articles (Full Text Access)” (M=5.95,
SD=1.31, % frequency 5 or above = 86.80%), “pre-selected materials for courses or
subject areas (Pre-Selected Materials)” (M=5.58, SD=1.45, % frequency 5 or above =
78.84%), “one search box for everything I need (One Search Box)” (M=5.48, SD=1.57,
% frequency 5 or above=76.00%), “capability to just type in what I’m looking for
without worrying about special searching language or strategies (Natural Language
Searching)” (M=5.48, SD=1.53, % frequency 5 or above = 75.86%), “career/job
information (Career Information)” (M=5.47, SD=1.46, % frequency 5 or above=78.25%),
and “capability to search the library and Google (or other search engines) at the same
time (Search Google & Lib Same Time)” (M=5.45, SD=1.60, % frequency 5 or
above=75.88%).
158

This list of library services, tools, and features was used to assess the percentage
of library websites identified for Phase IV that possessed these items as operationally
defined on the assessment tool (see Appendix S). For example, the item “capability to
search the library and Google at the same time” was operationally defined as, “Is there a
link to Google Scholar directly on the library’s homepage?” If a link to Google Scholar
was present, then that library would be noted as possessing that item. However, if the
only link to Google Scholar was found among the library’s list of databases and not on
the homepage, then the library would not be marked as having this item.

The percent differences between potential library tools, services, and features that
students were likely to use and the percentage of library websites that possessed these
items were compared and were found to vary greatly. These findings are illustrated in
Table 16 and Figure 7. While some items had minimal differences between what students
wanted and what library websites actually had such as One Search Box (difference =
0.0%) and Natural Language Searching (difference = 1.86%), other library items differed
by more than 50%. Items with greater than 50% difference between what students want
or need and the presence of these items on library websites include the ability to Search
Google & Library at the Same Time (difference = 67.88%), Customizable Website (for
easy access to favorite information sources) (difference = 61.06%), News/Current Events
Information (difference = 59.73%), Academic Skill Building information (difference =
59.18%), information about Campus Resources (difference = 55.68%), Mobile App for
the Library (difference=50.95%), and Tools to Connect with Others on Campus
(difference = 50.40%). While these differences are noteworthy, the gaps for many of
these items could potentially be minimized through a minor restructuring of information
placement on library websites. For example, providing a direct link to Google Scholar
from a library homepage with simple instructions on how to tie search results to library
resources would immediately allow students to Search Google & Library at the Same
Time, often with full-text online access to the materials identified in the search results.

161

It is feasible for the campus library to serve as an information hub for the
university.
To more thoroughly answer Research Question 4, the viability of creating a new

model for the library was explored in this study. In this newly proposed model, the
university library would expand its role and serve as a campus information hub, one that
is equipped to address both everyday life and academic information needs of the campus
community. In support of this concept, quantitative findings suggest students have an
above average to high likelihood of utilizing potential library tools or services in support
of everyday life information needs including those relating to careers (M=5.47,
SD=1.461), academic skills preparation (M=4.98, SD=1.662), campus resources
(M=4.72, SD=1.701), and finances (M=4.67, SD=1.816). In addition, thematic analyses
of qualitative interview data collected from librarians, enrollment and retention officers,
and undergraduate students (pre- and post-survey) overwhelmingly suggest that there is a
viable place in the campus community for the library to serve in an expanded role as a
campus information hub. Making this change a success, however, may require significant
marketing, rebranding of the library, and additional resources.
To address the viability of such a model, university enrollment and retention
officials were asked to share their thoughts. Officials at all three participating universities
were overwhelmingly in favor of considering a new library model to better meet the
information needs of the campus community. Officer R3 (University 3) shared his
enthusiastic support for a new model,
And it seems to me that rebranding to go to a knowledge hub absolutely makes
sense. … I wonder what a re-branding like that would look like that would say,
162

“You know, go to the library to get information on health professions, or
information on tutoring, information on financial aid.” I think it could be a very
neat model.
In further support of a new model, officer R1 (University 2) shared her perspectives,
I think one of the things our campus lacks is a central space for learning support.
… [W]hat if the undergraduate library was a central hub … the Learning
Commons concept... This is where you go for your tutoring … How do I manage
time? How do I go through a syllabus and make a weekly schedule and ... just...
How do I take notes successfully? I mean, it's just ... It's really just academic
skills. … It's not subject specific but more generalized … just even having a space
there where students could go, then it would also bring students to the library as
well. … [I]t seems like it would make sense, you know, to have some central
information portal for that kind of, you know, where do you get learning support
... Where do I actually go to look for this? … Yeah, so just basic, "how to be a
student here and be successful" from research to general studies would be helpful.
Likewise, librarians were asked to brainstorm ideas that might help address both
the everyday life and academic information needs of students and to share their insights
as to whether they thought students would utilize the everyday life resources if they were
available. Librarian responses were overwhelmingly in favor of the concept of the library
serving as a campus information hub (n=8, 100%). Librarian L3 (University 3) shared his
thoughts,
Having it [the library] as a focal points so students know... I know the library
won't do this for me, but they know who I can talk to help with this issue that I
have. I think libraries can even more so fulfill the need of being that
clearinghouse or a focal point for helping students get any type of service they
need just because we are a location for providing friendly support, not just
academic support, but also being the center of campus and being open many hours
a week, unlike services that close at 5:00 PM or only open four days a week - so I
do think the library has a role, an even greater role in that regard.

163

In further support of the campus information hub model, librarian L5 (University 1)
explained,
[O]n our campus at least... we have, maybe not all of the students by any means,
but we have a body of students who find the library as that neutral space and
come here for more than just information. So, I do think if this were set up and
then advertised, marketed properly, then it could make it a very viable part of the
campus community and extend what already is a viable part of the campus
community, but extend that in a supportive way for retention and issues of that
kind.
Findings from thematic analysis of student interview comments (n=14, 73.7%)
further suggest that undergraduate students would be inclined to use the library to meet
many of their everyday life information needs if such information and services were
available in a centralized hub. In response to the interview prompt, “If the library had
really accessible information to campus resources and other information like financial
issues, career information, job seeking skills …,” student PS1 (University 2) noted,
Those are all things that, if the library offered them, I would definitely use ...
because I do go to, for example, the career center on campus to try to talk to
advisors and people there about what my future, you know, my career, and stuff
like that. But if the library would offer things like that... yeah... I would probably
use it more.
Likewise, student PS9 (University 1) noted,
A lot of people I know in college still do consider the library to be a good central
hub for finding most of the information they want. So if all of that stuff [everyday
life information resources] were offered through the library, I can see people,
once they understand that that is the easiest place to find it, I can see people going
to the library for it.

164

Finally, student PS4 (University 1) explained how a centralized campus information hub
would benefit her, “I think college is a crazy time for being a "big kid" and learning
about all of that kind of stuff, so I think it's ... It would be nice to know who to ask or
where you could go to find something.”
A new library model would require a shift of priorities, rebranding, and
marketing.
While both quantitative and qualitative data suggest a new model for the library is
a viable consideration, further analysis of qualitative comments, particularly from
librarians and retention officer suggests that a new model may not be successful without a
shifting of priorities, rebranding, and significant marketing. Librarians L3 and L4
(University 3) noted that while they would be in support of a new library model, it would
require a significant shift of priorities and resources. L3 explained,
You do have to manage the ability of libraries to serve ever increasing roles based
upon declining budgets and often smaller workforce … so needing to sort of
manage the responsibilities and expectations of what we can do.
L4 further noted, “At least at the moment... [the library is] focused on traditional and
current services. ... I think we could do more, but we would need more resources or we
would need to ... have a significant shift in what we are doing.”
Additionally, a successful new library model may require rebranding and
significant marketing. Retention official R3 (University 3) shared his perspective,
I think university libraries could use sort of a rebranding. … I keep thinking to
myself... "When I'm going to the library" what are you thinking? Books. … And it
seems to me that rebranding to go to a knowledge hub absolutely makes sense. ...
Books is still the bottom line when I think of library. ... I think this is a fascinating
165

kind of thing. I wonder what a re-branding like that would look like that would
say, "You know, go to the library to get information on health professions, or
information on tutoring, information on financial aid." I think it could be a very
neat model. … Or it could be something as extreme as not using the word
"library."
Librarian L5 (University 1) indicated that she feels a campus information hub model
would be an asset to the university community, but would require significant marketing.
She explained,
So, I do think if this [campus information hub] were set up and then advertised,
marketed properly, then it could make it a very viable part of the campus
community and extend what already is a viable part of the campus community,
but extend that in a supportive way for retention and issues of that kind (L5).
Likewise, librarian L6 (University 1) noted that marketing a new model for the library
would be essential. She explained,
I feel like we could play such a greater role. … I think, again, we would have to
build an expectation because I don't think that many of them [students] would
have that experience of a library in the past. ... I think in their minds the library
still plays such a traditional role. I've had so many conversations with students
where they've said, "Oh, I didn't know you would know that" or "I wish I would
have asked you that a year ago."... We haven't help build the expectations that, in
fact, there are many things that we understand about the student experience and
that there are many ways that we can offer assistance (L6).
Chapter Summary
This chapter has reviewed the results of descriptive and inferential statistical
analyses of quantitative data and thematic analysis of qualitative data to assess the
study’s four research questions and 10 corresponding propositions. First, variables
relevant to the expectancy-value theory of motivation (expectancies for success,
166

subjective task value, and perceptions of cost) were assessed as they relate to
undergraduate students’ use of both the physical and online library. Findings suggest that
students’ perceptions of library value is a significant predictor of the frequency of their
in-person library use, accounting for 1.1% of the variance in library use. Perceptions of
both subjective task value and library cost were found to hold significant predictive value
for determining frequency of use of online library resources, accounting for
approximately 20% of the variance among online library use ratings. One-way ANOVAs
were conducted to determine whether significant group differences were present with
respect to students’ frequency of library use. Further, Fisher’s LSD and Games-Howell
post hoc comparisons were used to assess where these group differences occurred. While
there were numerous significant group differences identified, the most noteworthy was
that relating to students’ attendance at a library instruction class. Post hoc comparisons
revealed that students who attended two or more library instruction classes utilized the
library (both in-person and online resources) with significantly greater frequency than
students who attended only one library session or none at all. Students who attended one
library instruction class were also significantly more likely to access the library’s online
resources than those who had never attended a library class.
To develop a better understanding of the social cognitive information needs of
undergraduate students, the most common everyday life and academic information needs
and potential barriers to academic success were identified and compared across
demographic groups using ANOVA and LSD or Games-Howell post hoc comparisons.
Findings suggest undergraduate students need information about how to navigate campus
167

resources and services and information to help them complete their regularly assigned
homework and more in-depth academic research papers. Potential barriers identified for
this study include those related to academic readiness, finances, being supported by
others, and social belonging. ANOVA analyses of these educational barriers revealed
significant differences among many demographic groups including race (support by
others), GPA (academic readiness and financial issues), family income (financial issues),
and parent’s highest level of education (financial issues). Finally, the four educational
barriers factors and the three social cognitive career variables (performance goals,
outcome expectations, and academic self-efficacy) were entered into stepwise multiple
regression analyses to predict both the use of online library resources and students’ GPA.
Findings from the regression analyses revealed that academic readiness, social belonging,
and performance goals were significant predictors of online library use, though accounted
for only 2% of the variance of online library use ratings. Academic readiness, social
belonging, financial issues, academic self-efficacy, and outcome expectations were
significant predictors of GPA, accounting for approximately 22% of the variance of GPA
scores.
Students’ top information resources were identified and preferences assessed with
regard to their everyday life information seeking and course-related research. Findings
overwhelmingly suggest that Google is the top information resource for both everyday
life and academic research. For some students, however, the choice of resources may be
situationally dependent upon the requirements of an academic assignment.
Commonalities were also assessed for technology preferences for information seeking.
168

Findings suggest that a smartphone is the most preferred tool for everyday life research,
while the laptop is the most preferred tool for academic research. One-way ANOVAs
were used to assess whether significant mean differences were present with regard to
students’ information resource and technology tool preferences. Numerous significant
group differences were identified, including a noteworthy difference among academic
majors related to preferences for using Wikipedia as both an everyday life and academic
resource.
Finally, both qualitative and quantitative data collected across the four phases of
this study were analyzed and compared to assess whether expanding the role of the
library is a viability. Findings overwhelmingly suggest that librarians, university
enrollment and retention officers, and undergraduate students are in favor of a new
library model that is equipped to address both the everyday life and academic information
needs of undergraduate students. Accomplishing this change, however, will require a
shift of library priorities and resources, rebranding of the library, and significant
marketing.

169

CHAPTER V
DISCUSSION
While equipped to play a pivotal role in student engagement and retention,
findings in the research literature suggest academic libraries are underutilized by
undergraduate students with respect to their use of available scholarly resources. This
trend elicits cause for concern as positive correlational evidence presented in the research
literature suggests library utilization is closely related to both students’ academic
performance (Barkey, 1965; Goodall & Pattern, 2011; Knapp, 1966; Robinson & Schlegl
2004; Wong & Webb, 2011) and university retention (Haddow, 2013; Mezick, 2007,
2015; Soria et al., 2013, 2014). Thus, this study was conducted with a two-fold purpose:
(1) to better understand the factors relating to undergraduate student engagement/
disengagement with the academic library and (2) to explore whether university libraries
should expand their role beyond providing academic resources and services into more
“real-life” areas that are important to the daily lives of undergraduate students and in
support of the university goal of retention. The goal of this chapter is to expand upon the
constructs that were investigated in this study in order to more deeply understand
undergraduate students’ information needs and behaviors and the ability of libraries to
meet these needs. As such, this chapter includes an overview of the study, an in-depth
discussion of findings, study limitations, implications for future research,
recommendations for practice, and concludes with a directive for future action.

170

Study Overview
To filter the complex ideas that were outlined for this study thoroughly and
efficiently, a quantitative dominant four-phase sequential mixed methods design was
used to collect data and analyze findings as they relate to the four research questions and
10 corresponding propositions proposed for this study. Using six separate instruments,
both qualitative and quantitative data were collected over a three-month period during the
Spring 2016 academic semester. Data collection included conducting semi-structured
interviews with academic librarians (n=8), university enrollment and retention officials
(n=3), and undergraduate students (pre-survey, n=2; post-survey, n=16), an online
questionnaire completed by 1,280 randomly selected undergraduate students, and a
quantitative analysis of 50 randomly selected university library websites. The study
involved participants representing three large, primarily residential, 4-year or above
public universities geographically distributed across the United States. The primary
research questions for this study include:


RQ1: What motivational variables best predict library utilization by
undergraduate students?



RQ2: What are the social cognitive information needs of successful students?



RQ3: How do undergraduate students prefer to meet their information needs?



RQ4: To what extent is addressing the everyday life information needs of students
a viable option for academic libraries?

A discussion of the study findings as they relate to these research questions is outlined
below.
171

Discussion of the Findings
Research Question One
What motivational variables best predict library utilization by undergraduate students?
In response to Research Question 1 and Proposition 1, “Motivational variables
are predictive of undergraduate students’ utilization of academic library resources,”
quantitative findings suggest undergraduate students’ perception of library value is a
significant predictor of in-person library use, while perceptions of both library value and
cost hold significant predictive value in determining students’ frequency of use of their
library’s online resources. More specifically, qualitative findings suggest students value
the physical library as a space to study and access technology equipment, while they
utilize the library’s online resources primarily for their attainment value, turning to these
resources when required by their professors to earn favorable grades. Both quantitative
and qualitative findings further suggest that when undergraduate students are not required
to use the online library resources, they will opt for easier, more convenient online
resources such as those found through Google to meet their academic information needs.
In response to Proposition 2, “Group differences exist among undergraduate
students with respect to their utilization of academic library resources,” findings suggest
that statistically significant differences exist between groups with respect to frequency of
use of online library resources, based upon the number of library instruction classes
attended, race, first generation student status, family income, and academic major.
Particularly noteworthy among these findings, Games-Howell post hoc analyses revealed
that students who attended two or more library instruction sessions utilized the library’s
172

online resources significantly more often than those who attended one class or none at all.
Similarly, students who attended one library instruction class reported utilizing these
resources with significantly greater frequency than those who had never attended a class.
Returning to the expectancy-value theory of motivation, Wigfield and Eccles
(2002) propose that “…individuals’ expectancies for success and the value they have for
succeeding are important determinants of their motivation to perform different
achievement tasks and their choices of which tasks to pursue” (p. 91). Though findings in
the literature suggest that undergraduate students find online library resources difficult to
use, thereby creating a mismatch between their expectancies for success and the value
they place in using these resources (Connaway et al., 2006; De Rosa, 2005, 2006), these
trends are not directly supported by the findings of this study. While this study’s findings
suggest that perceptions of library and cost hold predictive value for library use, the
expectancies for success factor did not bring statistically significant value to the
regression equation and was, therefore, excluded. The exclusion of this factor from the
regression equation does not imply that it is unimportant. Rather, it may be that the
students who participated in this study are homogenous with respect to this measure.
Research Question Two
What are the social cognitive information needs of undergraduate students?
In response to Research Question 2, findings from both quantitative and
qualitative data analysis suggest the most common everyday life information needs of
students relate to understanding how to navigate campus resources and services. This
information need has not been previously identified in the body of literature that was
173

reviewed for this study. Findings from this study further suggest that the most common
academic information needs of undergraduate students relate to finding appropriate
information and tools necessary to complete course related research papers and regularly
assigned homework. These findings align very closely with those reported by Head and
Eisenberg (2011) and Given (2002) who also identified “finding and locating sources to
complete course-related assignments” as the most frequently cited academic information
need for undergraduate students.
In response to Proposition 3, “ There are common educational barriers among
undergraduate students,” study participants reported their greatest potential barriers to
their academic success related to feeling underprepared to manage the academic rigor of
college, including issues related to time management, and dealing with financial issues.
Secondary barriers included those related to feeling supported by others and developing a
sense of social belonging. These findings align very closely with those noted by
Murtaugh (2012), Stoessel et al. (2015), and Thomas (2012) in which the researchers
identified lack of preparation for higher education study, academic issues, feelings of
isolation and /or not fitting in, and concerns about future aspirations as the primary
reasons students report for dropping out of higher education study. Closely related to the
above noted factors, findings from numerous other studies suggest that even persons with
well-developed career paths will be unlikely to pursue that path if they perceive
substantial barriers to achieving their goals (Brown & Lent, 1996; Luzzo & McWhirter,
2001; Raque-Bodgan et al., 2013) including, but not limited to parental support, financial
worries, others’ perceptions related to gender and ethnicity, academic readiness and study
174

skills, social “fitting in,” and outside concerns such as employment and childcare. Thus,
the potential barriers to educational success identified in this study may also be construed
as social cognitive information needs, for when left unmet they can potentially lead to
student drop-out.
In response to Proposition 4, “Group differences exist among undergraduate
students with respect to their common educational barriers,” ANOVA findings suggest
that statistically significant differences exist across numerous demographic groups as
they relate to the potential barriers explored in this study. Particularly noteworthy,
Games-Howell post hoc analysis revealed that White (Caucasian) students felt
significantly more supported by others than Black/African American and Asian/Native
Hawaiian/Pacific Islander students. Students with lower GPAs anticipated significantly
more issues related to their academic readiness than students with higher GPAs. Finally,
students who reported their family incomes in the lower ranges, those whose parents
completed minimal to no higher education, and those with GPAs in the lower ranges
reported anticipating financial issues to a significantly greater degree than their peers who
reported family incomes in the upper ranges, whose parent’s held a master’s or doctoral
level degree, and those with GPAs in the upper ranges. These significant group
differences may serve as a reminder to those who work with students that there is no onesize-fits-all approach that will meet the needs of everyone. Instead, there must be room
for flexibility in service delivery in order to meet the needs of diverse student
populations.

175

Findings from a stepwise multiple regression analysis were used to address
Proposition 5, “Undergraduate students’ contextual background and social cognitive
factors are predictive of their utilization of academic library resources.” The regression
analysis revealed that academic barriers and social cognitive career factors related to
academic readiness, social belonging, and performance goals held significant predictive
value for determining the frequency of use of online library resources, though these
factors accounted for only a small amount of variance among scores. Findings from a
separate stepwise multiple regression analysis helped to address Proposition 6,
“Undergraduate students’ contextual background and social cognitive factors are
predictive of their overall academic success.” In this analysis, five factors including
potential barriers related to academic readiness, social belonging, and financial issues and
social cognitive career factors related to academic self-efficacy and outcome expectations
were found to hold significant predictive value for determining GPA range, with these
factors accounting for approximately 22% of the variance among scores.
Taken together, the findings relating to Research Question 2 and Propositions 3
through 6 suggest contextual and social cognitive factors, including perceived
educational barriers, pose important considerations in understanding undergraduate
students’ information seeking needs, preferences, behaviors, and utilization of library
resources. Further, while the findings from this study in no way imply that the predictive
factors for library use and GPA will lead to student retention, they do lend support to a
body of literature that has linked academic ability indices to persistence (Bean, 1980,

176

1985; Cabrera et al., 1992; Cabrera et al., 1993; Pascarella & Chapman, 1983; Tinto,
1975).
Research Question Three
How do undergraduate students prefer to meet their information needs?
In response to Research Question 3 and Proposition 7, “There are commonalities
among undergraduate students with respect to the types of information resources they
prefer to use for their information seeking, findings from both quantitative and qualitative
data analysis suggest undergraduate students largely prefer to meet both their everyday
life and academic information needs using Google or other search engines. These
findings fall into close alignment with findings from previous studies which suggest that
while librarians continue to work to promote information literacy among their student
populations and improve accessibility to their online resources, many undergraduates
continue to turn to other, more attractive alternatives such as Google to meet their
information needs (Connaway et al., 2006; De Rosa, 2005, 2006). Because undergraduate
students are likely to turn to search engines as their first step in both everyday life and
course related information seeking, it is imperative that they develop the knowledge and
strategies to effectively select and utilize both freely available online resources and
academic library resources and be able to evaluate the sources they find.
In further response to Research Question 3 and Proposition 7, qualitative findings
suggest that students’ choices for academic information resources are often situationally
dependent. There are many times when results from a Google search will suffice in
meeting the needs of a particular assignment, while a more in-depth, scholarly oriented
177

research assignment may require a student to utilize the library’s online resources. Other
students noted that they first turn to Google to gain an overview of a topic for a research
assignment, but then turn to the library’s online resources for the level of scholarly
materials required to complete the assignment. These findings lend further support to
those published by Connaway et al. (2006) and Prabha et al. (2006) which suggest that
undergraduate students make rational decisions that are contextually based as they carry
out their information searches, choosing a strategy and level of effort based on situational
needs and differentiating between quick and thorough searches (Connaway et al., 2006;
He et al., 2012; Prabha et al., 2006). More specifically, the findings from the present
study suggest that while undergraduate information seekers may rely heavily upon
Google to meet their needs, their level of effort and search strategies are dependent upon
the situation.
In response to Proposition 8, “There are commonalities among undergraduate
students with respect to the types of technology they prefer to use for information
seeking,” commonalities were noted among undergraduate students with respect to their
technology preferences for information seeking. Findings from both quantitative and
qualitative data analysis overwhelmingly suggest undergraduate students most typically
prefer to use their smartphones to answer everyday life questions and their laptops for
their course-related information seeking. Thus, while findings from both the Educause
report of college students (Dahlstrom et al., 2015) and a Pew Internet Research survey of
adults across the United States (Smith, 2011) suggest that younger adult smartphone
owners are particularly likely to say that they mostly go online using their phones, the
178

findings from this study suggest that their choice of technology is situationally
dependent.
Finally, in response to Proposition 9, “Group differences exist among
undergraduate students with respect to their preferences for information seeking,” oneway ANOVA findings revealed statistically significant differences across numerous
demographic groups relating to resource preferences for information seeking. Differences
among academic majors are particularly noteworthy. Fisher’s LSD post hoc analysis
revealed that students pursuing STEM majors were significantly more likely to consult
Wikipedia for both everyday life and academic information than students majoring in
Arts/Humanities, Social Sciences, Business, and Health related fields. Additionally,
students majoring in Arts/Humanities were significantly more likely to consult Wikipedia
than those majoring in Business or Health related fields. Likewise, students majoring in
Social Sciences were also significantly more likely to consult Wikipedia than individuals
majoring in health related fields.
To further assess the truth of Proposition 9, ANOVA and LSD post hoc analyses
were conducted with regard to undergraduate students’ technology tool preferences for
information seeking. Findings revealed statistically significant differences for this
measure among numerous demographic groups for both everyday and course-related
information seeking. Though group differences were identified relating to university
affiliation, race, international student status, and academic major, all effect sizes were
negligible, suggesting these differences may not be particularly noteworthy. Together, the
findings relating to Research Question 3 suggest that it may be prudent for library
179

instruction sessions to be tailored to meet the varied preferences among different
demographic groups, particularly academic majors. With respect to technology
preferences, because there are pockets of students who prefer to conduct their academic
information seeking via their smartphones, it is recommended that libraries make it a
priority to ensure their websites are optimized for mobile searching and consider creating
library smartphone apps to ensure these students have easy access to library tools,
services, and information. Of particular relevance to academic libraries, findings from
this study lend support to those noted by Pendell and Brown (2012) and Seeholzer and
Salem (2011) which suggest information seekers are interested in searching library
databases through mobile sites, despite the fact that some databases are not optimized for
mobile access and may be difficult to access from a phone.
Research Question Four
To what extent is addressing the everyday life information needs of students a viable
option for academic libraries?
Findings from the analysis of data collected across all four phases of this study
overwhelmingly help to answer Research 4, suggesting that expanding the role of the
library to address both the academic and everyday life information needs of students is a
strong and viable option. Qualitative findings suggest librarians and university enrollment
and retention officials can envision shifting the library’s priorities and rebranding it as a
campus information hub. Qualitative and quantitative findings from this study further
suggest students want and need everyday life information and feel that they would utilize
such resources if offered by the library.

180

One key aspect of addressing the viability of a new library model is to measure
the alignment between the everyday life information and resources students want and
need in order to be successful and the ability of libraries to meet these needs, thus
addressing Proposition 10, “There is a clear overlap between the everyday life
information needs of undergraduate students and the ability of academic libraries to meet
these needs.” While there is close alignment between many of the resources students
want and the availability of these resources at academic libraries, there are also distinct
gaps for others. Findings from a deeper exploration of the library websites reviewed
during Phase IV of this study suggest many of these gaps may be addressed with a minor
rearrangement of materials that may already be available through these sites. Closing the
gap between other desired resources and libraries’ abilities to meet these needs, however,
may require a more significant shifting of library priorities and resources.
Academic Libraries Can Play a Pivotal Role in Undergraduate Student Retention
It is time for the university library to consider expanding its role beyond that of
supporting students’ academic success and begin to move into more every day, “real life”
areas that are important to the daily lives of undergraduate students. Because the
academic and everyday life information needs of students are so closely intertwined,
attending to the formal (academic performance) and informal (faculty/staff interactions)
academic systems and formal (extracurricular activities) and informal (peer-group) social
systems as outlined in the social integration theory (Tinto, 1975; Tinto & Pusser, 2006;
Rovai, 2003) from a library and information science perspective may be a useful and

181

viable solution for integrating students into their universities and helping them persist in
their studies through graduation.
Further, while undergraduate students value the resources available to them
through their academic libraries, it is critical that students find these resources to be
convenient, easy to use, and relevant, as these factors appear to be primary drivers for
students’ choices of information resources. Because library instruction appears to play an
important role in students’ willingness to engage with online library resources, it is vital
that these efforts continue to be emphasized and sustained, particularly focusing upon
reaching students in their critical, first year of study. It is further recommended that
library instruction efforts move beyond the single one-shot library instruction session and
work towards having students participate in at least two sessions.
Limitations
Although every attempt was made to complete a thorough and comprehensive
exploration of the factors relating to undergraduate students’ engagement with their
academic libraries and to explore the potentiality of a new model for libraries, the study
was subject to numerous limitations. These limitations relate primarily to the site
selection, sampling of participants, issues related to data collection and survey design,
and researcher influence and experience. Each of these limitations presents opportunities
for future research.
First, the sampling frame involved participants from only three large, public
universities in the United States. Although many of the results align well with previous
findings, they cannot be generalized beyond this study’s population. It is also noteworthy
182

to mention that the university site selection was done out of convenience, as the
institutions invited and selected to participate had a library dean or director who was
known either to the researcher or a member of her doctoral committee. A randomized
selection of universities may have helped to produce a more generalizable set of data.
Further, while each of the universities selected was classified by Carnegie (2015) as a
large, primarily residential, 4-year or above public university, it was later realized that
undergraduate student admissions classifications for selectivity differed among the sites,
with University 2 classified as “more selective” and University 1 and University 3
classified as “selective.” Further, though the three universities were each designated as
“large,” the undergraduate student populations (University 1, n=8732; University 2,
n=31,302; University 3, n=15.591) and sample sizes representing each of the universities
(University 1, n=107; University 2, n=769; University 3, n=402) differed quite noticeably
from each other. Because of these differences, there is a distinct possibility that data may
have been skewed to reflect University 2 which had the greatest percentage of
participants (60.17%). A more closely balanced sample of participants and homogenous
university selectivity ratings may have elicited different and perhaps more trustworthy
results.
A second limitation of this study relates to the sampling of undergraduate student
participants. While sample selection was randomized, the nature of the data collection
methods allowed for students to self-select whether to participate. Participants who
completed the online survey may not accurately represent the larger pool of invited
participants, thus compromising the generalizability of the findings. The relatively low
183

response rate (9.63%) and completion rate (71.20%) for the online survey component of
this study is also a concern. There was a particularly low response rate for participants at
University 1 (5.77%). Again, there is a risk that those who completed the survey may not
accurately represent the larger pool of invited participants, further compromising the
generalizability of the findings. Similarly, in Phase III of the study, a second layer of
participant self-selection may have further compromised the findings. In this phase, a
heterogeneous sample of participants was purposely selected from a volunteer pool of
survey completers. Again, there is a risk that the perspectives of the Phase III participants
may not accurately represent those of the larger undergraduate student population.
Some elements of the data collection process may also be considered as study
limitations. Both interview and survey responses relied upon participants’ self-reporting
of data. With this brings a risk of “social desirability bias” in which participants may
have a tendency to over report socially approved behavior (library usage) or desirable
characteristics (e.g., high GPA, high parental level of education, high family income, and
low perceived educational barriers) to present themselves in a favorable light (Groves et
al., 2009). The timing of the survey invitations and response collection may also have
impacted study results. Survey data were collected from mid-point in the semester to the
last few weeks before semester end. These weeks tend to elicit more stress for
undergraduate students as they approach final exams and projects. Therefore, the timing
of the survey may have adversely affected the response rates for the study. The responses
of those who did elect to participate in this study may have also been skewed, potentially
reflecting an atypically high level of stress among students. Additionally, as students
184

work to complete final course research assignments and begin to prepare for final exams,
there is a distinct possibility that the frequency of library use reported by survey
participants may have been higher than if these data were collected earlier in the
semester.
Four elements of survey design may also be perceived as limitations to the study.
First, the social cognitive career factor, performance goals, was measured by a single
item. To increase reliability, more items need to be added to the instrument for this factor,
as there is significant risk that this single item will not produce consistent results. Second,
data regarding undergraduate students’ year in school (e.g., freshman, sophomore, junior,
senior) was not collected. While this instrument was created based upon the literature and
findings from earlier phases of the present study, this remained a significant and
unfortunate oversight. Without this information, the ability to assess differences related to
year in school and to assess changes over time was not possible. Data collection of
students’ GPAs in the form of a range (e.g., 2.5 or below, 2.6-3.0, 3-1.3.5, 3.6-4.0)
proved to be another limiting factor in this study. If GPAs were collected as an interval
measurement rather than forced into range categories, the predictive possibilities via
regression analyses would be more meaningful. Finally, it was noted that the standard
deviations for many of the psychosocial factors measured in this study fell below the
minimum desired threshold for a 7-point scale (SD=1.5), suggesting there is less than
optimal variability of scores about the mean. To improve the variability among ratings,
associated scale items require further review and may need to be rewritten to elicit greater
variability in responses.
185

Lastly, issues related to potential researcher bias and the researcher’s limited
experience with conducting a mixed methods research study of this magnitude may be
limiting factors to this study and its findings. While it is hoped that the data would be
collected, analyzed, and interpreted with an unbiased eye, doing so is an impossibility. As
a novice researcher, there is increased risk that important findings may have been missed
or misinterpreted. Conducting a multi-institutional, mixed methods study brings with it a
multitude of data to manage, analyze, and interpret. There is much room for continued
analysis of the data, including possibilities for more sophistical inferential statistical
analyses such as path analysis with structural equation modeling.
Implications for Research
The scarcity of research related to undergraduate students’ motivation to engage
with their academic libraries leaves the topic ripe for further investigation. Likewise,
considerations of whether or how academic libraries might better serve the everyday life
needs of undergraduate students in support of university retention efforts seem to be nonexist in the research literature. As university drop-out rates among undergraduate students
remain high across the nation, the intersection between students’ potential barriers to
their academic success, their information needs and preferences, and university retention
from an information science and motivational theory perspective warrants further
exploration. Though the findings and conclusions from the present study bring us a step
closer towards understanding students and how to support them in their academic
journeys as they persist through graduation, further research in this arena is needed. The
conceptual model that was proposed for this study (Figure 2) may help guide future
186

research in this arena. Further, the newly created and/or adapted subscales used in this
study were found to produce reliable results and can serve as tools for future research
studies. The use of the comprehensive, four phase mixed methods research design that
placed the students at the center of the study proved to be an excellent model that not
only allowed trends among the data to be revealed, but perhaps more importantly,
allowed the voices of the students to be heard. These concepts and recommendations for
future research are outlined in greater depth below.
Because this study addressed concepts that have been scarcely addressed in the
research literature, much additional work is needed in order to approach generalizable
results. As such, additional studies that attempt to replicate the findings of the present
study are encouraged. It may also prove useful to conduct similar research studies with
undergraduate students attending colleges or universities with different types of
institutional classifications such as private institutions, community colleges, and different
levels of selectivity, thus presenting opportunities for making comparisons across
university type. It is also recommended that future studies include students’ “year in
school” as a primary demographic factor, as this will allow researchers to assess potential
changes over time. If a participant pool was large enough to produce results at a 95%
confidence interval, it may prove helpful to implement stratified random sampling to
ensure a higher degree of representativeness of all strata or layers in the population,
particularly those relating to GPA, racial subgroups, academic major, and enrollment
status. Stratified sampling of students in different GPA subgroups may be a particularly
useful way to minimize self-reporting or social desirability bias for this measure.
187

Including different types of data collection methods in the study such as a review of
student records, library use statistics, and analysis of transcripts from student drop-out
exit interviews may further help to reduce biases inherent with self-reporting methods.
Further, it is recommended that GPA data be recorded as interval data rather than
categorical as was done in the present study. This may allow for more useful findings to
emerge, particularly related to attempts in predicting students’ GPAs. Finally, if changes
were implemented at a participating university based upon this study’s findings and
recommendations, it would be interesting to conduct a follow-up study using the same
instruments to compare results pre- and post- intervention.
The conceptual model proposed in Figure 2 of this study provides a particularly
noteworthy contribution to future research in this field. This model provided a clear
framework to guide this study that is based upon sound theoretical research related to
information use environments (Taylor, 1991), social cognitive career theory (Lent et al.,
1997), Wilson’s theory of information seeking (1997), expectancy-value theory of
motivation (Eccles & Wigfield, 2002), Tinto’s social integration theory (1975), and
Savolainen’s every life information seeking theory (1995). This model allows for
important factors which may be relevant to university retention to be given consideration,
especially those related to undergraduate students’ (1) contextual, social, and cognitive
needs that lead to (2) information seeking behavior, and the (3) motivational factors that
come into play that may instigate and sustain student engagement with their library
resources. It is important to note that the last line of this model has not yet been tested.
This final line proposes that increased engagement with the library will lead to
188

undergraduate students’ everyday life and academic information needs being met
(Savolainen, 1995), allowing them to become socially integrated into the university
(Tinto, 1975), thereby improving their likelihood of persisting through graduation.
Another important contribution to future research is the undergraduate student
survey instrument that was developed and implemented during Phase II of this study.
Survey development involved a seven step process proposed by Artino et al. (2014),
including steps endorsed by the American Education Research Association (AERA),
American Psychological Association (APA), and the National Council on Measurement
in Education (NCME) in their 1999 Standards for Educational and Psychological
Testing. Artino et al. (2014) suggested that “Addressing each of these steps systemically
will improve the probability that survey designers will accurately measure what they
intend to measure” (p. 463). All scales and subscales in this instrument were found to
have good to excellent reliability including those relating to the expectancy-value theory
of motivation (full scale α = .873; library expectancies for success α = .862; library value
α = .920; library cost α = .921), social cognitive career theory factors (full scale α = .870;
performance goals α not measured, outcome expectations α = .874; academic selfefficacy α = .871) and the educational barriers scale (α = .921) and corresponding
subscales (support from others α = .847; financial issues α = .744; academic readiness α =
.860; social belonging/mental health α = .789). Though each of these scales and subscales
were found to have good to excellent reliability, because they have been significantly
revised from the original scales identified in the literature, repeated testing of these
instruments will produce more credible results. It is also recommended that a subscale
189

comprised of at least three items be constructed and tested for the social cognitive career
factor, performance goals. This factor is currently measured by a single item in the
survey instrument, thus creating a risk of inconsistent results. Additionally, because there
was less than optimal variability among some of the subscales relating to psychosocial
factors (e.g., motivation to use the library, social cognitive career factors, and educational
barriers), it is recommended that the associated items be rewritten in a way that will elicit
more specificity and variability among responses.
Finally, it is recommended that future studies surrounding this complex topic be
undertaken using mixed methods designs. The use of the comprehensive, quantitative
dominant four phase mixed methods research design that placed the students at the center
of the study proved to be an excellent model, as it not only allowed trends among the data
to be revealed, but also allowed the voices of the students to be heard. While Olsson
(2009) has criticized the library and information science scholarship as “manifest[ing] a
task-orientation that is a legacy of the field’s origins in library and information system
evaluation” (pp. 22-23), mixed methods studies may help move the scholarship forward
towards a more user-centered approach. By doing so, undergraduate students will be
valued as “knowing subjects” and “cultural experts” (Talja, 1997) and become partners in
addressing problems and creating new solutions. In fact, use of student-advisory
committees in studies of this nature is recommended, thereby allowing the researchers to
gain first-hand insights into student behaviors and perspectives, while also gathering
valuable input from students towards creating viable solutions. Individuals who choose to
undertake rigorous multi-institutional, mixed methods design studies are further
190

encouraged to work in teams. Taking a team-based approach will not only help to
distribute and manage the immense workload associated with such studies, but will
provide additional sets of eyes and perspectives that may further improve the credibility
and trustworthiness of the findings.
Implications for Practice
Findings from this study suggest academic libraries are ripe for change. While
academic libraries have historically focused upon providing access to highly credible
resources to meet students’ academic/scholarly information needs, there is a viable place
in the campus community for the library to serve in an expanded role as a campus
information hub in support of university student retention goals. Successful
implementation of such change, however, will require a systems approach in which input
from all key stakeholders, including university upper level administrators, faculty, staff,
and students is valued. This change may require a realignment of library priorities and
resources, rebranding of the library as a center for information and engagement, and
significant marketing to ensure success.
According to the expectancy-value theory of motivation, for undergraduates to be
motivated to instigate and sustain engagement with their libraries, they must expect to be
successful in their library searches and perceive that their engagement will be high on
value and low on personal cost. To ensure that students expect success in their library
searches, it is critical that continuous efforts are made to ensure they attend two or more
library instruction sessions. Findings from this study revealed that students who attended
two or more library instruction sessions utilized the library’s online resources
191

significantly more often than those who attended one class or none at all. Likewise, those
who attended one library instruction class reported utilizing these resources with
significantly greater frequency than those who had never attended a class. Thus, it
appears that library instruction may play an important role in a student’s willingness to
use the library.
Findings from this study suggest undergraduate students’ perceptions of library
value hold the greatest weight in predicting use of the library’s resources. As such,
increasing perceptions of library value for students should be a primary consideration.
Study findings suggest the physical academic library holds great value for undergraduate
students by serving as a space for study and technology access. To further promote
engagement with the academic library and the university at large, it is recommended that
that library highlight and market the services, resources, and spaces that are available to
promote students’ curation and creation of their own content such as is possible via
scholarly commons, media commons, and makerspaces. Further, because recent trends
suggest an educational shift is beginning to occur throughout the United States, moving
from an emphasis on science, technology, and math (STEM) to STEAM: “Science &
Technology, interpreted through Engineering & the Arts, all based in Mathematical
elements an emphasis on science, technology, and math” (STEAM Education, 2015),
libraries must consider how to support and engage students in these efforts through their
space, resources, and services.
The online scholarly resources available through the library’s website hold
particular value for undergraduate students when they are required by their professors to
192

use them in order to earn favorable grades. When not required to use such scholarly
materials, the perceived value of the library’s online resources is minimal at best. What
many students may not realize, however, is the vast array of online resources that are
already in place at the library which may, in fact, bring value to them beyond completing
their course assignments. For example, 78.25% of undergraduate student survey
participants indicated with a rating of 5, 6, or 7 (7-point scale) that they would use career
information if it was available at the library. Phase IV library website review findings
revealed that 58% of libraries had career information compiled for their students in
subject guides. Likewise, 78.84% of survey participants indicated with a rating of 5, 6, or
7 that they would use pre-selected materials for their courses or subject area if provided
by the library. This time, 96.0% of library websites reviewed already had research guides
in place to support students in particular majors or courses. These findings suggest that
fulfilling some of the information needs revealed in this study may be accomplished with
minimal effort on the part of libraries by using a targeted marketing approach to make
sure students are aware of and know how to access these valuable resources.
Further, 75.88% of students indicated with a rating of 5, 6, or 7 that they would
utilize the ability to search Google and the library at the same time if it were available.
Google Scholar may be a resource that could fulfill this information preference for
students. Google Scholar enables a researcher to search specifically for scholarly
literature, allowing the researcher to “search across many disciplines and sources: articles,
theses, books, abstracts and court opinions, from academic publishers, professional
societies, online repositories, universities and other web sites,” oftentimes allowing the
193

researcher to locate the complete, full-text document through their library or on the web
(Google Scholar, n.d.). Of the library websites reviewed, 8% (n=4) provided direct access
to Google Scholar from the library’s homepage, while 70% (n=35) provided this link
from their list of library databases. Making Google Scholar a more accessible resource
for students may be as simple as placing a link directly on the library’s homepage.
Another largely untapped opportunity to build perceptions of library value relates
to providing information to help meet students’ everyday life needs. Students, librarians,
and enrollment and retention officers all expressed the need for students to have
increased awareness of and better understanding about how to access campus support
services. Undergraduate students also noted that the greatest perceived barriers to their
educational success related to their academic readiness, finances, social belonging, and
feeling supported by others. If these barriers were translated into information needs, then
the concept of the library as a campus information hub could conceivably help to address
these needs by providing resources and directing students to support mechanisms that are
already in place on the university campus. This is not to suggest that the library should
provide services to students that are traditionally provided by other campus units (e.g.,
advising, career counseling, financial aid, tutoring, etc.), but rather to serve as an
information clearinghouse, pointing students to the information or support units they may
need. In addition, it is recommended that student support units, including the library,
collaborate more actively with each other in order to provide a triage approach in which
all units value and know about each other’s services. This would allow reciprocal

194

referrals across units, thereby engaging a strategic campus approach in support of
meeting student needs.
The third factor relating to the expectancy-value theory of motivation is cost. For
students to be motivated to engage with library resources, the perceived cost must be
minimal. In other words, libraries must work to make their systems easy to use and are
encouraged to consider adopting web scale discovery tools that offer a more “Google
like” searching experience. Web scale discovery services are “capable of searching
quickly and seamlessly across a vast range of local and remote content and providing
relevancy-ranked results in the type of intuitive interface that today’s information seekers
expect” (American Library Association, n.d.). Fortunately, 76.0% of academic library
websites reviewed already had this type of feature available, described in this study as
“one search box” to search all types of library resources. Similarly, undergraduate student
survey participants (75.86% rated as a 5, 6, or 7) indicated that they would prefer the
ability to use natural search language rather than Boolean search operators when
conducting library searches. Again, findings from the Phase IV library website review
revealed that 74.0% of the libraries had search tools currently in place that allowed for
natural language searching. This suggests that libraries are beginning to recognize the
value such searching tools and features offer to their students by creating user-friendly
search interfaces that hold minimal “cost” for students. These are but a mere smattering
of the practical suggestions that can be gleaned from this study. Further consideration
should be given to the demographic differences noted throughout the study and how they
may implicate a need for further change across the university and within the library.
195

Finally, from a university standpoint, it is recommended that the survey
instrument that was developed for and implemented in Phase II of this research study be
distributed across an institution’s entire student body. The findings that could be gleaned
from such a campus-wide student survey could be used to gauge the information needs,
preferences, educational barriers, social cognitive and career factors, and motivational
perspectives across an entire study body. This could allow support units to better
understand the needs of their students and cater their services in meaningful ways in
support of the university goal of retaining students through graduation.
Conclusions
In this era of shrinking budgets, higher education institutions across the United
States are asked to do more with less. This has come at a time when the current
presidential administration is calling for the education of every American (White House,
2009). While Americans are enrolling in colleges and universities at higher rates than
ever before, attrition remains high. Maintaining student enrollment through graduation
has become a high stakes endeavor for colleges and universities as loss of students
through attrition directly affects institutional budgets through reductions in both the
tuition revenue stream and performance based funding resources.
Tinto (1975) posits that student engagement plays an important role in a student’s
decision to persist or drop out of college. The academic library is poised to play an
important role in engaging and retaining students, though not without a disruption to the
status quo. The issue at hand, then, becomes one of the relevance of academic libraries
for their undergraduate populations. To become more relevant to undergraduate students,
196

libraries must consider that it is time for a paradigm shift in order to increase the
intersection of what the library offers with what undergraduates want, need, and prefer.
This new paradigm will require the library to reinvent itself by creating systems around
user needs and preferences. Further, to facilitate adoption of these library resources, users
must feel that they will be successful when engaging with such resources, perceive that
the resources are valuable to them both personally and academically, and be of minimal
“cost” to them in terms of convenience, efficiency, and satisfaction. Rather than perceive
that the academic library is in competition with Google and other search engines, it
should instead be considered as a resource for carefully vetted information in support of
student success and retention. Thus, as universities consider ways to engage and retain
their students, they may benefit by reimagining the University Library as the information
hub of the university that attends holistically to the information needs of students.

APPENDIX A
INVITATION TO UNIVERSITY LIBRARIANS/DEANS
Date
Dear (Dean of Library),
Greetings! Dr. Clara M. Chu, a member of my doctoral dissertation committee, suggested
I contact you regarding my research. I am doctoral candidate at The University of North
Carolina at Greensboro (UNCG), pursuing a PhD in Educational Studies with a research
focus on undergraduate students’ digital information seeking. I am preparing to launch a
multi-institutional dissertation research study and invite you to consider collaborating. I
plan to work with four large public universities distributed across the four quadrants of
the United States. Dr. Chu thought (name of university) may be a good fit for this study.
In support of university retention goals, my dissertation seeks to gain a deeper
understanding of why undergraduate students are turning to sources beyond the academic
library to meet their information needs and to explore ways by which to reverse these
trends. A more complete overview of the study is available via this poster that I recently
presented at the Association for Library and Information Science Education (ALISE)
2016 conference in Boston earlier this year.
Data collection for this study will include: (1) interviews with university retention
officers, librarians, and undergraduate students at each university, (2) online surveys
distributed to a randomly selected pool of undergraduate students at each university, (3)
follow-up interviews with undergraduate volunteers (from the survey), and (4) an
analysis of 102 academic library websites to compare what students want, need, and
prefer regarding information seeking to what university libraries offer.
My desired end products from this study include:
 Written dissertation
 Reports prepared for each participating university regarding the findings with a
proposed model for engaging students with their academic library in support of
university retention efforts.
 A survey instrument that can be used by other libraries to measure information
seeking needs, preferences, and motivation of undergraduate students.

220

Your collaboration with my research would involve (1) helping me to gain permission to
conduct research at your university, (2) suggesting who I may talk with from your pool of
librarians to learn more about your students’ information seeking needs, preferences, and
motivation, (3) recommending individuals I might contact to learn more about your
university’s retention efforts, and (4) introducing me to the appropriate university
personnel or resources to gain access to a randomly selected pool of undergraduate
students to invite to complete an online survey.
This study has been approved by UNCG’s Office of Research and Compliance and is
determined to be exempt from further review under 45 CFR 46.101(b). To include your
university in this study, I would need a letter of support from you to include in an IRB
modification. Once that is in place, I then hope to work with your university’s IRB office
to gain permission to conduct research at your institution.
I sincerely appreciate your consideration. I would be happy to discuss the project further
at any time. I can be reached via email (racroxto@uncg.edu) or via my cell phone: 704661-3638. I also encourage you to visit my online portfolio to learn more about my
research and background: https://rebeccacroxton.wordpress.com/

APPENDIX B
INVITATION TO ACADEMIC LIBRARIANS
Dear (Name of Librarian),
Greetings! (Name of Library Dean) suggested I contact you to invite you to participate in
an interview relating to my dissertation research. I am doctoral candidate at the
University of North Carolina at Greensboro (UNCG), pursuing a PhD in Educational
Studies with a research focus on undergraduate students’ digital information seeking. In
support of university retention goals, my dissertation study seeks to gain a deeper
understanding of why undergraduate students are turning to sources beyond the academic
library to meet their information needs and to explore ways by which to reverse these
trends. A more complete overview of the study is available via this poster that I recently
presented at the Association for Library and Information Science Education (ALISE)
2016 conference in Boston earlier this year.
As part of this study, I would like to conduct interviews with academic librarians who are
particularly knowledgeable about undergraduate students’ information seeking needs,
preferences, and motivation to use the library. Specifically, I hope to explore how the
university might increase student engagement with the library, particularly for students
who may be vulnerable to dropping out. The interview is expected to last approximately
30 minutes.
Would you be willing to participate in an interview with me about this topic? I have
a great deal of flexibility to meet either in person, via phone, or video conference and am
happy to accommodate your schedule.
I sincerely appreciate your consideration. For more information about my research
interests and background, please feel to visit my online portfolio.
Kindest regards,
Rebecca Croxton, MLIS

INVITATION TO ENROLLMENT AND RETENTION OFFICERS

Dear (Name of Official):
Greetings! I am doctoral candidate at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro
(UNCG), pursuing a PhD in Educational Studies with a research focus on undergraduate
students’ digital information seeking. In support of university retention goals across the
country, my multi-institution dissertation study seeks to gain a deeper understanding of
why undergraduate students are turning to sources beyond the academic library to meet
their information needs and to explore ways by which to reverse these trends. A more
complete overview of the study is available via this poster that I recently presented at the
Association for Library and Information Science Education (ALISE) 2016 conference in
Boston earlier this year.
As part of this study, I would like to conduct interviews with key leaders of the university
who have a deep understanding of students who are particularly vulnerable to dropping
out of the university. Specifically, I hope to explore how the university library may help
to meet the needs of these students from an information science perspective. The
interview is expected to last approximately 30 minutes.
Would you be willing to participate in an interview with me about this topic? I have
a great deal of flexibility to meet either by phone or video conference and am happy to
work around your schedule.

Earlier research questions will help to identify what is important to students
with regard to info seeking. A review of current academic library websites will
help to identify what libraries currently have. This RQ will address the
alignment between what students want and what libraries have and explore
how libraries might address alignment between libraries and users in a way
that can be feasibly carried out by libraries and univ. in support of retention.
Viability - Capability of succeeding
Comparison of what students want with respect to meeting their information
needs and what libraries have. How closely are they aligned? What can be
done to bring alignment closer to ensure student success in a way that is doable
for libraries?
 Thematic analysis of qualitative data
 Descriptive statistics – means, frequency counts, percentages of features
from library checklist
 Comparison of student needs, preferences, and motivation to features from
library checklist for alignment

APPENDIX O
EXPECTANCY-VALUE LIBRARY MOTIVATION SCALE AND SUBSCALE
RELIABILITY AND NORMALITY
Scale reliability
A reliability analysis was conducted on the full scale for measures relating to the
Expectancy-Value Library Motivation as well as on each of the three subscales:
Expectancies for Success, Subjective Task Value, and Cost Beliefs. The items for Cost
Beliefs were reverse coded for this analysis so that scores would align with values
relating to the other dimensions, thus high values for Cost Beliefs indicate favorable
perceptions of cost (high scores = low cost). Across the full scale, reliability was found to
be excellent as measured by Cronbach’s alpha (α=.921). This value meets and/or exceeds
Cronbach’s alpha scores found in the original source instruments (Appendix N) relating
to the Expectancy-Value Theory of Motivation (Eccles & Wigfield, 1995). This favorable
comparison between the use of the modified scale in the current study with that of Eccles
and Wigfield (1995) helps to establish consistent internal reliability of this instrument.
The summary of item means (Mean=4.792) for the full scale suggests items
cluster very slightly towards the upper end of the scale (desired mean for a 7-point scale
= 4.0). The average standard deviation across the full scale (SD=1.59) falls above the
minimum standard deviation threshold for a 7-point scale (SD=1.5), suggesting there is
adequate variability of scores about the mean. The mean of Inter-Item Correlations
(r=.308) suggests that correlation between some items within the scale may not be
strong. This is not unexpected, as the subscales within this full scale are intended to
262

measure different underlying constructs and items within one subscale are not necessarily
intended to strongly correlate with items in the other subscales.
To assess whether the items identified to comprise the three subscales of the
Expectancy-Value Library Motivation Scale: (1) Expectancies for Success, (2) Library
Value, and (3) Cost Beliefs formed reliable constructs, Cronbach’s alpha, corrected item
total correlations, Cronbach’s alpha if deleted, and mean of inter-item correlations were
reviewed (see Appendix O – Table 1). Overall, the data suggest the three subscales have
very good to excellent reliability, with all Cronbach’s Alpha scores greater than α =.85.
Corrected item total correlations for all items in each subscale fall above the minimum
desired threshold (r ≥.40), suggesting the items forming each subscale “hang together”
adequately. Cronbach’s alpha if deleted scores for all items in each subscale fell below
the identified Cronbach’s alpha, with the exception of a single item (#11.8) in the Library
Value subscale, which had a Cronbach’s alpha if deleted score of 0.921 compared to the
subscale Cronbach’s alpha of 0.920. This was not a cause for concern, since the
reliability was strong overall, and the item was thought to be of value to the study. The
means of Inter-Item correlations for each of the three subscales exceeded the minimum
threshold (r ≥ .40), with the lowest Subscale inter-item correlation (r = .594) for the
Library Value subscale.

Review of Item Means and Standard Deviations
While the overall mean of item means (M=4.86) and mean standard deviation
(SD = 1.59) for the full scale and within each subscale suggest values fall only slightly
above the center of the scale and have adequate variability about the mean, analyses were
conducted at the item level to assess if any items require further review. As illustrated in
Appendix O – Table 2, the majority of item means fell slightly above the desired
threshold (M = 4.0 ± .5), suggesting responses may a slight negative skew. The standard
264

deviations across all items were above the minimum desired threshold (>1.5), suggesting
adequate variability about the mean with the exception of the three items in the
Expectancies for Success subscale and item #10.1 in the Library Value subscale, which
fell slightly below the desired range.

Review of Subscale Normality
The three sub-scales of the Expectancy-Value Library Motivation scale were
further assessed for normality by averaging the item scores within each subscale and
reviewing the skew, kurtosis, and percentile rankings (see Appendix O – Table 3). In
addition, histograms and Q-Q plots were created to aid with visual interpretation of the
data. Analyses revealed the Expectancies for Success subscale is slightly negatively
skewed, suggesting values fall towards the upper end of the scale. Library Value and Cost
Beliefs subscales were found to have only negligible skew, with the values falling within
the range of desirability (< ± 1.0). Distributions for all three subscales had minimal levels
of kurtosis with values for each subscale falling in the desired range (< ± 3.0). Further
review of percentile rankings revealed that average subscale scores for both Expectancies
for Success and Library Value slightly exceeded the desired range (4.0 ± 0.5 on a 7 point
scale), while the Cost Beliefs subscale scores fell within the desired range. Mean scores
for Library Value and Cost Beliefs at the 75th percentile were at or only slightly above the
expected range 5.25 ± 0.5, while Expectancies for Success mean values were more
noticeably clustered towards the higher end of the scale. Visual review of the histograms
and Q-Q plots further suggests a slight deviation from normality for the Expectancies for
Success subscale, while distributions approach near normality for the Value and Cost
subscales. These findings are, overall, not expected, nor do they elicit great cause for
concern.

Conclusions of Reliability Analysis of Expectancy-Value
Library Motivation Scale and Subscales
Overall, the findings of this reliability analysis suggest the three subscales
comprising the Expectancy-Value Library Motivation Scale: (1) Expectancies for
Success, (2) Value, and (3) Cost have strong reliability based upon statistical findings for
Cronbach’s alpha scores, Cronbach’s alpha if deleted scores, and corrected item-total
correlations. Further review of descriptive statistics, including scale and item means,
standard deviations and measures of central tendency including skew, kurtosis, and
percentile rankings suggest data are largely distributed as expected across the scale, with
a slight negative skew for data on the Expectancies for Success subscale. Percentile
rankings further suggest a slightly greater than average cluster of scores at the higher end
of the scale for Expectancies for Success. Interpretation of these findings suggest that
participants largely expect to succeed when using online library resources.
The strong reliability of these subscales further affirms the decision to analyze the
data according to three factors – Expectancies for Success, Library Value, and Cost
Beliefs. In the initial research plan, it was expected that questions designed to measure
attainment value (#10.1 – 10.4), intrinsic value (#10.5-10.6), and utility value (#11.7 –
11.8) (anticipated subconstructs of Library Value) would comprise their own factors.
However, due to the minimal number of items in two of the three proposed constructs for
Library Value, they were combined to measure Library Value as a single construct and
were found to have higher reliability when measured together (α = .92) in the present
study than when measured separately as noted for the original source instruments
(Attainment Value, α = .70; Intrinsic Value, α =.76; and Utility Value α =.62).
268

APPENDIX P
SOCIAL COGNITIVE CAREER SCALE AND SUBSCALE RELIABILITY AND
REVIEW OF NORMALITY
Scale Reliability
A reliability analysis was conducted on the full scale for measures related to the
Social Cognitive Career Theory as well as on each of the three subscale (Performance
Goals, Outcome Expectations, and Academic Self-Efficacy). Across the full scale,
reliability was found to be very good as measured by Cronbach’s alpha (α = .870). The
summary of item means (Mean=6.149) suggests items cluster towards the upper end of
the scale (desired mean for a 7-point scale = 4.0). Further, the average standard deviation
across the full scale (SD=1.286) falls below the minimum standard deviation threshold
for a 7-point scale (SD=1.5), suggesting there is less than optimal variability of scores
about the mean.
The mean of inter-item correlations (Mean = 0.395) suggests that correlation
between some items within the scale, though positive, may not be strong. This is not
unexpected, as the subscales within this full scale are intended to measure different
underlying constructs and items within one subscale are not necessarily intended to
strongly correlate with items in the other subscales. To assess whether the items
identified to comprise the primary subconstructs of the Social Cognitive Career Scale (1)
Performance Goals, (2) Outcome Expectations, and (3) Academic Self-Efficacy formed
reliable subscales, Cronbach’s alpha, corrected item total correlations, Cronbach’s alpha
if deleted, and mean of inter-item correlations were reviewed (see Appendix P – Table 1).
269

Reliability of Performance Goals was not assessed, as this construct is measured by a
single item. The items comprising the two other subscales, Outcome Expectations and
Academic Self-Efficacy, were found to have very good reliability, with Cronbach’s alpha
scores for both scales greater than α = .87, which fell very near the Cronbach’s alpha
scores for the original source instrument scales (see Appendix N). Corrected item total
correlations for all items in each subscale fell above the minimum desired threshold (r ≥
.40), suggesting the items forming each subscale “hang together” adequately. Cronbach’s
alpha if deleted scores for all items in each subscale fell below the identified Cronbach’s
alpha, with the exception of a single item (#20.5) in the Outcome Expectations subscale,
which had a Cronbach’s alpha if deleted score of 0.885 compared to the subscale
Cronbach’s alpha of 0.874. This was not a cause for concern, since the reliability was
strong overall, and the item was thought to be of value to the study. The means of interitem correlations for the Outcome Expectations and Academic Self-Efficacy subscales
exceeded the minimum threshold (r ≥ .40), with the lowest subscale inter-item correlation
(r =.595) for the Outcome Expectations subscale.

Review of Item Means and Standard Deviations
While the overall mean of item means (M=6.149) and mean standard deviation
(SD= 1.286) for the full scale and within each subscale suggest values fall noticeably
above the center of the scale and have little variability, analyses were conducted at the
item level to assess if any items require further review. As illustrated in Appendix P –
Table 2, the majority of item means fell noticeably above the desired threshold (M = 4.0
± 0.5), suggesting responses are negatively skewed. The standard deviations across all
items, with the exception of items #20.1 and 20.5, fell below the minimum desired
threshold (>1.5), suggesting inadequate variability about the mean.

Review of Subscale Normality
The three sub-scales of the Social Cognitive Career scale were further assessed
for normality by averaging the item scores within each subscale (except Performance
Goals which was measured by a single item) and reviewing the skew, kurtosis, and
percentile rankings (see Appendix P – Table 3). In addition, histograms and Q-Q plots
were created to aid with visual interpretation of the data. Analysis revealed the all
subconstructs were negatively skewed, suggesting values fall towards the upper end of
the scales. Further, while the Performance Goals and Outcome Expectations had an
acceptable level of kurtosis, the Academic Self-Efficacy scale fell well beyond the
acceptable range (7.49 compared to desired kurtosis range < ± 3.0), which suggests an
272

unexpectedly high spike of scores at the upper end of the scale. Further review of
percentile rankings revealed that scores fell much above the expected range of a normal
distribution. Visual review of the histograms and Q-Q plots further affirms a noticeable
deviation from normality for all subconstructs of the Social Cognitive Career scale. These
findings are not unexpected, nor do they elicit great cause for concern, as they merely
suggest that undergraduate students have, for the most part, high performance goals, high
outcome expectations for themselves, and a great deal of confidence that they will be
academically successful.

Conclusions of Reliability Analysis of Social Cognitive Career Scale and Subscales
Overall, the findings of this reliability analysis suggest the two subscales
(Outcome Expectations and Academic Self-Efficacy) plus the item measuring
Performance Goals have strong reliability based upon statistical findings for Cronbach’s
alpha scores, Cronbach’s alpha if deleted scores, and corrected item-total correlations.
Further review of descriptive statistics, including scale and item means, standard
deviations and measures of central tendency including skew, kurtosis, and percentile
rankings suggest the distributions for all three subconstructs reflect a deviation from
normality with each factor’s distribution having a noteworthy negative skew, suggesting

scores cluster at the high end of the scale and have very little deviation about the factor
means. Rankings at both the 50th and 75th percentile further denote a greater than average
cluster of scores at the higher end of the scale for each of the three subconstructs.
Interpretation of these findings suggest that participants are committed to graduating
from their universities, expect that their degrees will lead to future success, and are
confident that they will be academically successful while attending their universities.

APPENDIX Q
EDUCATIONAL BARRIERS SCALE PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS ANALYSIS,
SCALE RELIABILITY, AND REVIEW OF NORMALITY
Educational Barriers Scale – Review of Reliability and Normality
Scale Reliability – Full Scale
In addition to factors relating to social cognitive and career goals and selfefficacy, educational barriers were considered to be potentially important factors in
understanding undergraduate students’ information seeking needs, preferences,
behaviors, and motivation to utilize library resources (Kahn & Nauta, 2001; Lent et al.,
1994; Lent et al., 2000). To identify potential barriers that undergraduate students
perceive they will encounter during their time at their universities, Luzzo and
McWhirter’s 21-item Perception of Educational Barriers Scale (α = .93) was modified to
include 24 items included in the present study. Reliability analysis was conducted on the
full Educational Barriers scale as well as on four subscales that were identified through
Principal Components Analysis. All items were reverse coded for this reliability and
normality analysis so that they would align with scoring on factors relevant to the Social
Cognitive Career scale discussed above, thus high scores should be interpreted as
minimal barriers.
Across the full scale for Educational Barriers, initial reliability was found to be
excellent as measured by Cronbach’s alpha (α = .921) (see Appendix Q – Table 3). The
summary of item means (M=4.65) suggests items cluster very slightly towards the upper
end of the scale (desired mean for a 7-point scale = 4.0) (see Appendix Q – Table 4).
276

Further, the average standard deviation across the full scale (SD=1.953) falls above the
minimum standard deviation threshold for a 7-point scale (SD=1.5), suggesting there is
adequate variability of scores about the mean. The mean of Inter-Item Correlations (.375)
suggests that correlation between some items within the scale may not be strong, though
this is not unexpected, as the subscales within this full scale are intended to measure
different underlying constructs. All Cronbach’s alpha if deleted scores fall below the
Cronbach’s alpha for the full scale.
Principal Components Analysis
To determine if underlying constructs were present in the Educational Barriers
scale, a principal components analysis was conducted with a direct oblimin rotation.
Initially, a principal components analysis was conducted on the 24 items included in the
Educational Barriers scale, without rotation, using an Eigenvalues > 1.0 threshold (see
Appendix Q – Table 1) as well as a review of the corresponding scree plot (see Appendix
Q – Figure 1) to determine how many values to retain based upon the location of the
“elbow” in the plot. From review of Bartlett’s test of sphericity (p < .000), it was
determined that it was reasonable to proceed with the principal components analysis.
There were five factors for which Eigenvalues > 1.0, which explained 60.9% of the total
variance.

278

Appendix Q – Figure 1. Scree Plot to Determine Number of Factors to Retain
Review of the scree plot, however, proved ambiguous, as it was difficult to
ascertain whether four or five factors should be retained. The principal components
analysis was retained using five factors without rotation. However, the ending result was
a complex structure with many items loading on multiple factors and only 1 item loading
on the fifth factor within an acceptable limit (r ≥ .40). In an effort to approach a more
simple structure among factors, the analysis was rerun retaining only four factors and
using an oblimin rotation since it was suspected that some items were correlated with
each other. Retaining only four factors explained 56.53% of the total variance among
scores.
Upon review of the factor loadings achieved when retaining only four factors with
oblimin rotation, it was determined that a simple structure was achieved (see Appendix Q
279

– Table 2); 22 items loaded on a single factor, though two items did not load on any
factor (#27.13 and 28.31). These two items, as well as items #28.15 and 28.19, were
removed from further analysis, as it was determined that the wording of the questions
may have been unclear to participants. Additionally, item #28.18 (Other) was removed,
as it did not load on any factor, nor did it sensibly fit with the quantitative analysis. The
remaining 19 items were reviewed in accordance with the identified four factors and
factor labels were assigned: (1) Support from Others, (2) Financial Related Issues, (3)
Academic Readiness, and (4) Social Belonging and Mental Health.

Subscale Reliability
Reliability analyses were conducted on the modified full scale (eliminated 5 items
from the original scale) for measures related to Educational Barriers as well as on each of
the four subscales (Support from Others, Financial Related Issues, Academic Readiness,
and Social Belonging and Mental Health) (see Table 4). Across the full scale of 19 items,
reliability was found to be very good as measured by Cronbach’s alpha (α = .919). The
summary of item means (Mean=4.65) suggests items cluster towards the center of the
scale as is to be expected of a distribution approaching normality (desired mean for a 7point scale = 4.0). Further, the average standard deviation across the full scale
(SD=1.954) falls above the minimum standard deviation threshold for a 7-point scale
(SD=1.5), suggesting there is adequate variability of scores about the mean. The mean of
inter-Item correlations for the full scale (Mean = .379) suggests that correlation between
some items within the scale, though positive, may not be strong.
To assess whether the items identified to comprise the four newly identified
subconstructs of the Educational Barriers scale formed reliable subscales, Cronbach’s
alpha, Corrected Item Total Correlations, Cronbach’s alpha if Deleted, and Mean of
Inter-Item Correlations were reviewed (see Appendix Q – Table 3). Corrected item total
correlations for all items in each subscale fell above the minimum desired threshold (r ≥
.40) suggesting the items forming each subscale “hang together” adequately. Cronbach’s
alpha if deleted scores for all items in each subscale fell below the identified Cronbach’s
alpha for each subscale. The means of Inter-Item correlations for each of the subscales
exceeded the minimum threshold (r ≥ .40) with the exception of the full scale, for which
282

the mean of inter-item correlations was r=0.379. This is not of particular concern,
however, as each of the subscales measure different factors.

Review of Item Means and Standard Deviations
While the overall mean of item means (𝑋̅ = 4.65) and mean standard
deviation (SD= 1.95) for the full scale and within each subscale suggest values fall only
slightly above the center of the scale and have adequate variability about the mean,
analyses were conducted at the item level to assess if any items require further review. As
illustrated in Appendix Q – Table 4, item means in the Support from Others subscale fell
slightly above the desired threshold (M = 4.0 ± .50), suggesting a slight negative skew.
The majority of items in the other subscales fell very near 4.0 with the exception of item
#27.1 (Money Problems) and item #28.20 (Difficulty Managing Time) in the Academic
283

Readiness subscale, suggesting values for these items may cluster towards the lower end
of the scale across participants. The standard deviations across all items was above the
minimum desired threshold (>1.5), suggesting adequate variability about the mean.

Review of Subscale Normality
The four subscales of the Educational Barriers scale were further assessed for
normality by averaging the item scores within each subscale and reviewing the skew,
kurtosis, and percentile rankings (see Appendix Q – Table 5). Additionally, the four
subscale average scores were averaged to create a new Educational Barriers overall
average score. Histograms and Q-Q plots were also created to aid with visual
interpretation of the data

Subscales

Findings suggest all subscales and the overall scale had minimal skew and
kurtosis, as all values fell within the desired ranges of desirability (Skew < ± 1.0 and
286

Kurtosis < ± 3.0). Upon review of percentile rankings, all values fell very near the desired
ranges (50th percentile 4.0 ± 0.5 on a 7 point scale; 75th percentile 5.25 ± 0.5), with the
exception the Support from Others subscale, for which values clustered towards the upper
end of the scale across participants. Visual review of the histograms and Q-Q plots
further affirms a slight deviation from normality for the Support from Others subscale,
while all other scales appeared to approach normality.
Conclusions of Reliability Analysis of Expectancy-Value Library Motivation Scale
and Subscales
Overall, the findings of this reliability analysis suggest the four subscales
comprising the Educational Barriers Scale (1) Support from Others, (2) Financial Related
Issues, (3) Academic Readiness, and (4) Social Belonging and Mental Health have
respectable to very good reliability based upon statistical findings for Cronbach’s alpha
scores, Cronbach’s alpha if deleted scores, and corrected item-total correlations. Further
review of descriptive statistics, including scale and item means, standard deviations,
skew, kurtosis, and percentile rankings suggest data are largely distributed as expected
across the scale, with a slight diversion from normality for the Support from Others
subscale, which has a slightly greater than average cluster of scores at the upper end of
the scale. The strong reliability of these four subscales further affirms the decision based
upon the Principal Components Factors Analysis findings to analyze the data within the
realm of these four factors. Analysis of the full scale further revealed that the scale has
excellent reliability when the four items initially included in the assessment were
removed (28.15, 28.18, 28.19, and 28.31) due to misfit with the other items in the scale
and/or poor wording. Based upon analysis of normality of the combined average score for
287

Educational Barriers, the findings suggest the distribution approaches normality, has
negligible skew, kurtosis, and values fall as desired for both the 50th and 75th percentiles.

APPENDIX U
MEMBER CHECKING – SAMPLE EMAIL TO UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS
Dear (Name of Participant):
Thank you for your participation earlier this Spring in a one-on-one interview with me as
part of my dissertation research relating to undergraduate students' information seeking
needs, preferences, and motivation. As part of this study, I have collected data at three
large public universities including interviews with academic librarians (n=8), university
retention officials (n=3), undergraduate students (n=18), and an online undergraduate
survey (n=1278).
A bulleted summary list of my key findings from the student interviews is provided
below. A more comprehensive summary report of my findings from these interviews is
also attached. Would you be willing to scan the list below and let me know if you
concur with these findings? If not, I welcome your further input or clarifications.

7.

Motivation to Use the Library
Undergraduate students find Google to be more convenient and easier to use than
online library resources (n=12).
Undergraduate students’ use of online library resources is primarily driven by
course assignment requirements and professor expectations (n=9)
Some students gravitate towards the library’s online library resources for course
related research because they value the quality and credibility of these resources
over what can be found online through Google (n=7).
The physical library is primarily used by students as a place for quiet and/or
collaborative study (n=9).
The library is valued by many students as a place to access computers and
technology (n=4).
Students have been successful in past attempts at searching online library
materials for course assignments (n=10).
Students expect to be successful the next time they use the library’s online
resources. (n=15).

Social Cognitive Information Needs of Undergraduate Students
1. Students need (or want) information:
a. To help them complete their course assignments (n=6).
b. About how to find and navigate campus resources and services (n=6).
c. About news and current events (n=7).
2. Common educational barriers for undergraduate student success include:
a.
“Lack of Academic Readiness” (n=12).
307

b.
c.
d.
e.
f.
g.

“Poor Time Management” (n=10)
“Being Underprepared for Living Independently” (n=6)
“Financial Issues” (n=5)
For some students, college is a “poor fit” (n=5).
“Need for more in-depth advising” (n=4).
“Difficulty developing a sense of belonging” (n=4)

3. Undergraduate students are:
a.
Confident that they will be academically successful at their universities
(n=16).
b.
Confident that they will find satisfying work in their fields after graduation
(n=8).
c.
Split nearly 50/50 with respect to their commitment to graduating from their
particular universities (Committed n=6/Not Committed n=7).
Undergraduate Student Information Seeking Preferences
1. Google is the preferred information source for Everyday Life Information Seeking
(n=16).
2. Google is a preferred information source for Academic Information Seeking
(n=7).
3. Online Library Resources are important sources for Academic Information
Seeking (n=8).
4. Course materials such as textbooks and articles provided by the instructor are
popular sources for Academic Information Seeking (n=5).
5. A smartphone is the most preferred technology tool for Everyday Life
Information Seeking (n=9).
6. A laptop is the most preferred technology tool for Academic Information Seeking
(n=16).
Feasibility of Revised Library Model as Campus Information Hub
1. Students feel that they would use and value the academic library as a place to
address the everyday life information needs that are important to undergraduate
students. (n=14).
NOTE: This exercise, called Member Checking, is a qualitative research validation
technique to help improve the validity or accuracy of a study. In this approach, the
investigator takes summaries of the findings back to key participants in the study and
asks them whether the findings are an accurate reflection of their experiences. (Creswell
and Plano Clark, 2011, Designing and Conducting Mixed Methods Research, p. 211).
Thank you for your time and consideration.
