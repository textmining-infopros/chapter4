ABSTRACT
Discontent with the term “special libraries” has pervaded the library and information field
since the formation of the Special Library Association and the term's widely adopted usage in
1909. The literature related to special libraries has reflected this debate over the precise meaning
and nature of special libraries for just as many years. This project considers the historical dialog
regarding the varied definitions of special libraries that librarians and information professionals
have been engaged in for more than a century. Using systematic review, the scholarly and
professional literature is examined and analyzed to track definitional and descriptive
characteristics of special libraries in the United States to identify how and why changes have
occurred over time. Results reveal strong correlations between definition changes and shifting
movements in broader library and United States history, especially in relation to the emergence
and application of technological advances. Along with encouraging renewed discussion about the
boundaries of what we in the field consider special librarianship, this study confirms that rather
than permanent and rigid definitions, special libraries have always had dynamic definitions that
react to the changing technologies and practices of the profession.

1. INTRODUCTION
"It is the narrowest portion of the whole library world and at the same time, seen from
another angle, it becomes the broadest - narrow in that an individual special library is
confined to some special interest or to the literature of one business or one subject; broad
in that the opportunities for special libraries are as wide as the activities of men."
-- Ruth Savord, 1950

Background & Problem Statement
Special libraries are defined in many ways, often with a focus on excluding specific types
of libraries (such as academic, school, and public libraries) as a way of making “special library”
a catchall term for every library that does not fit into the other categories. Because definitions
encompass so many different types of libraries, it is difficult to define special libraries by what
they are rather than what they are not, and this apophatic way of defining them – libraries which
are not academic, school, or public libraries – is also frequently the simplest. With such elusive
definitions and continued debate over the term, confusion about the nature and value of special
libraries arises both outside of and from within the information profession.
Literature on special libraries is disposed to describe at the outset just what a special
library is. Tara E. Murray confirms that “every author writing about special libraries, it seems,
must begin with a definition.”1 Wide-ranging and ambiguous from the earliest prevalent usage of
the term, the delineation of standards for exactly which libraries are to be included in the
discussion of special libraries must be identified before one engages in an analysis of almost any

issue regarding them. And though many authors have put forth definitions, very few are in full
agreement as to exact the nature of special libraries.
Arising from this need to set parameters in the literature itself, the glut of definitions for
special libraries has made the understanding of the term less exact instead of more, the term
having “lost any very precise meaning.”2 David Shumaker, writing recently in 2009, echoes this
thought by stating that “the imprecision of the term ‘special library’ continues to provoke
discussions in the field and beyond.”3 And Elin Christianson agrees that “the precise definition
of special library is one of the unresolved issues of librarianship.”4 One of the founders and first
president of the Special Libraries Association (SLA), John Cotton Dana, was apprehensive about
the term as the organization began in 1909 and conveyed a hope that a better label could be
found.5 Shumaker reflects on Dana’s trepidation by calling the term “something of a
compromise.”6 In fact, SLA has attempted to change its name twice7 in the over one hundred
year history of the organization,8 and Dana’s default term has not been replaced or improved
upon. One could argue that at this point, with over one hundred years of usage, it is thought of as
a traditional name that is not likely ever to be replaced, based on precedent alone.

Need for the Study
The special library remains an enigma in the library and information field and among the
general public today in large part due to the arguable answer to the question of exactly what is a
special library. Outlined in the following pages, this project tracks the historical definitions of
special libraries found in the professional literature and scholarship to explore how and why
those definitions have changed over time. A historical, qualitative, and quantitative survey of the
literature that references or provides a definition of special libraries (or an equivalent term,
which will be discussed later), this study can aid in the understanding of how special libraries
have been viewed historically and provide an assessment of how those views have changed over
time. This understanding and assessment can inform the information profession about whether
the current predominantly accepted definitions are appropriate or, perhaps, continue to need
attention and discussion.

Research Question and Expected Results
This project is guided by the following research question: how have special libraries been
defined historically, and in what way have those definitions changed over time? Using sources of
literature that are scholarly or professional, written in English and about libraries in the United
States, and date only as far back as the formation of SLA in 1909, the scope of this study is
reasonably limited and conducive to the success of the research process.
Results anticipated at the outset of the study are a likely revelation of a strong correlation
between the change in definitions to developing technologies, innovations, and social
movements in the library and information science field, and general historical events. The

3

implications of these results are interpretation and enhancement of the historical narrative of
special libraries.

Purpose of the Study/Objectives
This study was designed to achieve three goals. First, it expands on and adds to the
existing historical literature on special libraries as well as enhances the historical narrative of
special libraries. Second, it examines and describes how special libraries fit within the library
and information community in the United States. And third, it endeavors to reinvigorate
discussion and debate beyond a cursory, introductory interest about how special libraries have
been and still are defined within and outside the library and information profession.
The purpose of this project should not be misunderstood; in no way does it seek to
redefine special libraries or produce a new, improved designation for special libraries. The
purpose of the study is simply to track definitional changes and usage of terms over time in order
to describe special libraries within the greater, general history of libraries in the United States,
and to interpret the means through which variations have occurred.

Audience and Motivation for Writing
The audience for whom this thesis is most suited is any information professional,
especially those who work in special libraries, are members of SLA, or have an interest in special
libraries in the United States, their history, or American library history in general. Graduate
students interested in pursuing a career in special librarianship or any other related professional
or academic information field may also find the study useful.

4

Motivation for the study began as both an academic and professional interest in special
libraries, special collections, and archives. After examining only a handful of scholarly pieces
written on special libraries, the academic curiosity of the researcher was piqued in discovering
and observing the incidence of diversity and divergence in the conceptual and practical
understandings associated with defining and labeling special libraries. The lack of a clear-cut,
universally acknowledged definition presented the researcher with a fascinating puzzle that has
been explored for over one hundred years.

Scope and Limitations
The scope of this thesis is large, though constrained by a number of factors. First, that
which is studied in the following pages is simply any definition of special libraries found in the
selected literature. This means that though more information often accompanies a definition
given in an article or monograph, that information is not what is of interest here. Second,
examined are those works of academic and professional literature written in English from the
years 1909 to 2014. This, along with studying only works written about special libraries in the
United States, limits the research to what is reasonably within the researcher’s grasp of
obtaining, either online or physically from a library. Last, the primary limitations of this study
depend upon the choice of literature being restricted to materials found or accessed through the
library services and online databases of the University of Alabama. This limitation is in place for
the two following reasons: (1) for the benefit of the researcher who has access to the University
of Alabama Libraries as an enrolled graduate student, and (2) to aid in keeping the scope
manageable for the length time in which the research is conducted. Because the University of
Alabama is in the United States, the majority of literature sources necessarily pertain to special

5

libraries in the United States, and this, too, became a limitation essential to the success of the
research.

Assumptions
Assumptions regarding this project are related to the nature of historical research in
general, concerns about unpredicted data, and clarification of the purpose of the project (see
above). Any type of historical research is by its very nature a narrative of some aspect of the
past, usually formulated by an individual not directly involved. As Felix Reichmann points out,
historical analysis is both scientific and artistic, requiring “both head and heart.”9 This study tells
the story of special libraries through the narrowly focused lens of literary definition.
Another idea that must be considered is openness of the researcher to unexpected data
gathered during the research process. A research question is typically accompanied by a
hypothesis, but data that do not correspond to the hypothesis cannot be ignored. The research
question guiding this project is open-ended enough to allow for surprising data that might yield
unpredictable results and lead to unforeseen conclusions.

Order of Presentation
There are four sections that follow, which are the Literature Review, the Methodology
and Procedures, the Results and Discussion, and the Conclusion. The Literature Review begins
with a brief presentation of the history of special libraries, starting with the ancient world and
quickly focusing on their appearance in the United States and their growth throughout the
twentieth century. It then outlines how special libraries have been described in the literature,

including the established criterion used in definitions and other terms used for special libraries.
The next part reports on the theoretical and methodological basis of the project. And, finally, this
section discusses three instances in which the definition of special libraries was directly debated
in the surveyed literature.
The Methodology and Procedures section first describes in detail the population and
sample used in the study. Next it explains the overall research design by clarifying the
instrumentation and tools used for the project, the data gathering and data entry procedures, and
the procedures involved in how the data is analyzed. The last part of this section defines key
operational terms used in the study, which include alternate terms for “special library” and the
terms used in coding the definitions prior to analysis.
Results and Discussion is the section that presents the study’s findings in four areas. A
general examination of the definitions gathered is measured by decade and against the total
number. Characteristics are then explored categorically by the following groupings: top three
most occurring, three related groups, and sub-characteristics within two individual
characteristics. The top four decades in which the most definitions were gathered is the next
focal point, while the final analysis compares the oldest decade surveyed to the newest (19091919 vs. 2010-2014).
The last section is the Conclusion, and it connects the initial research question and
hypothesis to the results of the study. It allows for a summary of the research project as a whole
and the calculated findings. The significance and implications of the results and how the project
fits within the information field are also discussed. And this section closes with suggestions for
further research.

2. LITERATURE REVIEW
There is a wealth of literature, from the time of the first publication of SLA’s Special
Libraries through its current iteration Information Outlook, which references special libraries,
and attempts to define and analyze those definitions. The literature that is reviewed here deals
directly with definitions of special libraries that are composed mostly of secondary sources that
analyze or formulate new definitions based on previously documented definitions.
A short introduction to the history of special libraries is given first, which will outline
their origins in the ancient world and their modern counterparts in the United States at the turn of
the 20th century through the present day. A discussion will follow that delineates the ways in
which special libraries are defined in the literature and describe some recognized attributes and
alternate terms for special libraries. The theoretical and methodological basis of the study is
discussed next, and, concluding, three cases of direct deliberation of the definition of special
libraries in the literature are described.

A Brief History of Special Libraries
When defined in the broadest scope, as Dana did in 1914 by writing that “it may be said,
of course, that every library is in a measure special,”1 Bierbaum correctly asserts that “in some
ways, the earliest libraries were special libraries because they were designed for the spiritual or

Dana (Washington, DC: Special Libraries Association, 1991): 61.

intellectual support of a limited and specific clientele.”2 Eugene B. Jackson contends that special
libraries can “trace their roots to ancient times and the medieval period” and gives as examples
English libraries dating back to the sixth century, Dutch libraries established in the seventeenth
century, and Russian and French special libraries founded in the eighteenth century.3 Ada
Winifred Johns claims the earliest origin for special libraries in the royal libraries of
Mesopotamia.4 What most of these early examples have in common is the limited or special
clientele served by the library or the subject matter collected.
Special libraries – and libraries in general – proliferated in the nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries thanks to the production and spread of printed materials and the industrial
revolution that swept both North America and Europe. Bierbaum puts it simply: “The full effect
of the industrial revolution and the impetus of expanding commerce and industry created an
increased need for recent, narrowly focused information.”5 Special libraries in this period were
mostly business and science oriented, supporting engineering and production companies. The
American Library Association (ALA) was established in 1876, and by the end of the nineteenth
century the specialized library associations of the National Association of State Libraries and the
Medical Library Association had been formed, and, following in 1906, the American Association
of Law Libraries.
With the rise of these specialized libraries and their respective professional associations,
SLA was founded in 1909 when a group of librarians led by John Cotton Dana expressed a

desire to form a separate professional community and associate themselves apart from ALA.
Elizabeth Ferguson emphasizes the new term that literature adopts with the formation of SLA
and its constitution in claiming that was when “the term ‘Special Library’ came into being.”6
Though this project focuses on the United States, it is instructive to point out that the United
Kingdom also formed an association for special libraries in 1924 called the Association of
Special Libraries and Information Bureaux (ASLIB), today known as The Association for
Information Management.
Bill M. Woods, writing in the mid-1970s, and Eugene B. Jackson, writing in the mid1980s, both divide the history regarding special libraries in the United States into three periods:
the first hundred years, 1840-1940; the World War II and post-war years, 1941-1951; and the
later years, 1952-1972.7 The first period includes the formation of multiple library associations
and saw special libraries characterized as “special subject or professional collections primarily
affiliated with universities,”8 as well as by services that offered “greater depth of analysis of
materials and active dissemination measures were emphasized.”9 The second period, during
WWII and after, was distinguished by “the need for quick and accurate information… imperative
within the charge to develop and produce rapidly materials, equipment, and services needed to
win the war.”10 The last period signified great growth in sheer numbers of special libraries,

though Woods cautions that growth in numbers can be deceiving: “The mortality rate of special
libraries is one of the realities with which those who choose special librarianship must be
prepared to cope.”11 Jackson does not add much to fill in the years between 1972 and the time of
his publication in 1986, only that special libraries tend to rise and fall with their parent
organizations, depending on them entirely for their existence and growth.12
The documentation movement of the 1950s is thought of as a rival or challenger to
special libraries, though the thrust of the movement took place in and came from the United
Kingdom and Europe. The movement focused on the improvement of information systems that
could essentially democratize the dissemination and availability of information through the use
of innovative technologies. This often took the form of sweeping bibliographic and database
projects, particularly in regards to amassing large catalogs of scientific data.13 Robert V.
Williams and Martha Jane K. Zachert assert that the movement “emphasized the use of new
technologies for detailed indexing of source documents and advocated in-house ‘documentation
centers.’”14 Williams also claims that “special librarians were the first American
documentalists.”15 Though the rivalry sometimes resembled a near alliance (the documentation
movement’s organization, the American Society for Information Science,16 discussed merging

Also known as ASIS in the 1950s, and today called American Society for Information Science and

11

with SLA at one time), Williams and Zachert contend that ultimately the documentation
movement led special libraries “to recognize the importance of new technologies for improved
access to information.”17
The 1960s and 70s were characterized by the rapid growth of special libraries. Manil
Silva, writing during the period, stresses that “the remarkable growth of special libraries is
evidence of the realization and acceptance of the need and consequent great demand for them. It
has been increasingly realized that the establishment of special libraries is the only means of
assembling and recording the increased flow of literature on special subjects.”18 This period also
had special libraries and librarians move away from the traditional library model. Ellis Mount
and Renee Massoud discuss the rise of the “information center” as a replacement for some
special libraries and describe them as “special libraries with a very narrow scope, a special sort
of special library.”19 And Murray argues that by embracing evolving technologies and electronic
resources during this period, special libraries have never quite gotten back to being comfortable
being cast as traditional libraries. She claims that there is “a shift in focus from librarians to
information professionals, including a growing contingent of consultants and others doing
information work outside of the traditional library setting. In many fields, a substantial on-site
physical collection is no longer required to satisfy the information needs of an organization.”20
Shumaker echoes this and insists that:
The special library arose as a distinct type of library because organizations needed units
to acquire the specialized information relevant to their activities, organize that
information, and provide customized services to get it to the right people at the right time.

The special library developed and prospered in proportion to its ability to deliver on this
value proposition. In the past twenty years [1989-2009], however, advances in
information technology and changes in the nature of work have altered this value
proposition.21
Where the 1960s and 1970s were decades that necessitated the growth of special libraries
and gave special librarians a sense of validation in the midst of social and political upheaval in
the United States, librarians in the late 1970s also anticipated the technological changes that
came in the 1980s. The years 1979 and 1980, perhaps in expectation of the start of the new
decade, yielded much literature that speculated on the future of special libraries, often focusing
on what the library of the future would be like in terms of patrons, equipment, space, and
materials. In this “golden age” of special libraries, special librarians in the 1980s seemed to come
into their own by embracing new technologies and “[having] an interest in playing a leading role
as society transitioned into this new era of information, knowledge and strategic learning.”22 St.
Clair calls the 1980s “the information age” and asserts that “business and research turned to
[special librarians] for assistance and guidance in keeping up with all the changes brought about
in this new epoch.”23
The 1990s and 2000s saw the virtualization of the library and information world, and this
era might be called the “internet age.” Computerized information technologies of the 1980s
paved the way for the shift to online information dissemination in the following decades, and
proliferation of internet access and increasing computer literacy of the general public also led to
changes for special libraries. Matarazzo and Prusak published two studies which outlined the

evolution of user computer skills, finding that between the year 199024 and 199525 the
importance of electronic database searching by the library went down from 80% to 48%,
meaning that patrons were able to use the databases and find what information they needed
without the aid of the library. Matarazzo and Connolly concluded in 1999 that “it has become
clear that we are being charged with the mission to explore and implement new and innovative
methods to encourage sharing and to better manage information.”26

Special Libraries Defined: Established Criteria and Terms
The focus of this project is on how special libraries are historically defined within the
library and information field, specifically in the scholarly and professional literature starting
from the time of the foundation of SLA in 1909 and its scholarly magazine, Special Libraries
(now Information Outlook). The earliest definition in the literature comes from John Cotton
Dana himself, and therefore can be considered the basis for all other definitions: “all small
special libraries, financial, commercial, scientific, industrial; and special departments of state,
college and general libraries … all libraries devoted to a special purpose and serving a limited
clientele.”27 Skinner is quick to point out that “a short survey of the literature reveals a
bewildering diversity of definitions and connotations of the term ‘special library,’” and that the
examples of special libraries listed in Dana’s definition hardly resemble other contemporary lists

– they are all different.28 Proving Skinner’s point are the examples of special libraries listed in
the original 1909 SLA Constitution: “The object of the Association is to promote the interests of
the commercial, industrial, technical, civic, municipal and legislative reference libraries, the
special departments of the public libraries, universities, welfare associations and business
organizations.”29 In fact, Skinner says, “Dana’s 1910 statement appears to be based as much
upon the earnest desire of librarians of his day to carve a foothold in the professional worlds of
those who were ‘putting knowledge to work.’”30
Williams and Zachert allege that at the core of the early definitions for special libraries
was a concentration on the collections themselves, the specific subject or topic collected: “Much
of the discussion focused on the concept of ‘collection’: since a library was a collection – and
therefore logically, a special library. This reasoning made sense … because it emphasized the
nature of the collection in these libraries.”31 But the emphasis of definition also shifted early on
to focus on services provided, thanks to John A. Lapp and Richard H. Johnston who “believed
that the key aspect of the special library was anticipation of user needs in advance of the actual
need and getting relevant information to the decision makers.”32 Williams and Zachert credit this
shift to the larger library movement in arguing that “this change in the focus of definition, from

collection to services provided, was a crucial and revolutionary development in the library
world.”33
Writers of literature regarding special libraries attribute various criteria that make up
definitions of special libraries. Surveyed here are six different works that list special library
definition criteria, itemized in chronological order by date of publication:


Johns (1968): Special libraries are characterized by “defined and limited subject, form or
clientele … include[s] collections that are of a minority type in the library world, [and] do
not fit in with any existing groupings.”34



Silva (1970): Differentiating characteristics of special libraries: location, subject scope,
material, clientele, and function.35



Skinner (1980): Considerations in evaluating characteristics of special libraries: “1. The
function of the library, in relation to the mission of the parent organization. 2. The
information needs of the library’s users. 3. The use made of the information.”36



Jackson (1986): “For the first twenty-five years of the twentieth century, special libraries
had these characteristics: (a) use of all forms of recorded information, (b) scope limited to
the prime interests of the host organization, and (c) active reference service as the prime
function.”37



Bierbaum (1993): Special libraries defined by characteristics and function: size, setting,
funding, collections, and clientele.38



Mount and Massoud (1999): Characteristics of special libraries to consider:
organizational names, size, salaries, collection sizes, location of facilities, services
offered, relations with top management, and duties of professionals.39

Most of these lists involve judgment of the collection itself, library users being served, and
considerations regarding the parent organization.
Another factor to consider in evaluating the literature about special libraries is the
terminology used by distinct writers. Special libraries generally exist within a larger organization
or company, and Bierbaum breaks these groups into three categories: profit/proprietary, nonprofit, and government.40 But different sources use different words for these groups. Bierbaum
calls these bodies “parent organizations.”41 Mount and Massoud state that special libraries are
“sponsored by” groups such as private companies, government agencies, and other organizations
and associations.42 Shumaker refers to special libraries as “sponsored by a parent institution,”43
and Stephen C. Boss and Glen S. Cook call these organizations “stakeholders.”44
Terminology for special libraries also varies widely across the literature and over time.
The use of the words library and librarian in relation to special libraries came into debate early

on in SLA’s existence. Conflict with ALA over what some in the association considered
appropriation of the term “librarian” came to a head in 1921 when a joint meeting with SLA had
to be called to resolve the matter.45 Some special libraries were beginning to be known as
“information centers” in the 1960s and 70s as technologies were advancing and in an attempt to
move away from a perceived old fashioned notion of a library.46 Despite Williams and Zachert’s
insistence in 2009 that special libraries and librarians sought a move back to traditional
terminology as early as the 1980s,47 Murray, writing in 2013, asserts that “outside of the
Association’s name, none of the words ‘library,’ ‘librarian,’ or ‘special’ appear anywhere in
SLA’s current mission, vision, and core values statements.”48

Theoretical Base
The theoretical basis for this project must rest on the theories of history relating to the
whole of the library and information science discipline. Wayne A. Wiegand and Donald G.
Davis Jr. sum it up clearly by asserting that “the history of the library as an institution cannot be
reduced to a single theory nor reflect a single philosophy.”49 But many writers express the need
to study the past to prepare for the present and beyond. Wiegand and Davis declare that “the
global library community cannot prudently plan its future unless it knows its present; it cannot

know its present unless it has a sound understanding of its past.”50 R. James King reminds
readers that each library is unique and that “in order to better understand the potential future, we
must first understand the rich past on which we are built as well as the current environment.”51
Estelle Broadman makes the larger claim that “a study of the history of a special library is a
study of the culture and beliefs of the society it represents at a particular period of that society’s
development.”52

Methodological Base
Like most historical research, the methodology of historical research into special libraries
takes the form of gathering data from primary and secondary sources. Anthony Kruzas published
studies in the 1960s in which he used directories to track the development and growth of special
libraries in areas such as location, size of the institution, and subject concentrations.53 Jackson
conducted a similar study in 1986, almost an update of the Kruzas project, using directories from
1985.54 Johns used primary sources to extensively cover the development of and compare special
libraries in the US, the UK, and Australia.55 Frank E. McKenna compiled a list of 30 definitions

of special libraries in his 1978 Encyclopedia of Library and Information Science entry and
devised a successive set of “five fundamental levels of development of special libraries.”56
Other authors compile timelines and chronologies, or compare special libraries to other
types of libraries. Skinner compared special libraries to academic libraries and found that
academic libraries have a teaching mission, designed to “complement, supplement and illustrate
the teaching activities of the faculty,” while special libraries are involved in research activities of
the parent organization, as a member of the team and have a “real world” mission.57 Case studies
are also used to define special libraries. Broadman used her experience with medical libraries to
explain special libraries through the example of the National Library of Medicine.58
Jackson affirms the need for historical research on the subject of special libraries by
stating that “as a branch of the information professions that has generally been more concerned
with the practicalities of the profession than with study of its past, special libraries appear to lack
the kind of historical treatment that other types of libraries have attracted.”59 Special libraries
have changed dramatically from the time of SLA’s formation, and not least in the way that they
are defined. Guy St. Clair, writing in 2009 for the hundredth anniversary of SLA’s founding,
argues that SLA and special libraries are and have always been about change and embracing new
ways to serve the organizations to which they belong.60 Mount and Massoud tell readers not to

put too much stock in names or terms used for special libraries, because they will always change
with the times. They agree with St. Clair that “regardless of labels, the development of
information services is a dynamic process, not a static one.”61 As special libraries continue
advance, evolve, and develop new and better ways to disseminate information, likewise the
definition of special libraries will remain in flux.

Three Dialogs: Definitions Debated in the Literature
As previously stated, the many different ways to define special libraries have been like an
open and continuing dialog among those in the library and information profession. While many
authors provide, reference, or synthesize various definitions of special libraries in the literature –
in this dialog – it has not been that direct debate and critique often occurs. Three such instances
are presented here that have arisen within the literature where writers directly address other
writers’ discussions or critiques regarding definitions of special libraries.
In 1912, in just the third volume of Special Libraries, a number of the founding fathers of
SLA engaged in discourse about the nature and characteristics of special libraries as they saw
them near the beginning of their newly-formed association. Originally an actual spoken
exchange at the SLA meeting in Ottawa, Canada, on June 27, 1912, the discussion between M. S.
Dudgeon, A. G. S. Josephson, William P. Cutter, John A. Lapp, Guy E. Marion, and C. A.
George is transcribed and printed in Special Libraries under the title “What is a Special
Library?”62 Dudgeon begins the conversation by comparing special libraries to reference

Cutter, W. P., C. A. George, A. G. S. Josephson, John A. Lapp, and Guy E. Marion. "What is a Special
Library?" Special Libraries 3, no. 7 (September 1912): 145-149.

21

libraries and making the case that though they have similarities, they are entirely different
entities. Josephson’s lengthy contribution continues Dudgeon’s comparison motif and argues that
special libraries are established for a specific purpose, “to fill a real need,”63 where general
libraries have no such mandate. He goes on to outline a special library’s difference from a
general library by asserting that special libraries employ special methods and materials. And he
contends that a special librarian need not be primarily a specialist, but that “a librarian must first
of all be a librarian.”64 Cutter joins the conversation briefly to add a qualifier to Dudgeon and
Josephson’s comparisons, asserting that “I consider a special library as one which serves people
who are doing things, and a reference library one which serves people who are thinking things.
The former are not thinking about doing things, they are already doing them.”65 Lapp, who
edited Special Libraries for a number of years, offers insights into what he sees as the most
distinctive characteristic of special libraries in explaining that “we deal with material that is not
in print. We manufacture it. We many times must color it with our own opinions.”66 He also
praises Cutter’s idea of “people who are doing things” and remarks that “this is the age of
efficiency. I believe that the librarian is the efficiency engineer.”67 Marion, who would go on to
be SLA president in 1918-1919, focuses on the community aspect of SLA and interrelations with
other types of libraries by pointing out the interest of public librarians in the organization.68

George is the voice of dissent in this conversation as he expresses confusion over SLA and the
special library’s role in the library profession: “I confess I am a little bit at sea as to the whole
scope of this particular association.”69 He asks more than once what the goal is of coming
together to be identified as a separate population of libraries. Additionally, he expresses concern
that if, as Lapp discussed, special librarians are dealing with material not in print then that is
overreaching the function of a librarian. Dudgeon answers George by conceding that the question
“seems to me to be a little bit indefinite and hard to answer,” but he contends that “we are
specialized in getting knowledge out of books and out of the experience of others into the hands
of workers rather than into the hands of people who are just thinking about working. It seems to
me that it is quite distinct although hard to distinguish.”70
The second dialog took place at the end of 1937 when Rebecca B. Rankin wrote a letter
to the editor of Special Libraries in volume 28 entitled “Finally – A Definition of Special
Library.”71 In it she summarizes the work a group of special librarians for the Committee on
Library Terminology of ALA to determine a definition of a special library that was to be
included in an upcoming ALA glossary. Rankin, who had been SLA president in 1922-1923,
reports that the group recommended a list of sixty terms to be incorporated into the definition,
but the Committee kept just seven. The following definition, printed near the end of the letter, is
one for which Rankin credits Linda H. Morely with compiling from the group’s various
attempts:

A special library is a service organized to make available all experience and knowledge
that will further the activities and common objectives of an organization or other
restricted group, with a staff having adequate knowledge in the field of specialization and
of the activities of the clientele, as well as professional preparation. Its function is (1) to
assemble information from published sources both within and without the library, (2) to
secure information directly by correspondence and interview from individuals and
organizations specializing in particular fields, and (3) to present this information at the
appropriate time and place on the initiative of the library as well as upon request, that it
may take an effective part in the work of the organization or group served.
Policies, methods, and collections vary, on the one hand according to the library's
subject interests: economics or business, social sciences, science and technology, or the
fine arts; and, on the other hand, according to type of organization of which the library is
a part: a corporation, association, or institution, government office or a general library
having definitely decentralized departments.72
It is a complex definition, and it seems that they were hoping this definition would cover just
about every special library in existence at the time. It is 183 words long, comprises two
paragraphs, and contains characterization by collection subject matter, parent organization, and
three primary functions. At the end of the letter, Rankin invites all the members of SLA to weigh
in on the definition by writing to the editor of Special Libraries with any criticisms or
improvements.
In the next volume of the journal, published in 1938, Rankin received four responses. In
issue one from January, Donald Coney and Isabel L. Towner both wrote to the editor. Coney, a
librarian at the University of Texas, confesses that in teaching a course at the University of
Illinois he “was obliged to fabricate a definition of special libraries,” and he acknowledges early
in his letter that he is “[taking] advantage of the invitation for criticism to take issue with
[Rankin’s] definition on what is, perhaps, a minor point.”73 He goes on to object to the word
“organization” in the first sentence of the definition, arguing that “it is too general a term to

72

Rankin, 372.

73

Donald Coney, “Definitions to the Fore!” in Special Libraries 29, no. 1 (January 1938): 25.

24

apply to one with as limited a connotation as has ‘special libraries.’”74 He seems to fall into the
opposite camp of Rankin and her group, which is those who do not agree that the definition
should be broad enough to cover every single possible special library, especially at the expense
of clarity and comprehension. Coney ends his letter by accusing Rankin’s group of writing
“propaganda” into their definition by including the words “professional preparation,” suggesting
that the words are self-serving and make it “not an impartial definition.”75 Alternatively, Towner
praises the efforts of Rankin’s group to assemble such a comprehensive definition, but she
complains of the length. She offers this condensed version instead:

A special library gives library service to any organization or specialized group by making
available through a trained staff all information from all sources, published or otherwise,
on the subject or subjects of interest or importance to the organization or group. The
organization may have commercial, economic, social or other purposes and may consist
of a corporation, association, institution, government office or department of a general
library.76
Issue two featured one peculiar response to Rankin – peculiar in that its author, Ione M.
Dority, does not actually mention the definition put forth by Rankin’s group, but employs
another definition entirely to comment on what characteristics make up special libraries. Dority
singles out two functions of special libraries, those being: “selecting, summarizing, collecting
and compiling information” and “the carrying of information to the clientele.”77 In concluding

25

her letter, Dority finally alludes to the definition printed in volume 28 and asks, “can a definition
or a statement of special libraries be formulated which recognizes these distinctions?”78
The last response to Rankin’s letter came in issue three and directly addressed Coney’s
statements on propaganda in the definition. Marie Louise Prevost writes that there will always be
confusion until the profession can agree “that there are two sides to the shield of a ‘special
library’” and that “a definition stretched to completely cover both types may be neither feasible
or desirable.”79 While correcting Coney’s “misconception,” Prevost also seems to be in
agreement with him that no one single definition of special libraries can embrace all those who
proclaim or are proclaimed to be one. What two characteristic ideas Prevost offers and says may
overlap at times are these, “(1) A library service to the members or employees of an
organization, located on its premises, financed by the purse which pays the persons served… (2)
A Library of literature on a specific subject.”80
The third dialog spans at least seven years and began in 1943 when Rankin’s team, with
Morley at the head, published a short monograph called Contributions Toward a Special Library
Glossary81 which compiled all the definitions of terminology that they believed to be germane to
special libraries. In the preface, Morley reasons that the need for the glossary is “not merely an
academic matter,” and explains that terminology delineation is essential in helping those in the
library field understand what special libraries do and what makes special libraries different from

other libraries, and also the viewpoint of special librarians.82 What is interesting about the
definition supplied in the book is that it is an update of the definition Rankin previously put forth
in Special Libraries, and instead of being condensed, as some suggested, it is actually expanded
to explain the different organization types that might employ special libraries. The entirety of the
definition is as follows:

Special Library: a service organized to make available whatever experience and
knowledge that will further the specific activities of a particular organization or limited
group, all members of which have a common objective; requiring on the part of the
library staff familiarity with the activities of the clientele and knowledge in the field of
specialization, as well as of library policies and techniques. Its primary functions are (1)
to maintain a continuing survey and evaluation of current publications, research in
progress, and activities of individual authorities, on behalf of its clientele; (2) to organize
the sources of both written and unwritten experience and knowledge from the specialist
viewpoint; (3) to assemble from within and without the library both publications and
information as required by the activities of its clientele, disseminating these on the
initiative of the library as well as on request; offer in abstract or memorandum form
oriented for immediate application to an individual's work.
Policies, methods, and collections vary among individual special libraries in
accordance with their subject interests on the one hand, and on the other in relation to
their organizational type: (1) the special organization library serving all informational
needs of a corporation, non-profit organization, government body, or other kind of
institution, in which the library staff and clientele are both employees of, and receive
their salaries and expenses from the same organization; as distinct from (2) the special
branch of a public library serving certain occupational groups; and (3) the special subject
library which may be semi-public, independent, or departmental library, serving students,
professional groups, members, or general public, on a given subject.83
The clarification and illustration of the word organization is perhaps in answer to Coney’s
complaint about it being “too general a term to apply to one with as limited a connotation as has
‘special library.’”84

27

The Glossary was updated and published in a second edition seven years later in 1950,85
and again the definition appears in an altered form. This time, the preface acknowledges the
1943 definition’s detractors in stating that “the definition of a special library, which aroused the
most comment in the first edition, has been revised in the light of opinions expressed by
librarians at that time and it is hoped certain ambiguities therein have been clarified.”86 The
researcher could not find any evidence of complaints about the definition in the literature
surveyed, so one can conclude, perhaps, that the comments Morley received regarding fault with
the definition came in the form of personal or professional correspondence, or from SLA
members and other special librarians at conferences and other professional events in the
intervening years between the publication of the first and second editions. The 1950 definition
reads as follows:

Special Library: A service organized to make available whatever knowledge and
experience will further the activities of a particular organization, all members of which
have the common objective of their organization, although different functions and
therefore a number of subject interests, as in the special organization library, the
predominant type; or, of a group, organized or unorganized, having a common subject
interest but diverse individual objectives, as in the special subject library.
Collections and their methods of organization are determined in individual special
libraries largely by their subject interests. On the other hand, the administrative and
service policies and the program of activities are determined by their organizational type:
(1) the special organization or staff library serving all informational needs of a
corporation, non-profit organization, government body, or other kind of organization in
which the library staff and clientele are both employees of, and receive their salaries and
operating expenses from, the same organization; as distinct from (2) the special subject
library which may be semi-public, independent, departmental or branch library, serving
students, professional groups, members or general public on a given subject.

Such service presupposes on the part of the library staff familiarity with the
activities of the clientele and knowledge in the field of specialization, as well as of library
policies and techniques. Its primary functions are: (1) to maintain a continuing survey and
evaluation of current publications, research in progress and activities of individual
authorities, on behalf of its clientele; (2) to organize the sources of both written and
unwritten experience and knowledge from the specialist's viewpoint; (3) to assemble
from within and without the library both publications and information as required by the
activities of its clientele; and in the organization library, disseminating these on the
initiative of the library staff, as well as on request, in a manner to beget use, often in
abstract or memorandum form oriented for immediate application to an individual's
work.87
This version also includes a note at the end (not included above) that informs readers of
terminology specific to English special libraries. The basic elements of the previous two
definitions are present, but some are in a different order and some are significantly expanded or
qualified. Additionally, it may be assumed that with this incarnation, after two successive
revisions and increases, there is little hope that any one definition will satisfy every special
librarian and cover every special library.

3. METHODOLOGY AND PROCEDURES
Population and Sample
This research project is a historical, qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the
definition of special libraries, guided by the following research question: how have special
libraries been defined historically, and in what ways have those definitions changed over time?
The entities of interest for the project are those definitions of special libraries found in scholarly
and professional literature for the field of library and information science published from 1909
(the date of the formation of SLA) until 2014. Specifically, this literature is written in the English
language; originates from and is about libraries in the United States, Canada, and/or the United
Kingdom; and includes SLA documents, literature, and reports. The sample of literature used in
the study is, for the sake of convenience to the researcher, composed of documents both in print
and in digital format that can be found at or accessed through the library services and online
databases of the University of Alabama, and obtained through interlibrary loan.
To further clarify and identify the population and sample of literature studied for this
project, what is meant precisely by scholarly and professional literature within the field must be
defined. For the purposes of this study, scholarly and professional literature and sources are
published academic monographs and peer-reviewed journals and magazines intended for
professional and academic review by library and information specialists. The use of scholarly
works ensures the quality of the sample of literature used for analysis. The literature studied is
also restricted to works produced only as far back as the year 1909 because SLA was established

30

in July of that year. This not only limits the scope of the project to the manageable period of a
little more than one hundred years’ worth of literature, but it is also advantageous in increasing
the chances of locating sources that use the words “special library” exactly because of SLA’s
influence on the rise in prevalence of the term’s usage after 1909. SLA documents and reports
(e.g., constitutions, mission statements, bylaws, conference proceedings) are also included as
part of the professional literature because of the organization’s advocacy of special libraries and
great influence on the professional community in the United States.
Because this research project is an historical analysis of literature, the delineation of
primary and secondary sources is an important factor in their assessment, typically because
primary sources are valued more than secondary sources. Primary sources for this project are
those works that contain a definition or reference to a definition of special libraries contemporary
to the time of writing or publication. This means that Tara E. Murray discussing the current
mission statement of SLA in 20131 and Margaret H. Fuller, president of SLA, deliberating on the
need for standards within the organization in 19592 are both primary sources of literature.
Secondary sources for this project are those works that contain a definition or reference to
a definition of special libraries incongruent to the time of writing or publication. Robert V.
Williams’ 1997 article chronicling the documentation movement in the United States in the early
part of the twentieth century3 and David Shumaker’s 2009 entry on the history of special

libraries in the Encyclopedia of Library and Information Sciences4 are both examples of
secondary sources of literature.
The case can also be made for one source that includes both primary and secondary data.
In 1986 Eugene B. Jackson recounts research in special libraries statistics done in the 1950s as
well as presenting his own contemporaneous research5 in a single article that can be considered
both secondary and primary literature. However, the distinction between primary and secondary
sources does not have much bearing on this project because it is concerned with only definitions
– the way special libraries are characterized and discussed – and the value of one definition over
another does not factor into the analysis of data. Using the example above, a historical and a
contemporary definition by Jackson are both definitions and therefore both equally valuable for
this research.

Research Design
The leading design feature of the project is systematic review, “a more rigorous
alternative to the ‘narrative’ review.”6 Systematic review explicitly outlines the steps in the
process of synthesis in order to formulate a more scientific, more replicable, and less erroneous
review procedure. The chief components are as follows: 1) develop a protocol based on the
research problem; 2) develop a search strategy; 3) search for literature; 4) identify, screen, and

synthesize findings; 7) report results.7

Instrumentation and Tools Used
The research was conducted at the University of Alabama and the researcher utilized the
services, space, and materials of the University of Alabama Libraries and the School of Library
and Information Studies. Included source materials are monographs and journals in print form as
well as databases to which University of Alabama Libraries has access. These databases
comprise Academic Search Premier, Academic OneFile, EBSCOhost, Research Library
Complete, JStor, HathiTrust Digital Library, H.W. Wilson Library Literature & Information
Science databases, Scopus, and Scout, the University of Alabama Libraries’ federated search
interface.
The only instruments the researcher used to record and analyze the data were a laptop
computer and a calculator. Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel were software programs
employed in this work.

Data Gathering and Entry Procedures
The data gathered for this study consists of primary data which are from primary and
secondary source literature. This data was gathered in four stages: (1) identification of suitable
literature to be analyzed; (2) analysis of the work; (3) assessment of the work to determine the
date of publication, the author and his or her credentials, and whether it was a primary or
secondary source; and (4) recording of data. Identifying suitable literature for analysis consisted

33

of federated searching of databases and the catalog of the University of Alabama Libraries by
keyword, subject, or title. The search strategy involved searching the databases for the keywords
“special librar*” (the asterisk used so that the search results would include both library and
libraries) in conjunction with “definition,” “define,” “defined,” “nature of,” or “characteristics”
joined by the Boolean operator and. Digital format books or journal articles were accessed from
the University of Alabama collection or through a database provider, and physical print
monographs from the library building itself. Reading abstracts and reference lists for scholarly
articles or browsing the table of contents in books is a good indicator of a suitable source of
literature. Once the source has been identified, analysis of the work was conducted to locate the
definition or reference to the definition contained within it. Assessment of the work as a primary
or secondary source depended upon the context and publication date, and author credentials were
determined by context within the work or database and internet searching. Data consisting of the
definition and source status were then recorded digitally in an Excel spreadsheet.
Data that were gathered – or, the definitions collected – were measured categorically.
First, each definition was labeled by date and compiled into a chronological list which was
divided by decade; then, the data were coded by definition characteristic term, source type
(primary or secondary), and format (article, monograph, edited collection, etc.). This allowed for
cross-referencing on multiple levels, and a spreadsheet was employed to ease this method of
comparison.

Data Analysis Procedures
After the data were gathered, they were analyzed in a number of ways. As this study
focuses on descriptive characteristics and the relationships between data to interpret history, so

34

too did the analysis of data rely upon description and those relationships to identify patterns and
trends that may indicate how and possibly why changes have occurred over time. Each recorded
definition was analyzed for descriptive characteristic words to create a coded image of the
special library it defines. Measurement of each coded definition was achieved by tallying the
instances of individual characteristics against the number of total definitions and the total
number within specific date ranges. Additionally, a chronological list was assembled to visually
plot definitions and more easily locate patterns and group together time periods.
The significance of the results of data analysis is assessed through the ability to interpret
the meaning of the patterns, trends, and shifts in data, and interpreting where the definition-based
descriptions of special libraries fit into those patterns and the overall history of special libraries.
The analysis of the data tracks definitional changes over time, and those changes are what is
most significant in this study. Dana’s original definition also is compared to the most recent
definition to measure the most change over time and against a representative definition from
each of the identified data-indicated time periods.
As with most any research project, the possibility of missing or faulty data is a risk. It
must be acknowledged that the limitations of the sample literature used for this project could
present a scenario in which significant or foundational data is missed simply because it is not
available in the UA collection or accessible databases. That being said, the digital and online
database content available to the researcher was extensive and comprehensive to the extent that
at no time did the researcher fail to locate a desired source obtained through referential notes of
other studied works. Any fault in overlooking or missing sources and data lies with the
researcher and the researcher’s prescribed method by which sources were searched for and
analyzed. The impact of missing or faulty data concerns the integrity of the project both

35

internally and externally. The internal risk is to the interpretation of meaning and assessment of
significance. Absent data could skew patterns and trends or cause the researcher to miss an
important one altogether. The external risk is of the possibility of reporting faulty, incorrect, or
simply false data to the professional community.
The methodology and data analysis plan of this study involves some quantitative
measurement in the form of categorization, and qualitative methods of description and
interpretation – Reichmann’s head and heart. By combined measurement, analysis, and
description, this project interprets and enhances the historical narrative of special libraries.

Definition of Key Terms
For the purposes of this project and because the focus of the population observed in the
sample begins with the formation of SLA, first president and SLA founder John Cotton Dana
supplies the definition that is considered the basis for all other definitions. This is the earliest
definition in the sample literature and that definition against which all subsequent definitions are
analyzed for comparison and relation. In 1910, in the first issue of the first scholarly publication
devoted to special libraries, Dana defines the term thus: “all small special libraries, financial,
commercial, scientific, industrial; and special departments of state, college and general libraries
… all libraries devoted to a special purpose and serving a limited clientele.”8

Alternate Terms to “Special Library”
If, as Guy St. Clair argues, special libraries were “born through change” and embrace
new methods of service to the organizations to which they belong,9 then it follows that change
also touches the terms and names used for and by special libraries. Names synonymous with (or
related to) special libraries that are recognized in this research process include broad terms such
as “information centers,” “documentation centers,” “corporate libraries,” “company libraries,” or
“professional libraries.” Specific types of special libraries are also tangentially included in the
project (e.g., medical libraries, law libraries, military libraries).

Data Coding Terms
There are thirteen coding terms and six sub-terms nested under two larger terms used in
analyzing each definition recorded for this project. The terms are applied to a definition when it
is used to define a specific aspect of special libraries, not simply when the term appears in the
given definition. The codes were determined after an examination of the literature and were
based on the established characteristics, repeated characteristics observed by the researcher, and
commonality of themes found in the literature. The following is a list and brief explanation of
each term used:


Collection: Informational materials held by the library or those to which the library has
access. This term is also broken down into sub-characteristics that describe the library’s
collection and are related and not separate from it, these being: subject matter, scope,
format, and size.

9

Guy St. Clair, “SLA at 100: Connecting Our Past to Our Future,” Information Outlook 13, no. 1 (Jan./Feb.
2009): 24.

37



Purpose/Function: The reason for which the library was established and/or the role it
plays or job it does within the organization of which it is a part.



Services/Methods: The general or specific services offered by the library, the ways in
which the library disseminates information, and/or approaches the library takes in
meeting the need of its clientele.



Setting: Any physical description of the library or the space it occupies.



Clientele: The people/groups of people the library serves, or the patrons of the library.



Parent Organization: The organization of which the library is a part. This can be a
corporate, governmental, non-profit, or any other organized entity. Some rare special
libraries are independent and do not have any oversight; examples include the Newbury
Library in Chicago and the Huntington Library in California. This term is also divided
into the following sub-characteristics that describe the library within the parent
organization: mission, which refers to the library’s alignment with the goals of the parent
organization; and relationship, which describes the relationship of the library to the
parent organization.



Role/Duties of Librarian: The skills, knowledge, and tasks required of the librarian, and
the importance of the librarian to the success of the library.



Information Use/Utility: Any description of how, why, or for what the information
provided by the library is used, and/or how effective or up-to-date the information is.



Funding: Financial aspects of a special library, including how it is funded and who pays
the librarian’s salary.



List of Types: Any list of specific categories, types, or kinds of special libraries. For
example, medical libraries, law libraries, and museum libraries.
38



Diversity: Explanation of special libraries by how many different types there are and/or
uniqueness of each library.



Exclusion: Explanation of a special library by apophatic means, that is, by the absence of
other types or categories of libraries. This also includes special libraries as a category that
excludes specific types or other categories.



Comparison: Explanation of a special library by comparing general or specific qualities
and characteristics to other categories of libraries.

4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Definitions by Decade
Table 4.1 displays the number of definitions that were recorded in each of the eleven
decades from 1909 until 2014, the total number definitions recorded in the study, and each
decade’s percentage of definitions taken from the total. Out of 84 definitions, the highest
numbers were found in the 1980s at 16 (or 19%), followed by the 1950s at 13 (15.5%) and then
equally in the 1960s and the first years surveyed, 1909-1919, at 11 (13.1%). As a comparison,
the lowest number of definitions was 3 in the 1940s and represents 3.6% of the total. Close
behind were the 1920s, 1990s, and the most recent years studied, 2010-2014, at 4 each (4.8%).
These numbers (also shown in Table 4.2) can indicate that a greater interest from writers in the
former set of years of defining special libraries within the library and information field, or,
perhaps, a greater interest from practitioners and scholars in reflecting on and drawing
boundaries around the special libraries community.
By looking at each decade individually and chronologically, and taking into account the
historical events of the time, it is possible to deduce why these more involved conversations
about the nature of special libraries were taking place. In the first years of SLA after its
formation in 1909, it was unclear to many in the library field which libraries and which librarians
should be involved with the association. ALA, when accepting affiliation, commented on SLA’s

40

“rather vague scope.”1 Perhaps to remedy this, the founding members and other leadership made
it a point to identify special libraries and discuss characteristics in their writing.

The 1950s and 1960s was yet again a time of great industrial and commercial growth in
the United States, and special libraries were met with the documentation movement and new
technologies to index and organize their materials. Growth in numbers of libraries and librarians
might have galvanized the profession into promoting themselves by expanding or improving
definitions to include more libraries during this time, and an effort to combat or distinguish
special libraries from documentation centers could have contributed to more definitions as well.
In the 1980s, technology was booming and being applied to everything, not just the
library and information field. This major shift in how information was processed, read, and
disseminated led many special libraries and librarians to drop the “library” part of their titles
altogether. With so much change happening, especially in what special libraries called
themselves, writers were looking to the future and deciding what information service would look
like in the years to come. It follows that an inevitable identity crisis sprang up amongst those in
the profession and this could have led to a greater deliberation on what special libraries are in the
face of so much transformation.
To further examine individual years, a delineation of each definition recorded appears in
Appendix A in chronological order with the year and author identified for each one.

Characteristics
The overall characteristic that was used as a defining factor of special libraries in the
most definitions gathered for this study is the library’s collection. At 69%, or 58 out of 84
definitions, Table 4.3 shows that considerations involving collection outstrip the next two closest
competitors, Services and Methods at 65.5% (55 definitions) and Clientele at 61.9% (52
definitions). These numbers are fairly close together, each one only three definitions greater than

42

the next. What makes these three characteristics stand out even more is the sharp decline in the
number of definitions recorded for each of the next highest occurring characteristics: Parent
Organization is used in 40 (47.6%) definitions and is a full 12 points below Clientele. The
relationship between Collection, Services/Methods, and Clientele as characteristic of special
libraries will be explored further in the next subsection.

(Table 4.3.)
Information Use/Utility is another important feature of special libraries and it is present
in 35.7% of definitions. Close to that is the Purpose/Function of the library at 32.1%. It is
interesting that these two attributes fall so close together on the scale because they are closely
related. How information is used in a special library often determines or describes the function or
43

purpose of the service unit. The next two are also close in the data progression but have little
relationship to one another; Role/Duties of Librarian appears 22 times (26.2%) while a List of
Types is given 21 times (25%). The bottom five traits each are representative of less than 17% of
the definitions recorded and the lowest indicating 9.5%. Diversity at 14 (16.7%), Exclusion at 13
(15.5%), Setting at 11 (13.1%), Funding at 9 (10.7%), and Comparison at 8 (9.5%) are the least
used factors in defining special libraries.
Worth mentioning are the occurrences of the sub-characteristics that were coded under
Collection and Parent Organization measured against the total number of definitions. Collection
is broken down into Subject Matter, Scope, Format, and Size, all of which operate in more
definitions than Funding and Comparison, the two lowest characteristics. Subject Matter of a
collection is the dominant category and is so prevalent at 43 (51.2%) that if taken as a
characteristic separate from Collection it would actually rank fourth, above Parent Organization.
Surprisingly, Size of a collection only speaks for 11.7% or 10 of the total definitions. The two
sub-characteristics beneath Parent Organization, Mission and Relationship, reflect 23.8% (20)
and 17.9% (15) of the whole.

Top Three Characteristics
Looking more closely at the three most occurring characteristics in the definitions
investigated reveals a clear pattern. Table 4.4 visually demonstrates the correlation between
Collection, Services/Methods, and Clientele as definitions are plotted through the decades. The
greatest disparity between the definitions per decade is in the first decade after SLA’s formation,
1909-1919. Here the lowest occurring characteristic is Services/Methods at 4 definitions and it is
five points from the highest, Collection at 9. For the rest of the years there is never more than a

44

three point difference in the number of definitions, both instances happening in high grossing
decades – the 1950s and the 1980s.

Table 4.5 shows how the numbers of definitions each decade and the percentage of those
numbers against the total of each decade compare for each of the three top characteristics. The
1940s is the only decade to have 100% inclusion for all three characteristics, which is not
unexpected considering those years have the fewest number of total definitions with which to
work. And the 1920s had the lowest rate of inclusion at a combined mean average percentage of
41.7%, also a decade with very few definitions recorded.

Related Groups of Characteristics
Analysis of the data also reveals correlations and patterns within groups of characteristics
that were determined by the researcher to be related in some capacity. Those groups are the
following: (1) those features having to do with categorical and conceptual concerns: List of
types, Diversity, Exclusion, and Comparison; (2) those attributes concerning business and nonlibrary matters: Parent organization, Clientele, Purpose/Function, and Funding; and (3) those
properties linked to broader library techniques and traditions: Collection, Services/Methods,
Setting, Role/Duties of Librarian, and Information Use/Utility.
A few interesting things can be seen with Table 4.6 which presents Group 1 as a line
chart of the percentage of the number of each characteristic compared to the total number in each
decade. No direct correlation is found between any of the four characteristics as none follow a
similar pattern of ups and downs. The percentages range from zero to 70%, and each
characteristic represents zero total definitions for at least one decade. Comparison actually stands
for more decades at 0% than those that have a positive number (only 3 of 11 have numbers more
than zero). Exclusion and Comparison both see their highest spikes of usage in the 1990s, while
List of Types peaks a decade later in the 2000s, and Diversity rises the highest in the 1940s. A
remarkable juxtaposition occurs between the 1990s and 2000s as List of Types plummets to its
lowest percentage at zero in the 1990s but rises to its highest at 40% in the next decade. This is
the opposite for Exclusion as it grows to 75% in the 1990s but shrinks to zero in the next decade.
In fact, during the 2000s when SLA celebrates its 100 year anniversary, the only one of these
characteristics that does not fall to zero is List of Types. It may be that the rise of the internet in
the 1990s – a new technology and concept that both those in the profession and the general
public were grappling with – promoted a sense of idealism and allowed authors to be more

47

abstract in describing special libraries. In contrast, in the 2000s, perhaps the anticipation of the
anniversary at the end of the decade caused writers to take stock of special libraries and make
definitions more concrete and to steer them away from the conceptual in order to reach a larger
general audience.

level of a single decade at 75% in the 1990s; Comparison is the only characteristic to get close to
that percentage at 50% in the same decade.

Table 4.8 presents the data for Group 2 in the same format as Table 4.6. Here the
percentages range from zero to 100%, and two of the four lines share a mostly correlated
trajectory. Clientele and Funding, though separated by at least 25 and as much as 66 percentage
points, share a similar path that deviates by going in opposite directions in the two most recent
decades. The following is a list of when each characteristic reaches its highest saturation
percentage: Clientele in the 1940s, Parent Organization in the 1950s, Purpose/Function in the
1980s, and Funding in the 1940s. Again, Clientele, the highest, and Funding, the lowest, both
reach their peak in the same decade. The feature that spans the largest range from lowest to
highest is Parent Organization, which goes from zero in the 1910s and 1920s to 76.9% in the
1950s.

In Table 4.9, Group 2 in broken down by number of definitions per decade and their
respective percentages of definitions compared to the total in each decade. Clientele has both the
50

greatest percentage of definitions in a single decade (100% in the 1940s) and over all the years
studied (61.9%). In fact, the same pattern holds for each of the next characteristics behind
Clientele in percentages. They are in order as follows: Parent Organization at 47.6% overall and
76.9% in the 1950s, Purpose/Function at 32.1% overall and 43.8% in the 1980s, and Funding at
10.7% overall and 33.3% in the 1940s.

For Group 3, unlike the previous groups, an analysis by line chart is not beneficial in
detecting patters or correlations due to number of characteristic factors and the erratic nature of
the line produced. Table 4.10 shows that the percentages of definitions against total definitions
per decade run the entire scale from zero to 100%. Collection and Services/Methods both find
100% usage in definitions in the 1940s, but it is prudent to note that the 1940s also saw the
lowest number of definitions recorded overall at 3. Collection, Services/Methods, and

51

Role/Duties of Librarian are all represented in every decade in which definitions were studied.
Conversely, Information Use/Utility and Setting both have decades that do not include them as
characteristics, though Information Use/Utility is only at zero in the 2000s where Setting has
zero percent representation in the 1920s, 1960s, 2000s, and 2010s.

Sub-Characteristics of Collection and Parent Organization
The definition characteristic Collection is divided into the following four subcharacteristics that describe the library’s collection: Subject Matter, Scope, Format, and Size.
This list is in order of most to least occurring within the Collection characteristic of the
definitions studied. Of the 58 total definitions that were coded with the term Collection, Subject
Matter is present in 43 (74.1%), Scope in 36 (62.1%), Format in 23 (39.7%), and Size in 10
(17.2%). This dominance of Subject Matter within Collection matches Williams and Zachert’s
assertion about the literature relying on defining special libraries by the collection’s subject
focus. What does not match is that they relegate this type of description to early definitions; the
findings here show that as late as the 2000s, subject matter is still a highly used characteristic.
Moreover, within the Collection category, Subject Matter does not fall below 50% usage during
the decades from 1909-2009.
An observation that can be corroborated with Table 4.12 is the absence of one or more of
these four descriptors in seven decades, with 1920s, 1950s, 1970s, and 1980s being the only
decades to include all four. And though the 2010s feature three definitions containing Collection,
none of them specify anything about the Collection in relation to the four sub-characteristics.
Both Subject Matter and Scope reach 100% saturation within Collection, but this occurs in lowaccumulating decades that encompass four or fewer total definitions.

Parent Organization, like Collection, is another characteristic that has sub-characteristics
that are related and used to further detail an individual aspect of the Parent Organization. Table
4.13 shows that comparing the two by the total number of each sub-characteristic, Mission is
represented in 20 (50%) of the 40 definitions that were coded with Parent Organization while
Relationship is represented in a lower number at 15 (37.5%). Both sub-characteristics have
decades at zero and both have decades where 100% of the Parent Organization definitions
include them. Also worth noting is the fact that the 1950s is the decade in which the most
definitions were coded with Parent Organization (with 10 definitions), but the sub-characteristics
that function as qualifying and detailing the main characteristics both present a relatively low
occurrence of 40%.

Table 4.14 displays the Mission and Relationship sub-characteristic number totals from
within the Parent Organization characteristic as plotted points connected with lines to show
movement. The rates of these two sub-characteristics are very close, and in reality their paths are
the same from 1909 through the 1960s. The lines separate for no more than one or two points
starting in the 1970s and still follow a similarly moving path of rises and falls through the 1990s.
It is in the 2000s when the lines go in opposite directions only to have both lines fall again in the
2010s. Based on this chart, Mission and Relationship are strongly associated concepts not only in
relation to each other but also in relation to Parent Organization.

Top Four Decades
As stated above, the four decades that hold the most definitions in this study are the
1910s, 1950s, 1960s, and 1980s. It is constructive to look at and compare these four decades in
55

regards to all thirteen characteristic code terms because the more data available the less chance
there is for an anomaly to corrupt the results. The chart in Table 4.15 indicates that the
characteristics follow the same path of frequency in many areas, with the most discrepancy
caused by Parent Organization and then the conceptual/categorical terms of Diversity, Exclusion,
and Comparison. This may be due to the fact that the latter three characteristics have the least
number of definitions represented and for the simple reason that compared to concrete, practical
features, these conceptual features are on average less frequent and more sporadically used to
describe special libraries. The drop in Parent Organization in the 1910s at zero while the 1950s,
1960s, and 1980s all spiked at six or higher can be explained by the 1910s’ emphasis on
Clientele rather than the organization of which those patrons are a part.

Exclusion. The 1960s have two null rates in Setting and Comparison, and the 1950s has one in
Comparison. The 1980s is the only decade that has no characteristic unrepresented. Also,
interestingly, no single characteristic managed to reach full saturation of 100% in any of these
four decades.

Oldest vs. Most Recent
A valuable juxtaposition to examine is the oldest decade against the most recent, 19091919 and 2010-2014. It is, perhaps, somewhat unfair to compare these decades as the latter is
only half finished and the inclusion of the whole decade’s data is not possible at the time of this
57

writing. In Table 4.17, the differences between these two decades is displayed numerically and in
the form of percentages of the total number of definitions gathered for that particular decade. The
primary discrepancy concerning these two decades is the total number of definitions recorded for
each; the 1910s include 11 total definitions whereas the 2010s have 4. This makes the disparity
amongst some sets of numbers even greater, but also speaks to the numbers that are exactly the
same or near the same. The largest gap is 6 definitions between instances of Collection with
1909-1919 having 9 and 2010-2014 having just 3. Represented as a percentage of the total
number of definitions for the decade, though, the 1910s only top the 2010s by a little more than 6
points, 81.8% to 75%. The next largest distance between two numbers is 4 in the List of Types
characteristic, and that occurs again with the 1910s outstripping 2010s 4 to zero. This time the
percentage gap is much larger with the 1910s at 36.4% versus the 2010s at zero. All other
differences are 3 or less. Conversely, there are two instances in which the lower number of
definitions for one decade actually represents a higher percentage of the total; this happens twice:
first, with Services/Methods where the 1910s comprise 4 definitions at 36.4% of the total and the
2010s have 2 definitions but they weigh in at 50% of the total, and second, with Clientele where
the numbers are 6 and 3 (1910s greater), and the percentages are 54.5% and 75% (2010s greater).
Table 4.18 easily shows the points at which characteristics match up between these two
decades that are separated by 100 years. Hitting zero in Funding and one occurrence of
Diversity, these decades find common characteristic ground. Also shared is the movement of the
path connecting the points for seven of the thirteen characteristics: Collection, Purpose/Function,
Services/Methods, Setting, Clientele, Parent Organization, and Funding. Those with divergent
trajectories are Role/Duties of Librarian, Information Use/Utility, and the four immaterial
characteristics, List of Types, Diversity, Exclusion, and Comparison.

5. CONCLUSION
Expressed in the simplest way, a special library is a category of library. Like academic,
school, and public libraries, special libraries are differentiated by the users they serve. Where
academic libraries assist scholars, college students, and researchers, and school libraries serve
elementary and secondary school students, and public libraries provide for the general public,
special libraries serve particular groups of people and organizations not as definitely identified as
those in the other three categories. In contrast, what sets special libraries apart from other
categories of libraries is that they encompass libraries that do not fit within the other categories –
“special” is a word that essentially signifies “other” or “miscellaneous” categorically. No two
special libraries are alike, from collection to clientele to parent organization or any other
characteristic coding term used in the data analysis phase of this study. This is not to say that
special libraries do not have shared characteristics – they do, as the results of this study show –
but it does mean that the disparity of qualities in special libraries is much broader than the
difference in features of academic, school, and public libraries. There is no one characteristic or
service or function that special libraries as a whole can point to that can categorize them as such.
While it may be easiest to describe special libraries as a category, they are much more
than that. John Cotton Dana did more than create a separate association when he and his
colleagues broke away from ALA to form SLA; he gave a name and an identity to a community
that had none. While there are some distinct groups and professional organizations within the
category of special libraries – the Medical Library Association, the American Association of

60

Law Libraries, the Art Libraries Society of North America, to name a few – the presence of a
larger body, though incredibly diverse, is most beneficial because of that diversity, which allows
for more inclusive communication of ideas, sharing of knowledge, and creation of standards and
best practices. Professionals who identify themselves as special librarians and those libraries they
work in represent a community that has chosen to come together and give itself a name and
identity.

Summary of Research and Results
This thesis has considered the nebulous nature of definitions of special libraries through
the narrow lens of literary definition. The research was driven by two questions: (1) how have
special libraries been defined historically, and (2) in what way have those definitions changed
over time? Using systematic review as the research design, scholarly and professional literature
within the library and information science field was surveyed to collect and collate definitions of
special libraries from 1909 to 2014.
The Literature Review provided a broad overview of the history of special libraries in the
United States and examined the established terms and characteristics associated with definitions
of special libraries. It also allowed for an in-depth look at three cases in which discussions
regarding definitional content took place in the literature, one early in the life of SLA in 1912,
the next just before World War II in 1937-1938, and the last near the end of the War and into
1950. These instances of direct conversation exemplify the nature of the way in which
definitions of special libraries shift, evolve, and are contested by those in the profession.
Before the data were gathered and analyzed the hypothesis associated with this project
stated that the results would reveal a strong correlation between the change in definitions and

61

developing technologies, innovations, and social movements in the library and information
science field, and general historical events. Results generally complement this proposition as
many of the fluctuations in definitional content move with technological or informational
advances, such as the invention of electronic record keeping systems in the 1970s and the dawn
of the “information age” in the 1980s, and with greater historical events, such as World War II
and the commercial boom of the 1950s and 1960s.
The results reveal which decades saw the most discussion about definitions, which
characteristics occur most frequently in definitions, how characteristic groups correlate within
definitions, and what is different about definitions from the 1910s and today. The decades that
showed the highest number of definitions recorded in the literature were, in order from highest to
lowest, the 1980s, 1950s, and 1960s and 1910s (both with equal numbers). The special library’s
collection was the most applied characteristic in definitions, with Services and Methods and
Clientele following closely behind. These three characteristics follow a similar path of peaks and
lows throughout the years, and each one accounts for as much as 100% and no less than 25% of
definition criteria in the decades represented. Analysis of the data also uncovered groupings of
characteristics, those dealing with categorical and conceptual aspects, business/non-library
concerns, and general library techniques and traditions. Conceptual aspects of special libraries
contained those characteristics that were least represented in the overall count of definitions, and
they represented the most contrasting group, with very few patterns emerging from analysis. The
group concerned with business matters revealed that Funding was the least accounted for
characteristic, and that though funding and value are discussed frequently in the literature,
financial matters do not necessarily define special libraries. The group that was related by
traditional library concerns was made up of two of the most frequently attributed definitional

62

characteristics, and it determined that Collection and Services and Methods are nearly twice as
important in definitions as other general library features. A comparison of the most current
decade and the oldest revealed that where they most differ is in definition by Exclusion and the
characteristic of Parent organization, both absent from the 1910s definitions but representative of
50% of the definitions in the 2010s.

Implications and Significance of Results
The definitions of special libraries are as dynamic, boundless, and unique as the libraries
themselves. If there is so much diversity in the libraries themselves, does the library and
information professional even really need a definition? Who is the definition ultimately for, and
who does it benefit? Maybe there is no single definition that fits all special libraries because
special libraries are essentially defined by being nearly undefinable, that is, they are defined by
their diversity and inclusion of all the libraries that do not fit into other library categories. A
definition of special libraries first benefits the libraries and librarians it defines. It provides an
identity for a community that can share ideas and knowledge. A definition also benefits the
greater library and information profession. Just as comparison to other types and exclusion and
inclusion aid in defining special libraries, librarians in public, academic, and school libraries can
also use these boundaries to define their libraries.
Definitions recorded in this study seem to fall into two categories: those that attempt to
cover all special libraries and those definitions that strive for simplicity and therefore define the
typical special library. As evidenced by Rankin and Morley’s painstaking compilation of a
definition1 that grew and morphed over the years to accommodate every critic’s complaint, be as

1

63

specific as possible, and include every conceivable notion of a special library, the definition that
tries to be all things to all people will never actually accomplish that – someone will
continuously and inevitably have a difference of opinion on what constitutes a special library.
Likewise, perhaps a simple definition focused on typicality will also always leave something to
be desired if it cannot accurately represent a large enough majority of special libraries. Based on
the results, these modest definitions will likely contain characteristics involving Collection,
Services and Methods, and Clientele.
Special libraries seem to change with the times, often embracing new and innovative
techniques and becoming some of the first adopters of cutting-edge information technologies
within the general library community. With all the changes that the profession has gone through,
it is telling that Dana's initial definition of "the library of a modern man of affairs"2 still
embodies the spirit of SLA and the contemporary special libraries community. With the word
“modern” Dana implies that the special library is cutting-edge, up-to-date, and concerned with
the latest and greatest information and technology. This is very much the case today as SLA’s
Competencies state that its members are “Information Professionals (IPs)” and that they aid the
organization they work for “through the development, deployment, and management of
information resources and services. The IP harnesses technology as a critical tool to accomplish
goals.”3 Furthermore, the phrase "of affairs" gives the impression of important work being done,
the emphasis here on work and activity and action – Cutter's "people who are doing things."4

These ideas were certainly integral in forming SLA's slogan, "putting our knowledge to work,"
and SLA's current tag line, "connecting people and information."

How the Study Fits within the Information Field and
Recommendations for Further Study
Anthony T. Kruzas presented a solid basis for historical studies in his works on
directories of special libraries in the 1960s.5 He used historical and quantitative methods to
analyze the breadth of special libraries in the United States and the scope of the profession.
Frank E. McKenna, in writing the entry on special libraries and SLA in the Encyclopedia of
Library and Information Science6 in 1980, analyzed a number of gathered definitions of special
libraries and chose five increasingly comprehensive levels of inclusion that he believed, within at
least one, each special library could fit. Most recently, Tara E. Murray established a column in
the Journal of Library Administration in 2013 called “The Specialist” in which she has discussed
the definition of special libraries. Murray purports the column to be a regular discussion about
practices, methods, and experiences of special librarians that she shares in anticipation of being
beneficial to other types of librarians.7 It is the hope of the researcher that this thesis can
supplement these studies and writings to aid anyone interested in the history of or current
condition of special libraries.

Typically, the majority of special librarians do not do much looking back. They live in
the here and now and strive to keep their collections up-to-date, relevant, and as useful as
possible. In most cases, once a piece of information is out of date, it is obsolete, and that which is
no longer useful has no place in a collection “serving people who are doing things.”8 Because of
the fast-paced nature of their work and the need for efficiency that keeps them looking to the
future for new and better ways of getting the best information to their clients, time spent in the
past seems to be time wasted for special librarians and their libraries. Often in a professional
environment of workers developing innovative ideas, necessarily they do not have the luxury of
time and resources to spend on looking at the past. There is always a new day, a new information
request, and new technology to apply to make that information work better for their clientele and
parent organization.
All that being said, it is valuable for the special libraries professional community to know
its history so that it can grow from its sense of heritage and learn from that which has been
successful and that which has failed in the past. As said above, the spirit of the organization that
Dana began has not altered in these past one hundred years; special libraries are still concerned
with efficiency, specialization, and innovation. While histories of specific groups within the
special libraries umbrella have been given the historical treatment in the form of a monograph,
what could be more beneficial is a comprehensive, complete history of special libraries in the
United States and, possibly, the world. The researcher found no such history in examining the
literature; however, St. Clair’s history of SLA9 in 2009 for its one-hundred-year anniversary and

Johns’ close examination of special libraries10 in 1968 come the nearest to providing the
profession with conclusive history. An inclusive look at the history of special libraries in the
United States would be quite an undertaking, but one that has been needed and desired for
decades. The task has likely not been completed for all the same reasons stated above that
describe why special librarians have very little time to look back. It seems that if ever this work
is commenced, a working special librarian is likely not to be its author.

Definition

1909 Constitution of
SLA

"commercial, industrial, technical, civic, municipal and legislative
reference libraries, the special departments of public libraries,
universities, welfare associations and business organizations."

1909 Robert Harvey
Whitten

"By 'special' library I mean an up-to-date working collection with
the 'special' librarian in charge; a collection so complete and well
organized that it becomes an efficient tool in the daily work of
those for whose use it is designed."

1910 John Cotton
Dana

"We may venture to define it as 'the library of a modern man of
affairs.' This definition is not sufficiently inclusive, however."

1910 Special
Libraries
Association

"all small special libraries throughout the country; financial,
commercial, scientific, industrial; and special departments of state,
college and general libraries; and, in fact, all libraries devoted to
special purposes and serving a limited clientage."

1912 A. G. S.
Josephson

"A special library is, to my mind, a library that covers a single
definite subject, or a definite group of related subjects… Such a
library will exclude from its shelves everything that is not
definitely related to its subject." Framed as discussion comparing
special libraries to general libraries.

1912 W. P. Cutter

"I consider a special library as one that serves people who are doing
things, and a reference library one which serves people who are
thinking things. The former are not thinking about doing things,
they are already doing them."

1912 W. S. Dudgeon

"The general reference library is in a sense the Jack-of-all-trades.
The special library is the expert in one line. Conditions similar to
those which make it necessary for men to become specialists make
it necessary for libraries to specialize." / "The material required for
the special library differs from that found in a general reference
76

library." / "The special librarian must have special knowledge as
well as library technique." / "Methods of work of the special
Librarian differ from those of the general reference librarian." /
"The special library deals primarily with the present and the
future."
1914 John Cotton
Dana

"It may be said, of course, that every library is in a measure special,
in its own field, and that state libraries, libraries of colleges and
universities, of medicine, law, history, art and other subjects may
be called special. But a special library… is much of the present
output of things-intended-to-be-read, and frankly adopt the new
library creed as to print management, of careful selection,
immediate use and ready rejection when usefulness is past."

1915 C. C.
Williamson

"The special library, as we understand the term, is an efficient, upto-date, reasonably complete collection of the literature of a
particular subject."

1915 Ethel M.
Johnson

"Subject matter alone does not make a library special" and "the
most distinctive feature of the special library is not so much its
subject matter as its service. Before everything else, it is an
information bureau… The function of the special library is to make
information available."

1915 R. H. Johnston

"scores of small collections in association with financial houses,
banking institutions, engineering firms, business enterprises, public
utilities, and corporations." / "In short, it is not a collection of
books however full that will adequately meet the demands of those
who have found it necessary to establish these special libraries;
there is necessary some medium either of method or of man fully to
utilize the collections in large libraries and be definitely responsible
for the care of the most recent information in some one of the
particular fields of inquiry or endeavor. What is needed is a
collection organized and planned for a certain end; a collection of
books and pamphlets that may be utilized as a tool in the busy
workaday world. Such a collection might not in the open market
produce any great sum. It is valued by its power to help and inspire
the busy man."

1921 Dorsey W.
Hyde, Jr.

"The figure includes for the most part collections maintained for
some special purpose, such as service to government, to business,
or to education and science. No effort has been made to restrict the
study to any one type or group of informational sources, the object
having been to make the list as inclusive as possible." / "American
business is entering into a new era, characterized by a keener
conception of service and merchandising method, and that the
business librarian or service specialist is to take an important part in
77

the new activities. The study of the brief notes descriptive of
special libraries now functioning will show that the members of
this profession are busily engaged in the development of a special
technique to aid them in getting results."
1924 Gertrude
Gilbert Drury

"half a dozen selected libraries illustrative of their type" : medical,
legislative, law, public service, engineering and contracting, and
manufacturing libraries

1925 D. N. Handy

"The libraries covered are exclusively special; no general, public,
college or school libraries having been admitted."

1926 D. N. Handy

"It seems to me that there is, however, one characteristic common
to all. This is a conscious effort to mobilize in one place the
information of a limited or even a general field and to render that
information adequately and quickly accessible to those who may
have need of it."

1930 Adelaide R.
Hasse

"A special library is one maintained on behalf of a special group or
for the collection and service of a special class of literature."

"A special library is a service organized to make available all
experience and knowledge that will further the activities and
common objectives of an organization or other restricted group,
with a staff having adequate knowledge in the field of
specialization and of the activities of the clientele, as well as
professional preparation. Its function is (1) to assemble information
from published sources both within and without the library, (2) to
secure information directly by correspondence and interview from
individuals and organizations specializing in particular fields, and
(3) to present this information at the appropriate time and place on
the initiative of the library as well as upon request, that it may take
an effective part in the work of the organization or group served.
Policies, methods, and collections vary, on the one hand according
to the library's subject interests: economics or business, social
sciences, science and technology, or the fine arts; and, on the other
hand, according to type of organization of which the library is a
part: a corporation, association, or institution, government office or
a general library having definitely decentralized departments."

78

1938 Ione M. Dority

Quoting M.L. Alexander: "collections of information on
specialized subjects that serve limited clientele," Two added points:
"selecting, summarizing, collecting and compiling information; the
carrying of information to the clientele"

1938 Isabel L.
Towner

"A special library gives library service to any organization or
specialized group by making available through a trained staff all
information from all sources, published or otherwise, on the subject
or subjects of interest or importance to the organization or group.
The organization may have commercial, economic, social or other
purposes and may consist of a corporation, association, institution,
government office or department of a general library."

1938 Marie Louise
Prevost

"A library service to the members or employees of an organization,
located on its premises, financed by the purse which pays persons
served… A library of literature on a specific subject."

1938 Marion C.
Manley

"A special library is a special collection serving a special clientele
and using special methods for the purpose."

1943 Linda H.
Morley 1943

"Special Library: a service organized to make available whatever
experience and knowledge that will further the specific activities of
a particular organization or limited group, all members of which
have a common objective; requiring on the part of the library staff
familiarity with the activities of the clientele and knowledge in the
field of specialization, as well as of library policies and techniques.
Its primary functions are (1) to maintain a continuing survey and
evaluation of current publications, research in progress, and
activities of individual authorities, on behalf of its clientele; (2) to
organize the sources of both written and unwritten experience and
knowledge from the specialist viewpoint; (3) to assemble from
within and without the library both publications and information as
required by the activities of its clientele, disseminating these on the
initiative of the library as well as on request; offer in abstract or
memorandum form oriented for immediate application to an
individual's work. Policies, methods, and collections vary among
individual special libraries in accordance with their subject interests
on the one hand, and on the other in relation to their organizational
type: (1) the special organization library serving all informational
needs of a corporation, non-profit organization, government body,
or other kind of institution, in which the library staff and clientele
are both employees of, and receive their salaries and expenses from
the same organization; as distinct from (2) the special branch of a
public library serving certain occupational groups; and (3) the
special subject library which may be semi-public, independent, or
79

departmental library, serving students, professional groups,
members, or general public, on a given subject."
1945 J. H. Moriarty

"Typically it is sustained and continued service of securing
assessed information, not limited to print, for one group, often in
one field of knowledge, but equally often in several fields."

1949 Herman H.
Henkle

"The primary characteristic of special librarianship is not so much
the subject content of the collection or the type of organization in
which the library is operating, nor the particular personnel it serves,
but rather the kind of service it gives."

1950 Linda H.
Morley 1950

"Special Library: A service organized to make available whatever
knowledge and experience will further the activities of a particular
organization, all members of which have the common objective of
their organization, although different functions and therefore a
number of subject interests, as in the special organization library,
the predominant type; or, of a group, organized or unorganized,
having a common subject interest but diverse individual objectives,
as in the special subject library. Collections and their methods of
organization are determined in individual special libraries largely
by their subject interests. On the other hand, the administrative and
service policies and the program of activities are determined by
their organizational type: (1) the special organization or staff
library serving all informational needs of a corporation, non-profit
organization, government body, or other kind of organization in
which the library staff and clientele are both employees of, and
receive their salaries and operating expenses from, the same
organization; as distinct from (2) the special subject library which
may be semi-public, independent, departmental or branch library,
serving students, professional groups, members or general public
on a given subject. Such service presupposes on the part of the
library staff familiarity with the activities of the clientele and
knowledge in the field of specialization, as well as of library
policies and techniques. Its primary functions are: (1) to maintain a
continuing survey and evaluation of current publications, research
in progress and activities of individual authorities, on behalf of its
clientele; (2) to organize the sources of both written and unwritten
experience and knowledge from the specialist's viewpoint; (3) to
assemble from within and without the library both publications and
information as required by the activities of its clientele; and in the
organization library, disseminating these on the initiative of the
library staff, as well as on request, in a manner to beget use, often
in abstract or memorandum form oriented for immediate
application to an individual's work."

80

1950 Ruth S. Leonard “A ‘special library’ is not an entity; it exists as an integral part of a
highly specialized kind of organization... Since it exists to serve the
members of that organization, it is necessary to provide in the
training program an orientation to the structure, functions and
activities of the varying types of organizations.”
1950 Ruth Savord

"The special library is the clearing house of live ideas and live
problems which are particular to the organization which it serves. It
is administered by a trained staff with a clear knowledge of the
activities, present and future, of the group it serves. It is above all
the central point for information in any organization."

1950 Sherry Taylor

Types: banks, law firms, advertising agencies, transportation
companies, research organizations, museums and hospitals;
business and industry, government, municipal, state and national;
movies, radio, television, newspapers, magazines; public and
university libraries in branches and special departments; education,
medicine, science, social welfare. / "Collections and clientele make
this type of work 'special' in several senses." / "Some librarians will
tell you that a special library is a library that isn't - stop. They will
say that a special library isn't a college library; it isn't a public
library; it isn't a school library... A special library is essentially a
positive, aggressive, dynamic library aptly defined as 'a special
collection, serving a special clientele and using special methods for
that process.’”

1951 Lucille Jackson

"The [special] library is thus first and last an information service
for its clientele, and is characterized by its flexibility and its
adaptability to the particular requirements of the organization of
which it is a part." / "The library service, to continue Morley's
descriptive definition, is executed by a staff well versed in the
special subject as well as the practices and techniques of library
science. The broad function is to secure, assemble, and present all
information in a specific subject field, published or unpublished,
thus bringing together related facts from files within the
organization and those found in print." / "In addition to securing
such information on request, the special library usually maintains
for its clientele a regular and systemic information service covering
the immediate and future interests of the enterprise of which it is a
part."

1952 Herman H.
Henkle

"The key word in the answer [to the question 'What is special?'] is
'service.'" / "Stated another way, special library service involves
participation by the librarian in the seeking and organization of
information for specific purposes. As a matter of fact, the librarian
in many special libraries is the principle user of the libraries'
81

collections. The ultimate form of such service is completion of the
total library research job for the client."
1952 Rose L.
Vormelker

"The distinguishing characteristic of special librarianship is
service."

1953 Elizabeth
Ferguson

"Special libraries are set up to serve the specialized interests of
organizations - business, professional, governmental and industrial
and they operate as units of these organizations… Special libraries
have selective, working collections of books and other material in
specific subject areas. Their collections, no matter what their size,
are frequently definitive in one or more subject fields."

1953 Katharine L.
Kinder

"First: The special library exists as a service unit within an
organization having non-library objectives. For instance: a
manufacturing company, a business office, a hospital or a
government agency. Second: Library materials are collected and
information services developed with the needs of the specific
organization in mind. And, Third: The special library is usually a
small one, both in amount of material held and in number of staff
members."

1955 Irene Macy
Strieby

“The profession of special librarianship and documentation is a
science of selecting, evaluating, organizing and disseminating
information in special fields of knowledge and the act of
integrating and adapting information resources to the needs of a
particular institution or clientele.”

1956 William A.
Haarstad

"1. The special library exists as a service unit within an
organization having non-library objectives… 2. Library materials
are collected and information services developed with the needs of
the specific organization in mind. This factor is descriptive of
special libraries as a type and also distinguishes one special library
from another. Uniqueness is largely a matter of subject
specialization... In each location, the librarian needs to be
thoroughly familiar with information sources and literature of
subject involved... 3. The special library is sometimes small, both
in amount of materials held and in number of staff members. These
libraries generally operate most effectively when near their
clientele."

1958 Louise Lefebvre "The special library provides a service; that is, it makes available to
an organization whatever knowledge and experience it can muster
to further that organizations activities… The special library is, in
short, a particularized information service which correlates,
interprets and utilizes the material at hand for the constant use and
benefit of the organization it serves."
82

1959 Leon
Carnovsky

Discussing standards for special libraries: "1. Each library should
have the materials necessary to supply the information required by
the personnel of its parent institution… 2. Each library should have
the personnel necessary to collect and assimilate the information
needed... 3. Each library should as far as possible observe sound
principles of personnel administration... 4. Each library should
make use of materials available in other libraries... 5. Each library
should be so organized as to permit systematic location of desired
information."

1960 Anthony T.
Kruzas

"There are, is addition to libraries supported by profit-making
enterprises, the following groups: government agency libraries,
special divisions of public libraries, nonprofit association libraries,
college and university departmental libraries, and the older
professional libraries in law, medicine, history, science, and
theology... company libraries, factory libraries, corporation
libraries, technical libraries, industrial libraries, commercial
libraries, business libraries, and research libraries." / "composed of
libraries which provided direct and exclusive services to American
business and industrial companies." / Kruzas also lists
characteristics as chapter section headings: objectives of company
libraries, the special librarian, the collections and their
organization, and services

1963 Eugene B.
Jackson

"A special library is engaged in activities serving the technical
information needs of a special clientele which departs from
standard library procedures and uses nonconventional sources and
methods as necessary to fill those needs. Like documentation, it is
an active, not a passive service."

1964 Paul
Wasserman

"the modern definition of the special library, which would be an
information facility designed to provide access to specialized
information and placed within range of and addressed to meet the
needs of a special clientele." / "For the special library... functions
within a framework of cost justification." / "The special library has
been historically, and remains today, an integral, functioning unit
of the organization in which it is found, dedicated to the
proposition that it exists only to offer the information which the
organization needs in order to build, prosper, advance, and achieve
its ultimate ends. This mandate, this purpose, this objective,
contributes to differences in emphasis, makes for very important
and very different service requirements."

1966 Joel Williams

"A library maintained by a business firm, association, government
agency, or other organized group whose collections are for the most
part limited in scope to the subject area of interest to the sponsor." /
83

"There is another group of libraries which should not be considered
special libraries... libraries serving personnel of army posts and
naval stations, libraries for hospital patients, libraries serving
federal institutions of higher education such as the Air University
and Howard University, libraries serving elementary and secondary
schools on military posts, etc." / See page 96 for four criteria that
make up the definition.
1967 Jesse H. Shera

"A special library may be regarded as a bibliographic service
developed around a particular idea and organized and staffed to
meet the needs of a precisely defined clientele… Unlike the general
library, the special library is prone to ignore the conventional
compartmentalization of knowledge and to collect and organize its
materials according to the requirements of a particular situation.
The situation may call for materials, in a variety of physical forms,
from many different subject fields, but each item must contribute in
a significant way to the success of the enterprise that is served.""

1967 Lee Ash

"In the simplest terms it is a collection of books and other
informational media of any and all kinds, related especially to a
particular subject emphasis and, generally, accumulated, arranged,
and serviced for the use of a clientele whose interests are more or
less oriented to the subject fields of the collection. Thus the special
library, it will seem, can easily be the library of, or a collection
servicing, a department of a public institution, college, or
university. It can be a supporting arm of a government office (such
as the library of a city's Health Department), or of a business, or of
a bank, museum, newspaper, hospital, or of a probate gentlemen's
club, etc."

1967 Robert J.
Havlik, Bill M.
Woods, and
Leona M. Vogt

"Many library experts believe that the only things special libraries
have in common are their differences. This theory has some
backing when one examines the diversity of operational
classifications, subject-matter classifications, materials collected,
services provided, and the variety of administrative management
and support of these libraries. The authors of this study, however,
felt that there was a basic core of librarianship behind these
libraries." They also discuss the "active role of the special library in
the information needs of twentieth century society."

their difference from the three other major forms of libraries
familiar to North Americans…" / "they are easily differentiated
from other libraries… by where they are found… by limitations in
subject scope… by kinds or groups of people who use them or are
served by them… by a predominant characteristic of 'smallness'…
by their emphasis on the information function." / See page 1 for a
list of types

1976 Elin B.
Christianson

"The central concepts of the modern special library movement [are]
the utilitarian management of print whether in traditional or nontraditional form, the librarian as subject or information specialist,
the clientele as businessmen, scientists, professionals or other
practitioners who use information in the course of their work, and
above all, the idea of information service as the primary function of
the library."

1976 Shirley
Echelman

"a special library can be defined as follows: a physical collection of
information, knowledge, and/or opinion limited to a single subject
or group of related subjects or to a single format of information
product or a group of related formats; organized under the aegis of
an institution which provides funds for its continuance;
administered by a librarian or a specialist in the subject or subjects
covered; and carrying the mission of acquiring, organizing, and
providing access to information and knowledge in furtherance of
the goals of the parent institution."

1978 Cecily J. Surace

"a special library is… a type of information system which is
usually part of a larger organization whose primary interests and
objectives are not in information. The special library has as its
85

objective the transfer of information and publications or other
media to a defined user group." / "the special library is an
information transfer mechanism."
1978 Frank E.
McKenna

"Specialized service, anticipation of client needs, and quick
response to such needs characterize the specialized library."

1980 Audrey Skinner

“One might argue that every library is a special library; that is, one
which brings to its users services and materials which other
libraries cannot or do not supply.”

1980 Elin B.
Christianson

Christianson's research into "new special libraries" excludes
academic and public special collections

1980 Estelle
Broadman

"special libraries are not only the institutionalized memory of
mankind for the subject they represent, but they present that
memory in bits and forms which make the information pertinent to
the problem to be solved… The special library, then, is the sum of
shared technical information prepared behind the scenes, plus the
physical containers in which the information is stored."

1980 Grieg Aspnes

“In general it can be said that the special librarian’s methods may
be less formal, more experimental, with a greater tendency to use
short cuts or to adopt novel techniques.” / “Special librarians must
see themselves as problem solvers … their main responsibility
continues and will continue to be service – information service – to
individuals, to satisfy their needs and help solve their problems.”

and technical institutions; government; special departments of

Information

"A library established, supported, and administered by a business
firm, private corporation, association, government agency, or other
special-interest group or agency to meet the information needs of
its members of staff in pursuing the goals of the organization.
Scope of collections and services is limited to the subject interests
of the host or parent organization."

1983 Alberta L.
Brown

"The fundamental purpose of the special library today is service to
a special clientele rather than to the general public, but the basic
concept of service is common throughout the profession." / "The
diversity of both subject matter and purpose in the special library
has been a factor in the development of the profession."
86

1983 Benjamin C.
Glidden

"Is a library considered a special library by virtue of the unusual or
unique aspects of the building and the services it offers, or is it
defined as a special library because of the special nature of the
community it serves and the unique needs of that community."

1983 Brigette T.
Darney and
Sharon L.
Stanton

"special libraries are libraries built around a special collection
limited by subject matter or form; functionally, these libraries…
operate in support of a special mission or activity chosen by their
sponsoring organizations." and lists of types

1983 Emily R.
Mobley

"The special library in the private sector, or corporation, mirrors the
institution of which it is a part… This is analogous to academic
libraries which tend to reflect the educational programs in an
academic institution. Likewise, the public library's resources and
programs tend to reflect its community of users...Historically,
service was the aspect which differentiated special libraries form
other types of libraries."

1983 Joseph M.
Dagnese

"Special libraries are in large part ahistorical, that is, they do not
maintain large historical research collections in their fields of
interest… These collections are typically working collections,
organized to provide rapid access to data needed in the daily
operations of the parent organizations."

1983 William M.
Hubbard, Jr.

"The role of a special library is to improve the use of related
scientific knowledge. This aim is realized when the library acts as
translator and communicator between those who produce and those
who utilize scientific knowledge."

1984 Elizabeth
Ferguson and
Emily R.
Mobley

"A special library is characteristically a unit or department of an
organization primarily devoted to other than library or educational
purposes. A special librarian is first an employee, a staff member of
the parent organization, and second, a librarian. 'Special' really
means library service specialized or geared to the interests of the
organization and the information needs of its personnel."

1984 Herbert S.
White

White gives an impressive list of "significant characteristics,"
saying "We will have to find our own definitions of the
characteristics likely to differentiate special libraries - recognizing
their own diversity - from other libraries that we would not
consider special or that would not consider themselves special":
emphasis on providing information, nontraditional settings, a
limited body of users, limited subject scope, small collections,
inconspicuous quarters, the need to establish usefulness,
relationship to organizational mission, management that is not
library-oriented, the impact of organizational policies, untrained
87

clientele, working under time pressures, libraries that take on the
user's burden, specialized and internal materials, restricted access,
entrepreneurial opportunities, limitations and exceptions,
information versus documents, and the rewards of special
librarianship.

"Special libraries are differentiated from other libraries by their
emphasis on the information function… by where they are found…
by the kinds or groups of people who use them or are served by
them… [and] by a predominant characteristic of 'smallness.'"

1993 Esther Green
Bierbaum

“Special libraries may be defined by exclusion, if not by default:
they are libraries or information centers that are not public,
academic, or school libraries. This definition does not address the
dilemma of librarians who are in charge of subject-oriented
departments or collections of nonbook materials and who also
regard themselves as ‘special librarians.’” / “The organization
dictates not only the subject matter and the format in which
information about the subject is transmitted, but also the kind of
use to which the library’s patrons put the information.” / “The
special library’s activities are directed to the goal of its ultimate
function: providing information services to the parent organization.
Indeed, in the end analysis, the library’s information service is the
basis for its claim of specialness. Thus, information service is the
definitive function and characteristic of special librarianship: a
personalized, anticipatory service that is usually pragmatic and
occasionally exhaustive in execution and that is always specific to
the library’s setting and the mission of its parent organization.”

1994 Eugene B.
Jackson

“they have historically differed from more easily categorized,
conventional libraries in their commitment to bring all available
resources to bear on the current and future information needs of
their users, who are most often engaged in highly specialized
projects that require unique sources and services.”

organizations sponsored by private companies, government
agencies, not-for-profit organizations, or professional associations.
88

Subject specialty units in public and academic libraries are usually
labeled as special libraries as well.” / Mount and Massoud also list
characteristics to consider: organizational names, size, salaries,
collection sizes, location of facilities, services offered, relations
with top management, and duties of professionals; and they give a
brief comparison to academic and public libraries (p. 12-13)
2002 Joseph R.
Matthews

"Special libraries have a number of characteristics that should be
acknowledged… The library collection is typically small but highly
specialized in subject matter. Clients are typically only staff of the
larger organization, and their interests are known and can be
explained fairly accurately. The library is part of a larger
organization... that shares and supports the mission of that
organization. There is a tradition of being very responsive to the
clients of the library, often articulated as providing high-quality or
timely service."

2004 Joan M. Reitz

"A library established and funded by a commercial firm,
private association, government agency, nonprofit organization, or
special interest group to meet the information needs of its
employees, members, or staff in accordance with the
organization's mission and goals. The scope of the collection is
usually limited to the interests of the host organization." Plus see
also list.

2007 Stephen C. Boss “Rather than act only in a support role the corporate librarian often
and Glen S.
has the opportunity to work and contribute as a partner, with
Cook
researchers.”
2009 David
Shumaker

“Special libraries are libraries that have one or more of the
following attributes: a focus on specialized information resources,
usually of a limited subject scope; a focus on a specialized and
limited clientele; and the delivery of specialized services to that
clientele. Some authorities add that a special library is one
sponsored by a parent institution.”

2009 Guy St. Clair

St. Clair lists three characteristics that define specialized libraries:
"particularly focused 'special' collections, a unique and 'special'
body of users, and a collaborative and distinctly 'special'
relationship between the librarian and the user," and he says "The
purpose of the specialized library has always been, and still is, to
support research requirements of that specific and unique group of
clients (not 'readers') for whom the collection exists. Or, put
another way, the specialized library is a library created to
contribute to the achievement of the specific mission of the parent
organization that supports the library and for which it exists."
89

2011 Eva Semertzaki

"Special library is defined as the library that serves business,
industry and government. Alternative names of a special library are
information centre, research, corporate or company library and
knowledge management centre. Over the years the predominant
term, though, is ‘special library’. Very simply a special library is
defined as the library that is not public, academic, school or
national but serves a specialized public, which comprises the parent
organization."

2013 Tara E. Murray

"In the contemporary literature, one way to define special libraries
is by what they are not, i.e., any library that doesn’t fall into the
academic, public, or school categories. Another definition includes
any library with a specialized collection, and some definitions also
include subject departments within academic and public libraries,
which are not separate libraries but operate with some degree of
autonomy.”

2014 Liya Deng

"The lack of consensus among scholars and practitioners can be
explained by the variety of types and sizes of special libraries with
differing specialized collections, services, and the clientele they
strived to satisfy."

"Information organizations are defined as those entities that deliver
information-based solutions to a given market." / "An Information
Professional (“IP”) strategically uses information in his/her job to
