0XVLFLVRQHRIWKHPRVWSRSXODUFDWHJRULHVLQJHQHUDOSXEOLFÂ¶V:HEVHDUFK&RPSared to other
types of information retrieval, music search requires a different approach. This is due to the fact
that music information includes many unique elements such as composers, performers,
instruments, and various media formats, which could make it difficult for the users to realize that
there may be related or even duplicated music information available in a different format.
Therefore, the methods of organization and presentation for music information become
significant in the field of Music Information Retrieval (MIR).
Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) is considered an effective
model for representing the relationships between musical works and organizing the information
of musical works. The goals of this dissertation are twofold. First, I adopted FRBR as a model to
represent classical music and propose additional attributes and relationships through user studies
to enrich music information for users. Second, I examined, through user studies, how the FRBR
model improves MIR compared to existing keyword-based retrieval methods.
In order to achieve these two goals, three phases of studies are designed. The first phase

This study has two primary contributions. First, it proposed an extended FRBR-based
classical music representation model, CMFRBR, which was derived through interaction with
music experts, information experts, and general music seekers. Second, it examines user
experiences and system performance of classical music information retrieval using CMFRBR
based search system compared to FRBR-like music retrieval system on the Web in multiple
dimensions.

INTRODUCTION

Motivation of the Study

The explosive increase of Web and digital resources causes users to spend a significant amount
of time searching, browsing, and filtering information on the Web. In digital library
environments, researchers HQGHDYRU WR VDYH XVHUVÂ¶ WLPH and labor by providing effective and
friendly functions such as recommending keywords, linking relationships of search results, and
providing relevance ranking. There are several categories (e.g., image, local, commerce, music,
etc.) people would like to search on the Web, and the music is one of the most popular topic in
Web search from the general public (Beitzel, Jensen, Chowdhury, Grossman, & Frieder, 2004;
Song, Ma, Wang, & Wang, 2013). This study particularly focuses on the music field because
searching for music requires a different approach in comparison to other types of information
retrieval. Not only it is difficult to fully grasp the many unique elements that describe music
information such as composers, performance date, performers, conductors, featured instruments,
and various media formats, it is also difficult for users to realize that related or even duplicate
sound-recording information may be available in different media formats. In addition, most
music information lacks the relationships from musical work level to performance and physical
music objects such sound recordings, book, music score and so forth. Researchers have been
working on resolving these problems for decades (Dickey, 2008).

1

Music information retrieval (MIR) has been a flourishing area in information retrieval.
Currently, many musicologists, computer scientists, and even library and information scientists
are primarily concerned with content-based music retrieval that focuses on music similarity of
audio data that examines similar patterns of rhythm, pitch, and melodies (Casey et al., 2008).
This general trend of music information retrieval especially benefits music experts, such as
musicians and musical scholars, in discovering relevant music resources. However, non-expert
users are not as interested in these approaches as professional users. Novice users search music
information mainly with text by using metadata and keywords (Bosma, Veltkamp, & Wiering,
2006; Kim & Belkin, 2002).
In order to develop effective music database systems in both library and Web
environments, it is necessary to create an appropriate organization system and metadata schema
for music resources. Traditional cataloging systems provide catalog records based on item
descriptions like books, films, digital objects and sound recordings in their collections. Library
patrons can find adequate information about an item but would not find background information
or historical creation information for a work. Especially for music, catalog records provide
limited information about the work and limited performance information. Old cataloging rules
and systems such as MARC (Machine Readable Cataloging), ISBD (International Standard
Bibliographic Description), and AACR2 (Anglo American Cataloging Rules 2) have limitations
in describing multi-layered bibliographic records that are crucial for defining the relationships of
music information. Hemmasi (2002) describes the above weakness in MARC as a digitized
representation of music.
Through the efforts of many library researchers, the new cataloging standard, Resource
Description and Access (RDA), was launched on April 1st, 2013 at the Library of Congress of

2

United States of America (Library of Congress, 2012) and the British Library of United
Kingdom1. These cataloging rules can describe the relationships between metadata information
elements of classical music more systemically by applying the FRBR (Functional Requirements
for Bibliographic Records) as their conceptual model.
Many FRBR-related studies and projects have been conducted in the past decade. For
examples, in the early stage of music FRBR, many library projects concentrated on the migration
from old music cataloging records to FRBR-based records, known as FRBRization (Yee, 2005),
and several projects have done this successfully in the last few years (Ayres, 2005; Chang, Tsai,
Dunsire, & Hopkinson, 2013; Hardesty, Harris, Coogan, & Notess, 2012). Following these
FRBRization projects, several studies have been conducted which focused on FRBR as a
conceptual model of RDA (Picco & Ortiz Repiso, 2012; Riva & Oliver, 2012; Taniguchi, 2012).
Among prior FRBR-related studies, only a small number of them have included user evaluation
and FRBR user task study from the past decade (Hider & Liu, 2013; Pisanski & Zumer, 2010a,
2010b, 2012; Zhang & Salaba, 2012).
In terms of classical music, thousands of famous pieces of classical music have been
performed and published in various formats, which complicates the relationships of music
information. The complex relationship structure of classical music makes it difficult to represent
in general music information representation. It is expected that the complex structure of classical
music should represent related musical works and their information. Le Boeuf (2005b) suggested
that FRBR is an effective model for representing these relationships among musical works and
organizing the information of musical works, including classical music. Many library projects

such as the Variations project from Indiana University2 and Music Australia (now Trove)3 are
providing FRBR-based music bibliographic records. Although music FRBR has been examined
as a potential solution for improving music information retrieval, there are few Web-based music
databases that partially implement some aspects of a FRBR model (without claiming to have
implemented a FRBR model) to organize and present music information (e.g. MusicBrainz4).

1.2

Focus of the Study

Motivated by previous research and discussions of the FRBR model mainly in the library
cataloging settings (Ayres, 2005; Hardesty et al., 2012; McGill, 2011; Riley, 2008), there is
potential benefit in adopting the FRBR model for Web-based information representation
(3LVDQVNL3LVDQVNL Ã¤XPHU). In addition, classical music bibliographic records need new
methods to represent and organize their complex relationships and detailed information. This
study focused on the ways in which FRBR attributes and relationship descriptions enhance the
usability for finding classical music bibliographic information in a Web environment.
The purposes of this dissertation are threefold. First, I adopted FRBR as an entity
relationship model to represent classical music and proposed additional attributes and
relationships to supplement this model. The newly added components were selected based on the
original FRBR model through consultation studies in which I received feedback from various

groups to enrich classical music information and relationship descriptions for classical music
seekers.
Second, ,LQYHVWLJDWHGJHQHUDOSXEOLFÂ¶VFODVVLFDOPXVLFbibliographic information seeking
patterns in a social Q&A site, Yahoo! Answers to see if the FRBR model could provide good
resources for XVHUVÂ¶FODVVLFDOPXVLFLQIRUPDWLRQQHHGV
Third, I examined through a user experiment how the FRBR model-based classical music
search system improves music information retrieval compared to the existing keyword-based
retrieval methods (IMSLP as the baseline method) on the Web.
This dissertation proposes an extended FRBR-based classical music bibliographic records
representation, called CMFRBR (Classical Music bibliographical records based on the FRBR
model). CMFRBR was derived through interaction with music experts, information experts, and
general music seekers in Phase 1, which identified the important attributes and relationships of
classical music description in FRBR model. Proposed CMFRBRÂ¶V classical music representation
examined the usefulness of attributes in each entity and the effectiveness of the relationships
between entities. Additionally, this study examined user experiences and system performance of
music information retrieval using the CMFRBR-based information retrieval system, called
FIRM, compared to music information retrieval on the Web (IMSLP) in multiple dimensions.
The task sets in the experiment were sampled from Yahoo! Answers in Phase 2.

should be represented in a FRBR-based bibliographic system. The study adopts both a qualitative
and quantitative methodology in order to analyze effectiveness and usefulness of the FRBR
model in enhancing the usability of information retrieval of classical music. 7R GR VR XVHUVÂ¶
search performance and perception were measured in various ways.

1.3.1 Research Questions

research questions. The research questions addressed in this study are:
x

RQ 1: How can classical music information be represented in a FRBR-based bibliographic
system?
-

RQ 1.1: What are the important features (attributes and relationship between entities)
of FRBR to represent classical music?

-

RQ 1.2: Do users experience FIRMÂ¶VDWWULEXWHVDQGUHODWLRQVKLSVamong entities as a
useful and positive aid in satisfying their information needs? Moreover, does FIRM
give users a better user experience when compared to IMSLP?

Phase 1 (Chapter 3) consisted of two parts: 1) a consultation study with music domain
experts and 2) a user survey. The first study was a consultation with four music school students
from Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh. The participants reviewed all
the attributes of each entity and relationships FRBR model proposed and they were asked to
determine the FRBRÂ¶V LPSRUWDQW attributes and relationship descriptions fit to classical music
representation. From this study, additional attributes and relationships were proposed.
The goals of the user survey in Phase 1 were WR H[DPLQH XVHUVÂ¶ SHUVSHFWLYHV WRZDUG
FRBR representation and to determine the important attributes and relationships to describe
bibliographic records of musical work. It was found that the FRBR model is suitable for classical
music representation because the model contains many features to support classical music
information and relationships. After the survey, attributes in each entity and the relationships
between entities were ranked based on their responses. The top ranked attributes (i.e., title of
work and expression, instrument of expression, name and biography of person), and relationships
of classical music in FRBR were adopted to Phase 3, which examined the usability of FRBRbased classical music search that provides the attributes information and relationships between
entities.
In Phase 2 (Chapter 4)DTXDOLWDWLYHPHWKRGZDVFKRVHQWRDQDO\]HXVHUVÂ¶questions about
classical music information sampled from Yahoo! Answers, one of the most popular Social Q&A
sites. The study investigated 500 questions in the classical music category in Yahoo! Answers to
examine whether general web users seek to find bibliographic information of classical music.
Based on the data analysis, it is revealed that a number of questions are related to bibliographical
information of classical music, which can be answered with the FRBRÂ¶V attributes and
relationship descriptions. The findings demonstrate that FRBR-based classical music

8

representation can be feasible for Web-based music search systems. Phase 2 answered RQs 2.1
and 2.2. To extend the study from the findings of the Phase 2, it is necessary to examine how
FRBR-based classical music representation can help users find useful information compared to
the general classical music information provider on the Web.
Phase 3 (Chapter 5) assessed whether CMFRBR (Classic Music representation based on
the FRBR model) can help provide useful information in practice through a user experiment. The
question sets for the user experiment were adapted from the sampled questions in in Yahoo!
Answers. The experiment was designed as a comparative study and conducted in FIRM, the
CMFRBR-based classical music information system, and plain text-based classical music library
website, called IMSLP5 (International Music Score Library Project) to evaluate the efficiency,
effectiveness, and user experience. The results analysis of the study indicated that FIRM is a
suitable system to provide proper bibliographic records and relationship descriptions for general
music seekers. This phase answered RQs 1.2, 2.3, and 2.4. The main research questions were
solved in multiple phases. The relationships between phases and research questions are shown in
Figure 1.1.

Terminology

This section provides concise definitions for the key terminologies in this study, including the
components of Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR), and Music
Information Retrieval (MIR).

11

1.4.1 Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR)
1.4.1.1

Work

IFLA (International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions) Study Group on the
Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records defined work as Â³a distinct intellectual or
artistic creation. It is an abstract entity; there is no single material object one can point to as the
workÂ´(1998). The GHILQLWLRQRIPXVLFDOZRUNLVÂ³an intellectual sonic conception. Musical work
takes documentary form in a variety of instantiationsÂ´(Richard P Smiraglia, 2001). This study
solely focuses on classical musical work and adopts its definition from the Merriam-Webster
dictionary: Â³of, relating to, or being music in the educated European tradition that includes such
forms as art song, chamber music, opera, and symphony as distinguished from folk or popular
music or jazz ("Classical," 2015)Â´Its period expands from the 11th century to the present day
which includes Medieval, Renaissance, Baroque, Classical, Romantic, 20th Century, and
Contemporary, and the form of classical music includes Orchestral Music (symphony, concert,
ballet, suite, etc.), Chamber Music (string trio, piano trio, string quintet, etc.), Solo Instrumental
Music, Vocal Music, Opera, etc.
1.4.1.2

Expression

The definition of expression by the IFLA Study Group on FRBR is Â³the intellectual or artistic
realization of a work in the form of alpha-numeric, musical, or choreographic notation, sound,
image, object, movement, etc., or any combination of such formsÂ´ (1998). In this study,
Â³expressionÂ´ refers to the realization of classical musical ZRUNE\FHUWDLQPXVLFLDQVRUJURXSÂ¶V
performance in a certain time and place. The delivering method of this expression can include
studio performance, concert, event performance or recording process.
12

1.4.1.3

Manifestation

Manifestation is Â³the physical embodiment of an expression of a workÂ´ (IFLA, 1998). In this
study, manifestation is a published musical expression in a certain physical embodiment. All
formats of medium, physical or electronic, which contain the music expression, can be
considered as a manifestation. This study does not include physical or electronic objects of music
book, music score, or other materials in manifestation; only sound recordings of classical music
performance in its carrier including CD, DVD, computer file (mp3), video file (clip).
1.4.1.4

Person

Person is a term which Â³encompasses individuals that are deceased as well as those that are
livingÂ´ (IFLA, 1998). It is, in this study, an individual (musician or related person) who is
responsible for each musical work, its expression, or manifestation is defined as person.
Examples of person in musical work are composer and writer (lyricist, librettist). Person in
expression includes performer, conductor, sponsor, and director. The publisher (if applicable)
and the representative person in publication can be manifestation of person.
1.4.1.5

Corporate Body

Corporate body is Â³an organization or group of individuals and/or organizations acting as a unit.
The entity defined as a corporate body encompasses organizations and groups of individuals
and/or organizations that are identified by a particular name, including occasional groups and
groups that are constituted as meetings, conferences, congresses, expeditions, exhibitions,
festivals, fairs, etcÂ´(IFLA, 1998). Corporate body in Music FRBR is a group that is responsible
for each musical work, its expression[s], or manifestation[s]. A person in corporate body does
not have to belong to a sole corporate body; s/he can be a member of any corporate body if
13

necessary. The examples of corporate body in work, expression, and manifestation are same as
person entity above.
1.4.1.6

Attributes

Attributes of each entity serve as the means by which users formulate queries and interpret
responses when seeking information about a particular entity (IFLA, 1998). Although all the
semantic terms RI DWWULEXWHV DUH NHSW LQ WKH EDFNJURXQG LQ RUGHU WR HQKDQFH XVHUVÂ¶
understandability, the name of some attributes can change (i.e. Medium of Performance as
Instrumentation, Numeric Designation as Opus Number or Music Number).

REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE

This chapter reviews previous research on music information retrieval and music catalog in
library settings. In addition, studies of metadata use and the relationship model in music
information retrieval are introduced, as well as discussion of FRBR.

2.1

FRBR as a Conceptual Model of Cataloging System

2.1.1 Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records
Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) is a recommendation of the
International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) to restructure catalog
databases to reflect the conceptual structure of information resources (IFLA, 1998). FRBR
defines relationships among entities such as Work, Expression, Manifestation, Item in Group 1,
and Person, Corporate Body in Group 2.
FRBR identifies three groups of entities relevant to users of bibliographic information:
Group 1 entities include Â³SURGXFWVRILQWHOOHFWXDORUDUWLVWLFHQGHDYRUWKDWDUHQDPHGRUGHVFULEHG

different perspective of user interests in the outcomes. The work defined as Â³a distinct

2.1.2 Research on FRBR
From the beginning of the new millennium, many libraries and library researchers endeavored to
develop FRBR in different aspects. This chapter will review the FRBR as an entity-relationship
model, application, system development, and evaluations based on the categories from the
previous research (0HUÃ¾XQÃ¢YDE+DUHM Ã¤XPHU; Zhang & Salaba, 2009b).
2.1.2.1

FRBR as Entity-Relationship Model

FRBR has been considered a new representation model for bibliographic information and many
previous studies discuss how FRBR can differentiate the representations of old bibliographic
data of resources (Le Boeuf, 2005b; O'Neill, 2002; Riley, 2008; Riley, Hunter, Colvard, & Berry,
2007; Riva, 2007; Tillett, 2005; Zhang & Salaba, 2009a). In addition, Resource Description and
Access (RDA), a new cataloging standard and a replacement of AACR 2, employed FRBR in its
conceptual model for displaying relationships (Chapman, 2010; Seikel, 2013).
FRBR can draw the relationships between entities, and can place all versions of an
intellectual work in a specific collection. Chapman (2010) and Riley, Mullin, and Hunter (2009)
point out that AACR2 is a single item centered cataloging which can present limited
relationships such as redundancy, while the FRBR model can present a whole map of
relationships based on work entity. Maxwell (2008, p. 134) explains WKDWÂ³MARC was designed
as a flat-file system, with all information about an item within a single bibliographic record
GLYLGHG LQWR ILHOGV RI IL[HG RU YDULDEOH ZLGWKVÂ«7KH ELEOLRJUDSKLF IRUPDW UHFRUG FRQtinues to
contain aspects of all the FRBR entities in flat-file system.Â´ Each MARC record typically
describes the bibliographic records of a single item, while the field records contain all of the

20

necessary information about the cataloged item without depending on other records (Takhirov,
$DOEHUJ Ã¤XPHU).
One of the advantages of FRBR is that it facilitates both a search and exploratory
interface so that music seekers can follow the relationships from person or work level to find the
expression, as well as different versions of manifestations (Buchanan, 2006; Takhirov, Aalberg,
'XFKDWHDX  Ã¤XPHU ). Moreover, Bennett et al. (2003) note that FRBR is not only an
assured model to enhance the functionality of search and retrieval tools for library patrons in a
catalog system, but is also a more efficient model for cataloging practice. 0HUÃ¾XQ DQG Ã¤XPHU
(2009) emphasize that FRBR can help users explore search results and find relationships of the
records as well. Collocating related bibliographic records within a set of clusters will help users
navigate search results, understand relationships between items, and supply opportunities to
access similar works and expressions. FRBR provides a better means for users to navigate
possible relationships like different media formats, editions, languages, publishers, and so forth
(Dickey, 2008). Tillett (2005) notes WKDWÂ³FRBR offers us a fresh perspective on the structure and
relationships of bibliographic and authority records, and also a more precise vocabulary to help
future cataloging rule makers and system designers in meeting user needs.Â´ FRBR hosts
comprehensive descriptions of the item, its available formats, and the precise location and
availability of each format. The system goes on to note the collection or location which houses a
specific manifestation or expression of a work. Users want to know where the manifestation of
the work is, in which formats it is available at a location, as well as related items culled by the
FRBR system.
FRBR can define relationships well in a hierarchical structure. Entities in Group 1

Pisanski & Zumer, 2007). It was found that work and manifestation levels are possibly already
identified in existing catalog records; however, identifying the expressions of work were
problematic due to the lack of expression attributes (O'Neill, 2002). The problem of defining the
expression entity has been reported in various studies, and Richard P. Smiraglia (2012) arranges
the issues of expression in cataloging as technical problems, identifiable issues, modeling issues,
etc., by giving the examples of previous studies. According to Le Boeuf, however, these issues
are not a true modeling problem of expression in FRBR; the problem is caused by cataloging
practice (Le Boeuf, 2005a).
Other examples of large-scale FRBR projects in libraries are the Australian National
Bibliographic Database (Rajapatirana & Missingham, 2005), AustLit: the Australian Literature
Gateway (Ayres, 2005; Ayres, Kilner, Fitch, & Scarvell, 2002; Kilner, 2005), and the
MusicAustralia (integrated into Trove in June 2012) projects (Ayres, 2005). These projects were
led by the National Library of Australia and universities in Australia. They successfully achieved
their goal of implementing FRBR in their database. According to Ayres (2005), integrating an
enriched FRBR-based view with the traditional bibliographic view benefitted users who were
seeking information.

Therefore, it is necessary to find how users behave when seeking information in a FRBRized
cataloging system. A Delphi study finds, when contemplating possible issues with the FRBR
model, library experts are most concerned with whether or not the FRBR model is appropriate
for the user (Madison, 2006; Zhang & Salaba, 2009a, 2009b). Compared to other areas, a small
number of user evaluations and user task studies were conducted (Hanrath & Kottman, 2015;

24

Pisanski & Zumer, 2010a, 2010b, 2012). A few researchers conduct user evaluation using the
developed systems (Hardesty et al., 2012; Notess, Dunn, & Hardesty, 2011; Sadeh, 2008; Salaba
& Zhang, 2012; Zhang & Salaba, 2012). Although these studies demonstrate that users can
successfully identify FRBR entities and relationships, there has been less focus on how users can
find metadata information and detailed relationships among FRBR-based music representation
(Ã¤XPHU6DODED =KDQJ). It is generally considered to be an important contribution to the
understanding of the entities and relationships that are of interest to the end user (Takhirov et al.,
2011). IFLA defines user tasks as four steps: find, identify, select, and obtain. Not all entities can
be applied in each task. For example, users can find, identify, and select work and expression,
but cannot obtain work or expression. Not all user studies follow the user task of the FRBR draft,
but many studies are processed based on the user task suggestion.

2.2

FRBR as Music Information Representation Method

2.2.1 FRBR-Based Music Representation
Several researchers perceive that FRBR can serve as a data representation model of musical
bibliographic information in the library cataloging system, and adopted the FRBR model in
music catalogs (Ayres, 2005; Dunn, Byrd, Notess, Riley, & Scherle, 2006; Le Boeuf, 2005b;
Minibayeva & Dunn, 2002; Riley, 2008; Riley et al., 2007; Richard P Smiraglia, 2001).
Most FRBR projects in the past decade made efforts to successfully migrate the
bibliographic records of music from MARC to FRBR. However, the projects had difficulties
including the many attributes of work and other entities needed to realize the benefits of the
application of the FRBR model. This was mainly due to the lack of detailed descriptions and
25

relationships in previous catalog records where these attributes can function as information
resources to users. This is because a MARC record of a music item does not contain enough
bibliographical description of the musical work, expression, and person entity. This dearth of
prior information leaves many fields in FRBR entries empty after converting from MARC, thus
crippling the FRBR system. While this is not the only problem when converting to FRBR, it can
severely limit the development of relationships between musical works and persons. In order to
link the complex relationship between work, expression, and person, the FRBR model provides
the entities of person and corporate body in Group 2 and establishes relationships with the
entities in Group 1. The bibliographic records of music have more entry fields to fill in than
those of printed materials, such as books in a library cataloging system, because, for instance,
various levels of person such as composer, conductor, performer, and librettist exist in work and
performance levels. In a 0$5&HQWU\FDWDORJHUVXVHG[[Â¿HOGV DGGHGHQWULHV WRGHVFULEHWKH
additional information to improve the search results and present better information about the
item. The 100 and 7xx fields often contain person and corporate body information, including the
titles of works or performances (Takhirov et al., 2012). In the context of music FRBR, common
usages of added entries are to include additional persons such as composers, performers and
conductors. Using these fields, it is possible to extract person/corporate body and link with the
musical work. This will be able to draw relationship between music and persons.
FRBR is designed to support the representation of the multiple or related resources.
However, it has limitations when representing relationships with hierarchical structure. S. Lee
and Jacob (2011) argue that FRBR has difficulty portraying dynamic resources because its firm
hierarchical structure makes its relationship not fully supported between groups of entities and
attributes. When the FRBR model is applied to music records, the relationships among work,

26

expression, manifestation, and person and corporate body seem complex. For sound recordings,
especially with music, Bowen (2005) states that a specific music event or performance is an
expression level, so that all products of the event are the manifestation of the expression. In the
expression level, multiple musical works by different composers can be played by musician(s)
and/or conductor at one concert. Then, in the manifestation level, the concert could be recorded
to various media formats with a specific title for the concert which is not related to the title of the
musical ZRUNV )RU H[DPSOH WZR SLDQLVWV UHFRUG %HHWKRYHQÂ¶V SLDQR VRQDWDV LQ DQ DOEXP Dnd
release it with different titles. In addition, one famous music columnist may collect his/her
favorite classical music from various composers (i.e. Beethoven, Mozart, Bach, etc.) and release
them in various media formats. In most of these cases, it will be difficult to represent the
relationship of music information because defining the relationship of the musical works and the
musicians in work and expression levels is complex. Adding to this, when these Expressions are
released in different types of containers such as CDs and DVDs, another complexity of music
relationship between containers take places in Manifestation level.
When a smaller music collection RU D SDUWLFXODU FRPSRVHUÂ¶V PXVLFal works adopt the
FRBR model, it is anticipated that a simple network structure model can be established.
+RZHYHU ZKHQ WKH )5%5 PRGHO FRYHUV D OLEUDU\Â¶V HQWLUH PXVLF FROOHFWLRQ LW LV difficult to
define the relationship due to the complication of the network-like arrangement. Therefore, it is
hard to say whether real FRBR displays would be in a hierarchical structure or, in fact, have
network structure. According to Pisanski and Zumer (2010a), a true FRBR display should be a
network structure, not a hierarchy, because various works and expressions can be contained in a
single manifestation. Similar problems could occur if music records employ the FRBR model.

27

Figure 2.7 Complexity of Music Records Relationship

Another problem occurs when music information is applied to FRBR. Le Boeuf (2005b)
demonstrates that four entities in FRBR can highlight the four distinct meanings that a single
word such DVÂ³VFRUHÂ´PD\KDYHLQFRPPRQVSHHFK. In other words, score can be repeated in all
entities when it has different characteristics. Score is a work when it is used in the sense of
musical work or when its role is the base of the derived product/performance of a musical work.
When score is the abstraction in a composerÂ¶V mind with its concept of contents or text, it is
expression. Manifestation is the publication of musical work.
Moreover, format variation on intellectual property is another question that how to
present the relationships between printed and digitized (electronic) versions as realizations of the
same content (Oliver & Curran, 2004).

29

2.2.2 Variations Projects
Variations projects are long-term digital library projects, which provide online access to find
sound recordings and music scores, led by William and Gayle Cook Music Library on the
Bloomington Campus of Indiana University. Variations projects have three stages of project
history: Variations, Variations2, and Variations3. The Variations projects adopt FRBR as a
major data model from Variations2. This literature mainly discusses the Variation2 and 3 of
which the data model is FRBR. The modified FRBR framework (Figure 2.8) and Variation
Example (Figure 2.9) show selected entities that especially represent and fit well to music
collections Â± Work (title, composer), Expression which replaced by Instantiation (performer,
conductor, and instrument), Container replacing Manifestation (Type of media, Date, Publisher,
Genre, etc.), and Media Object as Item (single music file) (Dunn et al., 2006; Hemmasi, 2002;
Minibayeva & Dunn, 2002; Notess & Dunn, 2004; Riley et al., 2007; Scherle & Byrd, 2004).

The data flow chart in Figure 2.10 shows a sample representation of the FRBR model
applied to the Variation 3 project (Riley et al., 2007). The chart represents different levels of
persons (composer and pianist) involved in work and expression, and their works and
expressions are embedded into manifestation and item levels. Manifestation and item contain all
of the musicÂ¶V work and bibliographical records.
Although each entity contains information relating to the music, it is still difficult to find
the relationships between works (if there are parallel level or similar works), or person and
corporate body. Moreover, a single manifestation that contains multiple expressions has common
information between those expressions that explicitly defines important relationships. It is
understood that the problem resides in the old catalog system, which did not separate the
expression information in MARC, causing incorrect relationship information between performer
and expression.

Paris Symphony Â± Symphonies Nos. 82-87), it should show the relationships between works.
Currently, FRBR does not support the relationships in this way; it lacks the related information
necessary for users. Similar to work, expression information should also describe the
relationships between expression entities if they occur under a specific time or space, like a
concert.

2.3

Music Information Retrieval

2.3.1 Metadata Based Music Information Retrieval
Music Information Retrieval (MIR) is an interdisciplinary research area that has grown out of the
need to manage burgeoning collections of music in digital form (Futrelle & Downie,
2002). Bosma et al. (2006) assert that music information retrieval is the co-work between
musicology and computer science to retrieve musical objects. Information professionals, such as
music librarians and library scholars, make many efforts to work in the music information
retrieval field as well.
Based on the characteristics of music resources, there are two major music information
retrieval areas: 1) content-based music information retrieval and 2) metadata-based music
information retrieval. Content-based MIR systems are mainly concerned about music pattern
similarities. Content-based MIR has many advantages for music experts as they have better
knowledge on patterns of music tone, melody, pitch, etc. (Casey et al., 2008). However, it is
relatively less helpful to non-expert users while seeking for music resource, due to WKHXVHUVÂ¶ lack
of knowledge of musical contents. When users search by rhythm or keys, they have to know the
exact rhythm or keys. Most novice users usually only vaguely remember the melody of music.
Therefore, they cannot represent the music with the exact rhythm or keys. Although MIR
research relies heavily on content-based retrieval methods, there are efforts by librarians to
combine content search and traditional metadata search that can provide improved access to
music for their patrons (Riley & Mayer, 2006). Metadata for music resources consists of various
performers, recorded dates, played instruments of each media format in addition to basic
information of title, composer, composed date, etc.

33

2.3.2 Music Information Retrieval on the Web
Lee and DownieÂ¶VVXUYH\ (2004) shows that metadata has an important experience enrichment
aspect for users. In their survey, the top three methods in searching are title, lyrics, and artist
information. This study shows that music information seekers prefer to search with metadata
rather than other information such as genre, review, or background information. Similarly, some
studies assert that most music seekers would rather search information based on metadata
descriptions than other possible approaches (Cunningham, Jones, & Jones, 2004; Downie &
Cunningham, 2002; Isaacson, 2002). Other studies reveal that users often request bibliographic
information of music including title, performer, date, orchestration (instrument), genre, etc.
(Bainbridge, Cunningham, & Downie, 2003; J. H. Lee, 2010). However, it is often hard for
novices to search for music information with low-level musical knowledge. Orio (2006) reveals
that the utilization of appropriate metadata is notably useful to retrieve relevant information only
if users know the information. Non-experts are faced with a problem when performing metadatabased searches, as a pre-assumption of metadata-based search is that users already know part of
music metadata information before searching. With this point of view, Kim and Belkin (2002)
determine the limitations of metadata-based music information retrieval, which is that novice
users sometimes do not know or use musical terms. Chen and Butz (2009) also examine nonexpert users that have a high level of difficulty in expressing their musical preferences in a
formal way, and often change their minds during the search process.
One option for novice music searchers is to seek advice from others on the Web. In the
current Web environment, non-expert users are able to find recommendations, annotations, tags,
or Question & Answer sets from other users in order to obtain new information of music. In the
Web-EDVHGPXVLFFROOHFWLRQXVHUVÂ¶FRQWULEXWLRQVZKLFKHQULFKWKHDQQRWDWLRQVDQG tags, help its
34

collection and description of collection as well as through collaborations. Previous studies
explain the importance of Web communication among users in searching for music information.
Some studies analyze the social Question & Answer sites such as Google Answers and Yahoo!
$QVZHUVDQGIRXQGWKDWXVHUVÂ¶LQWHUHVWVDQGQHHGVRIPXVLF resources, especially bibliographic
information (Bainbridge et al., 2003; Cunningham & Laing, 2009; J. H. Lee, 2010). According to
Chen and Butz (2009), digital technology changes the way of organizing, browsing and
searching for music. Since many novice users find advice from their surroundings and Webbased community, it would be beneficial to have social recommendation, annotation and a tag
feature, which would allow users to find ideas about music information from the system.
Interaction within social communities gives users the ability to enrich their music search
experiences. Furthermore, it is expected that QRYLFH XVHUVÂ¶ SUREOHP RI VHOHFWLQJ SURSHU TXHU\
terms will be somewhat solved by providing other users tags, annotations and recommendations.
Previous studies also suggest that music information collaboration systems should integrate
searching and browsing seamlessly and offer functionalities such as query recommendation,
which go beyond explicit search, in order to allow users to find unexpected but acceptable results
(Bentley, Metcalf, & Harboe, 2006; Chen & Butz, 2009; Cunningham, Reeves, & Britland,
2003).

Summary

Previous studies found a number of music information needs on the Web, and a large portion of
needs are related to bibliographic record of music to find certain music. %DVHG RQ WKH XVHUVÂ¶
information need of music, FRBR can play a significant role to represent music information, and
provide search and browsing option to retrieve music information.
Previous research presents FRBR-based music information in the library catalog, and
conducts user experiments based on the user task that the FRBR draft suggests. The results of
user experiments demonstrate that FRBR can provide its users with a better way to find
bibliographic information. Although users can successfully identify FRBR entities and
relationships, there have been gaps in whether or not users can find and identify attribute
information of the entities and detailed relationships between entities.
Most user studies have been conducted in a library environment; this lacks user
evaluation on the Web, where people may want to find information about musical work,
expression, and manifestation entities. This study will examine the performance and perception
of users using FRBR-based music searching and browsing as compared to Web-based keyword
search. In addition, the FRBR-based system in this study suggests additional attributes,
relationships, and higher levels of work and expression entities which will enrich describing
music information.

PHASE 1: Finding the Appropriate Attributes and Relationships of FRBR Entities
for Classical Music

3.1

Introduction

When the FRBR model is applied to music records in a catalog, it is expected to be able to
describe the relationship between work, expression and manifestation. With the relationship
information, users may enhance their chance of learning musical information, including the
background of music. Each entity has its own particular attributes and can supply more efficient
information with these attributes. Also, in Group 2, the attributes contain person and corporate
ERG\Â¶VIHDWXUH, which are related to work, expression, and manifestation. Therefore, it is possible
to make connections between work/expression/manifestation and person/corporate body by
applying a relationship description. However, in this study, the target entities are only work and
expression in Group 1, and person and corporate body entities in Group 2. Manifestation and
item entities in Group 1 are disregarded because the focus of the study is how users are aware of
background information (like work, expression and person) in cataloging records, and how
influential they consider these new entities to be in bibliographical records in the new cataloging
model.

37

Based on the setting of the survey, the research question is identified under RQ 1.
RQ 1.1: What are the important features (attributes and relationship between entities)
of FRBR to represent classical music?
RQ 1.1 is a sub question of RQ 1, and the remaining question (RQ 1.2) will be answered
in Phase 3.

3.2

Finding Important Attributes and Relationships in Music FRBR

3.2.1 Selection of Attributes of an Entity and Relationships
The FRBR final draft (IFLA Study Group on the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic
Records & International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions. Section on
Cataloguing. Standing Committee, 1998) suggests different types of attributes by entities, and
has many relationship descriptions between entities. Additional attributes were also adopted,
such as place of work, place of expression, and biography of person, based on the suggestion by
the consultation with four music school students from Carnegie Mellon University and the
University of Pittsburgh and the Variations project (Riley, 2008). While the music students
discussed FRBR, they examined and referred to the FRBR final draft, Variations project, and the
report from Library of Congress (Delsey, 2002). After consultation, some attributes of each
entity that the FRBR final draft suggested were rejected because they do not match with musical
resources, for example, coordinates (cartographic work) of work, scale (cartographic
image/object) of expression, etc.
In work entity, the attributes selected for musical work are: title of work, form of work,
date of work, other distinguishing, intended audience, context for work, medium of performance,
38

numeric designation, and key. Moreover, CMFRBR model includes some additional attributes,
such as place of work (i.e. composition place), nature (history/background) of work, purpose (i.e.
dedication) of work, language, identifier, genre, duration, and music era (music style), but at the
same time it does not include some attributes proposed in the FRBR final draft, such as intended
termination, coordinates (cartographic work), and equinox (cartographic work).
Expression entity has attributes related to classical music, such as: the title, form, date,
and language of expression, other distinguishing, the extensibility, revisability, summarization of
content, critical response and use restrictions of expression, and medium of performance.
Additional attributes that are similar to work are place of performance, key, and duration of
expression. Unnecessary attributes for expression of classical music were excluded, such as,
extent of the expression, sequencing pattern (serial), expected regularity of issue (serial),
expected frequency of issue (serial), type of score (musical notation). Since this study mainly
focuses on classical music works, the performances of a work and their sound recordings in
manifestation, type of score in expression was not considered as an attribute in expression.
However, it will be included when the future study embraces other media formats such as book
and music score in manifestation.
Group 2 (person and corporate body) was considered separately when examining
attributes, because attributes can be applied with a different strategy to person and organization.
For person entity, name, dates of person, title of person, and other designations associated with
the person are the original attributes, and roles are applied in relationship part. Moreover, place
of person (i.e., place of birth/death) and biography are considered as additional attributes. In the
case of corporate body entity, name, number, place, date, other designations associated with
body, and address are adopted attributes with an additional attribute, biography. APPENDIX A

39

provides the full lists of the attributes and relationships between the entities of the CMFRBR
model.

3.2.2 Survey Design
A survey was designed to evaluate the importance of attributes and relationships in the music
catalog. The entry-survey asked for SDUWLFLSDQWVÂ¶ thoughts about and experiences with music
cataloging systems in terms of music information seeking, including their search skill, frequency
of music catalog searching, music search skill, the satisfactory level of catalog searching, etc.
In the main survey, participants rated the importance of the attributes of the musical
work, expression, person and corporate body using the 5-point Likert scale (1-Strongly Disagree,
5-Strongly Agree). The survey questionnaire simply asked the importance of attributes, for
example, Â³Do you agree that ÂµTitle of WorkÂ¶ (a word, phrase, or group of characters naming the
work. e.g. Wiegenlied, D. 498) attribute in Work Entity for music FRBR is important?Â´
In addition, the relationship descriptions between work/expression and person (or
corporate body) were evaluated in the same method of attributes. Four relationship descriptions
have been selected to examine the importance of relationships between works.
x

Parent work: representative work title of sibling works, e.g., -RVHSK +D\GQÂ¶V
Symphony Nos. 82-87 have a parent called Paris Symphonies

x

Sibling work: parallel level works from the parent work(s), e.g., Symphony Nos. 8287 share a sibling relationship from Paris Symphonies by Joseph Haydn

x

Similar work: the works which have similar or same title, e.g., Symphony No. 1 by
various composers

x

Successor: sequel relationship between works, e.g., Part 1 and 2
40

In the relationships in expression, participants were asked how important it is to find a
relationship in:
x

Sibling expression: different expressions from the same work

x

Parent expression: whole concert information, if applicable

x

Related expression: different expressions under parent expression

When the participants decided on the importance of relationships in work and expression,
they were also asked to rank their priority among the relationships. This rank was used for
finding higher priority when two or more relationships were rated with the same score.
In terms of the relationship between work/expression and person/corporate body, the
participants were asked to value the importance of the SHUVRQÂ¶V RU FRUSRUDWH ERG\  role(s) to
describe the relationships with musical work/expression.
Different from the parent-child relationship, the part/whole relationship between musical
work and expression was also asked to be rated. For example, a single part of a musical work can
be performed in different expressions. APPENDIX B provides the entire survey questionnaires
used in this study.

3.2.3 Participants
A short survey was designed to find the importance of attributes, entities, and relationships of
music FRBR. Fifteen participants were recruited from the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie
Mellon University, and were asked how music attributes and relationships are important to
represent music information for cataloging purposes. One third (N=5) of participants are music
professionals, including music school students, music experts, and music librarians. Five
participants were information professionals who work or study in Library and Information
41

Science or Information Science. The rest of the participants were non-professional university
students and classical music fans (N=5). Prior to the survey, each participant learned the concept
of the FRBR model in a 30-minute introductory session. During this session, the extra attributes
that were added for each entity were explained and were presented separately from the original
attributes. The participants were asked to rate both the original and additional attributes because
the survey results were expected to help decide whether certain attributes should be kept or
dropped for the future study. After the training session, the participants answered the
questionnaires using a Web-based survey application.

Survey Results

3.3.1 3DUWLFLSDQWVÂ¶%DFNJURXQGDQG0XVLF6HDUFK([SHULHQFH
In the pre-survey, I asked WKHSDUWLFLSDQWVÂ¶ thoughts about a music cataloging system in terms of
music information-seeking. Among 15 participants:
Eleven participants (73.3%) rated themselves to have good or excellent skills in searching
for music. Eight participants (53.3%) responded to search with music catalog once or more than
a month and three participants (20%) mentioned never having searched music resources in the
library cataloging system. The satisfaction rate of the current library music catalog system was
very low; only two participants (13.3%) were satisfied with library search results, whereas 33.3%
(N=5) of participants were dissatisfied. Five of them felt neutral about the cataloging system.
Five participants who were not satisfied with cataloging system specified the reasons why
they have difficulties with finding music information:

42

1. Difficulty with the search function (N=3, 60%)
2. Difficulty finding similar items (N=4, 80%)
3. Difficulty identifying the item I intend to find (N=3, 60%)
4. Difficulty finding appropriate media format (N=4, 80%)
Moreover, some notable comments about their reason of dissatisfaction were addressed
by participants, such as, Â³List all related items of each search term,Â´ Â³finding background of
music,Â´ Â³showing duplicate records, indicating all available media formats, searching by
ensemble,Â´DQGÂ³more various tagged words (tagging system improvement)Â´
Eight participants (53.3%) answered that they have at least heard about the idea of FRBR,
and half of them (N=4) rated their knowledge level of FRBR as good or excellent. These four
participants have a library and information science background. Neither music experts nor music
students answered that their knowledge of FRBR was good.

3.3.2 Rating the Importance of Attributes
In the main survey, the participants were asked to rate the importance of attributes of each entity
to describe musical information for the cataloging system.
Participants rated the importance of attributes of the musical work, expression, person
and corporate body using the 5-point Likert scale (1-Strongly Disagree, 5-Strongly Agree). In
addition, relationship descriptions between work/expression and person (or corporate body) were
rated in same method. The top four most important attributes in representing the music
information of work in FRBR were title (M = 4.67), medium of performance (M = 4.13), form
(M = 4.00), and context (M = 3.87) of work. Moreover, participants rated 3.8 on average for
date, genre, and piece style. On the other hand, nature of work, purpose of work, place of work,

43

and duration of work were rated less important attributes. In terms of the relationship of work,
they agreed that the relationship between work and person (creator of work) was important (M =
4.47). Table 3.1 shows the average rating of the attribute in Work entity.

In Corporate Body, name (M = 4.6), biography (M = 3.93), and place (M = 3.87) were
rated top 3 among the attributes. The interesting point is that they rated place of corporate body
as 3.87 on average, but gave only 3.0 on average to address. By this, I assume that when
comparing the value of weight between address and place, the place attribute provides enough

3.3.3 Relationship Representation
In terms of relationships, the participants were asked how important the relationships of musical
works are with four different relationships: has sibling work; has similar work; has successor;
and has parent work. The relationship Â³has parent workÂ´ was rated 4.33 on average and was
UDQNHGWRS7KHUHODWLRQVKLSÂ³KDVVLEOLQJZRUNÂ´stood at second with 3.93 rating on average. The
UHODWLRQVKLS Â³KDV VLPLODU ZRUNÂ´ DQG Â³KDV VXFFHVVRUÂ´ UHFHLYHd the ratings 3.87 and 3.67,
respectively.
In the relationships in expression, participants were asked how important it is to find a
relationship in parent expression, sibling expression, and related expression. Both sibling
expression and parent expression were rated 4.0 on average, but when ranked by high priority,
sibling expression was ranked the highest (nine out of 15 participants ranked it the highest

47

among the relationships). Thus, it can be inferred that users were more interested in finding the
performance information of the same musical work. Related expression was rated 3.67, and
placed the last among the relationship description of expression.
In terms of usefulness of the relationships representation in work and expression (e.g.,
related expressions of the same concert or sibling expressions of the same work), users highly
agreed (M = 4.27) that they find useful music information from the relationship representation.
Moreover, participants answered that FRBR can help users understand music information and
relationship easier than the old cataloging system (M = 4.33).
The role(s) of relationships between musical work/expression and person/corporate body
were also examined. Examples of the roles of relationships are as follows: Beethoven's role in
Sonata No. 1 is composer, and the role of Yo-Yo Ma in Beethoven's Sonata No. 1 is performer.
The participants strongly agreed (M = 4.6) that FRBR representation would help music searchers
find the roles of relationships between person and musical work/expression.
Concerning creator(s) of music, participants considered lyricist to be the same as creator.
86.7% of participants (13 out of 15) agreed that lyricist or librettist could be viewed as creator.
Two comments from the participants who did not agree that a lyricist is a creator mentioned,
Â³Sometimes composers adopted famous poem, novel, sentence....Â´DQGÂ³Value of lyricist is lower
than composer in classical music, can be considered as contributor same as performerÂ´
In terms of the part/whole relationship between musical work and expression, 80% of
participants (N=12) answered that the part is still regarded as an expression of a work even if it is
not the whole musical work. Three comments from the participants who did not agree with the
part/whole relationship said, Â³If each movement has different meaning and all combined
movement make new meaning of music, each movement can be considered as different musicÂ´;

48

Â³Partially agree: if the music work consist of several movements/part. If one or more parts of
whole music work played in the performance, it is part of music, but still considered as the music
workÂ´; DQGÂ³Piece of workÃ users may want to listen specific movement onlyÂ´7KHVHFRPPHQWV
are valuable opinions to consider; however, the majority decision that a partial performance of a
musical work can be considered one expression from the same musical work in FRBR-based
classical music information should be generally accepted.

3.4

Findings

This study identified the important attributes of each entity of FRBR for library cataloging
purposes DQG KRZ XVHUVÂ¶ XQGHUVWDQGing would be enhanced by representing the relationships
model. It was found that within the attributes in work and expression, participants considered
title, medium of performance, date, and role of person/corporate body as important attributes and
relationships in both entities.
In terms of relationship representation, it was found that people would like to see useful
relationship information, such as the parent/sibling of work, the sibling expression from a work,
and the person-creation-work relationship. In addition, the role relationship that linked entities in
Group 2 to entities in Group 1 was identified to be useful in describing the bibliographic
information of classical music.
As previous studies found (Hardesty et al., 2012; J. H. Lee, 2010; Salaba & Zhang,
2012), there is a similarity in using FRBR attributes or relationships in order to find music
LQIRUPDWLRQ $OVR WKH UHVXOWV LQGLFDWH WKDW SDUWLFLSDQWVÂ¶ PXsic information seeking about the

music, instrument, etc.
In addition, this study found that the participants rated additional attributes higher than
the original ones from the FRBR draft. For example, genre and music era (piece style) were
ranked highly among the Work entity. Similarly, place of expression, biography of person and
corporate body were highly ranked. Therefore, it would be useful to employ new attributes in
FRBR entities for music information retrieval. In addition, it was suggested that the history or
background of work are useful to describe a musical work entity.
The results of this survey imply that attributes of each entity can enrich descriptions of
musical bibliographic information, and these attributes help users find improved music
information.

3.5

Discussion

This study addressed the RQ 1.1 Â³What are the important features (attributes and relationship
between entities) of FRBR to represent classical music?Â´. The survey results indicated which
attributes were important for delivering music information to users. In cataloging, a number of
necessary attributes should be filled out to enrich bibliographic information of classical music in
each entity. Moreover, relationship information (like roles of creator or performer between
work/expression and person/corporate body, and sibling and parent relationship in work and
H[SUHVVLRQ  QHHGHG WR EH FOHDUO\ VWDWHG LQ RUGHU WR HQKDQFH XVHUÂ¶V XQGHUVWDQGLQJ RI WKH PXVLF
information.

50

Therefore, based on the results of the survey, this study propose a new term, CMFRBR, which
refers to the Classical Music bibliographical records representation based on the FRBR model.
This model was used for the final experiment, which examined the usability of FRBR-based
classical music search system in Chapter 5.
In order to represent more enriched music information from the FRBR final draft (1998),
this study decided to include additional attributes such as place of work, summarization, genre,
music period, duration, place (both in work and person), etc., for each entity. The main
difference between CMFRBR and the FRBR final draft is that CMFRBR is a specialized model
to describe classical music bibliographic records, whereas FRBR is a general model to describe
bibliographic records. Therefore, CMFRBR contains more precise information of classical music
work, expression, and person/corporate body by employing additional attributes and
relationships.
CMFRBR adopted various relationships from the FRBR final draft and additional
relationships, such as parent work (work of work) and parent expression (expression of
expression). As the FRBR final draft mentions, the usage of aggregates were similar to a parentchild concept, work-set or super work (Hickey et al., 2002; Tarango, 2008). The definition of a
parent is specified as a uniform title of a set of works or expressions. It not only contains a title,
but includes attributes which cover the general information of a set of works or expressions, such
as background/history, summary, and date. For example, the date of a parent work covers an
entire period of a work set composition, and the history provides a general background of the
entire collection of works. Musical works rarely have more than one parent. For instance, Il
cimento dell'armonia e dell'inventione N. 1-4 by Antonio Vivaldi, popularly known as the Four
Seasons, is made up of four concertos, so it is a parent of the four concertos. Moreover, these

51

four concertos are the first four works of Il cimento dell'armonia e dell'inventione, Op. 8 which is
a set of 12 concertos. Therefore, these four concertos have two parent works.
Similar to the parent work, the parent expression consists of several attributes such as
date, place, and summary. In terms of the realization relationship, the contributors in a parent
expression include the person and corporate body of each expression in an entire event which
various musicians perform in different expressions of an event.
A parent entity is necessary because it is possible for a user to find related works or
expressions from a parent by the creation of new relationships between children works or
expressions. Aside from the parent-child relationship in expression, it is possible to draw another
relationship between a work and its expressions, called sibling expressions. This helps music
seekers find all realizations of a musical work, and each expression can indicate other
expressions of the same work realized by the same or different musicians.
Another important relationship adopted by CMFRBR is the role of the person and
corporate body for the entities in Group 1, which draws the connections how the person (or
corporate body) contributed to work and expression entities. Figure 3.1 presents the relationship
descriptions among the entities and role types of group 2 for group 1 entities. As seen in
APPENDIX A, person or corporate body fill various roles in work and expression, and this
relationship provides users with a clear understanding of how person or corporate body was
involved in creating work and performing the musical work.

PHASE 2: Analyzing Use of FRBR with Finding Classical Music Information from
Social Q&A Sites

4.1

Finding FRBR Attributes and Relationships in Yahoo! Answers

From the consultations with music experts and the results of finding important attributes and
relationships for classical music in Phase 1 (Chapter 3), it was found that the CMFRBR model is
not only appropriate for the new cataloging rule, but can also be applied to Web-based
information providers by providing entity, attributes, and relationship. Therefore, in order to find
the feasibility of the CMFRBR model for Web-based music information retrieval, Yahoo!
Answers, a social Question & Answer site, was examined. From the consultation with music
experts, such as music students and scholars, it was found that they already know what they want
to seek and how to find music information. However, the JHQHUDOSXEOLFÂ¶VLQIRUPDWLRQDSSURDFK
would be different from that of experts. Therefore, the results of a previous study in Chapter 3 to
find the appropriate attributes and relationships of CMFRBR entities for classical music in the
cataloging was compared with real questions from the general publicÂ¶V LQIRUPDWLRQ QHHGs in
classical music. To achieve these goals, the following research questions were identified under
RQ 2: Can FRBR-based classical music representation provide better help for users to find
music?

Yahoo! Answers was selected as a source of a dataset because it is one of the most representative
social reference sites in the world. The questions were selected from the category Â³FODVVLFDO
music,Â´WKHVXE-sub-FDWHJRU\RIÂ³(QWHUWDLQPHQW 0XVLFÂ´'XHWRWKHKLJKYROXPHRITXHVWLRQV
in this category, some adequate query terms such as Beethoven, performance, recording, and so
forth were used to selectively collect questions from Yahoo! Answers. The total number of
returned questions is 500, which were asked from May 2007 to June 2013. Among the returned
question set, almost 350 questions were fitted to classical music information. The rest of the
questions were filtered out, as they were not directly related to classical music, including
questions such as Â³+RZGR,VHOOUHFRUGLQJVRI3XEOLF'RPDLQPXVLF"Â´RUÂ³:KDWÂ¶VWKHEHVWZD\

Coding Process

Various categories of codes were created with ATLAS.ti, a qualitative research software. For the
coding process, two types of main codes (code family), Entity and Relationship, were defined.
Since the scope of this study is to find the proper attributes of each entity of the FRBR model
matching with social reference questions, attributes and relationship descriptions related to
classical music were employed as sub codes. Moreover, additional sub codes were assigned to
include additional attributes and relationships that were proposed in Phase 1. Therefore, the
categories were organized with main codes, which were classified by types of entities and other
categories that do not belong to the sub codes. Below is the list of main and sub codes defined
for the coding.

Generally, a word or phrase was assigned with a single code. However, as shown in the
example, more than two codes can be co-assigned in one question or the same code can be
repeated in a question. The highest number of individual codes that occurred or co-occurred in a
question was seven.

A general pattern of XVHUVÂ¶ TXHVWLRQV DERXW classical music in Yahoo! Answers was
regarding how to find sound recordings of specific music by certain musicians. During the
coding process, the relationship between the entities and attributes was also identified. One third
of the quotations were coded as relationships because most questions contain two or more
entities or attributes connected by the relationship description. Therefore, the relationship codes
played important roles as the linkage between entities and attributes.
The frequency of code occurrence showed that the most occurring sub codes (attributes)
in each code family were title of work (N=49), person (corporate body) realization in
relationship (N=75), name of person (N=47) and name of corporate body (N=11), access address
(remote access electronic resource) of manifestation (N=46), and medium of performance of
expression (N=25).
The most occurred codes in the Work entity were title (n=49), purpose/nature (n=11),
piece style (n=9), other distinguishing (n=8), and medium (N=8). It is no surprise that Yahoo!
Answers users mention the work title in their question, as previous studies have shown similar
results (Bainbridge et al., 2003; Lee, 2010). Interestingly, some questioners asked about the
background or history of the composition of the musical work.
In Expression, the most frequently addressed attributes were medium of performance
(N=25), date (N=20), title (N=10), place (N=8), and duration (N=8). It seems that some classical
music fans seek out information about specific events, including where and when an event was
held7KHTXHVWLRQÂ³where can i find the New York philharmonic North Korea concert online"Â´LV
a good example of one looking for a certain performance in a particular place. One of the
interesting facts observed is that people sometimes mentioned or asked about the date, including

59

the year, of a performance. Mostly, these questions were redirected to ask how they can find the
recordings of the performance held in a certain time and place.
Access address (remote access electronic resource) (N=46), form of carrier (N=21), title
(N=12), and publisher/distributor (N=8) were the top four frequently mentioned attributes in the
manifestation code family. Due to the characteristics of Web-based social references, many
questions contained the links or addresses of particular sound recordings. Moreover, many
people seemed to care about the physical (or electronic) form of carrier (e.g. CD or mp3m video
clip). Some previous studies also reported that people seek certain types of musical sound
recordings that they prefer (J. H. Lee & Downie, 2004; Salaba & Zhang, 2012). A question from
WKHGDWDVHWÂ³Okay. So I saw this video of Pavarotti singing ÂµIngemiscoÂ¶ on Youtube Â«Anyway,
is there a CD recording of this performance? I REALLY want to find it, but all I can find is a
DVD recording!Â´DOVRVKRZV a XVHUÂ¶VQHHG for a specific type of containers of expression. These
types of questions have been coded with both Form of Carrier and Relationship: Alternative
Format.
In terms of relationship, Expression-Person/CB (N=75), Work-Creation-Person (N=42),
Expression-Sibling (N=40), Realization (N=24), and Embodiment (N=22) were identified to be
the most-used relationships from the question set. In Yahoo! Answers, people asked many
questions about the best performance of a specific musical work. The common patterns of
questions about the sibling expression relationship of a specific music from Yahoo! Answers are
Â³Which collection of Beethoven's Symphony Performances is best?... Which would you
recommend?Â´ 7KHVH NLQGV RI TXHVWLRQV ZHUH FRGHG DV VLEOLQJ H[SUHVVLRQ $OWKRXJK

information can provide only the expression information of a musical work.

60

Compared to the library catalogs, not all attributes from the FRBR model were coded.
For example, more than 50% of attributes, such as series statement manifestation and revisability
of expression, were never asked in the question sets. The total number of codes that appeared at
least once in questions was 44. Table 4.3 presents the frequency of sub codes occurred by code
families.

During the analyzing process, codes were mostly used and analyzed with co-occurrence
among attribute and relationship or attribute and attribute. A total of 392 codes co-occurred in
the dataset. The most frequently co-occurring codes were work title and relationship of work
creation (N=22) and WKH UHODWLRQVKLS EHWZHHQ SHUVRQVÂ¶ QDPH DQG WKHLU SHUIRUPDQFH 1  .
Sixteen co-occurred codes were about work composer and musical work creation. Moreover, 16
questions were asked about the relationship Embodiment & Relationship: Expression-Person/CB
that describes a particular performance is contained by a sound recording. Based on the top
ranked co-occurring codes, questioners commonly mentioned the PXVLFLDQVÂ¶ QDPHs and music
titles when they asked about the works, and then maybe seek for the performance information
and sound recordings of the performance. Moreover, by this observation, it can be inferred that
public users usually start their music seeking with a piece of musical information such as

Among the codes, the ones that co-occurred the most with other codes were Relationship:
Expression-Person/CB (N=128), Relationship: Work-Creation-Person (N=77), Person: Name
(N=64), and Work: Title (N=62). This implies that the relationship between person/CB and
expression has an important pattern: people are interested in finding out classical music related
person information because people tend to ask questions about who performed which music.
Similar to the relationship between person/CB and expression, a commonly asked question in
Yahoo! Answers was regarding who composed partLFXODU PXVLF RU D FHUWDLQ FRPSRVHUÂ¶V
composition list (Relationship: Work-Creation-Person). In addition, 51 embodiment relationship
codes were assigned with other codes, including Relationship: Expression-Person/CB 16 times.
As previously mentioned, I assume that the purpose of the questions containing expression
information is to find the sound recordings of a specific performance by certain performers.
In terms of attributes SHUVRQÂ¶V QDPH, title of music, work and access address of
manifestation have been coded more than the other attributes. It is assumed that many
questioners mentioned DWOHDVWRQHRUPRUHSHUVRQÂ¶VQDPHRUZRUNWLWOHZLWKRWKHUFRQWHQWZKHQ
asking about classical music. Similar to previous discussion, due to the characteristics of the
Web Q&A services, users asked for the Web address where they can find manifestation or
related information of performances.

generally accompany questions about performer (person or corporate body) and sound
recordings of the performance.
On the other hand, Relationship: Work-Creation-Person appeared with Work: Title
(N=22), Person: Name (N=16), Relationship: Realization (N=6), Relationship: ExpressionSibling (N=6), and Relationship: Expression-Person/CB (N=5). Therefore, it could be deduced

classical music information.

Discussion

In the coding and data analysis processes, it was found that the description of the attributes and
relationship of FRBR can fulfill XVHUVÂ¶ information needs about classical music.
The results of this study have answered the RQ 2.1: Â³:KDW LV WKH JHQHUDO SXEOLFÂ¶V
information need (i.e., entities, attributes, and relationship) of classical music on the Web?Â´
From the analysis of questions in Yahoo! Answers, three major patterns were observed.
First, questioners tend to ask for manifestation information, especially for a website or
URL, where they can obtain a physical or electronic version. In addition, people want to obtain
certain type of media format of sound recordings they prefer. This implies that the general

66

SXEOLFÂ¶V QHHG LQ VRFLDO 4 $ VLWHV regarding classical music is to find and listen to a classical
musical work in particular media formats on the Web.
Secondly, people ask for different performances of famous musical works, which was
coded with a sibling expression relationship. They also ask for information on famous
performers (conductor, instrumentist, and singer) and detailed information about performances
like place, date, or other expression information. This indicates that general users are not only
interested in the musical work itself, but they are also eager to listen to different interpretations
of music by various musicians.
Lastly, questions were asked to find title (of expression and work) or person (or corporate
body). By providing links to other resources such as YouTube, people tend to ask for the title of
the music in the video clipWKHSHUIRUPHUÂ¶s name, or how they can find other performances by
the performer.
For RQ 2.2 Â³What change in FRBR-based classical music representation should be made
to help general public on the Web find classical music information"Â´, it is found that not all of
WKHDWWULEXWHVWKDWDSSHDULQWKHOLEUDU\Â¶VFDWDORJLQJVHWWLQJDUHXVHGLQ:HE-based social Q&A
sites. For examples, some attributes such as statement of responsibility, fabricator/manufacturer,
and source for acquisition/access authorization in manifestation are only used for the library
catalog system, and these attributes and features were never asked by questioners in the Webbased Q&A site. Although only 33 attributes and 11 relationships were coded in this study, these
codes provide sufficient evidence about which attributes and relationship information is
important for general users to seek for classical music information.
I analyzed the chosen answers of the questions from Yahoo! Answers to examine
whether those answers included the attributes or relationship descriptions of FRBR model.

67

Except for the subjective opinions in the answers, around 110 out of 350 answers provided
bibliographic information of classical music that FRBR representation also can provide. Even
though this analysis was not entirely performed on correct answers, it is clear that FRBR-based
FODVVLFDO PXVLF UHSUHVHQWDWLRQ FDQ FRQWULEXWH SXEOLF XVHUVÂ¶ information needs about classical
music. %DVHG RQ WKH XVHUVÂ¶ TXHVWLRQing and answering behaviors in Yahoo! Answers, it
demonstrated that FRBR can play a significant role in identifying entities and attributes of
information from questions in social Q&A sites. The FRBR model provides a proper framework
to represent classical music information, including the background or historical information with
several attributes in work, performance information in expression, access address, form of carrier
in manifestation, and alternative format in relationship that people ask for.
The XVHUVÂ¶questions in this study include at least a piece of metadata related to classical
music, which means that general users know a piece of information when they search for music.
This fact indicates that users perform Known-Item search. It presumes that users may know
some information about the music, but it is difficult to interpret how high their knowledge level
of music is. With this perspective, especially for novice users, FRBR can make a contribution
toward finding related musical work information because the FRBR provides well-organized
attributes and relationship information. The relationship descriptions between entities (for
example, work-person or person-expression) will be important features for users to find music
information which they did not expect. The FRBR model can support these richer, unexpected
browsing functions through relationship descriptions that allow users to search and explore the
music information and relationships from work or person level to other entities or vice versa.

PHASE 3: Comparative Study of Two Classical Music Information Systems

This chapter introduces the experimental systems, plain text-based classical music representation
and FRBR (Entity Relationship model) based classical music representation, and the designs of
the experiment that compare them. The first section introduces the FRBR-based classical music
search system and its data sets. The second section provides detailed information about the
experimental design and describes the plain text based classical music system. The last section
VXPPDUL]HVWKHH[SHULPHQWÂ¶VVWXG\YDULDEOHV
This study introduces two terms related to FRBR-based classical music representation
and its information retrieval system. First, CMFRBR (Classical Music representation based on
the FRBR model) refers to the Classical Music bibliographical records representation based on
the FRBR model. The other term, FIRM, is used to refer to the CMFRBR-based Information
Retrieval system of classical Music.

5.1

FIRM System Design and Data

5.1.1 FIRM System Design
This study used Ontopia (http://www.ontopia.net/) to develop a CMFBRB-based classical music
search system, called FIRM. Ontopia is an open source suite of tools for building applications
based on Topic Maps, formally ISO 13250 (http://www.isotopicmaps.org/), a standard for the
69

representation and interchange of knowledge, with an emphasis on the findability of information
(Ontopia home page). Ontopia provides features such as an ontology designer, a data editing
tool, query language function, Web service access points, database storage, and a visualized
display of search results. Moreover, it is suitable to represent the CMFRBR because its features
include presenting relationships, entities, and attributes.

Figure 5.1: Screenshot of Work Information in FIRM

Figure 5.1 illustrates a screenshot of the work of %HHWKRYHQÂ¶V6\PSKRQ\1R7KHOHIW
panel of the display (Area 1) represents the relationships between a work and other entities.
These entities include expression (i.e. realization of work), manifestation (i.e. contribution),
person (i.e. composer/librettist), or corporate body. The panel on the right side (Area 2) provides
the information about the musical work, generally called attributes. Each page represents all

70

information about an entity and relationships among a work, an expression, a manifestation, and
person and/or corporate body.
CMFRBR implementation in Ontopia (FIRM) comprises seven types of entity pages
including work, expression, manifestation, person, corporate body, work of work, and expression
of expression.

Each entity page contains different relationship descriptions and attributes

information according to the character of the entity. For example, in person page, predefined
SHUVRQÂ¶V UROHV ZHUH FRPSRVHU OLEUHWWLVW FRQGXFWRU VSRQVRU SHUIRUPer, and etc. It also has a
relationship with other entities, such as composition of work, author of libretto, performance of
expression, affiliation with corporate body, family with person, and so forth.
The collection of the FIRM covered 1,050 musical works, 240 expressions, 75
manifestations, 345 persons, 74 corporate bodies, 15 expressions of expression, and 22 works of
work pages.

5.1.2 Data Collection for FIRM
5.1.2.1

Resources of Work and Person/Corporate Body Information

The collection has been built on Ontopia with attributes and relationship information. As the
current FRBR-based catalog systems does not contain enough attributes in each entity, I have
collected metadata of classical musical work, person, and corporate body from various resources
including ClassicalArchives (http://www.classicalarchives.com), Classical Net (http://www.
classical.net/), International Music Score Library Project (http://imslp.org/wiki/Main_Page),
Library of Congress Subject Authority Headings (http://authorities.loc.gov/), Naxos Classical
Music (http://www.naxos.com/), Oxford Music Online (http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/),
and Wikipedia (http://www.wikipedia.org/). Aggregated data was converted into CMFRBR
71

attribute suitable data. All of the work titles and personal names used in this system were
borrowed from the Library of Congress Subject Authority Headings (http://authorities.loc.gov/).
5.1.2.2

Selection of Musical Work and Composers

The music collection is intended to include the most popular classical musical works that were
selected based on how frequently they were mentioned in the following resources:
x

100 Greatest Classical Music Works (www.digitaldreamdoor.com/pages/best-classicwks.html)

x

The 50 Greatest Pieces of Classical Music (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_50_
Greatest_Pieces_of_Classical_Music)

x

The Classic FM Hall of Fame (http://www.classicfm.com/hall-of-fame/)

x

Classical Music Top 150 (http://www.classiccat.net/toplist.php)

Since many musical works are repeated in the most popular music lists, only around 150
musical works were initially selected WREHLQFOXGHGLQ),50Â¶VGDWDVHW. As the collection of 150
works is too small to build a classical music system, more than 900 musical works were added in
accordance with the rank of composers. The list of top 100 greatest composers was selected from
diverse resources, for example,
x

classical-music-online.net (http://classical-music-online.net/stat/?type=top_persons&
person_ type =composer),

x

classical-music.com

(http://www.classical-music.com/great-composers)

by BBC

Music Magazine,
x

classical music composers frequently mentioned on the Web by Google
(https://www.google.com/search?q=classical+music+composers), and

72

x

classicalcat (http://www. classiccat.net/)

A selection of composers was made in order to narrow down the number of composers,
because this study cannot include all classical music composers from the Medieval period to
Modern time. Therefore, the number of composers was limited to 60 of the top 100 ranked
composers (some of the top composers were excluded due to the copyright law) which, when
added to composers already in the collection, brought the total number of composers to 75 with
1,050 different works. Table 5.1 shows the distribution of a number of works per composer.

The number of musical works for each composer was not deliberately assigned. However,
more highly ranked composers have more music included in the collection and lower ranked
ones have less music included. Well-known composers, like Beethoven, Bach, and Mozart, have
higher chances of being searched for by users seeking for information about the composers
themselves and their musical works; as previous studies have discussed, people may search with
FRPSRVHUVÂ¶QDPHVLQRUGHUWRILQGWKHLUPXVLF(Kim & Belkin, 2002; J. H. Lee & Downie, 2004;
J. H. Lee, Downie, & Cunningham, 2005). Therefore, it is natural to consider that the system
should include a higher number of musical works for popular composers.

73

Note that the rest of the musical works from classicalcat.net were also found within
Google search results in the second results page of the composerÂ¶s composition list. The names
used in the two search results sometimes refer to individual works (e.g. Violin Partita No. 2 in
classcialcat.net) and sometimes refer to work sets (e.g. Sonatas and Partitas for solo violin in
Google) to which the individual work belongs.
5.1.2.3

Resource of Expression and Manifestation Information

The expression and manifestation information has been collected from the Library of Congress
Online Catalog (http://catalog.loc.gov/) and WorldCat of OCLC (Online Computer Library
Center, http://www.worldcat.org/). Although I endeavored to collect as many attribute records as
possible, the small size of &0)5%5Â¶V data collection that was manually generated was due to a
lack of music metadata fitting the &0)5%5Â¶V attributes. Metadata based on the attribute
descriptions was inserted and filled out for more than 80% of the attributes in Work,
Manifestation, Person, and Corporate Body entities. However, as a previous study points out
(O'Neill, 2002), because catalog records do not contain enough expression information, only a
few basic attributes (i.e. title of expression, date and place of expression) have usually been filled
out. Even finding the title of an expression was problematic because there is little information on
expression in the music catalog. Therefore, the title of the expression from the contents list in the
505 field of the catalog was adopted. If the title of expression could not be identified, the record
was not created. Furthermore, if the 100, 511, 650, and 7XX fields of MARC records provide the
SDUWLFLSDQWVÂ¶QDPHs of certain performances (i.e., conductor and performer with an instrument),
the realization of a relationship between expression and person (or corporate body) could be
established.

Comparative Study Design

5.2.1 Research Questions
The purpose of the study is to examine the usability of FIRM (CMFRBR-based Information
Retrieval system of Classical Music) to investigate the user experience while users locate their
neeGHG LQIRUPDWLRQ XVLQJ ),50Â¶V HQWLW\ UHODWLRQVKLS UHSUHVHQWDWLRQ. It is compared to their
experience using IMSLP (International Music Score Library Project), which is a Web-based
plain text display system comparable to CMFRBR except not being based on an EntityRelationship model. IMSLP is further described in the following sub-section.
The research questions for this study are described below:
1. RQ 1.2: 'RXVHUVH[SHULHQFH),50Â¶VDWWULEXWHVDQGUHODWLRQVKLSVDPRQJHQWLWLHVDVD
useful and positive aid in satisfying their information needs? Moreover, does FIRM
give users a better user experience when compared to IMSLP?
2. RQ 2.3: Can the attributes and the relationships of the CMFRBR representation in
FIRM provide the user with a superior objective and subjective experience when
searching for classical music information compared to IMSLP?
3. RQ 2.4: Which internal factors (independent variables: language, music knowledge,
and search skills) influence WKHXVHUVÂ¶VHDUFKSHUIRUPDQFHDQGVXEMHFWLYHH[SHULHQFH"
These (RQs 1.2, 2.3, and 2.4) are the sub-questions of the main research questions (RQs 1
and 2), and the remaining sub-questions (RQs 1.1, 2.1, and 2.2) contributed to the formulation of
the main research questions in Phase 1 and 2.

76

5.2.2 Baseline System
The selected baseline system of this study is the plain text-based classical music representation
system provided by the International Music Score Library Project (IMSLP), also known as the
Petrucci Music Library (http://www.imslp.org), an open online library project for storing
scanned music scores, music media files, and work information mainly for classical music. The
SURMHFWÂ¶V PDLQ JRDO LV WR collect every public domain classical music score and create an open
music database. IMSLP provides access for its users to classical music scores from both the
public domain and from composers who are willing to share their music without charge. Audio
recordings are also available on the site (Mortensen, 2014; Mullin, 2010).
5.2.2.1

Difference between IMSLP and FIRM

IMSLP provides general information about classical music (Figure 5.3). FIRM separates the
pages based on the representation of the &0)5%5PRGHOZKHUHDV,06/3Â¶VPXVLFal work page
includes work, performance, recording, and music score together; only the person page
(composer or librettist) is separated from the work page.
IMSLP provides relationships such as work and person (composition, libretto, and
performance), related works, and parent and sibling work; however, not all relationships of
parent and sibling information have been established. Related pages of the work are connected
via hyperlinks, and some links direct to external websites such as Wikipedia or other websites
that provide information on the musical work. IMSLP provides only minimal information of
H[SUHVVLRQ DQG PDQLIHVWDWLRQ VXFK DV SHUIRUPHUÂ¶V QDPH, published (uploaded) date of
recordings, and a few pages include detailed information like date of performance, medium of
performance, place of performance, etc.

77

Figure 5.3 Performance, Recordings, and General Information in IMSLP Page

A concern about IMSLP is that the display of the work page contains various pieces of
information which necessitates its users to scroll up and down. In addition, the relationship
description is not well organized and intuitive to explore (Encelle et al. 2009; Mullin, 2010).
However, compared to other music information search systems such as Wikipedia, Naxos Music
Library, or Classical Music Net, users can find better organized and FRBR-like structured

78

information of expressions and manifestations in IMSLP. Thus, IMSLP is the classical music
search system that is most compatible to FIRM.
5.2.2.2

Similarity between IMSLP and FIRM

IMSLP provides organized metadata records of musical works, person information and location
of manifestations. In the works page, the metadata fields in IMSLP are similar to FIRMÂ¶V
attributes of Work entity. There are many similar attributes in work; however, FIRM is based on
WKH &0)5%5Â¶V HQWLW\-UHODWLRQVKLS PRGHO ZKHUHDV ,06/3Â¶V VWUXFWXUH LV a plain text based
description without the explicit relationship information available in FIRM. In general, the
information available RQ ,06/3 LV FRPSDUDEOH WR &0)5%5Â¶V H[FHSW IRU WKH (QWLW\Relationships present in CMFRB. Therefore, IMSLP was selected as a comparative system since
it is one of the best FRBR-like classical music search methods on the Web. Table 5.2 shows a
mapping of information between IMSLP and FIRM.

Selection of IMSLP Dataset

Because FIRM includes only 1,050 works and 345 persons and IMSLP includes more than
88,009 works, 12,199 composers, and 320 performers (as of Jan. 2015), it is fair to select a
portion of IMSLP resources to have a collection of similar size for the purpose of comparison
between two systems. This study did not include some musical works composed in the 20th
century due to the copyright issues in IMSLP, where the musical works must be in the public
domain in either Canada or the US. In order to keep same musical works listed in IMSLP and
FIRM, the works that IMSLP could not list were excluded from FIRM as well. Thus, about 1,200
IMSLP cached pages of musical works and composers have been downloaded, which match the
work and person pages in FIRM.
In order to create a similar environment with IMSLP, I saved all downloaded IMSLP
pages on a database system and requested that Google index them so the search results of the
81

5.2.3 Task Sets
5.2.3.1

Procedure of Collecting Questions

As was found in Phase 2 (Chapter 5), many public users asked questions concerning classical
music in Yahoo! Answers, a social Q&A site. Questions used for the task sets were collected
from real questions in Yahoo! Answers. Questions in <DKRR$QVZHUÂ¶V Classical Music category
that pertained to the bibliographic information of classical music were first selected, since such
information is suitable to be applied to attributes and relationships in the CMFRBR model. This
study did not include questions requesting opinions or subjective open-ended questions related to
classical music in Yahoo! Answers. This was due to the following: (1) the major concern of this
study was to examine how users find bibliographic information of classical music from music
information resources. (2) Open-ended and subjective questions usually do not have fixed
answers (Jahnke, 2010, p. 48). Involving these questions would have complicated the analysis.
This study acknowledges that the reported results may not be able to be generalized to opiniontype question sets, which require more complicated experimental settings.
In addition, all the questions about the classical musical works which are copyrighted in
US or Canada were excluded, as IMSLP does not allow publishing pages for copyrighted
classical musical works. Therefore, this study accepted questions in Yahoo! Answers that only
address musical works which are published in IMSLP and duplicated in FIRM.

Similar to previous studies (Pisanski & Zumer, 2010a; Salaba & Zhang, 2012) that
examined user tasks suggested by the FRBR final draft (IFLA, 1998), this experiment also
adopts the criteria of user tasks from FRBR in the question sets: find, identify, select, and obtain
the information of work, expression, and manifestation. Since the FRBR draft does not contain

84

user tasks on the person entity, this study adopts the user tasks of person from the Functional
Requirements for Authority Data (FRAD) to bridge the gap (Patton & IFLA Working Group,
2009). Table 5.5 shows examples of the sub-tasks of each entity and relationships.

5.2.4 Experiment Procedures
To understand how &0)5%5Â¶V representation in FIRM efficiently works for searching and
browsing compared to IMSLP, I performed a lab-based user study which consisted of a survey, a
live experiment and a structured interview. In the laboratory-based experiments, participants
were requested to search for specific music information about a particular composer and
extended their search to the expression and manifestation level in both FIRM and the baseline
system, IMSLP. The experiment was set up as a comparative study in order to evaluate the
usability of both the FIRM and IMSLP search. International Organization for Standardization
(ISO) (1998) defined usability as the "extent to which a product can be used by specified users to
achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a specified context of
use". Figure 5.5 shows the structure of the experiment. This study is approved by the University
of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board (IRB) (IRB#: PRO12040138).

86

levels: page, information, and answers. In the training session, the participants learned the
definition of page, information, and answers. This study defined finding a page DV D XVHUÂ¶V
finding relevant pages within the search results display. After selecting the relevant pages for
each question, the participants were requested to find relevant information on the selected page.
Then, the user finally determined the answers to questions from the relevant information.
After the training sessions, each participant was asked to conduct three sets of search
tasks in IMSLP and FIRM for 15 minutes each. Each participant performed six search tasks,
using FIRM on three tasks and the other three with the baseline system (IMSLP). Each task
consisted of five sub-task questions that asked about work, expression, manifestation, person,
and relationship information. The details of task sets were introduced in Chapter 5.2.3. Each
task had a 15-minute limit to complete but participants were allowed to finish the task earlier
than the time allotted: the participant could either go on to the next task or take a break until time
was up. If a participant failed to find an answer in each sub-task in a task set, s/he could abandon
the task with a penalty that added three minutes to the actual experiment time, within which the
participant had to complete the given tasks for each sub-task (which never happened during the
experiment). A task consisted of five sub-tasks, which the participants were allowed to complete
in any order.
The experiment rotated the task sequence in order to avoid possible bias caused by
learning and fatigue. The Graeco-Latin square design was used to rotate the sequence of the
search systems and the tasks (Kelly, 2009).
Table 5.6 provides the sequence of the tasks of each subject. Each row was performed by
two subjects. The list was passed through twice in order with the first participant being S1, and
the thirteenth participant also being an S1 subject.

At the end of each task, the study used a post-task survey questionnaire to inquire about
SDUWLFLSDQWVÂ¶ pre-knowledge of the music, ease of search, and satisfaction level of finding page,
information, and answers. After finishing the three tasks in each system, participants were also
requested to complete the post-system survey which asked for their overall satisfaction level with
finding music information and the relationships among the entities of the system.
After the entire experiment (meaning that a user finished all six tasks) each participant
took a post-experiment survey, reporting his or her preferred music search method and opinions
of how well the CMFRBR representation in FIRM handled the attributes and the relationships of
classical music information. The participants also completed a short structured interview about
his or her experience of music search in both FIRM and IMSLP. The interview intended to
89

obtain individual opinions about using FIRM, which could not be gathered from the experiment
alone. During the interview, the participants were asked about advantages and disadvantages,
overall satisfaction and any additional comments to improve CMFRBR and FIRM. APPENDIX
D, APPENDIX E, APPENDIX F, and APPENDIX G provide the entire lists of questionnaires of
the survey and interview.
The study used screen and voice recording software, Camtasia and oCam, to capture

found the answers using screen recordings, which included how many times they searched with

included the total time spent on each task and the correct rate of their answers. The participants
were asked to freely express their impression or thoughts during their search process. Their
unstructured speech helped this study understand what users were thinking while searching and
browsing for music information, and allowed the observer WRFDWFKWKHXVHUVÂ¶SHUVSHFWLYH toward
their classical music information retrieval process. This technique was marginally beneficial to

5.3.2 Subjective/Objective Variables
This study adopts both subjective measurements and objective measurements for a more
comprehensive understanding of classical music seekersÂ¶ search behavior and perception on both
FIRM and IMSLP.
Subjective measurements refer to WKH SDUWLFLSDQWVÂ¶ SHUFHSWLRQV RU DWWLWXGHV WRZDUG WKHLU
search experiences. The experiment gathered pDUWLFLSDQWVÂ¶survey and interview responses in four
categories for subjective measures: 1) Ease of completing a search (in finding pages, information
and answers) in a task; 2) Self-assessment level of satisfaction (in obtaining information and
answers) in a task; 3) Overall ease of finding music information of entities and relationships in
each system; and 4) PartLFLSDQWVÂ¶SUHIHUHQFHIRUDVHDUFKSODWIRUP

logs: 1) Percentage of task completion; 2) Time spent on each task; 3) Number of queries the
participants issued to answer a question in the task; 4) Number of pages viewed in each task; 5)

93

Percentage of correct answers per task. Table 5.8 in the next section summarizes the subjective
and objective measures with usability characteristics.

5.3.3 Usability Characteristics Measurements
HornbÃ¦k (2006) identifies commonly-used measures of usability studies. He analyzes usability
research based on the three characteristics of usability defined by the International Organization
for Standardization (1998): effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction. This study adopted the
identified measures that fit the user experiment and survey results into these three pre-defined
categories. Thus, two dimensions of analyses, Objective/Subjective measurements under
usability measures and Effectiveness/Efficiency/Satisfaction measurements under usability
characteristics, are used respectively.
According to International Organization for Standardization (1998), effectiveness is
Â³accuracy and completeness with which users achieve specified goals.Â´ Efficiency is defined as
Â³resources expended in relation to the accuracy and completeness with which users achieve goalsÂ´
and satisfaction is Â³freedom from discomfort, and positive attitudes towards the use of the
product.Â´ Table 5.8 VKRZV+RUQE NÂ¶VXVDELOLW\FKDUDFWHULVWLFVand measurements that match the

5.3.4 Summary of Study Variables
In the study, 24 participants were recruited to search and browse bibliographic records of
classical music on FIRM and IMSLP in order to determine whether they were efficient, effective,
and satisfactory systems for music information seekers. The experiment consisted of a
background survey, training sessions, search tasks, post-task survey, post-system survey, postexperiment survey, and short interview. This study had two search systems, FIRM and IMSLP; it
was designed to examine how users search for and explore classical music information in different
entities, attributes, and relationship views. For each search task, the participant was required to

find five answers related to classical music in 15 minutes. The analysis of data was mainly

included various independent variables and constructs in the analyses. Several covariates
including music knowledge, language in which classical music was first learned, and music
search skills were collected from the background survey at the beginning of the experiment. The

of finding certain variables (page, information, and answer). The other subjective variable,
satisfaction level of their performance of finding information and answers, was also defined with
a 5-point Likert scale (very dissatisfied = 1; very satisfied = 5). In overall ease-of-use of finding
entity (work, expression, manifestation, person/corporate body) and relationship information,
participants rated using a 5-point Likert scale (very difficult = 1; very easy = 5) as well. The
preferred music search interface had two values which represents their preferred system to find
entity information (IMSLP = 0; FIRM = 1).
For the independent variables, music search skill and classical music knowledge, were
defined with 5-point Likert scale (very poor =1; very good =5). The language first learned
classical music separated out those participants who learned classical music in English and those
who first learned classical music in a different language. Those participants who did not first
learn classical music in English were asked if they were familiar with classical music terms in
English on a Yes/No basis.

5.3.5 Participant Group Information
5.3.5.1

Target Participant Group

The final target user group for the experiment was the general public who is interested in
classical music but does not have professional knowledge of it.
All participants were recruited by requesting information on their background in the
music domains; specifically, music school students or music professionals were excluded from
being participants in this study as their domain knowledge may reduce their efforts for finding
certain music information. These individuals may not need to search for information, but can
simply recall the answers from their memory, particularly when they already know the required
music information.
The assessment of the SDUWLFLSDQWVÂ¶ NQRZOHGJH OHYHO UHOLHV RQ WKHLU own subjective
judgment because it is difficult to define the line between music experts and non-experts. For
example, if a participant had studied at a music school, but had not worked in the music domain
for several years, it is difficult to claim that the participant still has professional music skill or
knowledge. Yet participants who do not have professional training experience may assert
professional knowledge if they have been interested in music for a long time. Previous studies
defined novice music listeners as musicians with limited training and non-professional
knowledge, where experts are advanced degree holders in music or teaching experience, both of
which indicate a difference in the dimensions used to make judgments of stylistic similarity
(Gromko, 1993; Miletto et al.,2011). Based on this criterion, this study defines the novice as a
person who does not have any advanced education in the music domain.

98

The requirement of the participants is that they have music search experience. It is not
necessary to have knowledge of the FRBR model. All participants had to be 19 years old or
older.
The participants were recruited from the general public in Pittsburgh, PA, USA. Twenty
four participants took part in the experiment over the course of two different experimental
sessions in order to evaluate and compare FIRM and IMSLP-based music information search
from September, 2014 to November, 2014. Participants were paid at the rate of $10 per hour and
the average duration of the experiment was one hour and thirty minutes.

The participants consisted of 2 librarians, 8 undergraduate students, 10 graduate students,
and 3 other professionals. Among the students, their majors included anthropology, biology,
computer engineering, economics, information science, pharmacy, physical therapy, political
science, psychology, public affairs, rehabilitation, and social works. This study excluded music
school students since the main purpose is to investigate the usability of different classical music
bibliographic records search systems for the general public who may not have a professional
music background.

100

Twelve participants (50%) first learned classical music in English. Among the remaining
(N=12) who did not first learn classical music in English, languages included Chinese, Japanese,
Korean and Taiwanese, six of whom answered that they were not familiar with basic classical
music terms, such as movements, key, and opus number.
Two (8.3%) out of the 24 participants rated their prior knowledge of classical music as
very poor; seven (29.2%) rated their knowledge as poor; and 13 participants (54.2%) rated their
knowledge as fair. The rest (N=2, 8.3%) rated their knowledge of classical music as good.
In terms of music search skills, five participants (20.8%) rated their music search skill as
poor, and seven (29.2%) participants evaluated themselves as fair. The rest of the participants
(N=12, 50%) considered their search skills for musical resources to be good or better. In this
study, due to the small number of participants, I categorized the music knowledge group and
music search group as two broad groups, which are the lower level group and the higher level
group in the in-depth analysis.
The majority of the participants (N=20, 83.3%) never searched for music in a library
catalog system. Only one participant regularly searches for music information in a library
catalog.
Among the participants, 95.8% (N=23) responded that they started their music search
with Google, and 15 (62.5%) selected YouTube. Two participants (8.3%) responded that their
starting point for searching for classical music was a library catalog system. Five answered they
start search for classical music in ProgArchives, Spotify, and Wikipedia.
Four participants (17.4%) had known about FRBR prior to the experiment. Of these four,
two participants estimated their knowledge about the FRBR model to be good, since their

101

occupation was librarian. Based on their ratings, the other participants of this study did not have
prior knowledge about FRBR.

overall perception between two systems as well. This study did not measure the percentage of
task completion as only one out of 144 tasks was not completed within the given time. It is
important to note that this study compared the differences between an implemented FRBR-based
classical music search system, FIRM, and a FRBR-like music search system (IMSLP). The study
results do not claim that FIRM, based CMFRBR, have been compared with non-FRBR classical
music search system.
5.4.1.1

Analyses of Objective Measurements

The user performance log analyses include time spent, number of queries issued, number
of pages viewed, and the success rate of finding correct answers.
Table 5.11 shows the results of the Mann-Whitney tests of the objective measurements.
102

A Mann-Whitney test suggested that XVHUVÂ¶VHDUFKSHUIRUPDQFHLQ FIRM (N = 72, UF =
62.11, M = 4m48s, Mdn = 4m05s) had significantly better outcomes than IMSLP (N = 72, UI =
82.89, M = 5m56s, Mdn = 5m32s) in terms of time spent, p = .003, r = .25, which indicated that
the participant spent significantly less time to complete their search tasks in FIRM than IMSLP.
The experiment assigned one point as the rate of correct answers for each task (0.2 points
for each sub-task), and compared the success rates between the systems. A Mann-Whitney test
indicated that the success rate of correct answer in FIRM (UF = 76.44, M = .989 points, Mdn = 1)
was significantly higher than IMSLP (UI = 68.56, M = .967 points, Mdn = 1), p = .027, r = .18,
thus, it inferred that users may be more successful when using FIRM in order to obtain classical
music information.
Because of the systemÂ¶V workflow, the minimum required number of page views in
IMSLP is two, including work page and person page, whereas FIRM requires four pages which
are work, expression, manifestation, and person/corporate body pages; therefore, the number of
pages viewed is set equal to the number viewed minus the minimums defined above. The mean
difference between IMSLP (UI = 85.99, M = 3.64, Mdn = 3) and FIRM (UF = 59.01, M = 1.81,
Mdn = 2) is 1.83, which indicated that the participants viewed more IMSLP pages to find
answers and information than those of FIRM (p < .001, r = .33). Meanwhile, a Mann-Whitney
test indicated that there is no significant difference of the number of search queries between
FIRM (UF = 71.23, M = 1.44, Mdn = 1) and IMSLP (UI = 73.77, M = 1.53, Mdn = 1), p = .637, r

the ease-of-use and satisfaction level analyses of user perception.
First, participants described how easily they found relevant pages about classical music
from the search result display. A Mann-Whitney test indicated that participants believed finding
104

relevant pages was significantly easier in FIRM (UF = 79.24, M = 4.17, Mdn = 4) than IMSLP
(UI = 65.76, M = 3.81, Mdn = 4), p = .041, r = .17. Similarly, the mean ranks of the ease-of-use
in finding relevant information in IMSLP was 62.25 (M = 3.43, Mdn = 4) and that of FIRM was
82.75 (M = 3.99, Mdn = 4). A Mann-Whitney test shows that the ease-of-use level of FIRM in
finding relevant information is significantly higher than IMSLP search, p = .002, r = .26.

In summary, the participants indicated that FIRM was easier to use for finding music
information and they were more satisfied with FIRM than with IMSLP. This implies that
searching for classical music in FIRM provides the participants with a better search experiences
than IMSLP.

Analyses of Overall Subjective Measurements

Overall Ratings of Entity Information Search
After finishing three tasks in each system, a post system survey was conducted to question
participants (N=24) about the overall ease-of-use level of using each system to find classical
information on work, expression (or performance), manifestation (or sound recording),
person/corporate body and relationships. A Wilcoxon signed rank test was run to determine if
there were differences in finding musical resources between FIRM and IMSLP. Table 5.13

and relationship description on each system.

106

A Wilcoxon signed rank test indicated that the median ease-of-use level ranks in work in
FIRM (W+ = 123.00, Mdn = 4) is significantly higher than IMSLP (W- = 13.00, Mdn = 3), p =
.003. The same was true with the work task, a Wilcoxon signed rank test found that finding
expression information in FIRM (W+ = 63.00, Mdn = 4.00) was significantly easier than in
IMSLP (W- = 3.00, Mdn = 3.5), p = .006. In the search for manifestation information, FIRM (W+
= 93.00, Mdn = 4.00) also received a significantly higher rating than the ease-of-use for IMSLP
(W- = 12.00, Mdn = 3.5), p = .10. Moreover, the sum of ranks of the ease-of-use in finding person
are 74.50 (FIRM: Mdn = 4.00) and 3.50 (IMSLP: Mdn = 3.5), respectively. A Wilcoxon signed
rank test indicated that finding person in FIRM is significantly easier than IMSLP, p = .005. In
the relationship description, a Wilcoxon signed rank test revealed that participants experienced
higher satisfaction in FIRM (W+ = 132.50, Mdn = 4.00) than IMSLP (W- = 3.50, Mdn = 3.5), p
=.001.
Similar to the subjective perception of ease-of-use in the post-WDVNVXUYH\SDUWLFLSDQWVÂ¶
responses on FIRM received higher ratings than IMSLP in finding entity information and
relationship descriptions that infers CMFRBR representation in FIRM provides better and easier
description of classical music information than IMSLP.

An exit survey was conducted after participants completed all search tasks in both
systems. Participants rated the level of agreement on how well FIRM provided organized
information to help people understand musical resources and relationships among music entities.
A combined 54.2% (N=13) of participants strongly agreed and 45.8% (N=11) agreed that FIRM
can provide better-organized music information than IMSLP. In addition, most participants
(N=23, 95.8%) agreed or strongly agreed that the relationship representation of FIRM will help
music finders understand the relationships between work, expression, manifestation, and
person/corporate body.
System Preference
Participants were requested to choose between FIRM and IMSLP for their preferred system for
locating information on musical work, expression, manifestation, person/corporate body, and
their interrelationships. Table 5.14 provides the results of the system preferences between FIRM
and IMSLP.

selected by three participants (12.5%). Same as with the other entities, their main concern with
finding manifestation information was information organization.

Interview Comments
During the interview, the participants were requested to comment on the advantages and the
disadvantages of using FIRM.
Advantages
As found in the previous section, the main advantage of FIRM was that it provided better
organization of information. Several participants also preferred separated entity pages so that
they could find information only related to certain entities.
Â³FRBR organized the information wellÂ´ - S18
Â³Separated pages are an advantage to find information that I needÂ´- S9
Â³I like FRBR because it breaks up the pages so I can find information from the certain
entity pageÂ´-S16
Â³I like the FRBR better because it tells me what page I'm on. For example, I know that
I'm on the page with sound recording. The only thing coming out of that page is sound
recording. However on the website [IMSL], all the information was on one page which made it a
little bit difficult for me to sort out the information. I like information that is in its own category.
I don't like all the information on one page.Â´ - S23

In addition, relationship descriptions provided a better representation for users about
where they could find related music information. Since FIRM LV EDVHG RQ &0)5%5Â¶V HQWLW\

work pages they need. For example, participants first click the expression or work of work page

Summary
To sum up, the participants spent less time finding answers and had higher success finding
correct answers in FIRM. Participants gave higher scores to FIRM than to IMSLP in terms of
ease-of-use of finding music and satisfaction level of their search process. Moreover, they
preferred to use FIRM over IMSLP when they looked for classical music information by the
entities and relationship description.

organized music information and clear relationship descriptions to its users. Although users had
to click more pages to find entity information, they preferred separate pages which contained

113

only information about one entity per page. FIRM, however, was considered to be a difficult
system for first-time users; they needed more time to learn the system environment. The
terminologies used in FIRM were not easy to understand for the users. It was necessary to
change and update to easier terms on the end user side (e.g. Numeric Designation to Opus
number or music catalog number).

FRBR User Task

This study examined the FRBR User Task, ZKLFK ,)/$Â¶V )5%5 VWXG\ JURXS VXJJHVWHG ,
measured the number of correct answers of each task which consisted of five questions asking
for bibliographic information of classical music as mentioned in Chapter 5.3.1. Among 24
participants, 20 participants (83.3%) got a SHUIHFWVFRUHLQWKHWDVNRI&0)5%5Â¶V),50DQG
participants (62.5%) reached the same score in IMSLP.
As seen in Table 5.15, the total number of questions regarding work entity in each system
was 132 (11*12). While participants perfectly found, identified and selected all correct answers
in FIRM, they found five wrong answers in IMSLP. In IMSLP, four participants failed to find
WKHEDFNJURXQGRIPXVLFDOZRUNZKLFKLQGLFDWHGWKHVHFRQGFRPSRVHUÂ¶VQDPH in Task 5. These
outcomes also impacted the consequences of finding relationship between composer and work: if
they failed to answer the first part of questions, they failed the rest of the question. Therefore, the
four failed tasks in background of work and the four failed tasks in Work Â± Person relationship
are for the same question, but were separate FRBR user tasks. The other failed question in Work
Â± Person relationship was that a participant failed to locate WKH SHUVRQ RI WKH Â³Work-PersonÂ´
relationship, which also caused the FRBR user task of identifying the attribute of date of birth in
the person entity in IMSLP to fail. For the sibling works, 91.7% (11/12) of the answers were
correct in each system. Parents-Child relationship had 95.8% (23/24) correct answers.

In expression, a total of 84 questions for each system were asked to find correct answers.
One participant failed in finding the time of performance (97.2%) in FIRM, and two users did
not find answers of the time (97.2%) and instruments (97.9%) in IMSLP.
Manifestation has same number of questions with expression (N = 84) and participants
successfully identify the form of carrier and obtain the access address in both systems. For the
115

published time and place, two participants did not find the publication date in FIRM (94.4%)
while three participants did not find them in IMSLP (91.7%).
Participants successfully found most answers to identify the person information in both
systems. The only wrong answer in IMSLP was the date of birth attribute as motioned in the
Work Â± Person relationship above.

5.4.2 Factor Analyses based on the Independent Variables
This section demonstrates WKHUHVXOWVRIDQDO\VHVRISDUWLFLSDQWVÂ¶LQWHUQDOIDFWRUVDuring the preexperiment survey, the participants answered their knowledge of classical music, the language
first learned classical music, music search skill, occupation, music search frequency in library
catalog and the knowledge of FRBR. The experiment survey was designed to analyze various
internal factors because previous studies considered music knowledge, language and search skill
as important variables (Byrd & Crawford, 2002; Duggan & Payne, 2008; Hargittai, 2002). In
addition, some studies reported that education level did not effected on their music search
(Lehtiniemi & Holm, 2011, 2013), and this study examines if there are different results from the
previous studies. I compared the results of WKH),50DQG,06/3Â¶VFODVVLFDOPXVLFVHDUFKV\VWHP
by each factor. The analysis does not include the survey results of music search frequency in
library catalog because majority participants (N = 20) never searched music information in the
library catalog system, and the knowledge of FRBR was too skewed to be analyzed because only
2 out of 24 participants having good knowledge of FRBR.

5.4.2.1

Impact of Language Group

The participants in this study were separated into two language groups, 1) one participant group
first learned classical music in English (N=12) and 2) the other group first learned classical
music in other languages (N=12) including Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Taiwanese. To
understand the impact of the two different language groups on XVHUVÂ¶ SHUIRrmance and
perceptions toward classical music search by their first learned language of classical music, I
performed a Mann-Whitney U test to examine its impact. Table 5.16 presents the outcomes of
Mann-Whitney U test in each system between language groups.

In the analysis of objective measurements, the medians of time spent for the two groups,
who first learned classical music in English, EG, (N = 12 * 3 tasks each = 36 observations) and
Non-English, NEG, (N = 12 * 3 tasks each = 36 observations), were 4m50s (UEG = 30.83) and
6m17s (UNEG = 42.17) in IMSLP, respectively. The distributions in the two groups differed
significantly, p = .022, r = .27. In IMSLP, however, the rest of the performance measurements
showed no significant difference between language groups: number of search queries (p = .737, r
= .04), number of page views (p = .26, r = .13), and rate of correct answers (p = .312, r = .12). In
the case of FIRM, the Mann-Whitney tests did not find any significant differences between the
language groups for any performance measure.
Meanwhile, for the ease-of-use level of finding answers in IMSLP, the medians of the EG
and the NEG were 4.0 and 3.0, respectively. A Mann-Whitney test found that the self-rated easeof-use of finding answers was significantly greater for the EG (N = 36, UEG = 43.13) than the
NEG (N = 36, UNEG = 29.88), p = .005, r = .33.

118

These observations could imply that the Non-English group had difficulties finding
answers to the task set in IMSLP search (longer time spent in search process), which could
explain why their ratings of the ease-of-use of finding answers were lower than the English
group. Meanwhile, the rest of the outcomes did not have significant differences between
language groups, which mean WKDWSDUWLFLSDQWVÂ¶ILUVWOHDUQHGODQJXDJHVRIFODVVLFDOPXVLFGLGQRW
measurably influence their search of classical music information within the same interface,
especially in FIRM.
On the other hand, this study examined if there were differences in the search
performances and userVÂ¶ perceptions between FIRM and IMSLP within the language groups.
Table 5.17 and Table 5.18 present the outcomes of the Mann-Whitney tests of userVÂ¶
performance and perceptions between the systems. In the performance analyses, the NEGÂ¶V
number of pages viewed was significantly lower in FIRM than IMSLP (p = .001, r = .56). In
addition, the NEGÂ¶V WDVN FRPSOHWLRQ WLPH LQ FIRM (N = 36, UF = 29.58, Mdn = 4m3s) is
significantly lower than IMSLP (N = 36, UI = 43.42, Mdn = 6m17s). A Mann-Whitney test
indicated that the NEG spent significantly less time between the systems, p = .005, r = .33. The
EG had a significant difference in page view (p = .026, r = .37) but did not have any significant
difference in time spent between the systems, p = .173, r = .16. The rest of the performance logs
did not show any significant difference between the two systems.

In the measurement of the subjective ratings by users, the (QJOLVK JURXSÂ¶V UDWLQJV LQ
FIRM were significantly higher than IMSLPÂ¶V in terms of ease-of-use of finding answers (p =
.016, r = .28) and the satisfaction of obtaining answers (p = .017, r = .28). The Non-English
JURXSÂ¶VUDWLQJVRQWKHease-of-use of finding music information (p = .003, r = .35), ease-of-use of
finding answers (p < .001, r = .54), satisfaction with obtaining information (p = .024, r = .27),
and satisfaction with obtaining answers (p = .004, r = .34) in FIRM were significantly higher
than those for IMSLP. Based on the Mann-Whitney tests, it is possible to conclude that,
regardless of the first learned language of classical music, participants perceived FIRM as
somewhat easier and more satisfying than IMSLP although their performances in each system
are not significantly different.

The Non-English group, meanwhile, gave higher ratings in all entities and relationship to
FIRM. In work, FIRM received a median of 4 (N = 12, W+ = 36) and IMSLP received a median
of 3 (N = 12, W- = 0). A Wilcoxon signed ranks test revealed a significance of p = .009. In
expression (performance) information, the Non-English group rated FIRM higher (W+ = 26, Mdn
= 4.5) than IMSLP (W- = 2, Mdn = 3). A Wilcoxon signed ranks test found a significant
difference, p = .037. The medians of the SDUWLFLSDQWVÂ¶ SHUFHSWLRQs on manifestation (sound
recording) of FIRM (W+ = 42.5) and IMSLP (W- = 2.5) are 5 and 3, respectively, and a Wilcoxon
signed ranks test indicated a significant difference, p = .016. In addition, FIRM (Mdn = 4.5)
received the sum of ranks of 36, whereas IMSLP (Mdn = 3) had 0 in rankings for finding person
information. The test showed significance, p = .010. Finally, relationship information was also
significantly different with the median of FIRM (W+ = 42.5) being 4 and that of IMSLP (W- = 0)
being 3, p = .017.
To summarize, in terms of performance, there were no significant differences between
language groups except for the time spent and ease-of-use of finding answers in IMSLP. This
implies that FIRM provided an equally usable interface for both language groups. Based on each
JURXSÂ¶V ease-of-use and satisfaction ratings on both systems, it is possible to speculate that the
Non-(QJOLVKJURXSÂ¶Vstrong preference for FIRM is related to their superior performance on that
122

platform, whereas the English group, which rated both systems similarly, had more similar
performance scores on both systems. In overall perception, both groups rated FIRM significantly
higher than IMSLP, which tells that the relationship description in FIRM is experienced as better
than IMSLPÂ¶V regardless of language group.
Non-native group in the Familiarity with Music Terms
In the pre-experiment survey, I asked the Non-English group (N=12) if they were familiar
with English terminology for classical music, e.g., instrumentation, movements, key, music era,
librettist, etc. Six participants (50%) answered they were not familiar with the specific
terminology of classical music, and the rest (N = 6) were acquainted with the musical terms. As
in the analysis of language groups, I utilized the Mann-Whitney U test as the statistical method
to examine the differences between the familiar with English terms (FM) and not familiar with
English terms (NFM) groups in each search system. Table 5.20 presents the Mann-Whiney U
test results between the term familiarity groups. In the performance analysis, the Mann-Whitney
U test found that the success rate between the FM group (N = 18, Ufm = 21.03, M = .989, Mdn =
1) and the NFM group (N = 18, Unfm = 15.97, M = .922, Mdn = 1) was significantly different, p
=.036, r = .48, in IMSLP. Interestingly, as seen in Figure 5.6, except for the ease-of-use of
finding pages in IMSLP, the participants in the NFM group voted higher ratings on ease-of-use
and satisfaction than the FM group in both systems, even though the Mann-Whitney test did not
find significance in ease-of-use and satisfaction in IMSLP. However, the ratings on FIRM are
significantly different between the NFM and FM groups. The NFM group awarded FIRM
significantly higher ratings to the ease-of-use of finding information (p = .031, r = .36), the easeof-use of finding answers (p = .024, r = .38), the satisfaction of obtaining information (p = .032,
r = .36), and obtaining answers (p = .041, r = .34) than those of the IMSLP. From the
123

observation of these results, the NFM group had stronger perceptions of ease-of-use and
satisfaction in FIRM than the FM group, although their performance analyses did not have
significant differences. This implies that the NFM group might consider FIRM to be the easier
system to find classical music information regardless of their search performances.

Figure 5.6 Ratings on the Subjective Ratings by Terminology Farmiliarity Groups

This study examined the difference of perception and performances between the search
systems within the terminology familiarity group. Table 5.21, Table 5.22 and Figure 5.7 present
the results of the measurements.
The FM group did not have significantly different search performances between the
systems except the number of pages viewed. The Mann-Whitney U test found that FM JURXSÂ¶V
additional page views between FIRM (N = 18, UF = 13.75, M = 1.78, Mdn = 2) and IMSLP (N =
18, UI = 23.25, M = 4.83, Mdn = 4) was significantly different, p =.006, r = .46. In addition, the

FIRM than IMSLP, p = .052.
Meanwhile, the NFM group had significant differences in time spent between FIRM (N =
18, UF = 15.03, M = 4m53s, Mdn = 4m05s) and the IMSLP (N = 18, UI = 21.97, M = 6m27s,
Mdn = 6m17s). A Mann-Whitney test indicated they spent significantly less time in FIRM than
IMSLP, p = .048, r = .33. Moreover, the success rates of the participants in the NFM group are
different between FIRM (N = 18, UF = 21.03, M = .989, Mdn = 1) and IMSLP (N = 18, UI =
125

15.97, M = .922, Mdn = 1). Repeated measures with a Mann-Whitney test showed a significant
difference, p = .036, r = .35. The NFM group viewed more additional pages in IMSLP than
FIRM and there is a marginally significant difference between the systems, p = .053. Based on
this observation, it implies that FIRM can help its users who are not familiar with classical music
terminology to find classical information with lower efforts, such as time spent, number of page
clicks, and correct information.

In the perception ratings, the FM group had difficulty only in finding answer in IMSLP
(UI = 12.97, M = 2.78, Mdn = 3) not FIRM (UF = 24.03, M = 3.72, Mdn = 4). A Mann-Whitney
test indicated that there are significant differences of finding answers between the systems, p =
.001, r = .56.
The NFM group had more differences in the ease-of-use and the satisfaction between the
two systems. First, there are significant differences in finding information between FIRM (UF =
22.94, M = 4.33, Mdn = 5) and IMSLP (UI = 14.06, M = 3.39, Mdn = 4), p = .008, r = .44. In

Mann-Whitney test show the significant differences between the system, p = .001, r = .55. In the
satisfaction level of obtaining information, the medians were 4.5 (FIRM: UF = 21.89, M = 4.39)
and 4.0 (IMSLP: UI = 15.11, M = 3.72), respectively. This indicates that there are significant
differences between IMSLP and FIRM, p = .039, r = .34. Similarly, repeated measures in a
Mann-Whitney test showed that the satisfaction with obtaining answers in FIRM (UF = 22.56, M
= 4.33, Mdn = 5) is significantly different from IMSLP (UI = 14.44, M = 3.56, Mdn = 3.5), p =
.015, r = .41. The results imply that the NFM group strongly perceived their use of FIRM to be
easier and they were more satisfied with their search performances.

Figure 5.7 Ratings on the 6\VWHPV by Terminology Farmiliarity Groups

Due to the small sample size (NFM = NNFM = 6), this study did not examine the
SDUWLFLSDQWVÂ¶ GLIIHUHQFH RI RYHUDOO SHUFHption of ease-of-use in finding entity and relationship
between two systems.
5.4.2.2

Impact of Music Knowledge

Previous studies have found that music knowledge impacts uVHUVÂ¶ VHDUFK SHUIRUPDQFH which
drives this study to further examine the impact of user knowledge (Duggan & Payne, 2008;
Laplante, 2010). In the pre-experiment survey, the participants self-evaluated their knowledge of
classical music in a 5-point Likert scale (1= very poor; 5 = very good). As presented in Table
5.10, nine participants (37.5%) rated their music knowledge as poor or very poor, whereas 15
participants (72.5%) answered they had fair or good knowledge of classical music. This study
H[DPLQHG ZKHWKHU WKH SDUWLFLSDQWVÂ¶ NQRZOHGJH RI FODVVLFDO PXVLF DIIHFWHG WKHLU VHDUFK
performances and perspective of the music search systems. Mann-Whitney tests were run to
determine if there were significant differences. Due to the sample size, this study separated into
128

two large groups (Low = very poor and poor; High = fair and good) to measure the differences,
although the values of the responses consist of four levels. No participant ever rated their
knowledge of classical music as very good; therefore, only four of the five Likert scale responses
were used. Table 5.23 presents the results between the knowledge groups. The Mann-Whitney
test found a significant difference in the success rate in IMSLP. The low knowledge group (N =
27, UL = 32.59, M = .941, Mdn = 1) had significantly lower success rate in finding correct
answers than the high knowledge group (N = 45, UH = 32.59, M = .982, Mdn = 1), p = .049, r
= .23. This implies that the higher knowledge group may have had a better sense of how to find
correct answers from IMSLP. The rest of the measurements did not reveal any significance,
which implies that the SDUWLFLSDQWVÂ¶ FODVVLFDO PXVLF NQRZOHGJH did not influence their search
performance and their perception for searching in both systems.

Conversely, this study compared the differences between the systems within the
knowledge group. From the performance logs, the low knowledge group had no significant
performance difference between the two systems, whereas the high knowledge group had a
significant difference in the number of page views and time spent (Table 5.24). The additional
page views of the high knowledge group in FIRM (UF = 36.26, M = 1.76, Mdn = 2) was
significantly less than in IMSLP (UI = 54.74, M = 3.76, Mdn = 3), p = .001, r = .36. In addition,
the Mann-Whitney test found that the high knowledge group spent significantly less time in
FIRM (UF = 38.29, M = 4m25s, Mdn = 4m01s) than IMSLP (UI = 52.71, M = 5m42s, Mdn =
5m00s), p = .009, r = .28. The results imply that the high knowledge group, in terms of time
spent and page views, made less effort to find music information in FIRM, but the success rate
between the systems was not significantly different.

In the subjective responses, the participants in both groups rated FIRM higher on ease-ofuse and satisfaction than IMSLP (Table 5.25).
First, the low knowledge group gave higher scores to FIRM (UF = 32.65, M = 4.11, Mdn
= 4) than IMSLP (UI = 22.35, M = 3.37, Mdn = 4) in finding information, and a Mann-Whitney
test shows that FIRM had a significantly higher rating than IMSLP, p = .012, r = .34. In addition,
on the ease-of-use of finding answers, FIRM (UF = 34.07, M = 4.04) received a median rating of
4, whereas IMSLP (UI = 20.93, M = 2.96) had a median of 3. The participants tended to rate
FIRM significantly higher than IMSLP, p = .002, r = .43. The average ranks of IMSLP (M =
3.59, Mdn = 4) and FIRM (M = 4.30, Mdn = 4) in being satisfied with obtaining information
were 22.06 and 32.94, respectively, and the result of the test was significant, p = .002, r = .36.

This study found that the high knowledge group placed similar ratings in their level of
ease-of-use and satisfaction with the low knowledge group, notably on the ease-of-use of finding
information and answers, and the satisfaction with obtaining answers. The average rank of
finding information in FIRM (N = 45, M = 3.91, Mdn = 4) was 50.62, whereas that of IMSLP (N
= 45, M = 3.47, Mdn = 4) was 40.38. Repeated measures in a Mann-Whitney test indicated a
significant difference, p = .049, r = .21. They also gave higher ranks to FIRM (UF = 55.36, M =
4.13, Mdn = 4) than IMSLP (UI = 35.64, M = 3.36, Mdn = 3) in finding answers. A MannWhitney test revealed a significant difference, p < .000, r = .40. In their satisfaction level of
obtaining answers, FIRM (UF = 51.11, M = 4.09, Mdn = 4) received a significantly higher score
than IMSLP (UI = 39.89, M = 3.67, Mdn = 4), p = .03, r = .23.

Impact of Music Search Skill

Previous studies have found that search skill is an important factor for measuring search
performance (Hargittai, 2002) DQG WKLV VWXG\ H[DPLQHG KRZ PXVLF VHDUFK VNLOO LPSDFWV XVHUVÂ¶
performance and perceptions in FIRM and IMSLP. The participants were asked to rate their
music search skill using a 5-point Likert scale (1= very poor; 5 = very good) during the preexperiment survey. Twelve participants (50%) rated their music search skill as poor or fair, and
the remainder (N=12) of participants answered they were good or very good at searching music
(Table 5.10). There was no participant who rated their music search skill as very poor; therefore,
this study only used 4 values from the Likert scale. This study examined whether the
SDUWLFLSDQWVÂ¶search performance and perception of the music search systems were influenced by
their search skills. Again, Mann-Whitney tests were run to determine if there were significant
differences. Table 5.27 shows the outcomes of the search skill groups based analysis.

134

In IMSLP, there was no significant difference in performance and perception between the
skill groups. However, the high search skill group (UH = 34.54, M = 4m09s, Mdn = 3m49s) spent
less time than the low search skill group (UL = 38.46, M = 5m27s, Mdn = 4m59s) in FIRM. A
Mann-Whitney test indicated there was a significant difference in time spent between the groups,
p = .18, r = .28.

In user perception of FIRM, Mann-Whitney tests found several instances of a significant
difference between groups. The low skill group (UL = 30.19, M = 3.97, Mdn = 4) rated
significantly lower on finding page than the high skill group (UH = 42.81, M = 4.36, Mdn = 5), p
= .006, r = .33$OVRORZVNLOOJURXSÂ¶VUDWLQJ UL = 28.78, M = 3.81, Mdn = 4) on finding answer
was significantly lower than that of the high skill group (UH = 44.22, M = 4.42, Mdn = 5), p =
.001, r = .39. In addition, the rating of the satisfaction in obtaining information was significantly
different between low skill group (UL = 30.76, M = 3.94, Mdn = 4) and high skill group (UH =
42.24, M = 4.28, Mdn = 5), which a Mann-Whitney test indicated as significant, p = .012, r = .30.
In FIRM, the mean rank of the high skill groupsÂ¶ rating in satisfaction of obtaining answer was
43.83 (M = 4.44, Mdn = 5), whereas the low skill groupÂ¶s mean rank was 29.17 (M = 3.89, Mdn
= 4) and repeated measures in a Mann-Whitney test showed a significant difference, p = .001, r
= .38. Based on the observation between the two skill groups, it was found that the high skill
groupÂ¶s performance in time spent and perception was significantly higher than those of the low
skill group in FIRM, where two groups did not have differences in IMSLP. It may be inferred
that FIRM is more helpful when better-skilled music seekers are searching classical music
information.
I conducted another measurement of Mann-Whitney tests in order to examine the
difference between the search systems in each skill group (Table 5.28). In the performance
analyses, the Mann-Whitney test revealed that the high skill group viewed significantly less
additional pages in FIRM (UF = 27.58, M = 1.5, Mdn = 1) than in ISMLP (UI = 45.42, M = 3.47,
Mdn = 3), p < .000, r = .43. Also, the high skill search group spent notably shorter time in FIRM
(UF = 29.35, M = 4m09s, Mdn = 3m49s) than in IMSLP (UI = 43.65, M = 5m42s, Mdn = 5m01s).
A Mann-Whitney test found a significant difference between the systems, p = .004, r = .34.

136

The perceptions toward FIRM were rated higher than toward IMSLP by the high skill
search group. A median of finding information in IMSLP was 4 (UI = 32.4, M = 3.31), and
FIRM received a median of 5 (UF = 40.6, M = 4.17). The test results indicated a significant
difference between systems, p = .002, r = .37. Also, the high skill group had a much higher mean
rank for FIRM, 47.14, (M = 4.42, Mdn = 5) in finding answers than IMSLP, 25.86 (M = 3.14,
Mdn = 3). A Mann-Whitney test revealed a very significant difference, p < .000, r = .53. In terms
of obtaining information, the high skill group rated a median of 5 in FIRM (UF = 42.28, M = 4.28)
where IMSLP (UI = 28.75, M = 3.81) received 4 as a median. Repeated measures in a MannWhitney test showed a significant difference, p = .012, r = .30. The mean rank of FIRM from the
high skill groupÂ¶s satisfaction of obtaining answer was 44.25 (M = 4.44, Mdn = 5) and that of
IMSLP was 28.75 (M = 3.64, Mdn = 4). The test result revealed a significant difference between
FIRM and IMSLP, p = .001, r = .39.

FIRM is 36 (N = 12, Mdn = 4) while that of IMSLP is 0 (N = 12, Mdn = 3). A Wilcoxon signed
test indicated that the low group has a significantly different perception in rating the relationship
description between FIRM and IMSLP, p = .009. In addition, person search in FIRM (W+ = 36,
Mdn = 4) received higher ratings than that of IMSLP (W- = 0, Mdn = 4). A Wilcoxon signed test
indicated a significance, p = .023.
In the case of the high skill group, Wilcoxon tests found significances in their perception
of ease-of-use in finding work, expression, and relationship. A Wilcoxon signed test indicated
that high groups ratings on work in FIRM (N = 12, W+ = 45, Mdn = 5) and IMSLP (N = 12, W+ =
0, Mdn = 3) were significantly different, p = .007. In expression, FIRM received a median of 5
(W+ = 34.5) and the median for IMSLP was 3 (W- = 1.5), and a Wilcoxon signed test revealed a
significance, p = .015. The sum of ranks of relationship information in FIRM (Mdn = 5) and that
of IMSLP (Mdn = 3) were 34 and 1, respectively. A Wilcoxon signed test found a significant
difference, p = .024.
Both groupsÂ¶ perceptions on FIRM were somewhat significantly higher than IMSLP.
Remarkably, the higher search skill groupÂ¶s performance and perception in FIRM are
significantly higher than IMSLP. It seems that the high skill groupsÂ¶ likes and dislikes between
the systems were very clear. The high groupÂ¶s perception in FIRM is greatly higher than the low
skill group, but their ratings are close to each other in IMSLP. It can be inferred that high skill
groupÂ¶s strong preference for FIRM influenced the significant differences between the groups
and systems.

As listed in Table 5.10, four occupation groups (librarians, graduate students, undergraduate
students, and others) participated in the experiment. This study examined whether the participant
groups, especially educational level, affected their search performance and perspective of the
music search systems. The major participants groups were students (19 out of 24) from the
University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University. Due to the limited time and location of
the experiment, this study did not recruit similar number of participants in each occupation group.
Eleven graduate students and eight undergraduate students participated in the experiment. Two
librarians and three other participants were excluded in this analysis since the sample size is too

5.4.3 Summary
This section concludes the results of the comparative study between FIRM and IMSLP. First, in
RYHUDOO PHDVXUHPHQWV SDUWLFLSDQWVÂ¶ SHUIRUPDQFHV RI VHDUFK WDVNV LQ FIRM was significantly
better than IMSLP, especially in time spent and success rate of finding correct answers. Users
144

also perceived it to be easier to find relevant pages, information, and answers in FIRM, and they
were more satisfied with their search performance in finding information and answers in the
FIRM system than with IMSLP. Moreover, participants preferred to use FIRM when they sought
music entities and relationship description of classical music information rather than IMSLP.
Second, in terms of the first-learned language of classical music, this study did not find
significance in either performances or perceptions between the two groups in FIRM, but found
that the two groups had significant differences in the time spent and ease-of-use of finding
answers in IMSLP. This implies that FIRM is a reliable method to find information for both
language groups. The perception ratings on both systems by each group conclude that the Non(QJOLVKJURXSÂ¶VVWURQJSUHIHUHQFHfor FIRM influenced the differences between the systems. The
English group, however, rated a similar score on both systems, so this study did not find
differences between FIRM and IMSLP for them. In overall perception of relationship description,
both groups gave significantly higher scores to FIRM than IMSLP, which indicated that the
participants perceived better relationship description in FIRM than IMSLP, regardless of their
initial music training languages.

the logs of search performances were not very different. It can be concluded that FIRM received
higher ratings than IMSLP UHJDUGOHVV RI SDUWLFLSDQWVÂ¶ NQRZOHGJH RI FODVVLFDO PXVLF but their
knowledge was not an influence when they searched using the same search methods.

Fourth SDUWLFLSDQWVÂ¶ PXVLF VHDUFK VNLOOV somewhat influenced their search performance
and perceptions. Notably, the high search skill JURXSÂ¶VSHUIRUPDQFHDQGSHUFHSWLRQLQFIRM was
significantly higher than in IMSLP. In addition, the high search skill JURXSÂ¶VSHUFHSWLRQLQFIRM
was significantly higher than the low skill groupÂ¶V but the ratings in IMSLP were close to each
other. It is possible to deduce that the high search skill JURXSÂ¶s drastic inclination toward the
FIRM-based search influenced the great differences found between groups and systems.
Finally, WKHSDUWLFLSDQWVÂ¶HGXFDWLRQDOOevel did not impact their search and perception with
in the systems. Undergraduate student group did not have significant different performances or
perception ratings between the systems except their satisfaction with obtaining answers.
However, graduate sWXGHQWVÂ¶ SHUIRUPDQFHV DQG SHUFHSWLRQ ratings were significantly different
between the systems.
Consequently, the first learned language of classical music, music knowledge, and the
level of education did not influence finding music information in the same search system, but
WKRVH JURXSVÂ¶ SHUFHSWLRQV RQ HDFK V\VWHP KDG VRPH VLJQLILFDQW GLIIHUHQFHV However, search
skill somewhat effected the ratings for FIRM-based search, especially the high skill group, which
perceived significantly higher ease-of-use and satisfaction in FIRM than in IMSLP.
Phase 3 made two contributions. First, it examined user experiences and system
performance of music information retrieval using FIRM compared to IMSLP in multiple
dimensions. Next, the entity and relationship model of CMFRBR in FIRM was evaluated on
whether they were helpful to users in finding music information.

6. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

In this chapter, the research questions are answered, and the conclusions of this study are
presented. In addition I identify some important implications of the entire study. The previous
three chapters (Chapters 3 - 5) presented the analytic results in response to each of the two main
research questions and their sub-questions. Section 6.1 aims to conclude the answers for the
research questions and provides a further comprehensive discussion of the results from the
previous three chapters. Then in Section 6.2, the contributions and implications that can be
drawn from the findings of this study are discussed. Limitations of this study are discussed in
Section 6.3. Finally, Section 6.4 presents my conclusions and possible future work.

6.1

Discussion of Research Results

The previous three chapters (Chapter 3-5) presented the analytic results in response to each of
the two main research questions and their sub-questions. In this section, the results of this
dissertation research are discussed to answer the research questions.

6.1.1 Representation of CMFRBR in FIRM
This section focuses on RQ 1: Â³How can classical music information be represented in FRBRbased bibliographic systems?Â´ and its two sub-questions.
147

6.1.1.1

Appropriate Attributes and Relationships for Classical Music in FRBR

The primary attributes of each entity and relationship description of CMFRBR were identified by
UHSUHVHQWLQJ WKH )5%5Â¶V HQWLW\ UHODWLRQVKLS PRGHO LQ RUGer to answer RQ 1.1: Â³What are the
important features (attributes and relationship between entities) of FRBR to represent classical
music?Â´
First, music seekers considered that the title, medium of performance, and the form of
work were the primary attributes in work entity. For expression, it was found that the most
important attributes include title of expression, medium of performance, language of
performance (if applicable), and summarization of content.
Second, for corporate body, participants gave top ratings for name, biography, and place
of corporate body. In person entity, the top rated attributes were name, biography and date of
person (date of birth/death) which are similar to the findings of previous studies (Kim & Belkin,
2002; J. H. Lee & Downie, 2004). This indicates that those attributes are not only important
search methods in FRBR-based music information search, but are also the most popular methods
to represent music information. This calls for the involvement of additional attributes such as
biography, which the CMFRBR model suggested, in addition the FRBR model.
Lastly, in terms of relationships, parent, sibling, and similar work relationships in work
were newly adopted to CMFRBR. For expression, parent, sibling, and related expression were
included. The participants were mostly interested in the parent/children relationship of work (e.g.
Â³6SULQJÂ´DVRQHRIÂ³WKH)RXU6HDVRQVÂ´ DQGWKHVLEOLQJUHODWLRQVKLSRIH[SUHVVLRQ HJGLIIHUHQW
performances of the same musical work). This implies that people would like to know the
collection information, of which a work is a part, when they search for musical work

148

information. They were also interested in finding different performance information (by same or
different performers) of a certain musical work.
To sum up, the most important attributes for music seekers searching for classical music
in FRBR are: title, medium of performance, and form in work entity; title of expression, medium
of performance, language of performance, and summarization of content in expression entity;
name, biography, and place of corporate body; and name, biography and date of person in person
entity. CMFRBR added the following relationships to the FRBR model: parent, sibling, and
similar work in work; and parent, sibling, and related expression in expression entity. The
addition of the new attributes and relationships in FRBR model would contribute in the

related information.
6.1.1.2

FIRM as a Useful and Positive Aid to Music Search

In order to answer RQ 1.2: Â³'R XVHUV H[SHULHQFH ),50Â¶V DWWULEXWHV DQG UHODWLRQVKLSV DPRQJ
entities as a useful and positive aid in satisfying their information needs? Moreover, does FIRM
give users a better user experience when compared to IMSLP?Â´, the usability characteristics
were utilized to measure usefulness and positive point of view of music search methods. When
explicitly DVNLQJXVHUVZKHWKHU),50Â¶VDWWULEXWHVDQGUHODWLRQVKLSVDPRQJHQWLWLHs was a useful
and positive aid in satisfying their information needs and provided a better user experience,
usersÂ¶ responses revealed their positive views in searching for classical music information in
FIRM.

149

Effectiveness
In usability characteristics, the metrics of effectiveness of this study were 1) percentage of
completion, 2) percentage of correct answers, and 3) self-assessment of the outcomes of
interactions. This study did not analyze the percentage of task completion as only one task by
one individual was not completed within the given time.
With respect to the rate of correct answers, the participants had significantly higher
VXFFHVV UDWHLQILQGLQJFRUUHFWDQVZHUVLQ ),50$OWKRXJKWKHGLIIHUHQFHLQWKHXVHUVÂ¶DYHUDJH
success rate between two systems was only .022, this was statistically significant (p = .027). In
self-assessment of the outcome of interactions, users gave higher ratings to FIRM than IMSLP
on the satisfaction of their search performance in finding information, and answers.
In terms of the correct answer rate and self-assessments, FIRM effectively provided the
bibliographic information of classical music for its users, DV XVHUVÂ¶ UHVSRQVHV DQG SHUIRUPDQFH
logs showed better outcomes than with IMSLP, which answers a portion of RQ 1.2.
Efficiency
The measurements of efficiency used in this study included, 1) the number of queries the user
issued in the task, 2) the time spent on each task and 3) the number of additional pages viewed in
the task. All the efficiency measurements are computed IURP WKH SDUWLFLSDQWVÂ¶ VHDUFK
performance in the user experiment. No significant difference was found between systems in the
number of queries issued because most participants issued only one or two queries to find
answers in each task. In the time spent, the participants spent significantly less time using FIRM
to complete their task than IMSLP, even though they had to view more required pages in FIRM
(a minimum of four pages) than IMSLP (a minimum of two pages). In addition, the participants
viewed significantly fewer extra pages in FIRM to complete tasks than IMSLP.
150

This demonstrates that FIRM is an efficient system in that users spent less time and less
effort to find appropriate classical music information as asked by RQ 1.2. It implies that a
CMFRBR-based classical music representation can help music seekers, so that FIRM or similar
systems should be implemented in Web-based search systems to enhance the findability of
classical music information by users.
Satisfaction
User satisfaction was measured from the following three dimensions: 1) ease of completing a
task, 2) overall satisfaction in each system and 3) pDUWLFLSDQWVÂ¶SUHIHUHQFHIRUDVHDUFKSODWIRUP
First, I discovered that users had significantly different perceptions in finding entity
information and relationship between the two systems, and FIRM received higher ratings in the
ease-of-use of finding entity information than IMSLP. User ratings to relationship descriptions of
FIRM were also more highly positive than IMSLP.
Second, the participants were more likely to select FIRM rather than IMSLP when they
sought classical music information in entity search. Their preference for using FIRM in finding
work, manifestation, and person was higher than 80%. Remarkably, all of the participants
preferred to use FIRM to search or browse relationship descriptions among entities.
Lastly, users highly agreed that their satisfaction with the information organization in

FIRM was a positive aid to the classical music search method, as FIRM received more selections
for the classical music search method than IMSLP. These results provide positive answers RQ
1.2 supporting that FIRM provides a better organized description of classical music information
151

and is a more useful method to help music seekers find appropriate bibliographic information of
classical music that they might need.

6.1.2 CMFRBR-based FIRM as a Classical Music Search System
This section discusses RQ 2: Â³Can a FRBR-based classical music representation provide better
help for users to find music?Â´ and its four sub-questions.

relationship information. RQ 2.3 and RQ 2.4 will be addressed in the later section. This study
does not limit the usage of CMFRBR and its representation system, FIRM, to Web-based
systems. As many previous FRBR related studies within the library systems, this study actually
extended the search environment to the Web. It means that the study not only examined the
usefulness of FRBR in what could be a standalone library setting, but also in a meaningful
information delivery method on the Web.

Classical Music Information from Social Q&A Sites

54  :KDW LV WKH JHQHUDO SXEOLFÂ¶V LQIRUPDWLRQ QHHG (e.g., entities, attributes, and
relationship) of classical music on the Web?
In the Yahoo! Answers dataset, I found that there are several questions sought to find
sources of sound recordings or video clips that they could obtain. This reveals an important
information need in Yahoo! Answer Â± obtaining and listening to music. In addition to the URL

152

source, I also found that the users were also interesting in finding the physical location,
particularly for the manifestation.
Besides, users in Yahoo! Answers were also interested in finding different performances
of a musical work, which CMFRBR defined as a sibling expression of the same work. In
addition, they sought different music performances of the same musician or music groups;
CMFRBR describes this relationship as performance of person/corporate body. This implies that
music seekers also try to find music information related to certain persons or works.
To sum up, I discovered that the access address (i.e. URL or physical location) of
manifestation is one of the most important entities that a search system can provide to its users to
meet their information needs. In addition, the general public often seeks classical music
information based on the relationships. Finally, the title of work and name of person/corporate
body were also frequently asked in Yahoo! Answers.
RQ 2.2: What change in the FRBR-based classical music representation should be
made to help the general public on the Web to find classical music information?
)URP WKH REVHUYDWLRQ RI WKH XVHUÂ¶V TXHVWLRQ set in Yahoo! Answers, I discovered that
people usually have a limited range of question types for asking, which include the title of work,
the background of work, music era, medium of performance in expression, date of expression,
access address of manifestation, form of cDUULHU SHUVRQÂ¶V QDPH DQG ELRJUDSK\ HWF Based on
XVHUVÂ¶ TXHVWLRQV LQ <DKRR $QVZHUV LW LPSOLHV that CMFRBR can have a significant role in
providing proper bibliographic information of classical music. CMFRBR includes various
attributes and relationship descriptions which can answer many of the most frequently asked
bibliographic questions from the classical music category in Yahoo! Answers. CMFRBR
provides organized information with attributes of each entity and can draw relationship between

153

entities. In addition, based on the relationship description, users can browse music information
based on their information needs from work or person entity to expression and manifestation
information, which allows users to use the knowledge they have to find the information they seek
in CMFRBR.
CMFRBR, therefore, adds relationship information and additional bibliographic
attributes to the FRBR model.
6.1.2.2

Objective and Subjective Outcomes in FIRM

RQ 2.3: Can the attributes and the relationships of the CMFRBR representation in FIRM
provide the user with a superior objective and subjective experience when searching for
classical music information compared to IMSLP?
7KH SDUWLFLSDQWVÂ¶ SHUFHSWLRQV WRZDUG the ease-of-use in finding classical music pages,
information, and answers were significantly higher in FIRM than in IMSLP. Their satisfactions
with their search performance of obtaining information and answers in FIRM were also
significantly higher than in IMSLP. Especially, ease of finding answers and satisfaction of
obtaining answers were statistically significant at the p < 0.001 level. It further implies that the
participants have a superior experience when using FIRM to find classical music information.
It was also discovered that users preferred FIRM when they sought music information by
entities. More than 80% of the participants selected FIRM as their preferred search method when
they sought for work, person, and manifestation. Remarkably, all the participants selected FIRM
over IMSLP when asked what their preferred system was to find relationship information. This
implies that FIRM presents perceptually easier and in a more satisfactory way to acquire music
information than IMSLP, especially when finding a specific piece of music information based on
HQWLW\Â¶VDWWULEXtes and relationship information.
154

This study answered the research question whether FIRM can provide better subjective

Objective outcomes were measured by the following measurements, which included 1)
percentage of task completion, 2) number of search query, 3) number of additional page views
from the minimum requirement, 4) the time spent, and 5) correct answer rate.
The first measurement, percentage of task completion, was excluded since 99.3% of tasks
were completed within given time. I did not find significant differences of the number of search
queries between the systems because most participants issued two or fewer queries in each task.
The rest of the observations of objective measurements revealed significantly different
outcomes between the two systems. The participants viewed significantly more additional pages
and spent longer time in IMSLP to reach to the answers than FIRM. Although the participants
spent more time and viewed more extra pages than required in IMSLP, their success rates of
finding correct answers were significantly lower than FIRM. 7KLVUHVXOWLPSOLHVWKDW&0)5%5Â¶V
entity relationship model as implemented in FIRM provides a better search and browsing
interface to find classical music information and is easier to use to find relevant information and
answers about classical music. In addition, it is important to note that the study results do not
imply that CMFRBR model and its retrieval system, FIRM, are better than other classical music
search system on the Web. This study compared the differences between implemented FRBRbased classical music search system, FIRM, and FRBR-like music search system (IMSLP).
Thus, this study supports RQ 2.3 that the FIRM provided a superior performance
experiences for its users to search and browse classical music information.

other languages) to find whether their initial classical music training language influenced search
performance and perception. It was discovered that the participants of different language groups
did not have significant differences in their search performance and perceptions in FIRM, which
indicated that FIRM provided a stable search interface for both language groups. On the other
hand, the two groups had significant differences in the time spent and in ease-of-use in finding
answers in IMSLP. Because the Non-English group spent significantly more time to find answers
in IMSLP, it influenced the group to give significantly lower ratings to ease-of-use of finding
answers. This implies that music seekers, whose initial trained language of classical music is not
English, need more time and effort to find music information in plain text-based music
description than the English group, whereas a more organized interface of music information
representation allows an easier retrieval process for the Non-English group users.
This study also discovered several significant differences in the search performances and

finding answers and satisfaction with obtaining answers in FIRM were significantly higher than

those for IMSLP. Meanwhile, the Non-(QJOLVK JURXSÂ¶V VHDUFK SHUIRUPDQFHV LQ YLHZLQJ H[WUD
pages and the time spent in FIRM were significantly lower than those in IMSLP. Moreover, their
ratings of the ease-of-use in finding information and answers, and satisfaction with obtaining
information and answers in FIRM were significantly higher than IMSLP. Within the NonEnglish group, I discovered the participants, who are not familiar with the classical music terms,
assigned strong preference for using FIRM as their classical music search method, and this result
caused very significant differences between the two systems.
7KHVHUHVXOWVLPSO\WKDWWKHSDUWLFLSDQWVÂ¶ILUVWOHDUQHGODQJXDJHRIFODVVLFDOPusic did not
noticeably affect their searching when they searched for classical music information within the
same search interface, particularly in FIRM. Furthermore, I discovered that regardless of the first
learned language of classical music, the participants perceived FIRM as easier and were more
satisfied with the system than with IMSLP. Both groups also exerted significantly less effort to
find music information with FIRM than with IMSLP. Finally, FIRM can help the Non-English
group more easily find classical music information, especially for people who are not familiar
with the terminology of classical music.
Classical Music Knowledge
Between the two classical music knowledge groups, I did not find significant differences in
either objective or subjective measures within the same search system, except for the success rate
in IMSLP (p = .049) in which the lower music knowledge group had a lower success rate than
the high music knowledge group. This does not mean that the knowledge of classical music
never influenced their music search performance and perception, because this study was
conducted based on known-item search from pre-defined task sets. Its results could be different
if users perform an exploratory search on unknown classical music resources.

Similar to the results for the language groups, WKLV LPSOLHV WKDW WKH SDUWLFLSDQWVÂ¶

different. FIRM provided an easier and more satisfied search experience for both groups.
Music Search Skill
This study discovered that in FIRM, the search performance of the high search skill group in the
time spent was significantly less than that of the low search skill group, whereas there is no
significant difference between the groups in IMSLP. In addition, it revealed that the high search

between the two skill groups in IMSLP. This is because the participants in the high search skill
group gave very high ratings to FIRM, which dominated their ratings to IMSLP and the low
VHDUFKVNLOOJURXSÂ¶Vratings for both FIRM and IMSLP. From this result, it can be implied that
the high search skill group has a stronger positive perceptions of FIRM than that of the low
search skill group.

the viewing of additional pages and the time spent were significantly better than in IMSLP,
whereas the low search skill group did not have any significant differences between the two
systems. In user perception, similar to the performance logs, the high search skill group gave
significantly higher ratings to FIRM than IMSLP, while the low search skill group gave similar
ratings to both systems. Therefore, FIRM is a better search system for the high search skill group
to search for classical music than IMSLP, but FIRM did not differentially help the low search
skill group find classical music information compared to IMSLP. This implies that FIRM is a
somewhat suitable system for music seekers whose music search skill is higher than the average.
Educational Level
This study DQDO\]HGWKHUHVXOWVWRILQGZKHWKHUSDUWLFLSDQWVÂ¶ educational levels influenced their
search performance and subjective perception. It is found that there is no significant difference in
either objective (performances) or subjective (perception) measures within the same search

Between two classical music information platforms, this study revealed significant
differences from the graduate student JURXSÂ¶VSHUIRUPDQFH7KH\YLHZHGVLJQLILFDQWO\less extra

regardless their fields. $GGLWLRQDOO\ JUDGXDWH VWXGHQW JURXSÂ¶V VXEMHFWLYH UDWLQJV WR ),50 ZHUH

To sum up, in order to answer the research question, I examined which internal factors

all internal factors (first learned language of classical music, music knowledge, educational level
and search skill) generally did not effect on their search performance when they search within
the same system in both IMSLP and FIRM. Similarly, their perception toward ease-of-use and
satisfaction with their search performance within the system, in general, were not significantly
different between the language groups and the knowledge groups, but there were significantly
different perceptions between the search skill groups. This implies that search skill is a factor
associated with significant GLIIHUHQFHVLQWKHXVHUVÂ¶perceptions of ease-of-use in finding music
information and their satisfaction.

as these groups viewed fewer extra pages and spent less time in FIRM. This implies that FIRM is
a helpful system to find classical music information for these groups. Moreover, in general, it is
found that all the groups, except the low search skill group, perceived that FIRM is a somewhat

160

better system in terms of ease-of-use and satisfaction. Therefore, search skill is the only factor to

Implications and Contributions

6.2.1 For FRBR Research Communities
The findings of this study indicate that the FRBR model functions are not only a bibliographic
record relationship model in library settings but can equally function in any search system. The
main emphasis of previous FRBR research focused on modeling FRBR in library catalog, but
there were fewer studies discussing the application of FRBR LQ SHRSOHÂ¶V GDLO\ ZHE Vearch on
unstructured web pages and the usability evaluations for constructed FRBR schema. The lack of
focus on user task and usability test is important since it results in failure WR LQYHVWLJDWHXVHUVÂ¶
inquiries of information display and organization. Therefore mixed usability and FRBR user task
studies will be potential future directions to improve FRBR research. This study includes
usability testing of the FRBR model and is the first example of such testing in the classical music
field.
Next, another important message from this study is that the studies of music search in
FRBR should not only be concerned with the efficiency and effectiveness of search, in terms of

experience and satisfaction, which can also easily to be applied in any other FRBR or even nonFRBR settings.

can be effectively used by the general community (i.e. non-expert) to obtain information they
seek. This dissertation also demonstrates the feasibility of building a FRBRÂ±based system that
provides general users with an accessible classical music information system. The users of
different language groups, different levels of search skill and classical music knowledge were all
able to effectively use the implemented entity relationship model to find answers to questions
that real Web users ask for, taken from a social Q&A site. Users specifically liked relationship
information presented in the FRBR model. This indicates that relationships are significant
cognitive concepts for general users and may provide sufficient contextual information for users
to navigate in/out any music entities. Further study on the most effective of relationship
information is necessary as is what relationships are the most important in different domains.

6.2.2 For Music Information Retrieval Research Community
The CMFRBR model adds more attributes and entities in the traditional music representation
schema. Known that normal users usually care about certain music entities and relationships,
MIR research can use CMFRBR model in two ways: 1) reconsiders the representation of music
information in the backend of music IR systems; 2) provide different types of facets of attributes
of entities and relationships in a faceted music search system to make users more controllable in
their search process.
The findings of this study suggest that music information retrieval researchers may study
YDULRXVJURXSVÂ¶LQWHUQDOIDFWRUVUHODWHGWRWKHLUPXVLFVHDUFKZKLFK could influence their search

162

process and results. Although I did not include the professional level of classical music
knowledge group in this study, the outcomes of the search results and their perception were quite
different among the groups. It will be an interesting research when comparing the usability of
SURIHVVLRQDOJURXSÂ¶VLQWHUQDOIDFWRUVRUEHWZHHQSURIHVVLRQDODQGQRQ-professional groups as the
groups may have different strategies and search behavior to find classical music information. It is
also important that FRBR researchers explore other measurements that can examine the benefits
of information organization.

6.2.3 For the Design of Classical Music Search systems
The findings of this study have several implications for the design of classical music information
retrieval systems in order to better support its general users.
First, the study results suggest that when the general public seeks to find certain
information they need, they frequently browse through related music entities such as works and
persons for additional music information using an unspecified relationship model. This implies
that the FRBR model can be implemented in music search systems and that the designers of
classical music information search systems should initially consider drawing upon all possible
relationships among classical music information elements. The FRBR-based relationship
description is complex but it is important to define the most important relationships (e.g., parents,
sibling, etc.) which are potentially useful to general users of their specific classical music search
system. Users of FIRM in this study clearly preferred using relationship information when
answering some of the study tasks and commented on lack of such information in IMSLP.
Second, the findings in this study can provide useful guidance for the interface design of
a classical music information search system. Each page should describe the attributes and

163

relationships of a single entity and the pages should be linked by the relationships as FIRM
presented based on the CMFRBR model. In an entity page, it would be beneficial to separate
attributes and relationship information in multiple panels (or frames) in the display to enable
users search, browse and explore the relationships among entities. Users in this study preferred
an interface design that had more focused information contents in each page rather than pages
with a lot of information. Even to the extent of having to view a larger number of pages being
preferred when it is easier to find desired information on each page. Explicitly in FIRM the
minimum number of pages required to achieve some tasks was four while the minimum number
in IMSLP was two, however, users still preferred to use FIRM even with the additional required
pages. Although in general fewer page clicks is considered to be better than more page clicks,
this experiment showed that is not always true.
Third, in implementing a system with FRBR model, it is important to be aware of the
needs for learning process with FIRM-based search. In this user experiment, users initially had
some difficulties in using FIRM in order to find answers. The major reason for the difficulties
ZDVWU\LQJWRXQGHUVWDQG&0)5%5Â¶Vterminologies and classical music terms. This implies that
the search system should use easier terms on the end user side rather than technical FRBR
terminology. For example, users initially had difficulties with understanding terms such as
Â³PDQLIHVWDWLRQÂ´ Â³PHGLXP RI SHUIRUPDQFHÂ´ HWF. In addition, the implementation of FIRM for
this study only provided keyword-based search without any advanced search options. It would be
beneficial to add advanced search options which could include entity based search or filtering
option by entities. In addition, to prevent the length of the page from becoming too long, it would
be beneficial if users could interact with the display employing expansion of filtering affordances

164

such as +/- signs in relationship description. Other researchers have similar findings in evaluating
FRBR-based music catalog systems (Salaba & Zhang, 2012).
Fourth, from the observations and surveys, FRBR not only can provide bibliographic
information of a certain musical object but also can function as a classical music information
provider for students who learn classical music. For example, it could be implemented as an
educational system for classical music in K-12 schools. Such FRBR-based music search system
can assist music teachers in not only searching for music products but also to provide
background or history of music to their students.
Lastly, as most of the previous FRBR studies only focused on FRBRÂ¶V conceptual model
in libraries' catalog setting, it is now necessary to investigate the feasibility of the FRBR
conceptual model in Web-based search systems. Some studies have done this with a general
FRBR model, but only a small number of these studies were done in the music domain especially
in the classical music field. &0)5%5Â¶V UHSUHVHQWDWLRQ FDQ VHUYH DV DQ DOWHUQDWLYH GDWDEDVH
schema for obtaining classical music information on the Web so that users can do one-stop
searching from classical music work information to related musical representations, such as
sound recordings, music scores, and books. In order to enhance the usage of libraries, it is also
important that the destination and access information for obtaining pieces of classical music
manifestation should EHLQFOXGHGVXFKDVOLEUDULHVÂ¶ URLs or the physical location of a library.

6.3

Limitations of the Study

There are several limitations of this study. First, although significant parts of the Functional
Requirements for Bibliographic Records model is considered and examined for classical music
165

resources representation and retrieval, the model was not fully tested. This study focuses only on
Groups 1 and 2 of the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records among the three
groups (Groups 1, 2, and 3). However, some entities in Group 3 have been merged as attributes
into the entities of Groups DQG0RUHRYHUWKHÂ³,WHPÂ´HQWLW\LQ*URXSLVH[FOXGHGLQWKLV
study because this study relies more heavily on Web-based music information retrieval, and the
manifestation level can provide enough information of embodied expression in media.
In the second study, I sampled 500 classical music related questions from Yahoo!
Answers to categorize the types of questions general Web users ask related to classical music.
However, there may be different types of information needs than those samples or questions may
be different in other platforms. In addition, the study did not include the analyses of )5%5Â¶VXVHU
task which is to find, identify, select, and obtain the entity information from the Yahoo! Answers
question set. This process will be done in the near future.
The majority of participants in the final experiment were college students representing
members of the general public whose educational background is higher than undergraduate.

those of the general public outside of academia. There was an age bias to an under 30 category.
Finally, this dissertation only focuses )5%5Â¶V IHDVLELOLW\ RI WKH FODVVLFDO PXVLF
bibliographic records. In CMFRBR, the records contains only the musical sound-based
information in expression and manifestation, which does not include printed material such as
books, music scores, etc. In this study, only classical music information including work,
performance and its recorded materials was investigated; all other music genres like jazz, pop,
dance, etc., were excluded.

Conclusions and Future Work

This study had three purposes. First, it was intended to determine the important attributes and
relationships to describe classical music information. The second purpose was to identify XVHUVÂ¶
real information needs for finding bibliographic records on the Web. The final purpose was to
understand how people search and find classical music information in given music search
systems with different types of support.
The phase of the study successfully identified classical music attributes in entities and
established the relationships between entities in FRBR. The results of the survey in the first
phase implied that attributes of each entity can enrich descriptions of musical bibliographic
information, and these attributes help users find improved music information.
In the second phase of the study, it was found that the general public tended to ask about
bibliographic classical music information when they were not explicitly seeking opinions about
which composer/symphony/orchestra is better. %DVHG RQ WKH XVHUVÂ¶ questions in Yahoo!
Answers, the study indicated that FRBR can play a significant role in identifying entities and
attributes of information from questions in social Q&A sites. The FRBR model provides a proper
framework to represent classical music information in a manner that general users can
understand and use to obtain their desired information on the Web.
Finally, for the CMFRBR-based classical music information representation and its
retrieval system, FIRM, the usability test was performed. To my knowledge, this study is the first
to examine the usefulness of a FRBR-based classical music representation model for retrieval of
bibliographic records. The results demonstrate that a FRBR-based classical music search system
can provide the bibliographic information to users in a format they prefer over the baseline
system (IMSLP) as far as organization and representation are concerned. The survey results also
167

pointed out that users can easily search for specific information in FIRM which significantly
improved XVHUVÂ¶VDWLVIDFWLRQ
The entire study results conclude that general web users are interested in finding classical
music information and would like to use a better organized music search system. Therefore this
study contributed in indicating that a FRBR-based system such as FIRM, the implemented FRBR
classical music search system use for this study, can help users find appropriated classical music
information they needed.
I plan to conduct future studies in the following directions. First, it is necessary to expand
the datasets to include various types of media format such as books, scores, etc. This will provide
a larger benefit to classical music seekers to find not only sound recordings of music out but also
additionally related information of classical music. Second, a larJHU VFDOH DQDO\VLV RI XVHUVÂ¶
classical music information needs can indicate additional information needs in topics or
platforms. For the current study, I only sampled 500 questions from Yahoo! Answers which can
be extended. Finally, further in-depth analysis, such as analysis based on FRBR user task, can
provide a better understanding of the diversity of XVHUVÂ¶ FODVVLFDO music information retrieval
experience.
