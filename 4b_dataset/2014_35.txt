Information-Seeking Behavior and the Intercultural Learning Process: Experiences of
International Graduate Students from China: A Qualitative Sense-Making Case Study
Elisabeth Rodriguez, MLIS
University of Pittsburgh, 2014

In 1976, Deng Xiaoping opened China’s economy to help modernize the country. This
decision created a need for an educated work force to develop China’s economy. In turn, China’s
citizens experienced educational opportunities to travel and/or live abroad, and gain knowledge
from higher-education institutions located in developed economies. Students from China began
traveling to the United States to obtain higher-education degrees in the 1980s, and since 2009,
China has sent more international students to the United States than any other country (Open
doors, 2013).
Many higher-education institutions have focused efforts on supporting their Chinese
international student populations, as it represents growth and relevance to the institution.
Academic service departments such as libraries often assist students in the completion of their
studies through user-centered services, relevant collections, and instruction in support of
information literacy skills. In spite of the great effort that academic libraries undertake in
researching user needs, unique populations, such as Chinese international students, can
inadvertently be ignored when designing services or collections.
This study seeks to investigate the information-seeking behavior of one specific
international student population to aid in identifying the information behavior of a specific
population of students, and to aid in the development of evidence-based research for detecting
student information needs.
iv

Utilizing Brenda Dervin’s sense-making method as a framework, this study investigates
the information-seeking behavior of Chinese graduate students from the People’s Republic of
China (PRC) at the University of Pittsburgh’s School of Information Sciences. A total of 20
qualitative interviews were conducted with these graduate students. Interviews were transcribed,
imported into Atlas.ti, and analyzed using a qualitative content analysis approach.
Results from the study detected varied practices to identify and utilize authoritative and
reliable sources of information in support of participants’ information-seeking behavior. These
include: reliance on personal networks, assumptions of reliability of information, and awareness
of resources that help. Participants’ opinions on authority and reliability of information offer
insight into the need to further investigate the detection of information literacy skills among
similar populations of international graduate students

INTRODUCTION

This study will explore the information-seeking behavior of Chinese graduate international
students from the People’s Republic of China (PRC), in support of their intercultural learning
experience in the United States. More broadly, this study explores institutional cultures in China
and the United States. The study seeks to understand and explain possible insight into
participants’ information-seeking behavior. The findings of this study will contribute to
knowledge about the information-seeking behavior research on international students in the
United States. This introductory chapter discusses the purpose of the study and theoretical
foundation; it is organized in six sections. Section 1.1 describes the background of this study and
section 1.2 states the problem being investigated. Section 1.3 addresses the research question
explored and section 1.4 provides the theoretical lens that the researcher utilized to view the
research problem. Section 1.5 supports the significance of this study. Lastly, section 1.6 provides
terminology commonly used in this study.

1.1

BACKGROUND

In fall 2006, I was a new librarian faced with my first task: co-teaching a semester-long
information literacy course. While a co-instructor and I developed the lectures and exercises,
neither of us considered the cultural background of the students. After one lecture, and talking to
1

an international student from Taiwan, I realized that my presentation of library systems and
instruction on United States copyright law was culturally exclusive to the way that I was raised
in the United States. The student informed me that, “we Chinese kids were not taught to be good
like you American kids.” This statement came as a surprise. I never intended to present content
in a culturally exclusive or alienating manner; yet, my lecture caused students to feel culturally
unequal.
My MLIS education did not necessarily prepare me to teach, and certainly not to teach in
a culturally inclusive manner. My instruction was unintentionally exclusive. My scope was not
broad enough to consider the needs of international students whose cultural norms were different
from my own. Upon investigating the professional literature addressing instruction of
international student populations, I found that it lacked meaningful insight into specific cultural
groups. Rather, the literature tended to generalize and group students into a single category of
“international” or “foreign.” The abundance of culturally superficial literature for instructing
international students led me to investigate the information-seeking behavior from the
perspective of Chinese international students studying in the United States.

1.2

PROBLEM STATEMENT

The term and classification of “international student” is used to describe any student studying in
the

United

States

that

is

not

a

citizen.

Since

2005,

the population of international students in higher education in the United States has experienced
a steady increase (IIE, 2010a). For the academic year of 2012-2013, there were 819,644
international students studying in the United States, with the highest enrollment from China at
2

235,597 students (IIE, 2013). International students are a source of revenue for United States
universities, so institutions have a vested interest in their needs. Academic libraries, which
provide access to information through services and instruction on resources, are one way in
which schools support student education. However, if there is no communication between users
of the library and the librarian, disconnect may occur. A library may then risk failing to support
the information needs of students and becoming irrelevant to users. Libraries face a challenge in
the 21st century: How can the needs of students be identified and addressed? Chinese students are
just one of many nationalities that come to the United States to study for educational, cultural,
and social benefits. When international students come to study in the United States, they come
with their own unique values and cultural insights of their representative countries. If institutions
do not address these unique needs, they “may leave these students feeling disappointed,
unfulfilled, and even exploited” (Sherry, Thomas & Chui, 2010, p.34).
While studies have explored the issue of services available to international students, a
majority of these works were published more than a decade ago (Peters, D., 2010;
Correll, 1983; Bilal, 1988; Lafon, 1992). Furthermore, the literature demonstrates the slow
progress toward inclusion of international student needs and the continual argument for
extending special services for them (Iheanacho, 2008; Liao, Fin, & Lu, 2005). Past literature
emphasized librarians’ perceived opinions of student needs (Conteh-Morgan, 2003) and research
primarily relied on quantitative survey research methods to capture student experiences (Lewis,
1969; Correll, 1983; Cope & Black, 1985; Moorhead, 1986; Liestman & Wu, 1990; Lafon,
1992). This research tactic failed to present specific insight into international student groups in
the United States and overlooked their higher-education library and information experiences and
needs.

RESEARCH QUESTION

Based on preliminary identification and exploration of the research problem, the following
research questions have been identified to investigate the experiences of international graduate
students:
Primary question: How do international graduate students from China make sense of the
information they need in support of their intercultural learning experience?

Secondary questions:
a. What kinds of information situations and challenges do students experience
during their studies?
b. What are the hindrances that prevent international students from accessing or
using information resources related to their education?
c. How do international students overcome obstacles to their access or use of library
resources?
i. Sub-question: Are there “gatekeepers” that assist in this process?
d. Do international students feel successful in accessing and utilizing library
resources?
e. Do international students feel satisfied with the information that they find?

THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVE

This study is framed by two theoretical perspectives – (1) Freire’s critical pedagogy (1970) and
(2) Dervin’s sense-making theory and method (1983, 2008). Both are discussed below.
According to Freire (1970, 2000), awareness of culture and its inclusion in instruction are
essential to providing relevant instruction. This act of awareness is informed by self-reflection,
which Freire (1970, 2000) defines as Praxis: the act of “reflection and action directed at the
structures to be transformed” (p.126). Freire (1970, 2000) argues that Praxis driven by the
oppressed is the only means of liberation from a hegemonic system. Denying marginalized
groups the right to reflection prohibits people from exercising the “right to say their own word
and think their own thoughts” (Freire, 1970, 2000, p.126). Educator and researcher James A.
Banks (1996) reflects on Freire’s Praxis by suggesting that when previously marginalized groups
are able to take hold of their rights, they can influence mainstream culture. Thus, creating
progress and empowering previously excluded groups.
The democratization of power in educational capital, i.e., knowledge, within the United
States can be traced to the Civil Rights Movement of the late 1960s and ‘70s. Historians
specifically point to the Third World Liberation Front (TWLF) at San Francisco State University
(SFSU), where racially oppressed SFSU students employed “grassroots political participatory
models for social change” (Ono, 2005, p.2) within an education system for the purpose of
curriculum inclusion.
Beginning on November 6, 1968, “black activists” at SFSU who were part of the Black
Students Union recruited other students of color (Asian American, Chicano Latino, and Native
American) to establish the “Third World Liberation Front (TWLF)” (Chiang, 2005, p.65). This
student uprising eventually caused “a shutdown of the campus for five months” (Chi, 2005, p.40)
5

and was resolved by only partially meeting student demands to establish a School of Ethnic
Studies. SFSU established “the first ethnic studies in the nation, including an Asian American
studies program” (Chi, 2005, p.40). Movements such as these gave way to multicultural
education through the establishment of Ethnic American Studies (African-American, AsianAmerican, Chicano/a and Native American Studies) (Banks, 1996, p.38).
Applying Freire’s (1970) critical pedagogy context to SFSU’s establishment of the first
Ethnic Studies School and Asian American Studies program in the United States indicates that,
the oppressed were successful because:
“The pedagogy of the oppressed, which is the pedagogy of people engaged in the fight
for their own liberation, … those who recognize, or begin to recognize, themselves as
oppressed must be among the developers of this pedagogy” (Freire, 1970, 2000, p. 53).
Self-determination or self-liberation, according to Freire (1970), is arrived at through Praxis. In
order for Praxis to occur, hegemony needs to be controlled. Brenda Dervin’s (1983, 2008) sensemaking theory, method (SMM) and interviewing tool serve as a means to detect hegemony
within a person, or system, through the understanding that hegemony exists consciously or
unconsciously.
Dervin (1983, 2008) cites the utilization of Freire’s Pedagogy of the Oppressed (Freire,
1970) and Education for Critical Consciousness (Freire, 1983) in the SMM, which “looks
beyond hegemony and habits to how systems might be designed to be more responsive to human
needs” (Dervin, 2008, p.6). This theory/method empowers the “actor”/person by allowing them
to be free of “ideological judgment” (Dervin, 2008, p.6).

It does not impose ideas of

“correctness”; thus, allowing the actor to create a context of understanding based upon his/her
perspective or self-reflection.
6

Utilizing the lenses of multicultural education and SMM (1983, 2008), this study focuses
on the participants’ perspectives. Allowing participants to reflect in their own words will
facilitate Praxis. In addition, these theories will assist in detecting if participants see themselves
as culturally excluded within their education system.

1.5

SIGNIFICANCE OF STUDY

The study investigates the information challenges of the Chinese international student population
utilizing a qualitative method of investigation. Previous research studies on international students
had placed emphasis on survey method approaches, which limited participant responses to the
researcher’s predetermined selection of answers. Using a qualitative approach, this study allows
participants to self-report, and thus, present a more nuanced insight into their informationseeking behaviors and experiences.
Many previous library-related investigations approached international students as a single
population, grouping multiple nationalities into one sample population. This study avoids this
limitation by focusing on one nationality: Chinese students from the People’s Republic of China.
This decision avoids the possibility of generalizations being made among cultural or national
groups that might invalidate the study’s findings.
This study occurs at a time when the largest international student population in higher
education in the United States is from China; therefore, this work is timely and essential. In
addition, the results of this investigation should provide library practitioners and researchers with
authentic insight into students’ use of information resources and systems, providing the
knowledge needed to help improve services in support of student educational endeavors. Lastly,
7

participants were drawn from disciplines of study that fall under the scope of Information
Schools (iSchools), as few studies have explored the information needs of students in these
disciplines.

1.6

TERMINOLOGY

The theoretical foundation of this study is multidisciplinary; it borrows terminology from the
fields of education, communication, and library and information science. The terminology
primarily is based on a higher-education context. Two terms not defined for this study are
“success” and “satisfaction.” Participants will define these terms during the data collection
process, and will be explained later in the findings of the study.
Below are some working definitions for vocabulary that will be widely utilized in this study:
Acculturation: The direct and indirect process of adoption of similarity to a dominate culture
groups’ normative behavior and/or practices (Berry, 2003, p.19).
Bridge: Within a sense-making context, identifies the various helps or sources that allowed the
actor to overcome his/her problem (Dervin, 2008).
China: This refers to the People’s Republic of China (PRC).
Chinese: Those whose nationality is assigned to the People’s Republic of China. It excludes
persons from Taiwan and nationals of the United States.
Context: Derived from the sense-making metaphor (2008) that depicts context as an umbrella
hanging over the actor that he/she carries throughout life. The umbrella holds previous
knowledge or experiences over the actor that he/she can draw upon while moving through life.
This knowledge can shape one’s perception and approach to life (Dervin, 2008).
Copyright: In the United States, this term is used to describe the “exclusive rights granted by law
to copyright owners for protection of their work” (United States Copyright Office, 2012).
Cross-Culture: Pertaining to interaction between persons of different cultural backgrounds that
are “one or more cultures beyond one’s native culture” (Grant & Ladson-Billing, 1997, p.53).
8

Culture: Shared “knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes” of a society or group of people (Lawton &
Gordon, 1996, p. 80).
Exclusive education: A system of education that is opposite of an inclusive educational
environment.
Gap: Within a sense-making context, describes the question or muddle that the actor seeks to
address or answer (Dervin, 2008).
Gatekeeper: “Someone who is able to grant or to deny access to the field” (Silverman, 2006,
p.402).
Hegemony: In the context of multicultural education, “a process in which dominate groups in
society come together to form a bloc to sustain leadership and control over subordinate groups”
(Grants &Ladson- Billings, 1997, p.130).
Inclusive education: A system that “respects and reflects all aspects of the school, its community,
students, and staff.” (Joshee, 2009, p.104)
Information: A “resource…that describes reality, reduces the uncertainty about it, and allows
people to cope more effectively” (Dervin, 1980, 2006, p.30). For this study, the term will be used
in relation to structured higher-education learning.
Information-seeking behavior: A subset of information behavior “concerned with the variety of
methods people employ to discover and gain access to information resources” (Wilson, 1999,
p.263).
Intercultural: Describes interaction between two cultural groups as cited by previous studies
(Smith, 2008) when “individual participants of differing cultural backgrounds come into direct
contact and interaction with one another” (Kim, 2001, p.140).
International student: Students who entered the United States through a student visa. This term
will be used synonymously with literature that describes this population as “foreign.”
Multicultural education: Format of education that addresses issues of racism, discrimination,
and prejudices by “changing the total school environment so that it will reflect the diverse groups
in United States society” (Howard, 1996, p.337).
Neutral-questioning: As defined by Dervin (1984, 2006), a form of interviewing that uses “three
classes of questions that are content free except in their allegiance to time-space premises”
(p.266). These “classes” relate to the steps of the Sense-Making Method (situation, gap, &
bridge) that identify the outcome of a situation as told through the words of the participant.
Outcome: Within a sense-making context, describes the result of a bridge; it can be an
answer/solution or another gap or problem (Dervin, 2008).
9

Plagiarism: Is an act in which one may claim, present, or duplicate the work of another person
without giving attribution (Pickering, 2008).
Resource: “A means of supplying a deficiency or need; something that is a source of help,
information, strength, etc.”(OED, 2010b).
Sense-making: A qualitative research theory and method that utilizes the “behavior, both internal
(cognitive) and external (procedural)” of an actor (participant/person) to understand how the
individual “construct(s) and design his/her movement through time-space” to solve a problem
(Dervin, 1983).
Situation: Within sense-making this describes the context for the cause of the information need
(Dervin, 2008).
Socially constructed knowledge: knowledge from “everyday experience is socially shaped” by
“the power relations of the social and historical forces that produced them” (Grant & LadsonBillings, 1997, p.52).

REVIEW OF LITERATURE

The library literature on services and instruction to international students studying in the United
States is mainly limited to English as a second language (ESL), English language learners (ELL)
or limited English proficient (LEP) in higher education. The scope of the literature evaluated for
this study focuses on academic libraries, as non-academic libraries differ in mission and
resources. In addition, non-college student immigrant populations were not included in this
literature review as their information needs differ from those of students who come to the United
States for education.
Section 2.1 is a literature review of library instruction to international students in the
United States from the 1960s to 2000s. This section analyzes the various ways libraries have
documented how they serve international students and identify the special needs of this
population. Section 2.2 is a literature review of library instruction and orientations given to
Chinese international students in English language countries outside of North America. Section
2.3 presents an overview of information literacy and its presentation in English languagepublished Chinese professional literature. Section 2.4 reviews literature that seeks to address
information behavior of international students. Lastly, section 2.5 reviews a few Sense-Making
Method studies examining participant background and qualitative interview techniques.

2.1

LIBRARY INSTRUCTION TO INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS

In the United States, one of the earliest examples of research on library service and needs of
international students was Lewis’ 1969 study, “Library Orientation for Asian College Students,”
a mixed method study conducted at the East-West Center, University of Hawaii. It included 60
Asian students from 20 different countries (Lewis, 1969). Through interviews and surveys, the
subjects of culture shock, library anxiety, and students’ unfamiliarity with the educational
environment and library system were identified as challenges that Asian students faced during
their studies in the United States. Some recommendation based on the findings of this study
proposed that schools provide Asian international students with non-credit library orientation
courses and small, student-guided, library tours.
Since Lewis’s (1969) study, many library practitioners have followed her advice, and to
some extent for over the last 45 years, the topic of challenges to service and instruction of
international students has remained constant (Bilal, 1988; Lafon, 1992; Wang & Frank, 2002;
Knight, Hight, & Polfer, 2010). A significant portion of the research preformed within a library
context has focused on reference services and instruction (Peters, 2010) and was conducted
between the 1980s and 1990s (Morrissey & Given, 2006, p.222). Librarians and researchers have
implemented Lewis’s (1969) suggestions through integration of native language library
instruction and tours by librarians (Liestman & Wu, 1990), student workers (Lopez, 1983), and
audio tours (Huls, Parson, Peterson, & Vakili, 1994). Librarians and students both indicate that
the usage of native languages in library instruction and orientations are helpful ways to address
clarity in the communication of culturally dependent information.
Literature also mentions the use of collaboration efforts outside of the library, such as cotaught courses with ESL instructors (Cope & Black, 1985; Knight, Hight, & Polfer, 2010), and
12

international student services (Chau, 2003). However, librarians still struggle to reach students,
and address the challenge of engaging students and assisting them when utilizing the library.
Ultimately, librarians seek to understand how to best provide access to information. In
Felicia Suila Kimo Lafon’s (1992) dissertation “A Comparative and Analysis of the Library
Skills of American and Foreign Students at the University of Michigan,” international students’
library instructional needs were assessed. Lafon (1992) conducted a quantitative survey with 839
students (undergraduate and graduate) from both the United States and abroad (Japan, China,
Korea, Taiwan, India, Iran, and Saudi Arabia) with the primary purpose of determining if library
education needs of foreign students differed significantly from those of American students (pp.
155-154). The study found that international students had significantly different needs than
American students due to a lack of familiarity with library resources, and a lack of English
fluency. Furthermore, two challenges for librarians and library administrators were identified.
The first was “to develop programs to teach foreign students how to use libraries effectively”
(Lafon, 1992, p.165). The second highlighted the need “to prepare library staff to communicate
effectively with these students” (Lafon, 1992, p.165).
Although the challenges Lafon (1992) addresses have been noted in previous research,
the finding supported the need for continued research. Lafon (1992) suggested that further
research should investigate the topic qualitatively (interview-based research) to better understand
how international students perceive the library, their motivations (information-seeking behavior)
behind their choices of information resources, and how students search (information-searching
behavior) for material (Lafon, 1992, pp.170-171).
Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, librarians continued to investigate ways to
adequately address library services in a culturally sensitive way. Culturally inclusive library

13

instruction (Conteh-Morgan, 2003) and gender differences among international student
populations (Bilal, 1988; Zoe & DiMartino, 2000) have improved. However, research has not
identified what information international students need, and how the library does, or does not,
assist them in fulfilling this need.
Although the United States library literature has not significantly addressed international
student needs for information, guidance can be found in an example from Canadian researchers
Renée Morrissey and Lisa M. Given (2006). In their case study, “International Students and the
Academic Library,” conducted at the University of Alberta, nine graduate students from China
were interviewed regarding their experiences with their library. The participants’ “informationseeking behaviours and their evaluation of the library’s digital systems” also were assessed
utilizing American College & Research Libraries (ACRL) standards of information literacy
(Morrissey & Given, 2006, p.225).
The interviews “lasted between forty-five and seventy minutes” and were “transcribed
and coded using a grounded theory approach” (Morrissey & Given, 2006, p.225) to identify
common themes within the data. Through the participants’ own words, the research offered
insight into the difficulties that Chinese international students experience when utilizing library
instruction and understanding and adhering to copyright laws. Students expressed that cognition
of language was difficult to acquire and that library instruction given during school orientation
was not useful. Furthermore, students expressed that in-class library instruction with professors’
support was the most beneficial form of library instruction (Morrissey & Given, 2006, p. 236).
Students also noted that plagiarism was not a concept taught to them in China, but rather, learned
while studying in Canada.

14

The most valuable aspects of this article are the participants’ direct quotes, which build
an authentic perspective of their reasoning behind their information-seeking behavior. Though
the cultures being compared are Canadian and Chinese, this article is an exemplary model for
conducting culturally relevant library research that seeks to understand the user’s perspective on
improving library services. Additional library research that directly captures the needs of
international students, and how they can be assisted in their navigation through higher-education
studies, is necessary.

2.2

LIBRARY EXPERIENCES OF CHINESE STUDENTS INTERNATIONALLY

Library researchers in English language countries outside of the United States and Canada
reported challenges associated with servicing Chinese international students. A literature review
of research performed in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand indicates a
need for outreach to students, and cultural sensitivity training for staff, as means of overcoming
cultural linguistic barriers between libraries, and namely, Chinese international students (Mu,
2007; Singer, 2005; Wang, 2006; Sackers, Secomb, & Hulett, 2008; Hughes, 2010).
In Belle Wang’s (2006) thesis study of eight Chinese undergraduate and graduate
students at Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand, participants discussed their
experiences related to libraries. Wang (2006) found cultural differences among New Zealanders
and Chinese students between low context (New Zealand) and high context (Chinese PRC
culture) communication. Wang (2006) cites that “In a low context culture as New Zealand,
people rely heavily on words for information transmission. Silence is viewed as abnormal and

15

anxiety-producing” (Wang, 2006, p.72). In comparison, Mandarin Chinese is a high context
language. The stresses of communication pattern differences contribute to conflict between
students and natives of the country of study. Wang (2006) notes additional differences between
norms of behavior and feelings toward knowledge of libraries, specifically:
Chinese international students may think their ignorance is a shame and do not ask for
assistance or ask questions probably because they do not want to lose face. Alternatively
they many not want librarians to lose face by not being able to provide them the correct
answers: some participants do believe librarians may not be able to help them. This is an
important issue in the library instruction sessions. (Wang, 2006, p.79)
Outreach through international offices, and those instructing international students, has been
suggested to address the above challenges (Wang, 2006; Mu, 2007). Training library staff on
culturally sensitivity and awareness of students’ needs is also suggested as ways to improve
communication between service providers and recipients (Sing, 2005).
In Hilary Hughes’s (2010) doctoral research, carried out at two Australia universities, 25
international college students were interviewed on their experiences in Australian libraries.
Findings from Hughes’s (2010) research specifically dealing with international students from
China found that students did not use libraries in China. They indicated that assignments were
not research-based; instead, exams determined grades (Hughes, 2010, p. 81). One Chinese
participant suggested his/her lack of experience using libraries in China was due to limited and
outdated resources (Hughes, 2010). Another Chinese student in Hughes’s (2010) study noted that
the library at his/her previous institution of study in China did not have a catalog, which made
finding information difficult. Chinese students also stated having difficulty using Australian
16

databases and knowing how to search a catalog, check out a book, and interpret call numbers
(Hughes, 2010, p. 83).
Based upon the findings that Hughes (2010) presents in her study, she provides three
recommendations, first, there is a need for sustained informal and formal interaction between
library staff and international students in support of building relationships with students. Second,
librarians should attempt to detect the possible learning needs and perspectives of international
students in relation to libraries and librarians. Third, strategies in support of detecting learning
needs of international students need to be developed (Hughes, 2010, pp. 86-87).
It is apparent through this brief review of the literature in English language countries that
more research needs to be performed to inform to development of better services for
international students, specifically students from China. Researchers have identified the need for
engagement to address culturally specific differences between libraries, and culturally dependent
communication between students and libraries. Additionally, Chinese international students are
one population of special interest that can be better served and assisted in their understanding
and use of library instruction and services.

2.3

INFORMATION LITERACY

The introduction of the term information literacy (IL) has been credited to Paul Zurkowski, the
then president of the Information Industry Association (IIA) in 1974 (Maughan, 2001, p.71). His
utilization of IL was to describe the application and training of information resource use within a

17

work context. Although the origins of IL occurred outside of a library context, it was officially
adopted by the American Library Association Committee on Information Literacy in 1989.
The committee was formed in 1987 with the task of defining IL and produced a final
report. This final report included the following definition for IL: “To be information literate, a
person must be able to recognize when information is needed and have the ability to locate,
evaluate, and use effectively the needed information" (ALA, 1989, para 3). This definition is
commonly cited to describe IL (Breivik, 2005), but it does not address how one becomes
information literate.
IL terminology became prominent in North America during the 1980s among librarians
utilizing the term as a synonym, or replacement, for library skills, library use, and
bibliographic instruction (McCrank, 1992; Maughan, 2001). Support for the development of IL
within both higher education, and K-12 in the 1980s, was also attributed to the 1983 National
Commission on Excellence in Education report, “A Nation at Risk: The Imperative for
Educational Reform.” The report advocated that in order for America’s youth to be competitive,
they would be required to develop skills for the information age that included skills related to the
use information resources and technology.
During the 1990s, and the beginning of the new millennium, IL for higher education
institutions gained competencies through the creation of IL standards by the Association of
College and Research Libraries (Association of College and Research Libraries, 2000). Using the
1989 ALA definition of IL, five standards with performance indicators were created. Using the
performance indicators as guidance for teaching IL to students in higher education, numerous
studies have been conducted in the United States (Williams, 2008).

18

The ACRL has been a proponent of IL within North American for more than thirty years
(American Library Association, 1989). The uniformity of the concept and associated five
standards is supported by the ACRL member institutions, along with a cultural value for
intellectual property (in a United States context that is copyright law; United States Constitution,
Article V). The five standards reflect the research-based higher education system that was
developed in the United States during the 19th century (Weiss, 2003).
The promotion of IL as a form of literacy is not a culturally exclusive subject and has
been addressed in other countries such as China. The presentation of IL through professional
literature related to Chinese higher education is uniquely different from IL history and
professional organization in the United States Specifically, China does not have a uniformed
professional organization such as ACRL to promote IL as a learning objective for highereducation libraries.
Unlike the United States where IL has been defined uniformly for higher education and
tied to cultural values of property for information and tethered to educational pedagogy, Chinese
higher educational institutions have yet to adopt IL uniformly as a literacy standard. IL in China
emerged in the late 1980s (Li, X., 2006) and has been used widely to refer to other concepts such
as information retrieval, information qualification, and information ability (Li, X., 2006; Sun, P.,
2002). The absence of uniformity in the terminology, and a clear definition of IL present a
challenge for researchers to measure this form of literacy and track its development.
In October of 2005, “the first information literacy competency standards for higher
education in China” (Xiaomu, Z., Ping, S., Mengli. W., & Weichun, D., 2008, p.10) were
approved in Beijing by the Institute of Beijing Academic Libraries (IBAL). This academic
library system is comprised of university libraries that represent 10% of China’s higher19

education institutions. The standards promoted by IBAL differ from IL standards in North
American in that IBAL standards place “emphasis on information consciousness besides
information knowledge, information ability and information moral” (Xiaomu et al., 2008, p.10).
These desired competencies related to information are challenging to assess as they are abstract
and tied to socio-cultural specific values that may not be comparable to other countries that do
not have the same laws related to censorship or government as PRC (Ling, 2010; Gao, 2011).
The PRC constitution states under Article 40 that the censorship of personal
correspondents or communication is permissible “in cases where, to meet the needs of State
security or of criminal investigation, public security or procuratorial organs are permitted to
censor correspondence in accordance with the procedures prescribed by law” (China, 2004).
Determining when censorship is permissible is not specifically defined; however, this article
supports the role of government in the monitoring of information (Ling, 2010).
The means of monitoring the censorship of information is made permissible throughout
the numerous Articles in the PRC constitution, which dictates the role of the State in controlling
commerce (Articles 6, 7, 18, and 28). One of the most recent and notable cases of censorship of
the Internet in China involved the search engine Google (Ling, 2010; Gao, 2011). In this case,
the government told Google to either comply with China’s rules or it would not be allowed to
continue doing business in China; Google complied but has varying degrees of filters between
Hong Kong and Mainland China (Gao, 2011). In a 2011 congressional hearing on China's
censorship of the Internet and social media, censorship was addressed as both an issue of
commerce and human rights. Thus, thickening the ambiguity of what types of information may
be available on the Internet to persons in China. This filtering or censorship of information might

20

omit or limit situations where one would develop or learn assessment techniques for detecting
authoritative and non-authoritative information and thus change how one might gain IL skills.
China is still a developing economy, and access to computers and the Internet throughout
the country is a continual process. These factors also pose a challenge to developing IL in China
(Xiaomu et al., 2008). Beyond technology, China has challenges teaching IL, as the K-12
education system is exam-oriented and may not allow for the development of IL skills (Xiaomu
et al., 2008). Xiaomu et al. (2008) cite the previous challenges as a basis for why high school
graduates or incoming college students in China lack “information consciousness” (page.10) or
awareness of the types of information and access points to information. Xiaomu et al. (2008) do
not provide a definition for information consciousness in their article. Instead, the concept is
attributed to a standard with performance indicators. The standard for information consciousness
describes an information literate student as one who “knows the importance and effect of the
information and information literacy” (p.10). Some performance indicators that information
conscious students would demonstrate according to Xiaomu et al. (2008) include: identifying
information, the effects of information on life and study, knowing that “gaining information is
one of the important solutions to problems” (p.11). For the work of Xiaomu et al. (2008), it can
be implied that addressing IL in China would entail participation of Chinese educators beyond
the library.
The absence of a formalized definition of information literacy within a Chinese context
may also create difficulty for educators seeking to detect, measure, and develop their own skills
and abilities. This issue was addressed in the article “On information literacy for the University
foreign language teachers in China” (Zhang, 2012). The author, Zhang, addresses the topic of IL
from a Language teacher’s perspective and states that although IL has been addressed to

21

undergraduate students in China, “integration of information literacy into teacher preparation and
development has not occurred for most universities in China” (Zhang, 2012, p.2146).
Zhang primarily uses IL to describe information retrieval skills and shares an anecdotal
perspective on what types of IL skills are needed based upon personal reflections on IL literature
in a Western context, citing Paul Zurowski (1974), Carol Kulthau (1987), and Christine Bruce
(2002). Among the skills needed, Zhang mostly concentrates on skills related to information
retrieval, assessment and selection of information for a specific need, and processing or
interpreting information. From the author’s perspective, it appears that the issue of IL for
educators in the area of Language teaching is a critical one, and that there is much room for the
development of this concept, and the construction of competencies and methods of teaching and
learning these competencies in China.
Other implications for a lack of formalized definitions and standards for IL within a
Chinese context relate to methods of teaching IL. In Sun, Liu, and Cui’s (2013) article “The
Design and Implementation of Library’s User Training System Based on Moodle,” the absences
of uniformity in the definition of IL can be seen in the scope of activities described under the
umbrella of IL. Sun’s et.al. (2013) article mainly concentrates on the logistics of using a course
management software, Moodle, for the purpose of training Chinese medical students to use
academic medical library resources in China. The authors did not discuss or explain how, or
why, the content of the course was included, used to measure any specific skills or learning
objectives, or discuss how the course content supported the development of IL. Rather, the
discussion of IL was glossed over by briefly describing the content of the course by listing topics
and using the abbreviation of “etc.” (Cui, 2013, p.302) after each list, operating under the
assumption that the reader would understand what elements would fall within the listed

22

categories. This inadvertently presents a message of acceptance of marginalizing the importance
of defining and articulating IL.
There is still much room for the development of the concept of IL within a Chinese
higher-education context. Before one can compare IL in China to that of the United States, a
clear and consistent formalized definition is needed among Chinese librarians and researchers.
Otherwise, comparisons will not be valid as the same constructs will not be measured.
Additionally, IL within a Chinese higher-education context should reflect the needs, skills, and
environment of Chinese society, as IL is dependent upon the information environment that
students must navigate to become information literate within their own society. What this might
entail is uncertain, as it is culturally dependent and should come from Chinese values for
knowledge, access, and authority of information.

2.4

INFORMATION-SEEKING BEHAVIOR STUDIES

Librarians have sought to gain a deeper sense of international students’ and LEP users’ library
usage by investigating their information-seeking behavior (ISB). Currently, few substantial
research studies have captured the ISB of these populations. Rather, greater attention is given to
evaluating the librarian’s perspective of the user’s behavior without inquiring into the user’s
perspective.
A person’s information-seeking behavior might include intermediaries to information that
assist with identifying and accessing information. These mediators have been referred to as
gatekeepers. Literature presents gatekeepers as “agents of acculturation” (Liu, 1995a, p. 243)
able to “disseminate information within their ethnic communities” (Liu, 1995a, p. 243). ISB
23

literature related to international students, LEPs, and minority groups in libraries mention
gatekeepers as intermediaries (Lui, 1995a; Lui, 1995b; Lui & Redfern, 1997; Pyati, 2003). In this
role as agents of acculturation, the concept of gatekeepers was supported in Ajit Pyati’s (2003)
article, “Limited English Proficient Users and the Need for Improved Reference Services.” Pyati
(2003) uses Liu’s (1995a) definition of gatekeepers to claim that they can help identify unique
ISB of LEP communities, which can be used to design “better library services” (Pyati, 2003, p.
267).
Pyati (2003) cites two cases in which a member of a cultural group served as an agent of
acculturation. These members facilitated access to services related to health and education
through public libraries in Santa Ana, California to Asian LEP users, and Latino immigrant
laborers. Payati (2003) took an observational approach to identify gatekeepers within the library
literature but did not investigate how the users viewed the role of the gatekeeper in facilitating
their access. Capturing the users’ viewpoint would help libraries understand the extent of their
role in the ISB process. The development of the existence, permanence, and long-term relevance
of gatekeepers would be an added value to librarians interested in working with communities that
many not have prominent gatekeepers or ones that are not easily identifiable. Without
investigating specific user needs that interplay between behavior and external social and
environmental factors, one cannot assume the influence of gatekeepers.
A common method utilized in the study of ISB of international students has been
quantitative comparison survey studies between United States and international students. Studies
such as Yan Liao, Mary Finn, and Jun Lu’s (2005) “Information-Seeking Behavior of
International Graduate Students vs. American Graduate Students: A User Study at Virginia
Tech” and Yoo-Seong Song’s (2005) “A comparative study on information-seeking behaviors of

24

domestic and international business students,” from the University of Illinois at UrbanaChampaign, did not appear to provide readers with a fair comparison of ISB between student
groups, primarily because the structured surveys grouped "international" students together and
did not control for culturally specific variables that might assist in understanding the context in
which these students might approach seeking or searching for information. Furthermore, the
surveys focused on asking students questions related only to the library and library instruction
and did not include a way to capture other sources of information utilized that might be related.
Within the literature reviewed, there was a pattern of librarians' preferences toward the
importance of the role of the library in the studies of international students, without considering
what other sources of information students seek out in meeting their information needs. Aman
Salem Abdullah's (2000) dissertation, "Factors Affecting International Students Use of the
Online Catalog and Other Information Sources," is a good example of a survey study that
focused on how well students retrieved information without considering if the information
sought or the resources used did in fact meet their needs or were relevant.
The same theme of Abdullah's (2000) dissertation can also be found in Paulinus C.
Iheanacho’s (2008) dissertation “A Plan for Making the University of Delaware’s Morris Library
More Accessible to Students from Developing Countries.” Iheanacho (2008) provides an
example of the value of including a qualitative approach. This mixed method (survey &
interview) study sought to investigate the ISB of international students related to the resources
(services, collections, research tools, etc.) available to them at the University of Delaware’s
Morris Library. In the case of this study, the survey was found to be unreliable due to the low
response rate (Iheanacho, 2008, p.71); thus, the major finding from this study was the interview
data.

25

Iheanacho (2008) conducted brief (20 minute) interviews with 19 international students
and 5 library staff members. In these interviews with students, participants expressed difficulty
in communicating needs to staff members due to perceived biases against their non-American
status (Iheanacho, 2008, p. 51). In the interviews with staff members, concern over how to best
serve international students was expressed, along with a lack of cultural training (Iheanacho,
2008, p. 94). The interview data provided a basis for an area of improvement for University of
Delaware’s Morris Library, and identified contributing factors behind the conflict between staff
and students.
From a methodological perspective, a review of the library literature on the ISB of
international students indicates that most studies utilized surveys and statistical analyses. This
approach may inhibit theory creation, as these studies only tested a set of predetermined
variables that were based on librarians' experiences, not student experiences. As well, studies
that. As well, studies that utilized surveys made comparisons between international students and
domestic students and overlooked distinctions between variables of nationalities and native
languages, which would provide a richer context for comparison.
None of the above research precisely addresses behavior but rather, familiarity of, and
with, library resources and services. This research tends to focus on information behavior of
international students relating to their information-seeking and searching behaviors within a
library context (i.e., resources, services, instruction, etc.). The limitations of survey research,
utilizing descriptive statistics, are that it fails to explain the reasoning behind the behavior and
therefore lacks “insights of value for the development of theory or … practice” (Wilson, 1999, p.
250).

26

The literature indicates supports for the idea of gatekeepers as facilitators in the access to
information (Lui, 1995a, 1995b; Pyati, 2003); however, further investigation needs to be
conducted to explain the relationship between gatekeepers and the information behavior of
international students. Quantitative methods have been used to study the “number of visits to
libraries, to the number of personal subscriptions to journals and the number of items cited in
papers” (Wilson, 1999, p. 250); however, this does not support the development of a grounded
theory, which may be derived from the lived experiences of the information seeker. The
literature analysis supports the need to investigate international student information behavior
qualitatively (Lafon, 1992; Battle, 2004; Iheanacho, 2008).

METHODOLOGY

The purpose of this chapter is to present the methodology utilized to investigate the research
question for this study. It is organized in six sections. It begins with section 3.1, a general
discussion of the sense-making methodology. Section 3.2, describes the study participants and
their demographic information. Section 3.3 presents the data collection instruments. Section 3.4
presents the data analysis process. Section 3.5 exams the trustworthiness of the study. And
section 3.6 addresses the limitations of this study.

3.1

SENSE-MAKING METHODOLOGY

The Sense-Making Method (SMM) was chosen as the method for this study because it supports
the study’s theoretical framework and was designed specifically to accommodate the
identification of hegemony within a situation through reflection. Dervin began working on sensemaking in 1972 and has since then, developed her work into a communication theory and method
to study communication from "a more communicative (dialogic) perspective"(Foreman-Wernet,
2003, p.3). This perspective is supported by focusing on the " 'hows' of communication ...that
contributed to understanding not only current communication practices but also the potentials for
intervention and change-for improving-those practices in the future"(Foreman-Wernet,2003,
p.5).
28

The Sense-Making Method (SMM), developed by Brenda Dervin, utilizes the “behavior,
both internal (i.e., cognitive) and external (i.e., procedural)" (Dervin, 1983, p. 3) of an actor
(participant/person) to understand how the individual "construct(s) and design his/her movement
through time-space” to solve a problem (Dervin, 1983, p. 3). This study utilized Dervin’s (1983,
2008) SMM and Time-Line Interview as they seek to address the lack of LIS research on
international student information-seeking behavior in support of their higher-education
experience in the United States. SMM creates an environment of self-reflection in which each
participant is able to “name his or her own world” (Foreman-Wernet, 2003, p. 8), with the
analysis placed on the actions (verbs) of the respondent.
SMM (2008) is depicted metaphorically as a journey along a road in Figure 1. The main
steps in the SMM metaphor are: Situation, Gap, Bridge, and Outcome. The Situation is the cause
for the need of information. The Gap is the question or muddle that the actor seeks to address or
answer. The Bridge is the solution composed of various helps or sources that allows the actor to
overcome his/her problem. The Outcome is the result; it can be an answer/solution or another
Gap/ problem.
The “squiggly” drawn diagram depicts the actor traveling through time and space on a
“gappy” [sic] road. S/he holds an umbrella overhead that contains all of the contexts of
understanding that come from hegemony or previous knowledge. The “squiggly” lines represent
the constant flux of life that is in constant movement. Dervin (2008) makes the assumption that
we all carry hegemony with us, regardless of where we are in life. This context influences our
information-seeking behavior through our perception and approach to solving problems.

Reproduced from: “Interviewing as dialectical practice: Sense-Making methodology as exemplar,” by Dervin, B.,
2008, Paper presented at the 26th-annual meeting of the International Association for Media and Communication
Research (IAMCR). Reprinted with permission.

The Gaps in the journey reinforce that, between all of the concepts within SMM, there
exists “the possibility of incompleteness” (Dervin, 2008). This incompleteness results in the
repetition of the process of sense-making or unmaking. The unmaking of “sense” can occur
within the sense-making metaphor when hegemony that restricts understanding or behavior is
overcome by the actor. By overcoming hegemony, the actor is freed to approach or view the
“problem” in another context that can prove to be a solution to the situation.
30

As mentioned in section 2.5, Sense-Making Method (SMM) utilizes the “behavior, both
internal (i.e., cognitive) and external (i.e., procedural)" (Dervin, 1983, p.3) of an actor
(participant/person) to understand how the individual "construct(s) and design his/her movement
through time-space” (Dervin, 1983, p.3) to solve a problem.

This method is utilized in

conjunction with the “Micro-Moment Time-Line Interview” developed by Brenda Dervin
(1983). This interview allows participants to create a timeline of events to describe an incident.
The progression of a timeline allows the researcher to see each of the steps taken by the
participant to complete a task, offering insight into his/her information-seeking behavior. The
method was also chosen as it integrates critical pedagogical practices that require participants to
create the description of the problem, rather than having the researcher impose a description.
To gain a better representation and understanding of international students’ informationseeking behavior, variables need to come from the participants, not the researcher. Interviews
addressed this requirement by collecting data through in-depth discussions between the
researcher and participants. Utilizing Dervin’s (2008) SMM can help improve information
services and resources by identifying why resources or services might be utilized or ignored
(Dervin & Zweizig, 1977).
Interviews are considered “a cornerstone in qualitative research” (Gorman & Clayton,
2005, p.41). Interviews provide researchers with an interactive opportunity to build contextual
links between research questions, and data, through dialogical exchange (Gorman & Clayton,
2005, p.41). The Time-Line Interview Method can provide a deeper understanding of how
situations or problems are solved/resolved and how or why choices are made (Dervin, 2008).
Because of the advantages of qualitative interviews, this method of data collection was utilized

31

in this study and aligned with the methodology of the SMM through the Time-Line Interview
method approach.

3.1.1

Sense-making Studies

Researchers have used SMM to investigate the problems of diverse populations of varied sample
sizes, diverse ethnic cultures, and unique contexts. The results of these studies have extended the
usage and interpretation of Dervin’s work. In Valerie Smith’s (2008) dissertation, the decision to
use gender (women) and culture (Afghani) as variables to investigate participants’ informationseeking behaviors exemplifies SMM’s adaptability to capture diverse constructs. The study was
situated on the premise that Afghani culture places restrictions on women’s interactions with the
world by having them passively seek assistance through men. However, the Afghani refugees in
the study were women living in the United States without men and therefore, were responsible
for their own solutions for survival.
Methodologically, Smith (2008) identified a limitation in utilizing SMM in relation to
non-Western people:
Effectively implementing the Sense-Making Methodology with people from non-Western
backgrounds required adapting the assumptions of sense-making that individuals want to
control their environment and that they ask questions to do so. If people, whether
Western or non-Western, have not been authorized to be assertive or if they hold other
values as more important, such as group harmony, this information seeking approach may
not come naturally to them (Smith, 2008, p. 307).

Smith’s (2008) assumption specifically taps into the possibility of value systems (cultural
and religion) influencing people’s approach to solving problems in their lives. However, this
assumes that people are in systems (such as governing and culture) that are contrary to their own
personal value systems.
Howard Rodriguez-Mori’s (2009) study on the information behavior of Puerto Rican
migrants focused on capturing the assimilation process. Participants in the study were not
immigrants or refugees (such as in the case of Smith’s (2008) study) but rather migrants coming
from Puerto Rico to the mainland of the United States for the first time to live. Using a form of
Dervin’s Micro-Moment Time-Line Interview Method, Rodriguez-Mori (2009) conducted
interviews in Spanish. Rodriguez-Mori’s (2009) study focused on the process of migration in an
assimilation context. Though assimilation is not clearly defined in his study, it appears to be used
as a synonym for acclimation to an environment, as shown by this finding of the study:
[P]articipants’ accounts, after they settled in the new community there was a time when
they eventually took off on their own, either by driving or walking around, to explore the
area ... Having experienced the migration process myself, in retrospect I had partly come
to expect all of the other information behaviors found in this study. However, this sensemaking/information seeking behavior arose unexpectedly out of the data as an agreeable
surprise; I had in fact done the very same thing many years ago, but I had forgotten about
it. I conclude that this sense-making strategy/information pattern is a regular occurrence
in the assimilation process (Rodriguez-Mori, 2009, p. 77).
The description of the phenomena (assimilation process) investigated in this study is similar to
Smith’s (2008) study, in that, the process of learning to live in a new cultural environment is
used to detect information behavior.
33

Methodologically, Smith’s (2008) and Rodriguez-Mori’s (2009) studies raise some
questions regarding methodological and procedural methods used in interviewing participants
who do not have fluency in the language of their country of residence. In the case of Smith
(2008), an interpreter interviewed a refugee (Afghani) population, while in Rodriguez-Mori’s
study (2009) the shared native language (Spanish) of the researcher and participants was used
during interviews. The semantics of language in the data collection process of qualitative sensemaking interviews has not been adequately addressed, and as a result, further investigation into
the influence of language on data collection is needed.
Laura Brendon’s (2003) sense-making study on the information-seeking behavior of
women uses gender as the unit of analysis and utilizes feminist theories in her treatment of
variables, such as race, ethnic culture, or linguistic perspective. Brendon (2003) cites feminist
theorist Donna Haraway when deciding to focus on gender as a unit of analysis. Brendon (2003)
found that participants constructed perspectives toward understanding life based upon such
personal characteristics as educational attainment, native language, socio-economic status, and
marital status (p.118). She (2003) concludes that “further studies would benefit from working
with participants who were more similar” (p. 118), suggesting a perspective beyond gender.
Referencing Brendon’s (2003) investigation into the information behavior of women as an
example of a sense-making study provides support for the idea that participants should be
grouped based upon very specific characteristics. This approach should result in a study that
identifies the information behavior of specific populations.
Smith’s (2008) argument to the question of whether culture or gender influences the use
of the SMM is contrasted by the example of Daniel Roland’s (2008) dissertation, “Interpreting
Scripture in Contemporary Times: A Study of a Clergy Member's Sense-Making Behavior in

34

Preparing the Sunday Sermon.” The only participant in this study was a Caucasian, middle-aged
American male Lutheran minister from the Midwest.
Roland (2008) makes no mention of how the race or ethnic culture of the Study’s
informant related to limitations. However, he does state that:
Additional research may help to identify different and/or additional contextual factors for
clergy members of other denominations and backgrounds that affect the verbing process
in sermon preparation. The obvious contextual differences with the informant of the
current research project would be education and theological position, but other contextual
considerations include gender, age, and years of experience (Roland, 2008, p. 113).
Roland (2008) did not identify race or ethnic culture as variables in his investigation. However,
his reasoning could have resulted from the participant self-identifying with the German heritage
of the Lutheran Church (p. 227). Therefore, no issues of conflict between SMM and the
participant’s approach to solving problems were detectable. This study agrees with Smith’s
(2008) argument that a direct application of SMM within a Western cultural context is
conducive.
SMM, has been used to facilitate the detection of people’s information behavior in which
has allowed researchers to have a deeper understanding of how people use and do not use
information. The studies discussed in this section highlight a number of areas requiring further
investigation in relation to information-behavior as well as the use of Dervin’s SMM. Further
investigation is needed into new applications of SMM to study the information-behavior of
specific cultural groups beyond a Western cultural context. Additionally, further investigation
into qualitative interview methods with participant populations that do not share the same

35

language as the investigator, or the language that the research study is being conducted, in would
further the development of qualitative interview methods.

3.2

PARTICIPANTS

At the University of Pittsburgh, students from China represent the largest population of
international students (University of Pittsburgh, 2011). A total of 975 Chinese international
students enrolled at the University of Pittsburgh in 2011, representing nearly 42% of the total
international student enrollment. Within the University of Pittsburgh’s School of Information
Sciences, students from China also make up the largest international student population with a
majority enrolled in Master-level programs: Master of Library Information and Science (MLIS),
Master of Information Science & Technology (MSIS), and Master of Telecommunications &
Networking (MST).
The participant population for the study consisted of a sample of 20 Chinese international
graduate students from the PRC who enrolled in either the Summer or Fall 2011 semesters in one
of the three Master-level degree programs at the School of Information Sciences. Convenience
sampling was utilized in this study as the participants in this study attended the same school as
the researcher. Previous SMM studies have had a participant population as small as 1 (Roland,
2008) and as large as 990 (Just, 2008). This study sought 20 participants to meet data saturation.
Eight of the participants had just begun their studies and had only been attending classes
for a few weeks. These factors may have possibly contributed to six participants responding that
they had not yet experienced an information problem related to their graduate studies. As a

36

result, the fourteen participants’ responses were utilized for the analysis of participants’
experiences as graduate students in the United States.
Participant recruitment was conducted through the University of Pittsburgh, School of
Information Sciences listserves (e-mail communication), public notices (recruitment flyers)
posted throughout the School of Information Sciences building, and word of mouth. A paid
incentive of $9.00 per hour encouraged students to participate. Funding was provided by the
University of Pittsburgh’s School of Information Sciences.
The data collection occurred during the Summer and Fall 2011 semesters, as a result of
this the participant population was in flux, with new students arriving, and previously enrolled
students completing degrees and preparing for graduation. Furthermore, participants’ residency
in the country ranged from less than a month to nearly two years. During the Summer 2011
semester, there were nine viable participants, there were 36 potential participants in the Fall
2011. Table 1 shows the distribution of the participant populations’ enrollment among the
Master-level programs at the School of Information Sciences during both of the semesters. The
Fall 2011 enrollment does not reflect whether students were new or continuing; therefore, an
exact viable participant population could be calculated without accessing restricted university
enrollment data.

DATA COLLECTION

Dervin’s (2008) SMM and Micro-Moment Time-Line Interview Method approach guided the
data collection of this study. The study captured 20 semi-structured interviews utilizing openended neutral questions derived from Dervin’s (2008) model referred to as SMM questions or
SMM-questioning. Questions probed for each of the stages of Dervin’s timeline (Situation, Gap,
Bridge, and Outcome) and are listed in Table 3.

40

Table 3. Sense-Making Method questioning

Reprinted from: “Interviewing as Dialectical Practice: Sense-Making Methodology as Exemplar,” by Dervin, B.,
2008, Paper presented at the 26th-annual meeting of the International Association for Media and Communication
Research (IAMCR). Reprinted with permission.

By referencing Dervin’s SMM (2008) questions, which are structured to lead the
participant through the Sense-Making metaphor, individual responses are encouraged and
anecdotal assumptions avoided. Questions for the semi-structured interviews are divided into two
sections and seek information addressing students’ information-seeking behavior related to their
higher-education learning in general, not exclusive to library material or services. The first half
41

of the questions probed students for information-seeking behavior learned before coming to the
United States to study; the second half probed for information-seeking behavior learned after
coming to the United States A two-part question design offers a way to compare practices for
seeking information, and helps identify the previously learned habits or experiences that might
influence current thinking or process. Interviews were recorded in both digital and analog
formats to ensure the capture of data.
Follow-up questions for the primary situation questions were borrowed from and are
modeled after Dervin’s (1983, 2008) SMM questions listed in Table 3. Examples of follow-up
questions are listed below in Table 4.

To aid in the data collection process, a native Mandarin-speaking interpreter assisted with
any culturally dependent information. The interpreter also helped participants during instances
where they might be unable to convey meaning from Mandarin Chinese into English.
Furthermore, utilizing an interpreter who was a member of the study’s participating cultural
42

group supported cultural competence within the interview protocol. Guidance on the use of an
interpreter to achieve cultural competence was gathered through a review of literature from the
fields of social work and nursing (Watkins-Mathys, 2006; Shu,E., Kagan, S. & Strumpf,N.,
2009).
Interviews were conducted at the University of Pittsburgh School of Information
Sciences building during July and September 2011. The researcher applied several techniques to
ensure participant comfort and understanding. Showing participants their assigned code names,
which would be used in place of actual names, assured confidentiality while allowing them to
review interview questions ahead of time, and sought to quell uneasiness. Additional techniques
included providing participants an explanation of the study, both in electronic and analog
formats, before the interview. Following proper interview protocol, participants were also
notified in advance that the interview would be recorded, and notes taken (Clayton & Gorman,
2006, p.194). The recording included participants stating their consent to participate in the study,
after reading the Participant Consent statement.
In this current study, translation of the interview tool was not considered. Participants in
the proposed study are required to have a certain command of the English language as the
University of Pittsburgh’s School of Information Sciences requires a minimum Test of English
as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) score of “550 (paper-based), 213 (computer-based) or 80
(Internet-based)” (University of Pittsburgh, 2010). Possible detection of challenges in language
cognition may support previous studies that advocate for language services for international
student populations (Lopez, 1983; Liestman & Wu, 1990; Huls et al., 1994; Chau, 2003;
Morrissey & Given, 2006).

43

3.3.1

Cross-Cultural Interview Protocols

Cultural awareness of ethnic minorities, and the migration of people, have been noted as
contributing factors in the increase of cross-cultural research internationally (Wallin & Ahlstrom,
2006). Cross-cultural research involves research between different cultures.

Successfully

conducting cross-cultural research involves the integration of cultural competence, which is best
defined as:
"a complex integration of knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, skills and encounters with those from
cultures different from one's own that enhance communication, and appropriates an effective
interaction with others"( Andrews, 2008, p.16; Jones,2011, p109).
Taking the above definition one step further, Shu et.al (2009), states that cultural competence is
comprised of “cultural knowledge, cultural desire, cultural skills and cultural encounters." (p.
194). One of the many ways that researchers have supported cultural competence within
interview protocol has been the inclusion of interpreters and translators who are members of the
participating cultural group. In cross-cultural research, designing survey instruments that will
collect valid data involves consideration of the extent of the usage of the tool to study culture
(Pareek & Rao, 1980).

3.3.2

Procedures: Recruiting an Interpreter

The decision to utilize an interpreter as an element of a culturally inclusive research
methodology for an interview study involved more challenges than had been identified in the
literature reviewed by the researcher. Hiring and selecting an interpreter from among the Chinese
student population involved a number of legal and logistical challenges. International/ foreign
44

students in the United States of America are classified under F-1 visa status. The restrictions on
the type of work that students with an F-1 visa can accept is restricted to employment only
through a university or college, and for no more than 20 hours a week (US Citizenship and
Immigration Services , 2011). Due to the restriction of hours, students who are already employed
by a college/ department may not take on additional work.
Additional caveats were placed upon the researcher by the University, by limiting who
could be hired to serve as an interpreter. The researcher was granted funding by the University of
Pittsburgh School of Information Sciences with the restrictions that applicants had to be a
University of Pittsburgh student and have already worked for the University but not currently
employed at the University for 20 hours a week.
Once the qualifications of an interpreter had been established along with the employment
restrictions, University resources were sought for assistance in the recruitment of an interpreter.
The University of Pittsburgh Office of International Services (OIS) and the Confucius Center at
the University of Pittsburgh were the first agencies identified for assistance, but no candidates
were identified.
After nearly a month of advertisement with no viable candidates, the researcher turned to
advertising on the public classifieds through the website Craigslist. In less than a week, two
candidates were identified that qualified both culturally and logistically. This qualifying process
involved interviewing the candidate, and having the candidate participate in the Pilot study to
observe how they would interact with a participant.
The selected candidate was a Female graduate student in her mid-twenties from China.
The selected interpreter was chosen both for her educational background, cultural background,
and previous work as a medical physician in China. The researcher felt that since the interpreter

45

had a background in conducting patient consultations, this experience would transfer to the
interviews.

3.4

DATA ANALYSIS

This study used qualitative content analysis to discover themes and patterns in the informationseeking behavior of Chinese international graduate students. Content analysis is a research
method that analyzes the content of communication in the form of text (Busha & Harter, 1980).
Early examples of content analysis focused on a quantitative approach of counting words or
phrases within text and then classifying them into categories for the purpose of drawing
inferences of meaning (Weber, 1990). Focusing on the frequency of a word or phrase, rather than
the content and context of the communication when gathering data for analysis has been
identified as a concern for researchers. Concerns arise because the method does not factor in
non-explicit themes that might be related to the data, providing further understanding behind a
phenomenon (Weber, 1990).
To overcome the above limitation of content analysis, a qualitative form of this approach
was used. Qualitative content analysis focuses on the context and meaning of communication
versus frequency of words (Hsieh & Shannon, 2005). This goal is accomplished by identifying a
unit of analysis based upon themes rather than specific words or phrases (Zhang & Wildenuth,
2009).
The researcher selected a qualitative content analysis method utilizing deductive codes
from the SMM and theory to assist in the detection of the information-seeking behaviors of PRC
student participants. Although deductive content analysis can be used to test the application of an
46

existing theory in a new context (Elo & Kyngäs, 2008), this was not the purpose of choosing to
use the SMM instances as codes. Rather, detection of the participants’ information-seeking
behavior by using predetermined codes from Dervin’s (2008) SMM was sought to align the
methodological and theoretical structure of this study.
According to Elo and Kyngäs (2008), a categorization matrix can organize the deductive
codes to assist with the coding process. The units of analysis for this study are the SMM
instances taken from Dervin’s (2008) SMM metaphor. The codes have been aligned to the
questions in the interview tool, and the following categorization matrix was developed based on
SMM metaphor and is listed in Table 5.

“It’s just so-so… I still learned a lot from that assignment…the first thing was understanding of
the topic and I not understanding very clearly or deeply…I think to ask a librarian is a way to
understand this topic but everyone has their limitation”

According to Weber (1990), “there is no simple right way to do content analysis. Instead,
investigators must judge what methods are most appropriate for their substantive problems”
(p.13). To capture the information-seeking behavior of the participant population, this study was
designed to have alignment between the theory and methodological approach, which is why the
deductive codes correlate with the SMM.
Atlas.ti was utilized as the coding analysis software for this study. All transcripts were
loaded into the software as one hermeneutic unit and initially coded with the four sense-making
instances: situation, gap, bridge, and outcome. After this initial coding, the data was divided
further by categorizing the codes between instances that occurred in China and situations in the
United States. Situations related to experiences in China were denoted by the code China
education. This was assigned to instances of situation that related to education experiences in
China.
In further investigation of the situations, it appeared that some participants described their
information behavior (IB) generally while others were more specific in describing informationseeking behavior (ISB) situations. In addition, in the instances where participants specifically
described ISB situations, a patterned appeared where situations described three main tasks:
writing assignments, programming assignment, and student life situations.
In order to better visualize this division among the data, a table was created denoting the
types of information problems experience by the participant. Table 6 outlines the categorization

49

of the data. Four codes were created to describe the participants’ responses for both situations
related to their studies as undergraduates in China, and as graduate students in the United States.
These situations should be viewed through an academic lens as they reflect participants’ tasks
and assignments in which an information need/problem was associated with it. The code of None
described participants not providing a specific information problem. The code of IB was assigned
to situations where participants spoke generally about their information-behavior that related to
their academic studies, without identifying a specific incident. The code of Programming was
assigned to situations where the participant specifically shared an information-seeking situation
related to an assignment that involved computer programming. Lastly, the code Writing was
assigned to an information-seeking situation related to an assignment that was focused on
completing a written assignment.

Participant responses that were assigned the codes of None and IB were excluded from
the analysis as they do not address specifically information-seeking situations. The remaining
responses were then divided into three main tasks types (programming, writing, and student life),
loaded into three separate hermeneutic units, and re-coded again for the sense-making instances.
The results of the codes associated with the sense-making instances were printed out and hand
coded for patterns based on the activities, and lastly, grouped together for the results. The
timeline for this process is outlined in Table 7, shown below.

TRUSTWORTHINESS

Qualitative content analysis has been categorized within a naturalistic paradigm (Lincoln &
Guba, 1985; Bradley, 1993; Zhang & Wildemuth, 2009), which seeks “to describe and
understand human behavior as it occurs in its natural contexts” (Owne, 2008, p.548). This type
of analysis is the opposite of a positivist paradigm, which is associated with quantitative research
that takes an experimental approach to assess the nature of reality (Owne, 2008; Bradley, 1993;
Zhang & Wildemuth, 2009). Naturalist inquiry stems from a naturalistic paradigm and “focuses
research endeavors on how people behave in natural settings while engaging in life experiences”
(Owen, 2008, p.548). Multiple realities that are socially constructed are a central value to
naturalistic inquiry (Owne, 2008).
Research methods that fall within a naturalistic paradigm seek to capture an
understanding of human behavior that is innately subjective, and thus, methods used to ensure
“validity, reliability, and objectivity would not apply as they do in a positivist research
paradigm” (Given & Saumure, 2008, p.896). Rather, in evaluating qualitative content analysis
research, one can find guidance through trustworthiness. A number of researchers (Bradley,
1993; Zhang & Wildenuth, 2009) have cited Lincoln and Guba’s (1985) book, Naturalistic
Inquiry, as a source of guidance when outlining methods to aid in trustworthiness for qualitative
content analysis. Trustworthiness can be described as “the ways in which qualitative researchers
ensure that transferability, credibility, dependability, and confirmability [sic] are evident in their
research” (Given & Saumure, 2008, p.896).
Transferability refers to how a researcher’s data and description of a study can be utilized
by another researcher to formulize hypotheses and apply the information to a new context. This
step in trustworthiness is not the responsibility of the researcher, but of the person developing
53

hypotheses from the study, and testing those hypotheses within a new context (Bradley,1993).
This study supports trustworthiness by providing ample description and direct quotes from
interview participants.
According to Lincoln and Guba (1985), dependability and credibility are dependent upon
each other. While credibility in a study describes the “adequate representation of the
constructions of the social world under study,” (Bradley, 1993, p.436) and may include
prolonged engagement, persistent observation, triangulation, member checks, referential
adequacy, negative case analysis, and peer debriefing (Lincoln & Guba, 1985), dependability in
a study refers “to the coherence of the internal process” (Bradley, 1993, p.437). Therefore, if
credibility can be demonstrated, it is sufficient in demonstrating dependability (p.316). This
study sought to support credibility and dependability by using “members of the community
under study” (Bradley, 1993, p.436) to verify the collected data. During the transcription process,
three translators were utilized to ensure that applicable portions of the interviews were properly
translated into English from Mandarin. This process involved having two Mandarin speakers
transcribe while a third Mandarin speaker verified the transcriptions and assisted with cultural
context.
Lastly, confirmability refers “to the extent to which the characteristics of the data, as
posited by the researcher, can be confirmed by others who read or review the research result”
(Bradley, 1993, p.437). Confirmability can be met through an audit of a researcher’s process and
findings (Zhang & Wildemuth, 2009). For this study, confirmability was supported by having all
interviews transcribed, and by keeping a log of notes and observations during the coding process
to assist in the analysis process.

LIMITATIONS

This case study, with its contextually specific participant population may not be generalizable to
the experiences of all Chinese international students living and studying in the United States.
This study did not seek to be generalizable, in order to identify genuine, unique examples of real
situations and problems that international students experience while seeking to complete
graduate studies in the United States. By capturing these unique experiences, this study attempts
to contribute to the body of knowledge about international students’ information needs, seeking,
and use.

RESULTS

This study focuses on the information-seeking behavior (ISB) of graduate international students
from China within a United States higher education context. Elements of this context include the
academic environment and its associated helps and resources that support student learning. For
this reason, the analysis includes two sections related to participants’ behavior and opinions
towards three Library Information Science topics; libraries and librarians, and information
literacy (IL). These sections are contextualized with data collected from participants’ experiences
as undergraduates in China. Section 4.1 provides insight to participants’ opinions towards
libraries and librarians while studying in China. Section 4.2 addresses the detection of IL
standards in participants’ behavior as undergraduates in China.
The primary research question that guides this study is: How do international graduate
students from China make sense of the information they need in support of their intercultural
learning experience? The evaluation of data, grounded by this question, was framed by four key
concepts from Brenda Dervin’s (2008) Sense-Making Method (SMM) and metaphor, specifically
situation, gaps, bridges, and outcomes. Within each of these conceptual categories, three broad
themes related to Chinese international graduate students’ information-seeking tendencies were
identified.
Dervin’s (2008) sense-making is a research theory and method that draws upon a
person’s (actor) internal and external behavior as it relates to a past experience with an
56

information problem. Constructing how a person might have been able to make sense of his/her
information problem, the sense-making, relies on the identification of the sense-making
instances: situation, gap, bridge, and outcome. Utilizing the sense-making instances as a
framework, it may be possible to develop an understanding of how a person progressed through
his/her information problem, and made sense of the resources used.
As noted in the Methodology section (section 3.4), the Study’s interview instrument was
derived from Dervin’s (2008) model of neutral open-ended questions. This instrument allows the
interviewer to tap into, and capture, the sense-making instances. The Results section presents the
sense-making process of the study participants by operationalizing the instances as deductive
codes. In order to provide an authentic representation of the participants’ thoughts, ideas,
opinions, and feelings, the results have been presented in their own words. The English of the
participants’ is that of an English language learner and does not reflect the written English of the
students nor their academic performance. The analysis of the data within the framework of
sense-making is divided by participants' ISB experiences in China as undergraduates, prior to
studying in the United States, and then experiences as Graduate students in the United States.
Section 4.3 is the analysis of participants’ ISB as undergraduates in China. Sections 4.4 through
4.6 provide an analysis of participants’ ISB in the United States as graduate students.

4.1

LIBRARIES & LIBRARIANS: CHINA

Bridges are comprised of sources of helps. Within an academic context, libraries and librarians
can serve as sources of help for students when seeking information for their studies. In relation to
participants’ experiences in seeking information in China, the role of libraries and librarians
57

fulfilled varied roles in helping them to mediate their information problems. Participants
described using their undergraduate library for information resources (books and databases). As
one student said, “I went to the library to borrow some books for the basic programming” while
another mentioned using a proprietary database, “… I searched the foreign database…first is
from the school library [sic] has some bought from some foreigners”. These two participants
described seeking and finding information resources from their undergraduate library in support
of their studies, but this was not the case for all participants.
Relevancy and accessibility of a library were issues that two other participants
raised when describing their undergraduate libraries in China. One participant described this
problem:
“You, know my undergrad, the university has two campus and the one I studied in was
far from the City. So the library facilities was not complete and it was a little small.
Usually, me (sic) and my classmates would not borrow books. So when we wanted to
find information or reference we just print the textbooks or go to the bookstore.”
For this participant, location of their campus, and the size of their academic library,
seemed to prevent them from utilizing the space, collection, and services. However, this
participant was able to navigate over these barriers by turning to his/her textbooks and accessing
a bookstore.
Another participant also reported using a bookstore to access material for a course due to
the collection of his/her undergraduate library: “… we won’t buy that just read some chapters in
the bookstore…Because we can’t access the book in our library”. This participant, and the one
cited above, experienced barriers to using their academic library in China. For one, location and
size were cited as obstacle for access and support. For the second, scope or currency of the

58

collection of the library left the institution unable to support their information needs. However;
both participants identify bookstores as relevant sources and places to utilize to support their
academics. The role of a librarian in the academic learning process described by participants in
this study was similar to their reported views on libraries. For some participants, librarians were
relevant sources of assistance. As one participant said, “I just asked the librarian,” when they
needed assistance with locating a book or assessing the authority of a book. Another participant
described using the help of a librarian whom they identified as most authoritative:
“We could not find enough material and I tried to chat or email with the national
librarian…National librarian because at that time I know we can send email [sic] to ask
the national librarian and that was the most authorized people we can ask…They didn’t
give me many or reliable resources, just recommend me to search some database from
English [sic] or other countries.”
Although this was a government, not an academic librarian, it does demonstrate the
student’s opinion of an information provider in support of resolving an information need. The
idea of a librarian as a person who is educated and skilled in addressing information problems
was not held by all participants. Two participants described not seeking out the assistance of a
librarian during their undergraduate studies due to the perception that librarians in China are
untrained information professionals lacking specific subject knowledge:
“The library [sic], they are just doing the work for the library but don’t understand
what we really want…I think, I never, because I know they are not professional librarian
[sic]…Actually, I think a lot of Chinese librarians have the librarian they just give them
work as a job and they can find the work in the right place but I don’t think they have the
knowledge for the specific degree.”

59

This sentiment was also expressed by another participant who offered context of, and a
comparison of, his/her perceptions of differences between librarians and academic libraries in
China and the United States. The participant explained:
“I just think something like, in China, a librarian is not a good job. It has low salary and
the working [sic] is boring and not many people want to do that, it’s not noble work...I
know it cause [sic] my school (in China), the university has three departments. I am in
Information Systems and another department is Library and the third department is
Archive. Sometimes we will have courses together and I have friends in those
departments in my debating team and we will communicate about the future career of our
major. They told me that, and you can tell, the staff in the Science and Library (library
science) is not that professional…I can feel that basically they (University of Pittsburgh)
are much more professional than the librarians in other place. Guangzong is a city that
concentrates on its culture, but I still think I can’t get the help that I want. In today’s
library (University of Pittsburgh), you want to [sic] information on biology (you can ask
a librarian), ‘What books can you recommend?’ and you can get answers from Hillman
Library because there is a special staff who have a biology master [sic] or PhD to help
you. But in China, librarian [sic] just have a bachelor or master [sic] of library science, no
specialty.”
The perceptions and opinions shared above provide possible motivations and perceptions as to
why students from China may choose to overlook librarians as sources of informational support
in their studies.
Awareness of the role of a librarian was another theme that appeared in another two
participants’ response regarding their undergraduate experience in seeking help in searching for

60

information. For one participant they described librarians in China as non-accessible, (i.e., in
their offices) and therefore, not a visibly apparent help for finding information:
“But to ask a librarian, in China it’s a little weird, because we don’t have that kind of
librarian like reference librarian, that faces students. Maybe you need to come to an office
to ask this kind of question.”
The absence of a reference desk where a librarian could be easily approached for help
was identified as a barrier to asking for assistance by this participant. For another participant, a
lack of awareness of the role of a librarian in searching databases was expressed: “Our professor
advised us to search in CNKI…We just used some database to search…We didn’t know we can
ask the librarian.” These participants who described librarians as inaccessible, or an unknown
source for assistance, provide insights to their previous experiences.
These responses of participants’ understandings of libraries and librarians, drawn from
their undergraduate studies in China, provide a deep source of context. The experiences the
participants brought with them as international students studying in the United States provides
background to their information behavior as graduate students.

4.2

INFORMATION LITERACY: CHINA

As undergraduates in China, participants in this study expressed confidence in finding
needed information online using the Internet. The skills required in accessing and assessing
information in support of academic work has been associated with information retrieval skills.
Within a United States higher-education context, retrieval skills are often associated with
information literacy skills according to the Association of College and Research Libraries
61

(ACRL). Information literacy (IL), described as “the set of skills needed to find, retrieve,
analyze, and use information,” (ACRL, 2006, para 1) is a goal of library instruction as a way to
offer support skills for academic success and life-long learning. An information-literate student
should demonstrate five IL standards that cover topics, such as information retrieval, to the
ethical use of information. Three of the five standards were detected during participants’
descriptions of seeking information in support of their information problems. Standards two,
three, and five will be discussed in this chapter.

4.2.1

ACRL IL Standard Two

As noted in the literature review (Section 2.3), ACRL’s IL standards are not universal and they
are culturally contextual. ACRL’s (2000) IL Standard two states that: “The information literate
student accesses needed information effectively and efficiently” (p.9). This standard essentially
taps for performance indicators related to students’ searching behavior in both a physical and
digital environments. It also assumes that a student is functioning in an environment where
information is easily accessible.
Searching on the Internet for information was cited by 17 participants when sharing their
general information behavior related to their studies. Participants were asked how they came to
learn to use the Internet in searching for information. A summary of participants’ self-reporting
on their first introduction to searching the Internet is listed in Table 8.
Of the 17 participants, eight cited first using the Internet during their middle school
education, five during high school, three in college, and one in primary school. Formal
instruction on how to use the Internet for their studies during his/her college education was
described by only one participant, and it was presented as an information retrieval course. Other
62

participants described being taught how to search the Internet by parents, friends/classmates,
teachers, Internet bar employees, or not at all (self-taught). Of the participants who specified
using a search engine the first time they accessed the Internet, a majority listed Baidu and three
mentioned the use of Google. Below is a table that details participants’ responses to their first
Internet search.

The significance of this background information is that it provides insight into the accessibility
of the Internet in China. When describing searching behavior in an online environment, some
participants described using academic databases. One participant articulated their search method
in detail: “…we used topics search, quick search, advance search and this kind of search
63

techniques we were very familiar.” This participant’s response aligns with the second
performance indicator for this Standard; “The information literate student accesses needed
information effectively and efficiently” (ACRL, 2000, p.9). This participant shared her/his
experience of learning how to first use academic databases from a librarian, and receiving
assistance with searching from a professor.
When describing techniques to search on the Internet, some participants described using
keyword searching techniques, such as:
“If I wanted to find information on financial analysis or something like that, I just type in
the words and search for it.”
And,
“You know, in China, the search engine is popular among students because you can
search for free and in-putt the key words in the blank field and search.”
Participants did not describe using limiting or advance searching features during their use of
search engine.
When participants were asked which search engines they used, and why, the responses
varied. One participant described just using a particular search engine because it was
recommended by a classmate: “My classmate told me. I ask them how they think of that (code)
and then said you can search the Internet, Baidu, you can search some famous coding website.”
Two participants described in more detail that the choice of search engine was based upon the
language of the information being sought. One participant shared, “I can search more English
website on Google but, Baidu I can search Chinese”, and another:
“Depends, if the assignment was in English then I search in English and if Chinese, I
search in Chinese. In some situations, I use Baidu because Baidu is better in searching in

64

Chinese… Well, I just think that Baidu is a Chinese search engine and people say it’s
better for searching in Chinese.”
The relationship between the language of the information and choice of retrieval tool
(search engine) identified by these participants above describes a culturally dependent
relationship in that, utilizing language as a determinate in the selection of a search engine
supports the probability of retrieving information more effectively.
The responses provided by participants in reference to their searching behavior and
accessing information in an online environment suggests that some received instruction and
guidance to develop techniques that would qualify as a demonstration of ACRL IL competency.
However, actual assessment of Standard two to similar populations of college students from
China may want to consider inclusion of their pervious information environment, which may
shape how Chinese culture and language may influence searching techniques.

4.2.2

ACRL IL Standard Three

ACRL’s (2000) IL Standard three states that: “The information literate student evaluates
information and its sources critically and incorporates selected information into his or her
knowledge base and value system” (p.11). This standard was expressed by two participant who
described searching authoritative information as an undergraduate students in China. The first
participant described identifying core literature within their subject field:
“We have the ‘core’, I only read papers in core periodicals, and I know the famous
scientist in Information Science…You can do something like search the citation
index…Just scientific database in our library database…The core journals are listed by

65

certain universities…Peking University, Beijing University, and others…In any field
there will be three or four top scientist in a field.”
This cultural context for how information is ranked in China, based on its association with
universities that are better funded and supported by the Chinese government, was shared in
greater detail by another participant:
“I think because there is an organization to manage all the magazine (academic journal)
and they evaluate which magazine is the core literature…Yeah, and another evaluation
method is to look at the author and the author’s university or research center they belong
to. If this research center or university is a very high level, then I think we trust
better…Because high level university in China that means that the students and
professors have a higher scholarly level then the common level university. According to
my opinion that is a way to evaluate.”
The participant was asked how they learned this method of assessment and shared , “[F]rom
professor because our professor also recommend some information for us and I think it depends
on the course materials and I think most of the materials come from the high research center or
university.”
The participants described utilizing a culturally constructed method for evaluating
academic information. Participants shared evaluation of academic information by utilizing
government rankings of an academic institution and its associated publications. Participants
described seeking out “core literature” within a subject field, which was also tied to a ranking of
its associated university. These responses express a learned method of determining the authority
of information because of its place within a government ranking. Content and quality of a
publication was not a factor in the assessment technique shared. These findings suggest that the

66

influence of the organization of China’s higher education, and associated academic publications,
infer how students may assess the authority of information. Those seeking to detect Chinese
graduate students’ understanding of methods of assessing information might need to consider the
cultural context they bring with them in how they might perceive authority of information, and
possible assumptions towards the authority of academic rankings.

4.2.3

ACRL IL Standard Five

Standard five states, “The information literate student understands many of the economic,
legal, and social issues surrounding the use of information and accesses and uses information
ethically and legally.” Standard five specifically addresses the information behavior of an
individual as it relates to his/her observance of copyright compliance and academic integrity.
Copyright compliance and academic integrity, or plagiarism, has been cited as a possible
problem for Chinese academic researchers. In both Beijing and Shanghai, academic programs
have been closed (Centenary College, New Jersey) due to widespread plagiarism (Redden,
2010). These cases are only dwarfed by instances in which Chinese faculty and researchers were
found guilty of plagiarizing research in academic publications (Friedman, 2010).
In this study, nine instances were identified in which the concept of copyright appeared in
reference to participants’ understanding of academic integrity and avoidance of plagiarism
during their undergraduate studies. One participant shared how she/he became aware of
copyright infringement through news stories in China. He/she shared, “I think in the news and
the famous people they are doing the sentence. Because in the news we know that they used
other people’ writings and they are in the court. It happens a lot.” This response demonstrates

67

how notable incidents of copyright infringement and plagiarism in China are publicized, and that
students from China may have awareness of these issues.
Six participants reported learning about methods to avoid plagiarism from an
undergraduate instructor/professor in China:
“Yeah, don’t cheating [sic]. In the second year of undergrad, in a course where we had to
write reports. The professor said we had to have references and a bibliography don’t just
Google and copy everything…It’s a kind of stealing.”
Another participant described how a teacher in China explained to them explicitly how to insert
citations into their assignments:
“But my teacher explain [sic] that if you never write the reference it’s plagiarism. So if
you take the exact words of others, cite it. If you paraphrase it is OK, you can put the
author in the reference list.”
Other participants shared the following: “Yes, they tell you the format sometimes and tell you
what information should include [sic] in the paper and also recommend you to put in the
reference,” “I know how to write the reference from undergraduate studies, ‘Easy Bib’, it
generates the reference automatically,” “Yeah, for different resources there is different format,”
and “Yeah, he told us we can’t copy someone else…Because the article was written by other
person. It’s like property, so we can’t stole it [sic]”. In these six instances, participants described
receiving clear instructions during their undergraduate education on how to denote and assign
attribution of information resources used to complete an assignment.
Not all participants were able to clearly articulate how they came to learn to include
attributions to information utilized in support of their assignments as undergraduates in China.
One participant described how he/she identified the need to create a bibliography on their own:

68

“For the reference, I just figured it for myself; I just had a feeling to put it
somewhere…For the copyright issue that, I when I first writing [sic] my essay in the
bibliography. I just had a feel [sic] can’t just use all the resources as it was all mine.”
For another participant, she/he explained their process of including attribution on assignment, but
did not provide where they came to learn that references “should” be included in their written
assignments:
“Yeah, record with paragraph or sentence is cite and which book or journal or websites, I
should record it and put it on the bottom of the page. If it is a book, put it at the end of the
paper. Maybe some journals or websites put on the bottom of the page.”
These responses represent participant understanding of methods of adherence to
copyright and the treatment of intellectual property within an academic context. Their procedural
knowledge of the ways to avoid consequences associated with plagiarism and copyright
infringement within an academic setting may demonstrate detection in Chinese higher education
to address prior negative associations of plagiarism. Although not all participants were asked to
describe their understanding of, or exposure to, the concept of copyright and the avoidance of
plagiarism, it can be inferred from these examples that some participants had exposure to
methods for preventing unintended academic dishonesty during their undergraduate studies the
China.
From this data, it is not possible to determine whether participants understood the full
complexity of the ethical issues assumed with the usage of information within a United States
copyright context. However, the study did detect knowledge of practices for giving attribution to
copyrighted material and other types of intellectual property. This finding positively supports the
idea that Chinese students may have an awareness of the ethical and legal issues surrounding the

69

use of copyrighted information. Additional research on the degree of student understanding of
copyright, and the policies governing academic integrity among newly arriving PRC graduate
students, would help track the presence of this issue in relation to IL.
IL, and the ethical usage of copyrighted material within a United States context, is
presented in this section as a means of offering a discussion of participants’ attitudes towards
these constructs. These findings suggest that the participants in this study may not have had full
exposure to the methods or techniques necessary for the development of competencies related to
IL in a United States context. These findings may suggest that librarians and educators should
not make the assumption that international graduate students are fully equipped with the
necessary techniques to carry out academic tasks that require IL competencies.

4.3.1

UNDERGRADUATE INFORMATION-SEEKING: CHINA

Situations: China

The focus of this study is on participants’ experiences in seeking information as graduate
students in the United States. In order to understand the participants’ experiences as international
students studying in the United States, one has to also understand the cultural context they carry
with them as persons from China. This cultural context becomes visible when participants
express the differences between studying in the United States and growing up in China. By
identifying participant’s previous behaviors in seeking information as undergraduate students in
China, this will assist to identify similarities and differences in behavior as well as provide space

70

for identifying possible barriers or challenges that participants may face during their intercultural
learning experience in the United States.
Situation is the background information (history, past experiences, habits, etc.) that a
person holds that may influence his/her choices. The sense-making instances were utilized as a
framework to construct how participants made sense of their information problems as
undergraduates in China. To acquire information relating to their prior information seeking
experiences during their undergraduate educations in China, participants were asked the
following question: Can you please describe how you found information for an assignment while
you were a student in China? Of the 20 participants, 12 chose to share a specific information
problem related to their undergraduate studies in China. Participants that shared examples of
seeking information for an assignment concentrated on describing situations related to computer
programming tasks, written papers, and undergraduate theses.
Two examples provided by participants that described completing tasks related to
computer programming related primarily to assignments requiring the construction of a website
or a web application. One example related to computer programming included building a website
for an Ecommerce course:
“…it was a project for the course Ecommerce and we had to do a website related to a
database and we need to do it but most of us don’t have the experience and the professor
said that the course just teaches us the aspects.”
In another computer programming assignment example, a participant described learning a
specific type of programming language during the process of designing an application:
“…there is a big assignment…it was called ‘Transportation Use for Java Framework’.”

71

Participants also described situations in which they needed to seek information to
complete a final project during their last year of undergraduate study, or when they were
researching a final paper. Examples include “I was preparing for my thesis; for it was a big
assignment”, “[i]n my undergraduate time we need to write an essay this essay topic is Enterprise
2.0” and “[w]hen I did my final project in my last year, I worked on Google Maps”. These
examples provide glimpses into the range of situations that participants decided to share with the
researcher. Many of the participants were pursuing computer-based fields, of study, and thus,
described the process of finding information to solve computer programming assignments. These
included learning new software, creating a website or organization application, and writing a
paper, such as an undergraduate thesis.

4.3.2

Gaps: China

Participants described their information gaps when recalling specific assignments or tasks they
had difficulty completing as undergraduates in China. Some gaps were not attributed to a lack of
subject knowledge. In some cases, external forces, such as language and government restrictions,
and the limited availability of, or access to, the information they needed. Participants indicated
that they lacked the information needed to complete assignments that required knowledge of
computer programming design and their associated languages. To determine the nature of the
gaps, participants were asked: What were you trying to solve? How did you know you had a
need? And, how did you know what you were looking for?
Two participants recalled gaps caused by their lack of experience with computer
programing: “…it was a project for the course Ecommerce and we had to do a website related to
a database and we need to do it but most of us don’t have the experience,” and:
72

“…there is a big assignment… it was called ‘Transportation Use for Java Framework.’ It
was a new software for me and I tried to find on the Internet if there were some forums to
see if other people, what other people do.”
Participants spoke of completing their education in China; however, the subject matter of their
studies was within an international context. To this point, one participant described how
language created an information gap for an assignment, “In my undergraduate time we need to
write an essay. This essay topic is ‘Enterprise 2.0’ and that is the topic and it is very new and
[sic] can’t find a lot of materials in Chinese resources.” Another participant described an
information gap caused by the difficulty of retrieving information through an academic database:
“I need many papers to write and it much harder so I need to use it (academic database) more
skillful.”
The role of the Chinese government appeared in one participant’s description of a gap
created due to a lack of access to information online. “When I did my final project in my last
year, I worked on Google Maps. You know, a few people know Google Maps because it is
blocked in mainland China.” This participant was seeking information that was not legally
accessible, yet it did not prevent her/him from having awareness that the information existed, and
from seeking to gain access to the information.
Lacking subject knowledge created information gaps for some participants as
undergraduates in China. For others, the intersection of the need for new information along with
the interference to access information due to language (i.e. lack of available resources in
Chinese) and governmental policies (i.e. China’s Internet filtering policies), created information
gaps. The identification of these information gaps assists in providing a background to some of
the challenges that participants in this Study experienced as undergraduates in China.

73

4.3.3

Bridges & Outcomes: China

In this section, Bridges and Outcomes are presented together because a bridge can lead to an
outcome or another gap; presenting this relationship can assist with understanding the
connection. Uncovering information uses to bridge participants’ identified information gaps
required tapping into the ways in which participants found assistance with progressing through
their information problems.
The students interviewed mentioned using their personal networks of helps, such as
professors, family and friends, and online resources. The types of questions used to uncover the
bridges included: What assistance did you seek? What resources did you seek? And, what helped
you to answer your question? Participants described seeking assistance from professors and
advisors who provided resources, methods of searching, and additional directions for
assignments.
Participants described struggling to find help with their information problems.
Additionally, not all helps, or Bridges, resulted in satisfactory outcomes. As undergraduates in
China, participants primarily sought information to support their completion of assignments
related to computer programming, and the writing of reports. Gaps in information were
sometimes related to a lack of subject knowledge, but were also caused by the lack of access to
information due to barriers in the environment, such as limited access to English-language
resources, or blocked Internet sites (i.e., Google Maps). As a result, participants used friends and
family, as well as extended personal networks, to expand their access to information helps.
While the outcomes of the bridges resulted in the completion of assignments, participants noted
feelings ranging from contentment and success, to disappointment and regret.

74

For the participant seeking to complete an Ecommerce website, he/she shared seeking
assistances from the professor:
“We talked to the professor many times when it started and was just assigned. We don’t
actually dig in it just take a look and put it away for a few days and when we started to do
it, we found it extremely difficult...Most of us can’t do it”.
The professor told the student to work independently. She/he felt that this was not adequate
guidance. The participant was asked how that made them feel, and they said “bad.” Within
Sense-Making, the actor defines their own world, the participant described their own personal
perspective and context of the meaning of the response from this one incident from one
professor:
“I’m Chinese. Usually you don’t get that but sometimes you do… it happens several
times… In high school and primary school… When you are young you don’t have those
feelings of being angry or mad …You don’t know, you don’t tell me. So if I ask a
professor something and if they don’t tell you, that’s it. That’s what happens in China.”
For the participant completing an Ecommerce website, they were asked what happened next and
they shared how they progressed through their problem:
“ (The professor canceled the assignment)…he…she did two things, she put more grades
on attendance and participation and then gave us an easy assignment like design an
interface…Easier is good but I didn’t learn as much as I expected. For me, I need you to
tell me how to do it and practice. But if you don’t teach me anything, just give me a hard
one (question) and I can’t do it, so then she give me a like a “1+1=2”...Something you
already know or you don’t put in a lot of time and you can finish it. That’s easy.”
The participant did not seem to express satisfaction with the solution the instructor of the course

75

provided to her/him in support of addressing the information gap.
For the participant seeking to learn a new programming language, she/he described
utilizing a previous known help, online Internet forums for computer programming:
“I tried to find on the Internet if there were some forums to see if other people, what other
people do…because it wasn’t a new idea (Java) it’s just new to me so I believe that
people have already done these kinds of things. Usually, when I meet a problem in an
assignment I always go to the Internet to check the forums. There are a lot of different
forums and you can really find what you need. Sometimes you can directly find the
solutions.”
Relying on previous experiences with searching for programming assistance, the
participant sought out information online through a programming forum:
“I think that is my experience. I think before the project I like to stay on the Internet and
see something new, something technical knowledge, technical news, what is that updated
thing. Usually I can see those forums and people they are very professional. Different
forums have different topics and each form I think there are several people that are
professional and they like to post some new solutions for some kind of questions.”
The participants also stated seeking information from programming books at a library, as well as
consulting his/her group partner:
“Also, I went to the library to borrow some books for the basic programing. Also, I had a
partner so we could do the project together. Most of the time I searched by Internet and
used Baidu and there is a lot of information I can get over there.”
The participant was asked how he/she knew the information found on the forums could be
trusted, and they explained:

76

“Usually I have to try. Like the Java programing code usually, I post maybe 95% right
things. Sometimes on the Internet when I copy and paste them in my compiler, if it does
work, I have to fix this problems (sic). So I think most of them are right but (if not) I have
to do something to fix it.”
Since the information retrieved online was used to perform a task, the participant knew
that the information or code was satisfactory because it allowed the application to function.
When the participant was asked by the researcher how he/she knew enough had been found,
he/she said: “because I can what I want. Like java code and I can compile it successfully or I can
reach the final…what I expect and I think it’s good and I am satisfied.” The participant,
explained that the information found on the Internet forum answered his/her information problem
and shared the results of the assignment: “[t]he professors gave us the grade and we
finished…Not bad, it’s a good score for me.”
The undergraduate thesis is a degree requirement in Chinese universities (Wang, 2003,
p.160). One participant shared with the researcher her/his process of learning to search for
academic journals. The participant described not knowing how to search the academic databases
and sought the assistance of their academic advisor:
“My advisor told me more skills for excel. When you input the paper, you think how can
I get it faster and better and if you play on it you can get some tricks. Such as, you can
narrow your searching to make sure the only papers appear between a time period or limit
items in relevance. You just play with it like computer games and gradually you learn
more about it.”
The participant described learning how to use the advance searching feature on an academic
database from her/his adviser:

77

When asked by the researcher what other assistance the advisor provided, he/she said:
“In fact, I write one version. The first version and about 30,000 words and give it to my
advisor and he said you should have a well formed paper and he told me how to form the
paper...He said the teachers who are reading my paper, what their reading habit is and his
experience of the criteria for reading the paper”
The participant sought the assistance of her/his advisor in developing the structure of a thesis.
The outcome of the assistance, and help given, was shared:
“(I) finished my paper and I got an excellent…I feel happy but I didn’t get the prize of
excellent graduate because I didn’t enough scholarships in my third year. About 13
people of 92 got excellent. Yes, I feel successful, I finished everything.”
The participant described feeling successful in completing an undergraduate thesis through
making use of the information searching and writing assistance provided by her/his
undergraduate academic advisor.
Searching for information on academic databases appeared in another participant’s
description of her/his information seeking situations. The participant described to the researcher
that she/he was writing an essay on the topic of Enterprise 2.0, and was having difficulty finding
material in mandarin:
“the topic and it is very new and can’t find a lot of materials in Chinese resources so we
have to search English resources but we don’t (sic) familiar in the English database and
in our library system we bought (access) EBSCO and other very major English database
but we don’t know how to use it sometimes it is an English problem or we can’t access
the resources easily.”

78

The researcher asked the participant what he/she did next, and they replied, “I think at that time
we tried our best to search on Google and some English ( language) web page and some English
(language) database but not very fluent or completely.” When asked by the researcher if he/she
sought any assistance from a librarian with searching, the participant explained:
“We didn’t know we can ask the librarian because for students the first choice is to ask
the professor because that may be the most familiar people and it is convenient, at class
after class you can ask. But to ask a librarian, in China it’s a little weird, because we
don’t have that kind of librarian like reference librarian, that faces students. Maybe you
need to come to an office to ask this kind of question.”
The researcher then the participant how he/she identified the database he/she initially searched.
He/she explained:
“First is from the school library has some bought from some foreigners. At that time we
didn’t have many things to evaluate foreign database so we don’t evaluate a lot. So it
showed a listed to resources and I used them and tried to search some web pages from the
professors blogs.”
As a follow-up, the participant was asked how he/she knew that the information found on
the blogs could be trusted, and the participant responded:
“In English (searching) and the search tips is easy and we don’t have to pay a lot of
attention to know how to search but I think the evaluation. I think at that time the English
articles were valuable for ourselves because English especially, America has the latest
ideas for this topic ( Enterprise 2.0) so one we search for this kind of articles we just
think it is valuable and we don’t evaluate.”

79

The assessment of the information retrieved online by the participant did not include an
evaluation of validity or authoritativeness of the information. The participant responded:
“At that time we evaluate depending on the articles and compare with the Chinese articles
and can see that the English articles gather more information, inspiration, details and the
theory of this topic.”
Utilizing the information found in both academic databases, and online, the participant described
a process of constructing a bridge, and completing their assignment. The participant described
what happened next, “[m]y professor thought it was good and gave a high recommendation…He
gave the grade.”
The participant was then asked whether he/she felt successful in completing this
assignment and responded:
“Yes, cause the paper was complete and had an adaptable structure and give the reader a
clear structure of the idea. Another this is the professor gave the comment and grade I
studied a lot of things in this period of the paper”
From this, the researcher detected some uncertainty in the participant’s response and as a
follow-up, asked whether he/she felt successful in their searching technique. The participant said:
“Then I thought I was successful but not I know there were a lot of short comes. I think if
I doing this paper now, the first thing is to ask a librarian as many as possible and now I
know a lot of access methods and not just limited to the database and by myself.”
Although the participant progressed through the information problem and found a solution, upon
reflecting on the bridge constructed to assist them with overcoming the information problem,
he/she would have sought out the assistance of an academic librarian.

80

In another situation involving a final project, a participant commented on the issue of
Internet filtering and access to information. The participant was completing a final project on
Google Maps, which is a blocked website in China. The participant described to the researcher
what he/she first did to seek access to the website, explaining that:
“Firstly I used the proxy server which is given by my adviser and to search on Google
and especially the developer forum and ask questions on that and wait for replies. Then I
asked my classmates, my middle school classmate who was studying in Hong Kong and
ask her whether or not she can find someone who was familiar with Google maps API but
she tried but couldn’t find one. So, I still searched online and asked my friends if there
was someone they know who can help me and indeed they found some of their friends to
help me and got some very useful information from them and from my adviser and also
from the Internet. So gather information from varies ways.”
The participant sought the help of a friend in Hong Kong because the server was located
there; however, the friend did not have the necessary technology background, and was unable to
assist. The participant then sought out help through Internet forums. This source of help was
used for the following reasons: “Because I think there should be plenty of information online and
expertise who can solve my problem because the Internet is just a cloud of people from all over
the world.” When asked by the researcher how he/she knew that the information would be
reliable, the participant responded:
“I will judge on the content and I find information from the website I think will be
trustful. Also, I sent email to the developers who host on those forums and given by
words I thought that maybe he or she is the expertise in this field so may he or she can
solve my problem.”

81

The participant then proceeded to offer information on the individual that helped him/her
to bridge their information gap:
“Actually the one who gave me many suggestions and instructions is my mom’s work
mate. He’s working on my mother’s organization system and not only workmates but
friends. So my mother asked him if he can give me some instructions because the projects
in school must be easier for a man who have working experience in the working
organization I can ask him if he had time to instruct her or give her some suggestions that
uncle is really nice and he just …You know we call mother and father’s friends uncle or
aunt, not really relatives. That person gave me instructions that which really made my
project a big progress and I can continue on it and I get an achievement on my project.”
The researcher asked the participant how he/she knew to ask for assistance through their
parent:
“I told her, I said ‘hi mom, I don’t think I can handle it and I ask the ones who can help
and I still can’t solve the problem. Do you know is there anyone that can give me some
instructions because I don’t know who I can ask for’… Because she is my mother and she
can help me to solve my problem because she doesn’t want to see her daughter worry
about anything.”
Utilizing an extended network through a parent, the participant was able to identify a help to
bridge their information gap, allowing for the completion of their project. The participant shared
the result of the project with the researcher: “I gained one of the highest marks in my school and
won the award of best project in the university.” The researcher asked the participant how this
felt: “very proud of myself and also most important I thanked all the ones that helped me in
those three months.” This participant was able to rely on a personal network for help in bridging

82

their information gap. Although not all helps sought were successful in bridging the gap,
eventually, someone through an extended network was able to assist.
The helps, hurts, and behaviors utilized by participants to bridge their information gaps as
undergraduates in China required a diverse set of knowledge and resources. The convenience of
online searching, learned at an early age, seemed to be a readily sought after information help by
participants. The mix of negative and positive associations with libraries and librarian proved to
appear as sources of helps and hurts by participants. The use of personal networks of friends,
family, and educators appears to have provided the bulk of helps sought after to bridge
information gaps. The Discussion section will further discuss participants’ undergraduate
experiences, as differences, comparisons, similarities, and parallels with their graduate studies
experiences are explored. In the following section, participants’ information-seeking experiences
as graduate students in the United States will be discussed.

4.4

FIRST GRADUATE INFORMATION-SEEKING: UNITED STATES

In this section, we look at the participants’ experiences as graduate students in the United States
using the SMM category, “Situation”. Situations are the context and background for the
information need or problem. To tap into participants’ information problems, the following
question was asked: Can you please describe how you find information for an assignment now
during your current study in the United States? The participants described three types of
situations, or contexts, related to their information-seeking processes in the United States. They
are: programming tasks, writing tasks, and student life situations. The conceptual category of
Situation is analyzed through these distinct lenses.
83

4.4.1

Academic Information Environment

The University of Pittsburgh is located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, a city of 306,211 residents
(United States Census Bureau, 2012). The main campus of the University of Pittsburgh is located
in the neighborhood of Oakland. The Office of International Services (OIS) is responsible for the
support of immigration issues for international students and scholars at the University. OIS also
provides support through orientations supporting their acclimation to the University, the City,
and cultural context of living in the United States. These orientation sessions are offered at the
beginning of the semesters, as well as throughout the year.
The University of Pittsburgh Library System (ULS) offers both digital and physical
library collections as part of its academic information resources, which were available to
participants during their studies. Students can access electronic resources and collections such as
e-books and online journals, through the EZproxy associated with their university user
identification number. These resources can be accessed online from anywhere in the world.
At the time of data collection, the physical library spaces available to students included
an Information Sciences (IS) Library located inside the School of Information Sciences (SIS)
building. The collection of the IS Library included content for the three associated programs of
the School of Information Sciences (Information Science & Technology, Library & Information
Science, & Telecommunication & Networking) in addition to a special collection of children’s
literature. The library was staffed by one managerial librarian, one full-time paraprofessional
who had an MLIS, and a number of student workers, many of whom were pursuing MLIS
degrees. The IS Library offered instructional workshops on the ULS services and various
academic databases. In the summer of 2012 the IS Library was closed permanently.
University’s main library, Hillman Library, absorbed the IS Library collection.
84

The

Hillman Library serves as the main library for the ULS system. Several special
collections, such as the East Asian Library, exist within Hillman Library. The East Asian Library
is of significance to this study as its associated librarians have spoken fluency in a number of
East Asian languages. They also offer specific library orientations in the form of library tours
and bibliographic instruction (catalog, databases, and citation tools and writing resources) to
international students in Asian languages, such Mandarin and Japanese. The instruction sessions
are marketed to students through the Office of International Services (OIS), which typically
holds orientations at the beginning of a semester. At the time of the study, the East Asian
Library was only offering their library workshops at the beginning of the fall semester. Another
resource came from professors requesting that librarians provide instruction on the databases and
the ULS services during class time.

4.4.2

Information Tasks in Relation to Situations

For this study, discussions of tasks were viewed in relation to the participant’s sense-making
process, and analysis of participants’ information problems related to situations categorized as
type of task. Participants primarily shared two types of information problems: those related to
school tasks (i.e., assignments) and those related to activities encountered during everyday life,
noted as Student Life Tasks. The following discusses tasks in relation to the participant’s sensemaking process.
School tasks fell into two types of assignments: writing assignments and computer
programming assignments. Writing assignments are defined in this study as tasks requiring
students to submit a written document for evaluation. A computer programming assignment is
defined as a task resulting in the production of a computer application.
85

4.4.3

Situations: Writing Assignments

The assessment of student learning through a written report can assess students’ understanding of
course learning objectives through the production of new ideas. At a graduate level, the role of
writing assignments can serve as an external form of evidence that students utilize critical
thinking skills. Of the twenty participants, four chose to recount instances when they sought
information to complete a writing assignment. Two participants described an experimental
research proposal structured as a group assignment for an Information Science course on Human
Information Processing (HIP). The students needed to identify a problem related to a HIP
method or theory and design a proposed study to solve or improve upon the identified problem.
In addition, the proposal needed to take the tone of a research grant, and include APA citations
and references for resources. An oral presentation of the paper was also required. One participant
recalled the assignment:
“…Last semester I wrote some papers, one was a group assignment and one was personal
and I need [sic] to find some material to write it…For the group project, we search [sic]
the information together and then select [sic] the most valuable and read and then give
out each one's idea and then collect them together. Each person write [sic] a part of the
paper and then put them together to form a paper.”
Research papers, one discussing copyright, and another of writing a lesson plan were a
few other types of writing assignments shared. “Let me think, I got one related to copyright topic
paper,” recalled one participant. “That course assignment was copyright.” Another noted an
experience writing a lesson plan:
“I just finished my assignment about one hour ago. It talks about, you should design
lesson [sic] by ourselves and give your teacher the draft. But because I don't have teaching
86

experience, so I thought it was very difficult for me to write down the structure of the lesson
plan.”
The variety of writing assignments shared by participants was reflected in the course work they
were completing at the time of the study. The diverse subject matter of the assignments may be
attributed to the differences between the various graduate degree programs that are under the
umbrella of the School (SIS).

4.4.4

Situations: Programming Assignments

Five participants shared specific problems they encountered when searching for information to
complete a computer programming assignment. Types of programming assignments included
building applications, creating a website, and learning a new programming language.
A group assignment for a course on Adaptive Information Systems was mentioned by
two participants. The assignment required students to draw upon theories learned in the course
and demonstrate them in the design of a small adaptive system. Two participants described this
situation:
“Let me think about it. One is an Information Science course called Adaptive Information
System Design, and we need to build a system, which the system will use maybe some
coding and also need data [sic], the data sometime we gain [sic] from API. You know
API, so we try to search for API data…But we search for a lots of time [sic] but we
cannot find a suitable API.”
“Last semester, in Adaptive Information System that was (name of professor), that was
challenging for me cause [sic] I transferred from LIS (to IS). We didn’t need to do a lot
of programming but in the first assignment and the final one, it was tough for me but at
87

least there was group work. The first one was a programming assignment and you can use
any programming language you want. The TA provided us with information and several
tools and go directly to use them [sic] and it was helpful to me.”
Other participants shared situations where they needed to create a website: “The project
was to create a website issue used by all faculty and students at the School of Information
Science,” or demonstrate a growing competency in the usage of programming languages and
design:
“Like in the course of Java, each week we are assigned to do an assignment and about the
assignment, most of us were not clear what we were supposed to do. Some of my
classmates will work together to think about the words of the professor in class.”
Another programming situation shared by a participant involved creating a website: “The project
was to create a website to be used by all faculty and students at the School of Information
Science.”
Computer programming tasks may take on the form of solving a mathematical problem
or equation. This was the case for one participant who sought help calculating a parameter to
determine a design that would optimize a network. “The assignment was about calculate [sic]
some parameters in the network to optimize the cost in the through-put in the whole network,”
the student recalled: “I can’t remember the full question…It’s a mathematical problem on
paper.”
These situations, related to completing a computer programming assignment seemed to
be mostly reflective of students pursing graduate degrees in IS. This can be attributed to the high
number of participants in this study seeking graduate degrees in IS.

88

4.4.5

Situations: Student Life Tasks

During the interviews, participants also shared information problems related to student life. They
described situations secondary to their academic assignments, such as determining which courses
to take, how courses relate to their field of study, and how to navigate the University’s services.
As one student noted, “In the first week I have attended six courses. But it’s not my course in
this semester. Second week, I wanted to drop one of them.” Another shared a similar experience:
“You know, I have some little questions, there are two courses: one is Human
Information Processes and the Human Factor. When I take that course, it’s all about
psychology. So I just wonder, ‘how the psychology [sic] is related to the computer?’”
As well as, one participants’ situation related to using the student services system and financial
system:
“I don’t know, I know there is Pitt Pay in our portal and it just list [sic] our tuition and
fees. I can’t exactly [sic], what the economic terms mean, like, ‘deposit’ or how to use the
credit card to pay the tuition and just transfer the money from my bank account. I need to
search it, and where to mail to China...”
These participants shared situations that reflect the concerns of students just beginning their
studies, and learning how to navigate a new academic environment, education system, and area
of study.
Another information-seeking issue centered around a participant sharing his/her situation
related to their difficulties with English-language fluency, “I think it is about English because
when I first came here (United States) sometimes, I know what it is in Chinese but I just don’t
know the English name…” This participant shared their situation as a ESL speaker struggling
with language semantics.
89

One participant nearing the end of their degree shared their situation of trying to learn a
new programming tool in support of job seeking:
“Yeah, to be honest, I have one thing that’s been going on lately, I have some specific
questions on using some (programming) tools, but I just can’t find anyone to help
me…Recently, I’ve been looking for jobs and the descriptions of the jobs said you need
to know JEE (JAVA Entrance Exam); you need to know this tool, that tool. I know that’s
[sic] the skills I need if I want to have a job.”
Although this participant was a current student, he/she was focused on the future challenge of
gaining employment.
The situations shared by participants related to student life are not necessarily directly
tied to completing a specific academic assignment. However, these situations shared suggest that
international students experience additional information problems outside of the classroom that
require information helps and assistance from their academic environment.

4.5

GAPS: UNITED STATES

Two primary types of gaps that led participants to seek information were caused by school
assignment tasks, or tasks associated with living in a new country and pursuing studies at a
higher-education institution in the United States. To tap into these gaps, the following questions
were asked: What were you trying to solve? How did you know you had a need? How did you
know what you were looking for? This section highlights three emergent themes related to gaps.
They are: locating information, imposed queries, and awareness of helps.

90

4.5.1

Gaps: Writing

Two participants described their gap in information while writing an experimental paper similar
to a research proposal. One participant recalled, “Yeah, the paper, you need to present an
experiment to prove something about human information processing;” the second participant
noted, “He need [sic] us to design an experiment and to confirm some condition or some, I
cannot remember that word...theory? We need to confirm that (theory)…I need to find some
material to write it.” These examples illustrate that the students had information gaps associated
with both identifying a subject (a theory) for the paper and structuring a paper in the form of an
experimental research proposal.
Participants commented on other information needs related to a writing assignment,
including finding information appropriate to the task and topic of the assignment. “I searched for
the books and articles…,” said one student. “This topic is a virtual topic and there is a lot of
research on this topic so there is [sic] so many books.” Another participant related a situation in
which “…it's very difficult to find such information on how to write lesson plan [sic].” Although
the two participants were completing different types of writing tasks, they expressed that their
information gap stemmed from the amount of information available on the subject. One
experienced not being able to find specific-enough information, while another had difficulty
processing the abundance of information. These participants shared difficulty in locating specific
information for their assignments.

91

4.5.2

Gaps: Programming

The information needs identified by participants when completing a computer programming
assignment created a variety of gaps. One participant described seeking code to build a system:
“We need to build a system, which the system will use maybe some coding and also need data
[sic], the data sometime [sic] we gain from API.” Another participant recalled having an
information need based on an unfamiliarity with the task, and how to begin an assignment.
“Never did anything like that before,” the student remembered. “It was an RSS reader and I
didn’t know a lot about RSS file and at the very beginning I didn’t know anything.”
Another example in which the participant was tasked with solving a programming code error led
a participant to seek information online on the Internet:
“I had to make a program executable and to function to help you do some task for your
program…One of my co-workers on this project, she actually generated this idea. The
project is based on PHP, HTML, CSS and we have to take care of the back-end to set of
the servers and store any kind of information, and we have to design good user interface
to manipulate all their tasks...The website wouldn’t show correctly and usually when I get
stuck, I refer to the online resources.”
Another participant described a gap in understanding the instructions for an assignment:
“Generic Programming Java, so I think the proper assignment description, before I knew
this I just knew generic. I just knew to deal with generic (programming language) so
several of my classmates will get together to think about and double-check what we were
supposed to do.”
Finally, another participant related the challenge of calculating a mathematical problem that
caused great confusion:
92

“The assignment was about [sic] calculate some parameters in the network to optimize
the cost in the through-put in the whole network…I can’t remember the full
question…There is no solution to that question, the problem is like a disaster.”
The frustration of the gaps shared by participants provides an authentic expression of the stresses
caused by imposed queries in the form of homework assignments. The gaps in information were
not necessarily tied to a lack of knowledge that would be found in a single information resource,
or even an information resource that would traditionally be found in academic scholarly
resources, such as authoritative books or journals.

4.5.3

Gaps: Student Life

Confusions and muddles encountered by participants in their ordinary daily life as students living
in a new country, and navigating through graduate studies, presented a variety of information
gaps. Doubt, confusion, and uncertainty were a few of the emotions expressed by the
participants. One participant described several sources of confusions, created by living in a new
country while navigating a new education system:
“I don’t know, I know there is Pitt Pay in our portal and it just list [sic] our tuition and
fees. I can’t exactly [sic] what the economic terms mean. Like ‘deposit’ or how to use the
credit card to pay the tuition and just transfer the money from my PNC bank account. I
need to search it [sic] and where to mail (post office) to China and ask him to do
something for me. I am still explore this campus…The health information, the insurance,
the total fees for tuition and I don’t, if plus the insurance [sic] how much I should pay and
about …I need some information, I need some information but I haven’t tried them.”

93

This participant’s description of being stuck in an information gap at the time of data collection
was ongoing, and his/her progression through this problem was not captured as it was not yet
resolved.
Feeling stuck in a problem with no awareness of available helps was also expressed by
another participant. This student sought information to develop a new skill to enhance his/her
employability:
“…I just can’t find anyone to help me. I don’t think any of the students, any of my
classmates or professor knows, yeah, I doubt that…Just java eclipse, it has different
versions. I just think no one else knows more than I do.”
Expressing feelings of doubt that no one could assist with the information need of learning a
computer programming language highlights a gap, this gap in information was also accompanied
by feelings of isolation from help, when the participant declared that “no one else” would know
more than themself.
The challenges faced when selecting courses caused one student to feel uncertainty, “I’m
not sure which course I will drop because this course is all in time [sic]. I’m back and forth on
how to select my course.” Confusion is another feeling that can occur when a lack of information
takes the place of understanding. For example, one participant experienced confusion and a gap
in understanding the relationship between two related academic disciplines: “Human Information
Processes and the Human Factor, when I take that course, it’s all about psychology. So I just
wonder how the psychology [sic] is related to the computer?” This student’s question, and
confusion over the relationship between the two subjects’, addresses the interdisciplinary
approach of the course that may present an explicit connection.

94

Culturally dependent information can cause confusion and may be further fueled by
semantics in language. One participant shared such a gap in information created by difficulty
between Mandarin Chinese and English and the associated cultural differences:
“…I have to search what I want in Chinese no matter if it’s on Baidu or Google. It was
common because sometimes the translation is different. Like I can give you an example,
the names of movies is [sic] different (between Chinese and English)…It is hard for
Chinese students to talk with people who speak native English, and we want to talk but
we don’t know what they are talking about. I think they are talking about one movie we
(Chinese students) have already watched and we know what they are talking about, but
we can’t say anything in the talk. Feel bad because I want to talk…”
The angst the student felt over the gap in information was caused by the challenges associated
with communicating in English, while also attempting to bridge culturally dependent information
in support of socialization with classmates.
The information gaps participants shared in relation to student life experiences were
broad; the students’ length of stay in the country varied from as little as a few weeks to more
than a year. The gaps covered many aspects of daily life for international students living in a new
country while pursuing graduate studies. A common theme presented with these gaps was the
exposure to concepts, situations, and problems caused by the intersection of the presence of
American culture and English language, which participants may have not previously
experienced. Gaps with components related to culturally dependent information and contexts
may have further complicated participants in the sense-making process, as they lacked awareness
of the information helps and resources available to them as students.

95

4.6

BRIDGES & OUTCOMES: UNITED STATES

Within SMM, the Bridge represents the helps used in the sense-making and unmaking process.
Detecting a participant’s actions when addressing information needs, or gaps, may provide
insight into how a person can, or cannot, progress through a problem. In this study, participants
were asked to share what helps they used to progress through their information gaps. The
following questions were asked in an effort to tap into participants’ Bridges: What assistance did
you seek? What resources did you seek? What helped you to answer your question? How did you
access this resource/help?
Dervin (2008) defines the Outcome in the sense-making process as the result of the
bridge; it can be an answer, solution, or another Gap or problem. Bridges and Outcomes are
presented together in this section because an Outcome is the result of the Bridge. Examining the
relationship between these two concepts helps solidify their connection. To tap into the
Outcomes of participants, the following questions were asked: How did you know that your need
was met? How did that information resolve your need/question? How did the information
help/not help? How did that make you feel? How did this situation influence approach of
investigating information?

4.6.1

Bridges & Outcomes: Writing

Writing assignments played an important role in charting the Bridges and Outcomes of this
study. For international students, mastering a foreign language and successfully articulating
thoughts through writing can prove challenging. Several students recalled experiences of seeking
information when attempting to complete a written assignment. Their recollections offered
96

insight to the information-seeking behavior of PRC international students. For the participant in
search of information in support of writing a lesson plan, he/she first sought information online.
The participant explained why they first sought information on the Internet: “Well, it's easier and
faster. I have a computer always. That's why I checked it online.” The outcome of this searching
was shared: “when I check online, it's very difficult to find such information on how to write
lesson plan. It's like if you check Google, it's easy for you because like some teachers will talk
about it by PowerPoint and other things. But if you check our database like in PittCat, there is
not a lot of information for this.”
Further discussion revealed that the participant’s search strategy, using the library’s
online catalog, involved keyword searching and the use of the aggregator. “I just use ‘Find
Articles’ (library aggregator) in the PittCat system (online library). So, I just input keywords
‘study’ and ‘lesson plan’ and tried to find some information.” The student then explained the
decision to use the aggregator:
“Because, I think I assume I can find a lot of information. The aggregator combined the
entire database together. So, it's easier for me and also there are other sources, like ‘the
cloud’ (word cloud). You can choose which year, skill, particular search area. So it's
better for me.”
The participant indicated that the outcome of searching the Library’s collection through the use
of an aggregator and selected keywords was unsuccessful; the information found did not help
answer the information problem. The participant next turned to an Internet search:
“Go to Google…I found a lot of teachers’ PPT talk about it (lesson plans). Although they
are not scholarly resource, but I just want to know the structure of lessons, so it's OK for
me. I can do that by myself.”
97

Here, the participant revealed that the PowerPoint presentations retrieved online provided the
information needed to bridge the information gap:
“I just want to know the structure of how to arrange such a task plan, lesson plan, not to
use the content of the lesson plan from other teachers, or from other books, or from other
resources. So I want to know the structure.”
The assessment of the information retrieved by the participant involved a discussion of reliability
through association. “Well, because they are professors from other universities and college,” the
student explained, “I think they have the experience, teaching experience, to design the lesson.
So that's why I trust them.” This comment indicates that the participant used the associations
created by the academic institution, and the author’s job title/position as an educator, to
determine the reliability of the information. When the participant was asked if he/she was
satisfied with the information found, he/she responded:
“Because the teacher, I told you the requirements, it's also the teacher's requirement for
my homework. I think I just make all points ask to do [sic]. So, now I feel satisfied but I
don’t know the outcome (of the assignment) yet.”
In the above situation, the participant had yet to identify the outcome of the information-seeking
process. Expressing feelings of satisfaction with the information found enabled the student to
comprehend the information gap and proceed through the requirements of the assignment task.
As noted in section 4.6.1, two participants shared their experiences of working on a group
assignment of writing an experimental research proposal paper. The first participant shared a
positive experience in which the steps of the projects, including selecting a partner, researching
the topic and completing the assignment, were all done satisfactorily. Conversely, the second

98

example illustrates difficulties international students may have in seeking information at an
American university.
The first participant’s interview began by exploring the process of identifying a group
member. “We [sic] two Chinese students and we play together and are familiar with each other,
so we thought we should work together,” remembered the student. After selecting a partner, the
pair chose a topic for their assignment:
“I think she…we just discuss and we go through the book and see which topic is
interesting. And, then we focused on two topics and she said maybe this one is better.
Yes, our textbook…Because the teacher organized his course to reference the textbook.”
The pair then searched for information on the topic, “The Internet and a book the teacher
recommend [sic]…Actually, he (the professor) recommend [sic] a number of books and
one is the textbook and, if we have time, we can go through this book. It is helpful for our
study.”
When the participant was asked what information was sought in the textbook, he/she
explained:
“I just extract [sic] information for our paper. Actually, we got the idea by sending the
little paragraphs to the professor and he gave us feedback and thinks it's very great. The
idea is very great so we continue [sic]…He need [sic] us to design an experiment and to
confirm some condition or some, I cannot remember that word, theory. We need to
confirm that (theory).”
The participant may have made sense of the information utilized in the textbook through
the assurance provided by the professor’s comments. In addition to utilizing the professor and
the textbook as helps, the participant also sought feedback from a classmate, whom was selected

99

based upon specific qualifications. “We asked our classmate about our experiment,” the student
recalled. “We ask the classmate who got ideas and got lots of ideas…He always good at study
and do good [sic] in every course…He's my friend and we discuss [sic] the problem together.”
Soliciting assistance from a classmate whose academic performance was familiar, and
with whom the students were sociable, further aided in the quest for information. At this point
the participant explained the assignment requirements in more detail, and how the pair knew the
requirements for the task were fulfilled. “We just need to design it and confirm it,” the
participant stated. “Actually, in the book, the writer had design [sic] an experiment to test it but it
wasn't perfect enough, so we made it more perfect.”
The participant was then asked how the pair knew that they had designed a “more
perfect” experiment. “Because, during the presentation, the professor was very satisfy with our
design because he applaud,” explained the student. The professor’s feedback appeared to provide
the participant with the confirmation that the outcome of the assignment was positive.
The second participant that shared his/her information process for writing an
experimental research proposal related to HIP described selecting a group member. “Maybe I
choose randomly,” the student recalled. “They sit behind me and I said, ‘Can you be my
partner?’ and they said ‘yeah.’” While the partner was also an international student, the pair did
not share a native language or cultural background. The participant remembered the challenges
associated with this difference, “…sometimes, I say something and she cannot understand me
and sometimes she said something I could not understand her [sic].”
Working through the communication challenges, the pair progressed through the task of
writing an experimental research proposal:

100

“I read the instructions and then the examples, and then discussed with my partner. And,
all of do [sic] some research on Google and discuss again and decide what I should do
and what should you do. After we finish the work, we come together to discuss again and
finally we finish the work.”
The professor also provided students with information resources: “He (the professor) just provide
examples of papers…He gave us the URL of those papers online.” Although the “papers” were
not defined by the participant, it may be informed that they were electronic journal articles. The
participant sought specific information in the articles and via Internet searches. These methods
helped identify useful information for the project:
“Well, it makes me know how to design a psychology experiment since it is a psychology
course, and it tells me the steps of the experiment and got some ideas from it and
designed my own experiment…If the information could provide us with some ideas or
specific information on what we want to do.”
Although the participant searched for information on Google, he/she was deterred by instances in
which accessing proprietary information involved the use of the university library’s licensed
databases. “I will try the online library on Pittsburgh (university’s databases),” the student stated.
“And, if I really can’t (access it), then I will forget it.” When asked whether instruction on how
to search the databases was provided, the participant replied, “There is some guy called (name of
male library paraprofessional) in the third floor (School of Information Science Library), he’s the
one to teach me how to use it (the) first semester I was here.”
A series of follow-up questions sought to identify the participant’s exposure to alternative
search techniques and library services. The answers indicated that the student knew how to
borrow books from other libraries, but not journal articles. After further discussion, the

101

participant also shared an absence of familiarity with advance limiting features on the databases,
such as “full-text” or “Scholarly/Peer Review,” and did not participate in a formal library
orientation. To this question the participant surprisingly replied, “Is there? I don’t know, how do
I find this information?”
While the participant seemed to understand how to access the library’s electronic
resources, utilizing all of the library’s services, or using electronic resources to their fullest
extent, was beyond his/her knowledge. This demonstrates a lack of awareness of all the academic
helps provided to students by the Library system.
During the interview, the participant expressed preferences for selecting the information
resources used in the assignment:
“… I prefer the papers from the famous universities…Because I think that the famous
universities always provide the more better [sic] resources…Cause [sic] better
universities has better information resource, better students, better professors and then
they should have better work…They should provide me those useful information and
trustworthy [sic]…I don’t know how to judge this, I just kind of sense, for example, if the
paper is from Harvard University, it must be good. Cause [sic] Harvard is the best
university.”
This participant assumed the reputation of an institution and the sources of funding were good
indicators of research quality.
Another participant also described his/her preference for selecting information resources
based on a university’s ranking in the popular magazine, US News & World Report. The
participant explained how, and why, he/she first came to use this resource as a rubric for
assessing authority of education and scholarship:

102

“…Cause I need to the US News [sic] for the ranking (universities) information…I think
the better rank can present a university as better funding, better education, and provide
you more opportunities to find a job here (in the United States)…A friend taught me and
provides this information.”
Finally, the participant was asked if additional helps were utilized for the assignment. “At
the initial time, we were unclear what we should do,” recalled the student. “So, we asked the
professor together and he said how to design the experiment and what is necessary in a
psychology experiment. The professor is a nice guy.”
The participant, and his/her fellow group member wrote the experimental research
proposal utilizing the professor’s initial instructions and secondary explanations, journal articles,
and online searches. The participant negotiated with his/her group member and delegated tasks
between themselves in order to complete their assignment and make sense of their information
problem.
Another area in which a participant encountered barriers was when attempting to search
for information for a written assignment on a topic they did not fully understand. This was the
case for one participant who was writing a research paper on the topic of United States copyright
and technology. A book was the first resource the student sought, because:
“Books is a structure literature [sic] and contains a lot of complete ideas on this topic and
give you very complete and big outline [sic]…I think from professor that have
recommended some books [sic] and we know the different characteristics for different
material, and in my undergraduate [sic] we made a comparison between book, article,
website.”

103

The participant also read research articles from a reference list provided by the professor.
“From this reference list, I can find more information to give me deeper knowledge and
inspiration of the topic, and try to find these articles in the database,” the student explained. A
library orientation introduced the reference service, which the participant used in different
modalities. “Beside to search in the Pitt database [sic], I ask the librarian and chat with the
librarian online and they gave me another recommendation materials [sic],” recalled the student.
The chat reference service was easy to use. “It’s convenient,” the student noted. “You can
chat from home 24/7.” And, the student opted for a familiar online librarian:
“I recall NY public library and some university librarians…I knew about NY public
Library from China. We had to do a project and research, and New York Public Library,
so I knew I could use this chat function. Now in American [sic], I use it directly. I know a
lot of big universities have this…I just choose because NY Public Library is most
familiar.”
When asked, the participant did not express concern asking a public librarian for
assistance with an academic assignment. “That’s an issue I haven’t concern [sic].” The student
also utilized university resources, “But I don’t just chat with the public librarian, I also chat with
an academic librarian at University of Pittsburgh,” Consulting the text, and other resources
suggested during chat reference sessions, aided in the search for information:
“Then I read it, to see if it was useful or not…Whether it could solve my confusions or
my problems, and that was the first evaluation method. And, the second was to see the
materials, it is a scholarly article, a review, instructions, something like that…It depends
on my evaluation, the first: Can it answer my problem? And, second is if it is
authorized…If it comes from a scholarly article, I can trust it. But if it comes from a

104

website, I think it might, in my opinion, is lower …I look at the resource, what magazine
it comes from and where the author is from.”
Evaluation of the information provided by the librarians included evaluating the
relevance of the information, to the assignment and the identification of the authority of the
information resources.
Fellow classmates also became a viable information resource for this participant:
“Some classmates I am familiar with and some are my friends…Because we have to do
some projects together and that time we know her experience and outstanding ability
related to some topic…From their views of the topic and classes’ expressions and writing
essays you can evaluate…You can easily know this person in some aspect to know if
they are outstanding or not. If this person expresses lots of ideas that are logical ideas for
these things and you can think this a lot but they can [sic].”
Relying on friends, and academic individuals with a record of successful performance to
identify a suitable classmate to turn to for help, the participant asked the classmate to clarify the
paper’s subject matter and the writing process. “I wrote the outline for the paper to ask for
advises [sic], and they gave me some additional ideas for this topic…I saw all of them and think
that the additional concepts could help me to finish...benefit my paper,” the student explained.
When asked how the participant knew the classmate’s suggestions satisfied the information need,
the participant noted:
“First of all, I am not familiar with this topic. Then I read all the papers and get very
confused and not get [sic] a very obvious structure for this topic. But that friend is very
familiar with this topic and did a lot of research on this, so for their experience I trust
them, and when I saw the advices I thought it was better than my opinions.”

105

The participant described the outcome of the assignment as a “so-so” grade, and noted a
lack of understanding regarding the subject matter as a possible cause. The participant’s
comparison between himself/ herself and a classmate indicates an awareness of this issue:
“I just can’t understand the levels, I can’t understand another level…When I
communicate with other classmates and they can think of some other ideas for this topic
and I can’t think of any…I think it comes from the level of knowledge accumulation and
having the fundamental of this knowledge, and after you read this paper you are just very
low understanding [sic]…You can just know some basic concept and basic direction, but
you cannot think more.”
This response illustrates a lack of understanding linked directly to Dervin’s (2008) SMM
bank of neutral open-ended interview questions in which she suggests asking participants to
identify a better method of help. When asked, “If you could wave a magic wand, what would
have helped?” the participant responded, “…to read more and ask more people for help.” Asked
specifically whom he/she would have asked for help, the student responded “the professor.” The
student said he/she did not ask for help because, “Shy …maybe the language…maybe my
language is confusing and I cannot express clearly.” This response may suggest that for this
participant language and cultural differences prevented him/her from fully seeking out the help
needed to support them in learning new subject matter.
The bridges, and their associated outcomes, suggest that participants in this study
expressed contentment with the helps found to assist in making sense of information problems
related to completing a writing assignment. However, for one participant the barrier to making
sense of his/her information problem seemed rooted in language and culturally dependent
information, and would have benefited from more communication with the instructor.

4.6.2

Bridges & Outcomes: Programming

By restricting this study to students in the University of Pittsburgh’s School of Information
Sciences, many of the results focused on instances stemming from programming assignments.
Assignments of this type produced a range of experiences, from needing more help from the
professor, to finding the information needed by working with other classmates. In two instances,
participants described episodes involving a programming assignment for an Information Science
course, titled Adaptive Information Systems. The two students described seeking information for
a group assignment requiring the construction of an adaptive information system. The first
participant was asked how the group made sense of the assignment task:
“…So we have group [sic], we can discuss it about maybe something interesting to
make. Finally, we found the topic by ourselves, the music station, so just we, so the
instructor have talk with each group [sic] and he said this is OK, good for our course, and
we start…The assignment, we built particular system, it can play music, can have
personal service.”
The participant described seeking data, specifically, application programming interface
(API) code, to create a system that could connect to an external website, and explained why the
group decided to search to obtain the necessary code:
“You know API, so we try to search for API data. If we can find API, we don’t need to
collect data by ourselves. If they are maybe as much data they has [sic], if we have more
data the better. But we search for a lots of time [sic] but we cannot find a suitable API.”

107

The group planned to build a music website based on content from Last.fm, an online
music discovery website. API can be obtained online at no cost; the participant recalled
searching for this data online using the search engines Google and Baidu.
“API, just search from Internet. Use Google and Baidu. Different search engine to search
it. I don’t know how to say it, it is the things no school will offer. But some big website
like Google or Twitter will they offer API always on website [sic]. Others, if we want
data, they can copy API and use it. And we do with the music, so we want a music
website can offer the API, which we can be use [sic].”
Unable to locate code that met the needs of the system being built, the group collected
data themselves. “Actually, we found several API, but no one suitable for our system,” the
student stated. “So we just quit it and collect data by ourselves.” When asked if other assistance
was sought to help find the information needed, the participant shared a conversation with the
professor:
“We ask for our professor. Just ask our professor. He has give [sic] me some help but at
last, finally, we haven’t figure it out. He give me some more resources and ask you can
try these. And, actually there is no detail requirements about you should find API [sic].
You also can collect data by yourself, just cost too much time. So we do what he had
told us, but we haven’t finished it. So we just collect the data by ourselves.”
The help offered by the instructor was not useful in progressing through the task, and the group
was unable to locate the API code needed to create their website. They proceeded by writing the
code themselves:
“If we find the API, we don’t need to collect by ourselves, we just copy API and use it. It
is music thing, so we need to find website, and we just need to find data of music. So,

108

since we cannot find API, we just search for the music website. We found one is called
Last FM so they offer the free music download and all the information, the name, the
artist, yes, something for the particular song. So we copy the data, and download music
from this website. Just by hand, so it cost a lots [sic] of time.”
As a result of the extra time spent to complete the assignment, the group distributed the work as
follows:
“Next step, yeah, we have three people in a group. So, one people, one person is deal
[sic] with data collection. So, she goes to website and download music. And, at same
time when download [sic], also copy the…make Excel for copy the main artist and the
time, and some information about songs and make Excel on it.”
Another component of the assignment was a report that accompanied the website. As the student
recalled, “This report is not important, so we don’t put much time. It just to describe all the
system [sic].” The group determined the report was not important by evaluating the following
factors:
“Because, I don’t know how to say [sic]. It just, we need to write, the system is the most
important things. Report just a description of this system, because the instructor what to
know [sic], yeah, maybe we cannot, when we demo it, we cannot describe it clearly, so
the instructor want to have a report to read through and know all the system…Because
Information Science course, the most important is how to build system [sic], the report is
always…maybe not called report…it called [sic] description or demo, or introduction or
something, just to describe the system.”
The participant’s opinion that the written component of the assignment was not as important as
the program in the assessment process was supported by the length of the report submitted:

109

“Everyone says that…Everyone spends much time on system design, and maybe the last
day or something, they finish it, and they also found need write something about what
system do [sic]. What’s the function, maybe some including the coding or something.
Just conclude what we have done in maybe two pages or three pages paper to write this
[sic].”
The resources utilized, and time spent creating API code, supported the completion of the
assignment task. The participant described how the group reconciled the evaluation process
beyond the awarding of a grade:
“Evaluation, I think it is kind of our experience, because our Master and Information
Science [sic], I think it is the course can be practical [sic]. Maybe in the future, we go to
work, we have to do some particular system, now we have experience. So it is better.”
When asked how he/she felt about the outcome of the assignment, the participant explained:
“Yeah, give some feedback. Actually we have demo, and in the demo we first we give
speech, then professor will ask some question [sic]. Yeah, and just like that…when I
have finish something, maybe a paper or a system, I will feel happy. Because I done
something [sic], and also I don’t know, also I can get good grade, this is good enough for
me.”
Initially faced with an information gap when trying to locate the API code needed to complete
the assignment, the group overcame this challenge by writing their own code. The participant
expressed feelings of contentment after completing the assignment and received a positive
evaluation.
A second participant, who had recently switched from Library and Information Science
to Information Science, also described completing a programming assignment for the Adaptive

110

Information Systems course. This student was part of a group tasked with creating an RSS
reader; he/she recalled selecting a group, “There were lots of Chinese people in the course, so
just choose who you are familiar with.” Along with familiarity, the individual’s native language
was a qualifier when identifying and selecting group members. According to the participant,
there were “no language problems.”
The group relied on the teaching assistant (TA) as a resource when creating the website.
“The TA went into detail about the resources and provided a lot of examples and several website
to see as examples,” stated the student. “The professor said that the TA had a lot of experience
about all these languages.”
The group was composed of three persons and, “we started to assign tasks…Maybe
because the assignment can be split in three parts.” After the tasks were divided among the
group, they consulted the resources provided by the TA:
“Start working on it and check out the website the TA provided and download the codes,
but first chose the language (programming)…We three were familiar with…The websites
web divided up by languages, so we just go to the one (associated with the language) we
choose.”
In need of additional help, the group searched the Internet:
“We also Googled the same thing and tried to find something other resources…Cause
[sic] we can’t just copy the example, we need to find out if there are other examples, and
the examples did not provide all the ways to implement for the assignment.”
When asked why the group used Google as the search engine of choice, the participant
responded, “I just have the feeling that Google can provide everything that you search for on the
Internet.” The student reflected on his/her early usage of the Internet, and first introduction to

111

Google as a junior high school student in the early 2000s in China, as a main factor in the
decision to use and trust Google as an all-knowing source.
The participant then described retrieval techniques and the search process in detail. “I
first know what I am going to search and know very well and start searching,” the student
recalled. A process for finding search terms also was determined. “Go to a dictionary or a
wiki…It’s called Wikipedia…The old encyclopedias we have provided us all the information
and you just trust them,” stated the participant.
This comment led to a series of questions addressing authority control and the accuracy
of information on a wiki. “So edit by other people, so if one person makes a mistake, others will
correct it,” the student noted. When asked how one could determine whether information was
corrected, the student pondered, “Wow, I never thought of that…Never thought about that.”
This revelation exemplifies how the SMM detects sense-making as well as the unmaking of
sense. In this example, the participant reflected on past behavior and appeared to experience an
unmaking of sense.
By using resources provided by the professor and TA, supplemented by information
found online, the group built their website. “I reached my goal, which was implement [sic] all
the functions in the program,” stated the student. “…It was the requirements of the
assignment…The assignment was complete…Meet all the requirements and the grade was OK,
full credit.” The participant felt “successful” after completing the assignment. Completing the
assignment and receiving a positive grade seemed to support the participant’s successful feeling
regarding the information-seeking process.
The next programming example highlighted a type of cultural barrier. The student
encountered a gap when trying to understand the assignment instructions to perform a generic

112

programming task in Java. Assignments such as these can be viewed as imposed queries. This
term refers to questions imposed on others that may be difficult to answer because they do not
originate within the seeker (Gross, 2005, p.164). In such instances the question can become
muddled and difficult to understand during the transmission of a query, from the creator, to a
designee. The participant explained feeling this lack of clarity in trying to understand each
week’s assignment instructions.
“…each week we are assigned to do an assignment and about the assignment, most of us
were not clear what we were supposed to do. Some of my classmates will work together
to think about the words of the professor…Sometimes the professor is not clear about the
instructions and makes mistake [sic], and even in this situation we have to discuss with
classmates or ask the professor.”
The participant was asked what help he/she sought to overcome this muddle in the instruction:
“So, later on, I sent an email to my other classmates. Two of my other classmates gave
me two different answers and I compared them in my mind and I did that…Sometimes I
ask the professor directly and he will reply very quickly, but I think it’s a kind of laziness
to ask the teacher question in email.”
Based upon childhood experiences, the participant was reluctant to ask the professor clarifying
questions because he/she perceived this as a form of “laziness” and a sign of “not listening in
class.” Elaborating, the participant explained within a cultural context why he/she did not
directly ask for the professor’s help:
“No, I knew that if I ask for help I will get help, but I didn’t want to tell that I wasn’t
aware about this. I think many Chinese students have the same problem as me…I talk to

113

my friends, if they were not the same way they would not check the assignment with me,
they would check with the professor.”
Progressing through the information problem, the participant sought assistance from friends:
“When you are in trouble, you will go to your friends first because Chinese students are
closer to you…Based on the language and cultural problems, you are more easy [sic] to
get closer to Chinese students...I have friends from other nations, I have a friend who is
Saudi and we work together a lot, and a classmate from Thailand and we work together a
lot.”
Foremost, the participant sought the help of friends in the class who shared a native language and
ethnic culture. For this assignment, though, the participant asked a friend from Thailand for help
because, “the friend from Thailand always tells the right one (answer).”
“I did well,” recalled the student when asked about the outcome, “I got 10 out of 10.” The
participant obtained clarification for the assignment instructions from a classmate and was able
to bridge the information gap.
Problem-solving in tasks related to computer programming can sometimes take on the
form of a mathematical problem or equation. This was the case for one participant who needed
help calculating a parameter when developing a design to optimize a network. The participant
shared his struggle to find help in solving the problem. His first source of assistance was the
instructor, who, according to the student, responded, “If I can give you the answers, why would I
give you questions?” This response created angst for the participant, who recalled thinking,
“There is no solution to that question, the problem is like a disaster.” The participant then asked
a classmate for assistance:

114

“We always discuss with each other, I thought he would have a better understanding of
this topic because he has a better understanding in the classroom. He always gets out all
the correct questions that satisfy the professor…I asked him to go ask the professor, and
the professor told him the same thing.”
Unable to answer the questions on their own, the participant and classmate tried to problemsolve together. “Maybe we counted the answers that could be correct or partition [sic] that could
be correct,” stated the student.
The pair decided not to consult any additional resources while attempting to solve the
problem and they remained stuck in their gap. “No, because, since the professor said you can use
the topic in the class slides and you can’t find enough information in the slides, so that’s all,”
explained the student. After reviewing the course resources the participant sought further
assistance through a friend with a background in mathematics:
“If this is a mathematical question, you cannot find the answers, work it out. No useful
resources can be accessed. You should ask some guy who major in mathematics for
help…This is just some mathematical problems and you don’t know how to model or list
the equations. You should solve that you should ask mathematical guys for help [sic]. But
if you can’t understand the question at all, you should find some resources in the textbook
or reference book…I asked some mathematical guys for help…I just have a friend, he
major [sic] in mathematics.”
Asking the mathematics major for help was not successful:
“Since the value he calculated out was ridiculous…Give up. If all these methods do work
out; the professor, the textbook, the reference books, online resources, the mathematic

115

guys, if all of them can’t help me, then I can’t find another helpful method to deal with
it.”
When asked if he/she had experienced difficulty completing an assignment before, the
participant said the professor will provide the answer. “I feel, I’ve done enough to solve this
problem and it still doesn’t work out,” the student noted. “…If nobody work it out in class, he
(the professor) will explain to us.”
However, others in the class were able to solve the problem. “Yes, some of them but I
can’t identify who can work out the answers,” recalled the student. In this instance, the
participant was unable to resolve the information problem through utilizing the resources and
helps present within their personal network of known helps. Asked whether changing an aspect
of the information-seeking process might have helped solve the information problem, the student
replied, “I think if the professor had more patients [sic] to explain his idea to us and give us more
specific hints to understand the content of the slides that would be more helpful.” This example
may demonstrate the importance of maintaining positive inclusive communication in support of
aiding student learning.
Synthesizing multiple skill and knowledge sets is another problem-solving technique
required in computer programming. One participant recalled creating a website with a group
member that required the use of three programming languages. However, the website would not
display or function according to the participant’s design. The student explored several avenues to
solve the problem:
“I guess I tried different ways. First, I looked in my textbook and notes because it’s most
familiar on-hand but if I don’t find anything helpful I look online. But if I can’t find it
online, then I would have to turn to a friend. Programming is about experience, the more

116

experience, the more things you’ve done, the more flexible you will be…In terms of
programming, the project we are working on, the instructor doesn’t care about coding but
he cares about the final product.”
When asked how the pair determined who to ask for help, the participant said: “First, I go
to friends I know… after that, through our discussion, it is always beneficial to go them [sic]
with my problem…don’t know, but usually we can find alternative or solutions.” The group
decided not to consult the instructor for assistance:
“The instructor doesn’t get involved. Just gives us approval of the proposal and
guidance…Because I think it’s a project and it’s not a simple mathematical
problem with an answer. There is no right or wrong answer on a project. Only the
co-workers who are devoted to the project can know that. The group members
take care of the group project, and anyone outside of the group isn’t involved, like
the professor.”
Ultimately, the participant completed the assignment using a variety of sources, including
the textbook, online resources, and friends to help bridge the information gap. “Like problemsolving, there are multiple ways to do that and no one can figure it. So we tried it an alternative
way and it worked,” the student explained.

4.6.3

Bridges & Outcomes: Student Life Tasks

In addition to problems encountered in the classroom, participants also experienced difficulties
stemming from the need to explore secondary educational opportunities, and to acquire
information related to future employment. This construct appeared in two participants’ responses
as they recalled their attempts to gain experience through internships, learn new computer117

programming skills identified in job advertisements, and read Internet forums on employment
opportunities and advice.
One participant who was nearing the end of his/her studies described difficulty learning
Java Eclipse, a computer-programming language identified as an employment requirement in
many job postings.
“Recently I’ve been looking for jobs, and the descriptions of the jobs said you need to
know JEE (JAVA Entrance Exam). You need to know this tool, that tool. I know that’s
the skills I need if I want to have a job…Now, I haven’t gotten anyone to help me but I
do know someone, a student that has graduated and go for a job [sic]. They may know
better, but I don’t know if I can just ask them, because that may be a bother to them.”
When asked what other resources he/she might use to learn the program, the student
responded:
“I just think, maybe I should read more books because books tell you more…I feel that
no one can help me, why not try the books. Or, maybe it’s because lately I think besides
what I wanted to learn from the books, I’ve got other information that I didn’t plan on
getting from the book.”
The participant shared an instance in which books proved to be a helpful resource:
“Like, I was reading a book Programming for Interview and I was just looking for some
data structure examples and interview questions. But after reading other chapters, like
how could you react, those non-technical questions. I think it’s fantastic. It’s very useful.
I couldn’t think of such questions, if you never read the book.”
Obtaining the books was a multistep process:

118

“…First, I searched our online library at our university and try that book, but I noticed
that we don’t have that book. I noticed that our library doesn’t have books released in
recent years. So, I will try Amazon. Of course, they have that book.”
The participant recalled a previous negative experience with a librarian as the reason for why
he/she did not ask for help when the appropriate book could not be found:
“No, because I just realized that if I can’t find a book in the online system, and I turn to a
librarian, what she or he does is just does the same thing I just did-search the system in
our library (SIS). Actually, I wanted some type of suggestions but they just search the
system and say what they have now and what they could give me, and give me the
number like ‘q870’ (LC call number). And you can find this book experience, so I just
assumed that if I asked them it would just be the same thing.”
The student then turned to a teaching assistant for help:
“Like I said, there is this one guy (teaching assistant) and he just told me this book is very
good and I figure he might think of that and get that information from some professor or
classmates and he told me that it’s very useful. Also, I draw my conclusion from what
other people say about that book before I buy it. Although I find some people say that
there are some errors, but I still think if someone recommend this book, I should at least
look at this book.”
Conversely, the participant did not ask his/her advisor for help:
“No, because I have a feeling that they don’t want to be bothered…Because there was
this one time, I have an advisor and he is in some type of special track and I asked him
for suggestion [sic] that are not related to his track and he just ask me, ‘why didn’t you

119

chose my track?’ And, after that, I just felt that he didn’t pay enough attention to my
question so I feel that I don’t want such an experience again.”
It appears that past experiences determined what sources the student turned to for help. While
negative experiences with a librarian and an academic advisor created dismissive feelings when
seeking future help, a positive past experience with a teaching assistant lead to assistance in this
instance. The participant was still seeking help at the time of data collection and had yet to
resolve the information problem.
In another example, a participant in his/her first semester of studies discussed difficulty
understanding the relationship between psychology and computing, and why this muddle created
angst:
“You know, we are just international students and not like American students. Maybe the
only job qualified for us is coder. So, the only job I can do is coder. I heard that in
America, international students after they graduate, some companies cannot give
management position to international students.”
Asked where the participant learned of this information, and knew it was reliable, he/she
responded:
“From other people…Lots of Chinese people go abroad and we talk to each other and
some stay in American [sic] a long time…When people tell me something, I can’t trust
them, but if lots of people tell me the same thing, I can trust them…All application, a
website something about MSN, and also my friends. The information told me that
international students can only get a job (as a coder).”

120

The participant was then asked how this information made him/her feel. “Make me feel?” the
student replied. “I always feel nothing. I feel a little disappointed…Makes me want to make my
background much more powerful, much more than my profession.”
Next, the student was asked if he/she sought clarification regarding the interdisciplinary nature of
the course from a professor.
“Yes, he told me there is a link but really the link is not really big…My instructor said
the link is not big but there is a relationship. He told me there is a link related to
psychology in this course and program.”
While this participant was still making sense of the information problem at the time of data
collection, it appeared that the gap in understanding and perceiving future employment prospects
reached beyond the course work and into a deeper issue of cultural perceptions surrounding
equality of employment in a global market.
Making academic curriculum decisions was an anxiety-causing situation for one
participant who described the resources used in the process of making sense of the gap caused by
selecting a course during his/her first semester of graduate studies in the United States :
“I’m not sure which course I will drop because this course is all in time. I’m back and
forth on how to select my course. I talk to my advisor and three times about how to select
my course. He gave me some advice…I just told him which class I have selected. He
helped me to drop some course cause [sic] I applied to drop some foundation course
cause [sic] some course I have done from my undergraduate study…but I have attended
some of the class and it is useful, I have never learned.”
The participant indicated that he/she did not receive any advisement prior to signing up for
courses:

121

“No, before I selected my courses, I say, I just say, I just talk with him (the advisor) and I
select my course. He is very nice and I dropped his course and he said, ‘It’s up to
you’...First time he give a list of around four classes, but it’s just a suggestion. He told me
that I can select what I feel.”
At the time of data collection, the participant had not determined how to resolve this muddle and
did not expand further on any other academic advisement resources he/she was planning to
consult.
For international students who are not native English speakers, additional challenges may
occur in both social and educational situations. One participant detailed challenges with English
language fluency:
“Because nobody says it in real life. Like, when you are a kid and start to learn the new
words. Sometimes they just know the words in the beginning but when the parents says
the word in a sentence a lot, the kids can understand how to use the word. But when I
studied English, most of the time I have to look it up in the dictionary, but half of the
time I don’t know how to use the word. Sometimes when I hear Americans talk to say the
sentence sometimes just once I can understand how to use the word.”
The participant expanded on this information language gap within a social context of speaking to
classmates:
“Because it is hard for Chinese students to talk with people who speak native English,
and we want to talk but we don’t know what they are talking about. I think they are
talking about one movie we (Chinese students) have already watched and we know what
they are talking about but we can’t say anything in the talk.”

122

The participant added that English language fluency can also cause difficulty in the writing
process:
“That is difficult because sometimes when I write some essays I really want to use some
difficult words like GRE level, but it is really hard for me to use them. Sometimes when I
take the GRE test, I know the meaning of this word but I don’t know how to use it…I
can’t talk about it in depth, so I know it’s about my working experience so sometimes I
can’t understand or use my experience to discuss in the essay.”
This gap in English language fluency also seemed to hinder the student’s ability to make
sense of their information problems when writing or engaging with unfamiliar subject areas. The
participant described the following situation, “Like the Online Information Behavior (course), it
true [sic] that I don’t have a lot of working experience. So, sometimes I write one thousand
words and the grade is not good.”
The participant asked the instructor for assistance in order to more actively engage and
participate in the course:
“I sent her an email and tried to schedule a time and he [sic] give me the address and I
went to her office…I talked with her and tell her the problem I have and she can
understand cause she knew I didn’t have enough working experience, and after every
class she ask me whether I understand or not. I can feel pain in the class.”
Asked why the participant felt pain in the course, he/she said:
“Cause [sic] sometimes I can’t talk in the class like other people. They have the similar
experience or they were in the same situation at work. I really wanted to say
something…Like real experience, to share experience, but I don’t have that so I don’t feel
very happy.”

123

The participant was asked if the instructor helped him/her to engage with the learning
process and make sense of the course content. “I think she just try to…I don’t think she really
assist me because nothing can help me with real working experience,” the student speculated.
The participant felt that the instructor could not help him/her to gain a deeper knowledge of the
course because:
“I think the working experience is different from the book. The knowledge you learn is
the real thing when you are at work and how to deal with the relationship with your
colleague or leader. Maybe you know how to deal with them, but it’s not a real
experience.”
The participant decided not to seek additional information resources. “No, it’s useless to
find assistance because I’m lacking so it’s useless to find others help,” stated the student,
offering a suggestion for changing the situation. “I think she can lower the requirements for me
because I think I should take this course later, but already [sic] took the class. I just think she
need [sic] to lower the requirements for me.” This participant’s language difficulties appeared to
create additional information gaps. Although the participant initially had difficulty conversing
with classmates, the problem expanded, creating other problems in his/her academic studies.

SUMMARY

This chapter presented the findings from this study. Participants shared their sense-making
process from their experiences as undergraduates in China and as graduate international students
in the United States. Parallels were found in the situations, gaps, bridges, and outcomes that
participants shared in describing information problems related to their studies, both in China and
124

the United States, in the form of assignments related to writing tasks and computer programming
tasks. New situations, gaps, bridges, and outcomes appeared in relation to participants’
experiences as graduate students in the United States and as sojourners learning to navigate a
new country and educational system in a new cultural context.
Reliance on personal networks to help with navigating information problems was
described by participants while undergraduates in China and as graduate students while studying
in the United States. This parallel in behavior may support the importance of the role of personal
networks of graduate international students in their information-seeking process as it relates to
their studies.

Related to participants’ use of personal networks, was the possible lack of

awareness of resources and helps outside of their networks.
As graduate students studying in the United States, having a narrow or limited network,
seemed to cause participants difficulty in identifying unknown sources of help. This somewhat
insular behavior might be tied to participants' assumptions and understanding of the process of
identifying reliable information. Another parallel between participants’ understanding of
identifying and evaluating reliable and authoritative information as graduate students also
appears to possibly be carried over from their undergraduate behavior in China. These emergent
themes will be further explored in the Discussion section.

DISCUSSION & CONCLUSION

This chapter provides recommendations and concluding remarks for this study. Section 5.1
discusses recommendations for library practitioners based on the findings of this study. Section
5.2 discusses the findings of this study as they relate to previous research and theories. 5.3 offers
recommendations regarding Dervin’s SMM and the utilization of cross-cultural interview
protocols. Section 5.3 provides a conclusion by briefly re-stating the findings of the study in
support of the main driving research question.

5.1

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR LIBRARY PRACTITIONERS

Developing evidence-based models for detecting and evaluating student attitudes towards
information may assist in the creation of more culturally responsive services and methods of
instruction by librarians. Being able to detect student perceptions of information types, and
information environments, may aid in identifying how an information provider is, and is not,
supporting his/her constituencies or users. In this study, it was evident that participants were not
fully aware of the information resources and services made available to them as graduate
students. In addition, participants did not seem to possess an understanding of how to evaluate
and determine the authority of the information resources that they were using to support their
studies. Prior research, identified in the literature review, offers support for the need to advocate
126

for providing culturally responsive library instruction, services, and research to support
international student populations (Lewis, 1969; Lopez, 1983; Lafon, 1992; Morrissey & Given,
2006). This study adds to this body of work, and indicates the importance of understanding why,
and how, international students IB may be different from domestic non-international students.
This study offers support for the need of librarians to understand how the intersection of a
task, and the information resource necessary to complete that task, may not necessarily be found
in an academic library resource. Such was the case in this study when participants were seeking
API data or computer programming trouble shooting. This is significant, as it suggests the need
for library inclusion in curriculum processes. If a library’s collections and services do not
concurrently align with the curriculum and scholarship, it will not be able to support students in
their studies, and the library will not serve an active role in student learning.
This study’s findings provide evidence that international students’ information needs
extend beyond their academic studies to situations related to acculturation to a new country and
academic administrative systems. In this process of trying to learn a new educational and social
environment, these students may also have the added challenge of struggling to overcome their
cultural assumptions towards North American culture, which might have prevented them from
making sense of their situation. Studying IB may assist in detecting and understanding what
assumptions students may have towards information, and the providers responsible for
facilitating and promoting a collection. Using this evidence, one may be able to build more
culturally responsive services and instructions, as well as support existing models and methods.
Based on the findings of this study, the researcher offers some practical suggestions on
how academic librarians and libraries may better support to international students during their
intercultural learning experience.

127

1. Support the development of cultural competencies through awareness of cultural
differences in education systems. In order to gain perspective on similarities and
differences in academic libraries and education systems, librarians can seek to investigate
the countries and associated education systems that their institutions’ international
students are coming from. By doing so, librarians may gain an awareness of areas of
need, and as a result, provide support that will better assist international students.
2. Support the development of cross-cultural communication through student engagement.
Librarians may consider participating in outreach activities that involve supporting
international students in their acquisition of learning to navigate their new education
system. By understanding about the challenges students may face while learning to
navigate a new education system, librarians might develop an awareness of international
student needs, and obtain practice, in communicating with persons whom they might not
share a similar cultural, ethnic, or linguistic background.
3. Provide culturally responsive library orientations and services. Librarians may seek to
better understand the needs of international students, by soliciting from international
students, what similarities, differences, or gaps they notice between their previous
education experiences and their current ones. By creating this model of instruction, it
may support cultural relevancy, and assist librarians in better understanding students’
information needs. Facilitation of this model may be accomplished through student
engagement, and liaison work with the student services responsible for assisting
international students.

128

4. Create joint programming and establish liaison ties with other support services within an
academic institution. Librarians can assist students in both their academic needs and
everyday information need by promoting the appropriate resources, services, and
collections. This could come in the form of sharing information resources with academic
advisors, faculty, and career services. In addition with soliciting information problems
and collection development suggestions from liaison partners.
The above suggestions are based upon reflection on the study's findings and previous literature
on international students. In order for the above suggestions to be executed in practice, support
must first come from the administration of an institution. Leadership must make it an initiative to
address the information needs of international students; librarians should not be expected to work
alone, or without institutional support.
Lastly, international students are an ever-changing population of students whose needs
may reflect the countries from which they originated. There is no guarantee that all higher
education institutions in the United States will have similar composition of students as those
reflected in this study. Each institution should seek to investigate where their international
students come from and how their unique needs may, or may not, be met.

5.2

IMPLICATIONS FOR THEORY

This study sought to answer the question: How do international graduate students from China
make sense of the information they need in support of their intercultural learning experience?
The participants in this study made sense of their intercultural learning experience by relying on
previous information-seeking habits practiced as undergraduates in China, such as reliance on
129

personal networks, and assumptions towards authority of information. They sought, more
readily, the help of their professors, and persons who demonstrated a mastery of subject
knowledge i.e., “good grades,” rather than seeking out academic services such as libraries and
librarians.
The participants in this study, shared with the researcher, first, their experiences in
seeking information as undergraduates in their native country of China. These situations dealt
primarily with completing school assignments related to computer programming and writing
assignments, such as their undergraduate thesis. Participants did not describe or identify an
information problem unrelated to an assignment, or outside the context of school studies.
As graduate students in the United States, participants, again, shared with the researcher,
situations where they were seeking information related to computer programming and writing
assignments; however, the scope of the situations broadened, as they also described situations
related to acculturation and employment readiness. The emphasis of this study was on
participants’ educational studies, however, they also expressed information needs for everyday
living, such as job readiness, navigating a new country, culture, and education system.
Information gaps related to participants’ studies were not all directly caused by their
assignment tasks. In two instances, participants expressed information gaps that were created by
participants’ fear of judgment by their professors. One participant expressed her/his anxiety of
judgment by the professor in relation to his/her ability to communicate clearly in English.
Another participant expressed a concern with appearing lazy in the eyes of the professor by
asking for clarification on a homework assignment’s instructions. Participants’ anxiety, and
concern of possible judgment by their professors, appeared to prevent them from asking for help.

130

These instances align with the findings presented in Belle Wang’s (2006) study of eight
Chinese undergraduate and graduate students at Victoria University of Wellington, New
Zealand. Wang (2006) cited students not asking for help from librarians out of fear of losing face
and experiencing embarrassment. Although participants’ anxiety of judgment by an educator was
not specifically directed at a librarian in this study, the avoidance behavior was similar to that
described by Wang’s (2006) participants. This finding may suggest the need to investigate
whether avoidance behavior that appears in the ISB of PRC international students is also present
in other Western education environments.
Access to information was also a common theme in the gaps that participants shared. As
undergraduates in China, inhibitors to the access of information included barriers created by
Internet filtering by PRC government, as well as proprietary information (English language
journals). Information gaps related to information access due to government control or
proprietary access had not been identified in prior research. This may be attributed to the sample
population of this study and may support the need to investigate specific international student
populations’ information environments prior to studying in the United States.
Personal Learning Networks (PLN) can be described as personalized networks of
knowledge sources utilized in support of understanding and learning. PLN is not a new concept
as people have been utilizing networks of information resources (friends, family, books,
newspapers, radio, television, etc.) for years (Warlick, 2009). David Warlick (2009) described
three types of PLNs: personally maintained synchronous connections, personally and socially
maintained synchronous connections, and dynamically maintained asynchronous connections.
The importance of the three categories of PLNs described by Warlick (2009) is that the
Internet has made it possible for individuals to have, and maintain, constant access to resources

131

and channels of help in using information, regardless of time and place. PLNs help people to
acquire information outside of their physical or geographic location, and to access and solicit
help from people and resources unknown to the individual. A limitation of PLNs can be the lack
of diversity of knowledge and perspectives on information (Warlick, 2009), as this may prevent
introduction to diverse concepts, perspectives, and unfamiliar helps.
As graduate students, access to information seemed to be created by participants’
awareness of resources for helps. As undergraduates, participants turned to their personal
learning networks (PLNs) that often included Internet message boards and fellow classmates,
friends, and family. As graduate students, participants again relied on their PLNs that tended to
include primarily fellow Mandarin speakers. As a result of the narrowness of their PLNs,
participants expressed not knowing where to find help or information for new situations not
previously experienced.
In sections 4.5.5 and 4.6.3, a participant described their information needs related to
banking, international postal mailing, and health care, in support of living in a new country while
navigating a new education system. The participant who shared these information needs was
stuck at the time of the study and unsure of how or where she/he would find help to resolve their
information problems. Everyday life information seeking (ELIS) has been described as “the
acquisition of various informational (both cognitive and expressive) elements, which people
employ to orient themselves in daily life or to solve problems not directly associated with the
performance of occupational tasks” (Savolainen, 1995, pp. 266–267). The information needs of
the participant above may suggest that further research is needed to investigate the ELIS of
international students and if there is an intersection between their ISB related to their academic
studies, and those of learning to navigate a new country and education system.

132

Students in this study also expressed to the researcher that they sought information for
carrying out daily tasks that they experienced as a new student learning to navigate a new
country and academic environment. The detection of this additional level of skills suggests that
international students need more support in their educational learning process, beyond
information skills that support academic work. Additional research investigating what
information problems international students experience while pursuing their studies would assist
in further understanding how these populations of students are being supported. This type of
information would assist higher education institutions in identifying how information resources
are being utilized. One method that supported the detection of the level of awareness of available
academic helps to participants was found in their descriptions of libraries and librarians.
Participants did not seem to extensively use their academic librarians for help with their
information problems as graduate students. Although one participant sought out reference chat
services, they did not follow up on their request for further assistance in spite of being stuck in
their gap.
Although some participants described librarians at the University of Pittsburgh as helpful
and knowledgeable, participants overall did not seem to fully understand the extent of academic
support that they were offered by their Library system. Participants in this study shared with the
researcher their opinions of libraries in China, which were similar to the opinions of participants
in Hilary Hughes’s (2010) doctoral research on international students in Australia. Hughes’
participants from China reported not needing to use the library during their undergraduate
studies, and described Chinese libraries as having collections that lacked currency. This study
reported similar findings in participants’ descriptions of their undergraduate libraries in China.
This may suggest that these cultural differences need further investigation. These differences

133

may provide an area of discussion for academic librarians when engaging Chinese PRC graduate
students in understanding the role of academic libraries and librarians in their education process.
Awareness and assessment of authoritative information appeared as a struggle for this
participant population and brings into question the concept of information literacy (IL) within a
Chinese context. IL is a cultural construct that currently does not have a uniform definition or set
of standards in China (Li, X., 2006). This lack of uniformity may have influenced participants’
perceptions of authority of information. In this study, participants primarily described using the
reputation of an education institution as an indicator of authority, rather than the content,
structure, and context of the information itself. This may be a reflection of Chinese higher
education and its practices of distribution of financial support by the PRC government.
Higher education in China is managed and regulated by the Chinese government. The
Ministry of Education manages the publication of textbooks and curriculum (Wang, 2003). The
government also controls the publications of academic journals (Atwill, 2005) through their
monitoring of news and publications in general. Although there are a few private universities, the
majority of higher education institutions are regulated, ranked, and funded by the PRC
government (Wang, 2003). This close relationship between research institutions and academic
publications may give insight into the assumptions about academic information expressed by the
PRC students in this study. Further research is needed to investigate what types of assumptions
and feelings PRC students have towards academic information and if these assumptions affect
their behavior.
PRC students’ understanding of IL within a North American context needs further
investigation in the area of copyright. On this study, participants shared responses with the
researcher regarding awareness of copyright, and methods of providing attribution for usage of

134

intellectual property in school assignments. This finding differs from previous research on
graduate PRC students in Canada that reported subjects not learning about plagiarism prior to
studying in Canada (Morrissey & Given, 2006). This differing finding may suggest the need to
further investigate the PRC students’ understanding of plagiarism within a North American
higher education environment.
Participants in this study described to the researcher how they navigated through their
intercultural learning experience. They expressed a reliance on personal networks similar to their
behavior as undergraduates in China, however, they tended to limit their networks in the United
States to primarily include only other Chinese students, like themselves, due to language and
cultural familiarity. By narrowing their networks they express feelings of lack of awareness of
unknown helps. They expressed attitudes of assumptions towards identifying reliable
information to support them in making sense of their information problems. Participants
described progressing through their information problems and being stuck. Participant told the
researcher about the positive and negative outcomes to their information problems. Ultimately,
participants provided genuine insight into their ISB, which serves to identify areas of need for
this growing population of international students in the United States.

5.3

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR METHODOLOGY

Dervin’s SMM appears as a straightforward method, however, this research did not find it to be
so. In order for a researcher to successfully carry out a SMM study, the theoretical foundation
which the methodology is built upon, must be fully understood. This understanding ensures a
process where the participants possess the power to direct the study through the value placed on
135

their own words and experiences. In providing the participants with the freedom to construct
their reality and perspective on a specific situation, they provide genuine and authentic insight
into their information behavior. To negate the process of relinquishing control to the participant,
would hinder the development of Praxis in the research (see section 1.5), and undermine the
SMM methodology.
Those wishing to utilize the SMM and time-line interview method with participant
populations that may not acknowledge having information problems, or who may be reluctant to
share problems, may consider the following advice:
-

Provide participants with interview questions ahead of time

-

Explain the interview process and solicit for questions that they may have

-

Explain that any questions or muddles that the interviewer can answer for them will be
clarified during the debriefing process after the interview

-

Provide continual affirmation that their confidentiality will be protected during the
interview

-

After the interview, express and acknowledge their contribution to your study and offer
the option to have a copy of the interview recording or transcript

Communicating transparency, and the agenda of the study, is imperative to building the
initial trust between the participant and the researcher. By establishing trust, and supporting a
positive and welcoming environment, this researcher believes that it helps participants to feel at
ease in the reflection process during the interview, which is necessary for Praxis. The selfreflection helps to identify hurts or problems in which some persons may have been taught to
suppress or not share with strangers. Once these feelings of hurt are shared, it is important for the

136

researcher to acknowledge them, as it aids in both the communication process, and supports the
participant in sharing.

5.4

RECOMMENDATIONS ON WORKING WITH AN INTERPRETER

In this study, the researcher utilized an interpreter to assist in the process of qualitative
interviews. The purpose of the interviews was to investigate the information-seeking behavior of
international graduate student from China (PRC). Protecting participant data and confidentiality
was a key ethical issue identified with using an interpreter from among a peer member. By
having a peer present during the interview, participants could possible feel threatened that any
information would be compromised, and thus alter the accuracy of the data. Furthermore, by
having an interpreter present, participants might feel that the research holds certain assumptions
or biases against non-native English speakers. Those wishing to utilize an interpreter in
conjunction with the SMM should consider how this may hinder the communication between the
researcher and participant.

5.4.1

Theoretical Challenges

The decision to have an interpreter available for student use during the interview was to support
cross-cultural research protocol by supporting dialog, expression, and cultural context. However,
the vulnerability in which the participants positioned themselves, in order to reveal their
information behavior, was jeopardized by the loss of confidentiality with a peer present in the
interview. Though the subject matter of the interview was not associated with posing any risk of
137

physical harm to the participants, there was an issue of possible socio-cultural status at jeopardy.
Since the interpreter was a peer to the participants’ with the same or similar linguistic ability and
educational status, this might influence the participant’s level of comfort during the interview by
causing the participants to be defensive of the researcher who has imposed a bias against their
ability to communicate in English.

5.4.2

Logistical Challenges

At the beginning of the research study, the researcher had planned to make the interpreter
available for all interviews with the purpose of assisting in clear communication between
participant and researcher. However, by the second interview, a few concerns arose related to the
limitations of using an interpreter. First, participants in the research study did not necessarily
need an interpreter depending on their level of fluency in spoken English. Since the participants
in the study were current university level graduate students, they had some level of fluency in
English.
Unlike previous research studies that have utilized interpreters to work with immigrant or
refugee populations, international graduate students are sojourners that arrive to school with a
certain expected amount of fluency of language, as denoted by some sort of entrance exam.
Though, an exam score cannot guarantee fluency in a language, it does denote the student’s
ability to take course work in English at a graduate level. Taking this unique aspect into
consideration, this supported the decision to make the interpreter optional. Additional logistical
challenges identified with this study included difficulty in scheduling interviews due to the
interpreter’s availability. At the onset of the study the interpreter stated that he/she was available

138

to participate in the study any day of the week. However, once the study began, the interpreter
changed his/her availability and limited his/her days available to assist in the study due to
gaining an internship. The reduced availability of the interpreter limited the researcher in being
able to proceed with scheduled interviews, and further supported the ultimate decision to make
the interpreter optional upon request. For interviews where an interpreter was not present, a
Chinese-English to English-Chinese Dictionary was provided. The dictionary was selected and
provided on loan through the East Asian Studies collection at the University of Pittsburgh and
utilized by two participants.
Once the interpreter was made optional, only two participants requested that the
interpreter be present. For the interviews that the interpreter provided assistance, further work
was performed in the role of translator. In the transcription of the audio, the interpreter translated
the Mandarin into both English and Pinyin. The purpose of the Pinyin text, was to serve in the
cross checking of the translation by another Mandarin speaker to verify that the conversation had
been properly translated from Mandarin to English. In this capacity, the interpreter supported
cross-cultural interview protocols.
It was the decision of the researcher to ultimately make the interpreter optional during the
interviews. Ultimately the researcher did not detect any hindrance in the communication between
the participants and herself. In one instance a participant responded back to the researcher in
Mandarin. At that particular point in the interview the participant had become so comfortable
with the researcher that when she affirmed a statement, confirmation of “yes” came out in
Mandarin. The participant continued in the conversation without hesitation or halt. Future studies
may want to consider having an interpreter, and a dictionary available, for interviewing
participants who do not share the same native language as the researcher. However, one should

139

be privy to how it may impact intimacy and confidentiality of the interview. Future researchers
wishing to interview participants whose native language is not shared with the participant
population may have to ask for clarification from participants to ensure clarity of understanding.
Participants were given the option to utilize an interpreter or a dictionary. For the most
part participants opted to not use the interpreter and did not express difficulty in conversing.
However, some participants did have difficulty using pronouns which caused some confusion for
the researcher, here is one such example:
“We, before you did this project, we knew nothing about this. You were just a major in
this in Urban Planning and Environment. But after this situation you have a better
knowledge about this.”
Clarity of the interviewees’ responses was supported with the assistance of both the
interpreter and two additional native Mandarin speakers that assisted with the transcription
process of the interview recordings. Through this extra effort of reviewing transcriptions, it
supported the trustworthiness of the data and clarity of understanding.

5.5

CONCLUSION

Understanding student perceptions and attitudes towards information provides librarians and
educators insight into student information usage. In this study, participants’ perceptions of
authority of information may assist in explaining why the majority of Chinese international
students in this study did not explicitly report using the academic information resources and
services to the fullest. By not using the library services and collections extensively, participants
140

in this study limited their options for addressing information problems and their associated
information needs. Further research is needed to investigate the types of assumptions and
feelings that may appear in the information behavior of Chinese international students as it
relates to authority of information.
Future studies may want to investigate the information-behavior of other cultural groups
of international graduate students in comparison to PRC students to determine if similar
hindrances to information use are experienced. Further methods for investigating international
students’ PLNs might include ethnographic methods to studying their information-seeking
behavior. Potential approaches may include qualitative data collection through reflective
journaling, daily or weekly records of their use of information, and the use of other information
institutions complementary to libraries. This may provide a deeper and richer understanding of
international student’s information behavior.
