DEDICATION
Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let
us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles.
And let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us, fixing our
eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith. For the joy set before him
he endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of
the throne o f God. (Heb. 12:1-3, New International Version)
This dissertation is dedicated to the great cloud of witnesses who have surrounded
me throughout my life and especially during this journey. There are some names that I
can call, such as those o f my great-grandmother and grandmother, respectively, Daisy
Burrell Neal Horton, Ella Delores Crawford Webb, my grandfather, Henry Idus “Pete”
Collins, Jr., and my uncles, Melton Frank Eason, Sr., and Hollis Larry Eason. Other
witnesses I was not privileged to know. Known or unknown, you are with me all the
time, reminding me, in the words o f the late Dr. Maya Angelou that I am “fine, just fine”
(Spelman College, 2014). Through your collective sacrifice, I was equipped for this
journey and I am eternally indebted and grateful to you all.

Harris, I cannot thank you enough for giving me the freedom to explore this topic. I am
also grateful to the other members o f my committee for their support. To Dr. Olivia
Boggs, thank you for understanding the importance of this topic. To Dr. Carol Isaac, I
appreciate your constant encouragement, support, positivity, and cheerleader-attitude. To
Dr. Mary O ’Phelan, thank you for pushing me and for asking the hard questions that
forced me to think in ways that I had not done before.
To my mother, Patricia Eason Walker, I am eternally grateful to you for your love
and support, not just through the completion o f this study, but in every challenge that I
have faced in my life. Thanks is also extended to my father, Donald Walker, for his quiet
but steadfast love and to my siblings, Donna Gail Walker Thompson and Sean Edward
Walker for their support and encouragement. Appreciation is also due to my Granny,
Mrs. Etta Gay Collins, for constantly letting me know how proud she is of me and how
elated she is that I have been able to take advantage o f opportunities and experiences that
time and circumstance denied to her.
I am indebted to the many librarians who have served as mentors to me. I was
introduced to the uniqueness and beauty of libraries at historically Black colleges and
universities through the kindness and generosity of Dr. Carole Taylor and the late Mrs.
Doris Gosier, who provided me with my first academic library experience at the Henry

Alexander Hunt Memorial Library at Fort Valley State University. Along this journey, I
have been privileged to have the support of many other librarians and archivists,
including, Nancy Davis-Bray, Lorene Flanders, Dr. Laveme McLaughlin, Sybil McNeil,
Merryl Penson, Betty Rogers, Emma Stanley, and Wanda Thomas. Special thanks is
extended to Angela Brice for encouraging me and for expeditiously obtaining so many
interlibrary loans on my behalf. I am also appreciative to the administration and my
colleagues at Georgia College and the Ina Dillard Russell Library, including Dr. Kelli
Brown, Dr. Joe Mocnik, and Dr. Steven Jones for your support through the Faculty
Research Grant.
Acknowledgement is also due to two senior librarians under whom I was
privileged to grow, both personally and professionally, Dr. Dorothy M. Haith and Ms.
Wilmetta Jackson. In addition to these mentors, I have a special network of peers and
colleagues to whom I am indebted. I call them my “sister-colleagues”: Dr. Maisha
Akbar, Ivy Brannen, Dr. Davida Curtis, Dr. Cheryl Gaddis, Dr. Dawn Herd-Clark,
Michelle Jones, Stacy Jones, lyanna Sims, Jahala Simuel, and Dr. Washella Simmons. I
also would like to acknowledge my “big sisters” from Spelman College who have served
as personal inspirations and mentors to me: Vera Jordan, Lorin Stewart, Kristy Rachal,
and Dr. Stephanie Wright.
Additionally, I would like to thank Sandra Phoenix, Executive Director o f the
HBCU Library Alliance for her support and contribution to this project. Finally, I must
acknowledge the many librarians who have and continue to labor at HBCU libraries, who
often do much with very little and remain passionate and committed to the cause of
educating students o f color.

ABSTRACT

SHAUNDRA PATRICIA WALKER
A STUDY OF THE ROLE OF THE HBCU LIBRARY ALLIANCE LEADERSHIP
PROGRAM IN DEVELOPING LIBRARY LEADERS
Under the direction o f ANTHONY HARRIS, Ed.D.

There is an impending leadership crisis in libraries serving historically Black
colleges and universities (HBCUs), as deans and directors of these libraries report plants
to retire, yet few have succession plans in place (Youmans, 2009). Should the leadership
crisis persist, HBCUs and their libraries would become vulnerable in areas ranging from
accreditation to managing the academic library’s shift from print to digital information.
The role o f library leadership programs, such as the HBCU Library Alliance Leadership
Program, must be determined. The purpose o f this study was to explore the role of the
leadership program in developing leadership skills among participants and to explore
how participants applied what they learned within their libraries and their institutions.
A sequential explanatory mixed-method design was used to explore the research
questions. Participants were recruited from the first three cohorts of the program. Data
were collected via an online survey, interviews and reviews o f participants’ required
projects and key historical documents related to the program. The quantitative data were
analyzed using descriptive and inferential analyses and the qualitative data were coded
and analyzed to identify themes and patterns.

The results indicated that more participants were promoted internally than those
who remained in the same position or those to whom some other career change status
applied. The program helped to create a network of peers and mentors, who served as
resources and sources o f inspiration for participants following the program. Through the
program, participants developed and refined career plans, and gained confidence. The
program also played a role in empowering participants with skills that could be applied
within their libraries. Through the required projects, participants addressed many of the
historical challenges faced by HBCU libraries. At the institutional level, the program
provided an opportunity for participants to work on system-level collaborations with
other institutional units, motivated them to align their visions with institutional visions
and highlighted new roles for library.
Future research on this topic would benefit from a larger sample and the use of
control/treatment groups. Updated demographic on HBCU library employees are
recommended, along with a study o f HBCU librarians’ participation in shared
governance.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION
Historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) play an important role in
American higher education. As defined by the Higher Education Act (2013), HBCUs are
accredited institutions founded prior to 1964 with the expressed purpose o f educating
African American college students. Until the mid-20th century, HBCUs educated the
majority of African Americans (Kim & Conrad, 2006). Currently, though HBCUs enroll
only nine percent o f African American college students, they award 17 percent of all
bachelor’s degrees received by African Americans; in the field of education and in the
science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, HBCU production
increases to 25 percent and 22 percent, respectively (Lee & Keys, 2013c).
According to research conducted on behalf of the Association of Public and Land
Grant Universities (APLU):
.. .the student outcomes at HBCUs have a national impact on the number
of minorities who are ready to enter the workforce and contribute to the
economy. Without the significant contributions made by HBCUs in
awarding degrees to African American students, America will not reach its
goal o f having 60 percent o f citizens ages 25-64 with a bachelor’s degree
or higher by 2025. (Lee & Keys, 2013c, p. 16)
President Barack Hussein Obama noted the pivotal role played by HBCUs in
achieving this goal, highlighting both their past and present contributions toward creating
a Black middle class and educating future leaders (The White House, 2010). President
Obama also recognized the unique challenges faced by HBCUs, noting that these schools

1

2
“feel the pain more acutely — they do more with less, and they enroll higher proportions
o f low- and middle-income students” (The White House, 2010, para. 8).
As President Obama suggested, HBCUs face significant challenges, both
historically and presently. The Higher Education Act of 1965 (2013) acknowledged that
the federal government discriminated against HBCUs, confessing that public HBCUs
have been discriminated against in the allocation of land and the distribution of financial
resources, such as grants and contracts and that private HBCUs have been discriminated
against in the awarding o f grants and contracts and other federal resources. To remedy
past discrimination, the federal government, through the Higher Education Act o f 1965,
Title III, Part B, provides grants to HBCUs to increase their operating capacity. Gasman
(2010) maintained that these annual appropriations do not adequately address the long
history o f unequal funding between HBCUs and predominately-white institutions (PWIs).
Research by Lee, Jr. and Keys (2013b) indicated that these funding disparities exist to the
present; findings from their study revealed that from 2010-2012, 68% of HBCU land
grant institutions did not receive their state matching funds, totaling a loss of nearly $57
million in funding. Further complicating matters is the endowment wealth gap between
HBCUs and PWIs. HBCU endowments pale in comparison to their PWI counterparts.
The 2014 market value o f the endowment o f the wealthiest HBCU, Howard University at
$586 million, is only a fraction of that of Harvard ($35 billion), the wealthiest PWI
(National Association o f College and University Business Officers, 2015).
In addition to educating a disproportionate number o f low-income students
(Richards & Awokoya, 2012), HBCUs educate students who are more dependent on
financial aid. The impact o f recent changes in the Department of Education’s (DOE)

3
requirements for PLUS Loan Program highlights the vulnerability created by this
dependency. In 2012, the DOE modified credit standards for obtaining PLUS loans.
Parents and graduate students with charged-off accounts or accounts in collections within
the previous five years became ineligible for PLUS loans as a result of these changes
(Lee & Keys, 2013a). The Office o f Access and Success of the APLU documented the
effect o f these changes (Lee & Keys, 2013a) on HBCUs. Morehouse College, a private,
single-sex liberal arts HBCU for men provides an example o f magnitude of this
phenomenon; because o f the impact of PLUS loan changes, the college was forced to
furlough staff. Clark-Atlanta University, another private HBCU, lost more than 500
students following the PLUS loan changes, resulting in an $8 million deficit. Similar
impact was felt at other HBCUs, such as Hampton University, Tuskegee University, and
Bennett College (Lee & Keys, 2013a).
Maintaining accreditation from one o f the six regional accreditation agencies
authorized by the U.S. Department of Education and the Council for Higher Education is
critical for all colleges and universities and more especially for HBCUs, because without
it, these institutions, which tend to be cash-strapped and tuition dependent, would be
ineligible to participate in federal and state financial aid programs. Wershbale (2010)
described the dilemma this way:
The accreditation problem for HBCUs is circular - by catering to
underserved minorities and low-income students, HBCUs often lack the
educational and financial resources necessary to satisfy accreditation
standards based on the archetype of predominately-white institutions
(“PWIs”) and flagship universities; but without the accreditation required
for federal funding, HBCUs are unable to develop resources and
infrastructure. Federal funds designed to enable structural improvement
and provide for student tuition are contingent upon an institution’s
accreditation status. (Wershbale, 2010, p. 68)

4
Between 1999 and 2013, 29 HBCUs were placed on warning by the Commission
on Colleges (COC) o f the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools [SACS], the
accreditor of most HBCUs. Within the same time period, 20 HBCUs were placed on
probation by SACS and four lost their SACS accreditation (Lee & Keys, 2013c).
Although HBCUs only account for 13 percent of SACS membership, as a group, they
accounted for 25 percent o f the accreditor’s sanctions (Lee & Keys, 2013c).
SACS lists four library-related standards among those that are required to be met
to maintain accreditation (SACS, 2012). The library standards relate to the provision of
information literacy instruction, qualified staff and access to appropriate library resources
and services (SACS, 2012). Several HBCUs have been sanctioned for failing to meet
these standards and a failure to comply with library standards has also played a role in the
closure o f some HBCUs. For example, Selma University, a small, church-affiliated
HBCU in Selma, Alabama, lost its accreditation in 1998, due to a “lack of sufficient
learning resources, such as library materials,” among other reasons (Mercer, 1998, p.
A29). St. Augustine’s College (now University), a small HBCU in Raleigh, North
Carolina, was sanctioned by SACS in 2002 for failure to comply with SACS standards
related to educational support, including library resources (Yates, 2002). Talladega
College, another small HBCU located in Talladega, Alabama, was sanctioned in 2006 for
failure to comply with two library-related standards (“SACS continues probation,” 2006).
Other HBCUs where lack o f compliance with library accreditation standards has played a
role in sanctions, threat o f sanctions or removal of accreditation include Grambling State
University (June, 2002), the Interdenominational Theological Center (Blake, 2003),
North Carolina Central University (Quinn, 2008), Savannah State University (Few,

5
2000), Knoxville College (Mercer, 1998), and LeMoyne-Owen College (Basken, 2008).
Most recently, Paine College in Augusta, Georgia, was cited by SACS for failure to
adhere to library and other standards (SACS, 2013).
Problem Statement
While many HBCU library deans and directors anticipate retiring, few have
succession plans in place to ensure a smooth transfer of leadership (Youmans, 2009).
Unless a cadre o f library leaders emerges, there will be a leadership crisis among HBCU
libraries in the coming years (Youmans, 2009). One researcher predicted that between
2005 and 2013, HBCU libraries would experience a 60% leadership turnover (Askew,
2013). This impending crisis appears to be manifesting; according to the HBCU Library
Alliance’s web site (n.d.-a), 17 percent o f its institutional members currently have
vacancies or interim appointments in the library dean/director position. The effects of this
crisis would be detrimental to HBCUs, as libraries within these institutions play a critical
role in the accreditation process, provide support for teaching and learning activities, and
support campus technology. While speaking at a workshop for librarians working in
HBCU libraries, one presenter described the problem this way:
Because o f the constant struggle for funding and because o f the politics of
race and education, the impact o f institutional effectiveness is potentially
more threatening [to HBCUs.] At best, it can mean the loss of
accreditation. At worst, it can mean the loss of an institution. (Southern
Education Foundation, 1991, p. 11)
The HBCU Library Alliance and the Leadership Program
Formally established in 2002, the HBCU Library Alliance is a consortium of
libraries serving HBCUs that promotes collaboration among member libraries, with an
emphasis on leadership development and services designed to enhance library services
and programs (HBCU Library Alliance, n.d.-b). The organization traces its founding to a

6
series o f communications taking place among deans and directors of HBCU libraries and
members of the board o f directors of the Southeastern Library Network (SOLINET),
beginning around 2001 (Hart et al., 2007). Through a variety of communication methods
among these entities, the need to empower HBCU libraries through programs and
services was confirmed (Allen & Brooks-Tatum, 2014). From 2003-2004, assisted by
funding from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the HBCU Library Alliance and
SOLINET worked collaboratively to conduct a planning project, which identified some
the challenges that prohibited the libraries from being more involved in teaching and
learning activities on their campuses (Hart et al., 2007). The result of the planning project
was a sense that building leadership capacity among HBCU librarians would best address
the challenges and should be a top priority. In 2005, following the planning project, the
HBCU Library Alliance received a $500,000 implementation grant to develop a series of
professional development activities for HBCU librarians; these activities included a twopart leadership institute known as the HBCU Library Alliance Leadership Program, site
visits, an exchange program, and support for HBCU librarians to attend workshops. The
organization received additional funding from the Mellon Foundation for its leadership
programs in 2007 and 2011 (Orphan, 2007; Galloway, 2011).
The purpose o f the HBCU Library Alliance Leadership Program is “to provide
theoretical and practical instruction and useful resources to encourage the development of
leadership skills within the HBCU library community and on their own campuses”
(HBCU Library Alliance, n.d.-a). Four separate cohorts of emerging library leaders have
participated in the program. To achieve its stated goals, the leadership program used a
variety of methods, including theoretical instruction, mentoring, and partnering with non-

7
HBCU libraries (HBCU Library Alliance, n.d.-a). Practical application of skills
developed in the leadership program was achieved through the completion o f projects at
participants’ home libraries/institutions.
Research Questions
The following research questions guided this study:
RQ1: What was the role of the leadership program in developing leadership
abilities among participants?
RQ2: How did the participants in the program use what they learned in the
leadership program within their immediate workplaces (libraries)?
RQ3: How did participants in the program use what they learned in the leadership
program within their larger campuses and in professional organizations?
Theoretical Framework
The framework guiding this study was Peter Senge’s systems thinking as it relates
to the concept o f a learning organization. Senge (1990) described a learning organization
as “an organization that is continually expanding its capacity to create its future” (p. 14).
Within the library literature, a learning organization has been described as one that is able
to not only develop or obtain information, but also one that is proficient in applying
information and changing its behavior based on what has been learned (Giesecke &
McNeil, 2004). Senge’s seminal work, The Fifth Discipline (1990), presented five
disciplines that form the basis of a learning organization; shared vision, personal mastery,
mental models, group learning and finally systems thinking (1990). The fifth discipline,
systems thinking, brings together the concepts outlined in the other four disciplines.
According to Senge (1990), “all [of the disciplines] are concerned with a
shift of mind from seeing parts to seeing wholes, from seeing people as

8
helpless reactors to seeing them as active participants in shaping their
reality, from reacting to the present to creating the future.” (p. 69)
Systems thinking was appropriate for this study because it considers both internal
and external changes and their effects on different parts of the system. The concept o f a
learning organization was equally appropriate, due to the study’s desire to explore the
role of the HBCU Library Alliance’s leadership program beyond the participants,
including their libraries and the larger institutions where they are or were employed. In
learning organizations, learning is not limited to the individual; it extends to the group
and to the organization (Giesecke & McNeil, 2004). Due to the HBCU Library Alliance’s
expressed desire to assist libraries in better integrating themselves into the teaching and
learning activities of their campuses and because o f the pressing need to develop future
library leaders (HBCU Library Alliance, 2004), systems thinking and the concept of a
learning organization provided an appropriate framework for exploring the role o f the
leadership program in achieving these goals. The purpose of this study was to explore the
role and efficacy o f the HBCU Library Alliance Leadership Program in creating future
library leaders.
Significance of the Study
This study could highlight the potential o f leadership development programs to
develop future library leaders and improve organizations. Specifically, the study could
assist the HBCU Library Alliance in obtaining additional funding for future leadership
programs. Currently, funding from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, which has
sponsored all o f the existing cohorts of the program, has ceased. Should the HBCU
Library Alliance desire to continue the program in the future, it will need to impress upon
funders the potential o f the program to develop future library leaders, which will help to

9
address the crisis. Also, the HBCU Library Alliance might benefit from understanding
more about the role o f the program in developing library leaders, which could assist with
program revision, should the program identify another funding source. Professional
organizations, such as the American Library Association and others concerned with the
impending mass retirements o f librarians, might also benefit from the results of this
study. Skinner and Krabbenhoeft (2014) identify forty library leadership programs in
operation as o f 2013; the results of this study could provide an example to other programs
interested revising their existing programs or developing new programs.
Leadership on HBCU campuses, including presidents, vice-presidents for
academic affairs and other administrators are also potential beneficiaries of the results of
this study. Senge (1990) highlights the advantages o f identifying areas of “leverage” or
“places where small actions in the right place can produce significant improvements”
(Senge, 1990, p. 64). At a time when higher education budgets are shrinking and when
competition for resources is increasing, knowing how individual parts of the higher
education ecosystem, such as academic libraries, influence the larger system may assist
leaders in allocating scarce resources. Finally, advocacy groups, such as the United
Negro College Fund, the National Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher
Education, the Southern Education Foundation and other organizations who have
historically recognized the importance of HBCUs and are interested in the survival and
promotion o f these institutions also may be interested in the results o f this study.
Procedures
This study used a mixed-method design. The researcher specifically chose the
case study because o f its ability to consider context (Creswell, 2014). Participation was

10
restricted to individuals who attended the first, second and third cohorts of the leadership
program and were recruited from the HBCU Library Alliance listserv, as well as other
listservs and social networking sites where participants were likely to be community
members. Potential participants received a brief background of the study, a request to
participate and an informed consent document. Data were collected using an open-ended,
electronic survey and one-on-one interviews. In an attempt to triangulate the data
collected from the survey and the interviews, documents such as participants’
presentations from the leadership program, and archival information from the HBCU
Library Alliance, were reviewed. The collected data were analyzed to identify themes,
and patterns.
Limitations and Delimitations
The limitations o f the study were related to locating the participants. Since the
first leadership program was held in 2005, some o f the participants have retired. Other
participants have assumed positions at non-HBCU libraries or left the library profession
all together. Locating some o f the participants was not possible. This study attempted to
mitigate the effect o f these limitations by employing a criterion sampling method,
including a wide range o f program participants. The sole delimitation o f the study was
the cohorts of the leadership program that were recruited. This study included only
participants from the 2005-2006, 2007-2008 and 2009-2012 cohorts (first, second, and
third o f four cohorts). These cohorts were selected for two reasons. Due to the variation
in the content of these programs, these three cohorts represented the most similar
experiences o f any o f the four cohorts. Participants in the most recent cohort, 2011-2013,
might not have yet had an opportunity to apply what they have learned in the program.

11
Summary
HBCUs are predicted to play a substantial role in America’s goal of having 60
percent of its citizens ages 25-64 in possession o f a bachelor’s degree or higher by 2025
(Lee & Keys, 2013c). The accreditation o f these institutions is a significant challenge to
their long-term survival and ability to contribute to this goal. Within the past 15 years, 53
HBCUs have been placed on warning, probation or had accreditation revoked by SACS,
the accreditor o f most HBCUs (Lee, Jr., & Keys, 2013c). Libraries play a critical role in
the SACS accreditation reaffirmation process, as the accreditor includes four libraryrelated standards among those that must be met in order to maintain accreditation (SACS,
2012). Libraries within HBCU libraries are currently facing a leadership crisis, as many
deans and directors report retiring and few have put succession plans in place to develop
future library leaders (Youmans, 2009). Unless a group o f future library leaders is
developed, the impending mass retirement of HBCU library deans and directors will be
catastrophic for HBCUs.
The research questions for this study sought to explore the role of the HBCU
Library Alliance Leadership Program, an intervention designed to address the impending
crisis by developing future library leaders. This study used Senge’s (1990) systems
thinking as it relates to a learning organization for a theoretical framework. A mixedmethod design, consisting of an open-ended survey, one-on-one interviews, and
document review was used for to collect data for this study. The population included
program alumni from the first, second, and third cohorts of the program.
Potential beneficiaries o f the results of this study include the HBCU Library
Alliance, other library professional associations, HBCU leadership and advocacy groups

12
concerned with the long-term survival o f HBCUs. The results of this study could assist
the HBCU Alliance in securing additional funding for future leadership programs and
might provide a model for other organizations interested in addressing this problem. For
HBCU leaders, such as presidents, vice-presidents o f academic affairs and others, the
study could identify one area within the institutional ecosystem where additional
investment might produce significant results. Additionally, through the results of this
study, advocacy groups might leam about an organizational area with potential to
influence the continued survival of HBCUs. Subsequent chapters o f this study provided a
literature review, described the methodology that was used, reported the findings, and
discussed conclusions and implications for further study.

CHAPTER 2
REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE
This review o f the literature attempted to accomplish several tasks. Primarily, it
provided insight into why the problem o f lack of leadership development among
historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) libraries exists, using Senge’s
systems thinking/learning organization as a framework. Secondly and relatedly, by
reviewing the literature on library leadership development program evaluation, this
chapter positioned the study as unique among other studies, with its focus on a leadership
program designed for librarians working in HBCU libraries and an exploration of the
program in developing leadership at the individual, library and institutional levels.
Theoretical Framework
This study utilized Peter Senge’s concept of systems thinking and the learning
organization as a theoretical framework. In The Fifth Discipline (1990), Senge stated that
“the organizations that will truly excel in the future will be the organizations that discover
how to tap people’s commitment and capacity to learn at all levels in an organization” (p.
4). Five disciplines are included in the framework: personal mastery, mental models,
building shared vision, team learning, and systems thinking. Systems thinking, the fifth
discipline, brings together the other four disciplines. Senge (1990) described systems
thinking as follows:

13

14
Businesses and other human endeavors are.. .systems. They.. .are bound
by invisible fabrics o f interrelated actions, which often take years to fully
play out their effects on each other. Since we are part of that lacework
ourselves, it’s doubly hard to see the whole pattern change. Instead, we
tend to focus on snapshots of isolated parts of the system, and wonder why
our deepest problems never seem to get solved. Systems thinking is a
conceptual framework, a body o f knowledge and tools that has been
developed over the past fifty years, to make the full patterns clearer, and to
help us see how to change them effectively. (Senge, 1990, p.7)
The context in which HBCU libraries operate is an important consideration in
understanding their problems, as well as exploring solutions. In discussing the
applicability o f systems thinking to understanding and solving problems, Senge (1990)
stated that “to understand the most challenging managerial issues requires seeing the
whole system that generates the issues” (p. 66).
There was general agreement in the literature that HBCU libraries are deeply
entwined with their parent institutions’ histories and development. Boykin (1950)
concluded that “quantitative differences between white and Negro education, important
as they are, cannot and do not explain the whole o f the problem. Certain historical and
other factors must also be taken into account” (p. 535). Wheeler, Johnson-Houston, and
Walker (2004) agreed, stating that “the development o f academic libraries serving
historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) is invariably wedded to the history
and economic circumstances o f the parent institutions” (p. 44). Hulbert, who served as
librarian at Virginia State College and Atlanta University, writing on the subject of Negro
libraries, described the interconnectivity between HBCU libraries and their parent
institutions this way:
The library o f the Negro college has passed a period of unique growth and
development, the seeds o f which were rooted in the same barren soil
which gave birth to the institutions themselves. The background o f slavery
and reconstruction, with its many factors leading to cultural repression,
naturally set up many obstacles for the founding of schools and libraries.

15
The restrictive limitations set up by Southern society have been no less
hampering for the continuance and expansion of things educational; hence,
all efforts for enlightenment o f Negroes have been highly colored and
circumscribed. (Hulbert, 1943, p. 623)
In keeping with the chosen framework, this review began with an overview of the system,
or HBCUs, followed by a discussion of the historical “symptoms” manifested in the
HBCU library.
Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs)
According to the Higher Education Act o f 1965 (2013), HBCUs are those
institutions founded prior to 1964 with the intended purpose of educating African
Americans. Section 321 o f the Higher Education Act (2013) acknowledges the history
and contributions o f these institutions, highlighting the discrimination they have faced at
both the state and federal government levels. The 103 HBCUs include 40 public fouryear colleges and universities, 49 private colleges and universities; there are 14 HBCU
two-year colleges, 11 public, and 3 private (United States Commission on Civil Rights,
2009).
History o f HBCUs
O f the 103 HBCUs currently in existence, only two, Wilberforce University
(1856) and Cheyney State University (1837) were founded prior to emancipation (1864)
(ASHE, 2010). At the time of emancipation, nearly four million previously enslaved
African Americans were without education. Scholars generally agreed that this need was
initially provided through the work of several entities, included the federal government
through the Freedmen’s Bureau, northern missionaries and African American church
denominations, such as the African Methodist Episcopal Church and the African
Methodist Episcopal Zion Church (Gasman, 2007; DuBois, 1998). Those schools

16
founded by African Americans, such as Morris Brown College, Paul Quinn College, and
Allen University, generally had more control over their curriculum, but as a consequence
o f such autonomy, suffered from economic uncertainty, both historically and
contemporaneously (Gasman, Lundy-Wagner, Ransom & Bowman, III, 2009).
Just prior to the twentieth century a new type of HBCU came on the horizon, the
black land grant institutions, which were established as a consequence o f the Morrill
Land Grant Act Statutes o f 1862 and 1890. This legislation, sponsored by U.S.
Congressman Justin Morrill o f Nebraska, provided federal land for the establishment of
public universities throughout the country (Samuels, 2004). The United States Congress
established land grant institutions to focus on research, instruction, and teaching. These
institutions quickly outgrew the financial allocations included in the original land grant
act, necessitating additional funding in 1890 (Mutakabbir, 2011). This second round of
funding stipulated that in states that prohibited African Americans from attending the
designated in-state land grant institution due to their race, states had to establish a land
grant institution exclusively for the education of African Americans. To comply with the
law, states throughout the southern United States established new institutions for African
Americans or designated existing institutions as their state’s land grant for African
Americans (Gasman, 2007; Mutakabbir, 2011). According to Mutakabbir (2011),
“historically black public land-grant institutions were established as a consequence of
legal segregation” (p. 36). Roebuck and Murty (1993) extended this position and stated
that black land-grant institutions were established:

17
To get millions o f dollars in federal funds for the development of white
land-grant universities, to limit African American education to vocational
training, and to prevent African Americans from attending white landgrant colleges, (p. 27)
These land-grant colleges were colleges only in name; as late as 1917, of the 16
existing black land-grant institutions, only one offered college courses (Anderson, 1988).
Gasman confirmed this and stated that such was the case for the early HBCUs as well as
most white institutions during their infancy, including Harvard (2007). Between
Reconstruction and the Great Depression, a network of private, black liberal arts colleges
provided higher education for African Americans in the South (Anderson, 1988). The
Higher Education Act (1965) acknowledges that the federal government discriminated
against historically black institutions, stating that public HBCUs have been discriminated
against in allocating land and in distributing financial resources, such as grants and
contracts; private HBCUs have been discriminated against in the awarding of grants and
contracts and other federal resources. These discriminatory acts are credited with
establishing a dual, segregated system of public higher education that persists into the
present (Mutakabbir, 2011). To remedy past discrimination, the federal government,
through the Higher Education Act of 1965, Title III, Part B, provides grants to HBCUs to
increase their operating capacity. Gasman (2010) suggested that these annual
appropriations do not adequately address the long history of unequal funding between
HBCUs and predominately-white institutions (PWls). These funding disparities exist to
the present, as findings from a recent study revealed that from 2010-2012, 68% of 1890
land grants did not receive their state matching funds, totaling a loss of nearly $57 million
(Lee & Keys, 2013b).

18

Despite these challenges, HBCUs continue to contribute significantly to
educational outcomes in the United States. HBCUs compromise the top 10 of the top 50
producers o f African American undergraduates who go on to earn advanced degrees in
the STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields (Aud, S. L., Fox,
M. A., KewalRamani, A., & National Center for Education Statistics, 2010). Relative to
their numbers, HBCUs continue to educate a disproportionate share of African American
undergraduates who earn bachelor’s degrees. According to Brown (2013):
A close review o f the data reveal that historically Black colleges also
produce more than one-third o f all African American baccalaureate
degrees in mathematics, more than two-fifths of African American degrees
in the natural science, produce more than 50 percent o f all African
American public educators, 70 percent o f the nation’s African American
dentists, and nearly 50 percent o f all African Americans who pursue
graduate or professional education, (p. 30)
Additionally, numerous studies cite the impact o f HBCUs in helping to create the black
middle class and black entrepreneurs along with assisting African American students
with gaining important social capital (Allen, Jewel, Griffin & Wolf, 2007; Boyd, 2007;
Palmer & Gasman, 2008; Wilson, 2007).
Accreditation and HBCUs
The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools [SACS], the accreditor of most
HBCUs, has been criticized for “treating] HBCUs as second-class institutions”
(Donahoo & Lee, 2008). This sentiment is likely attributable to the fact that, historically,
SACS denied full membership to HBCUs until 1956 (Donahoo & Lee, 2008). SACS
states that it “first took note of the Black institutions in 1928 when a group of educators
petitioned for help in standardizing and evaluating the education o f Black youth” (SACS,
1971, p. 5). The result o f this initial collaboration was the creation in 1929 of the
Highsmith Committee, a special committee for the approval of African American high

19
schools, colleges, and universities. The committee operated with the support of both the
General Education Board and the Julius Rosenwald Fund (SACS, 1971), two
philanthropic organizations that played a significant role in African American education,
among other influences.
Between 1930 and 1956, HBCUs were rated separately from White institutions,
as either Class A or Class B institutions and were listed as affiliated institutions in SACS
proceedings (SACS, 1971). During the first year that SACS approved HBCUs, only Fisk
University received an “A” rating; Johnson C. Smith University, Morehouse College,
Spelman College, Talladega College, Virginia State University, and Virginia Union
University received “B” ratings that year (Carter, 2010). HBCUs and secondary schools
did not receive accreditation approval by SACS; instead the schools were approved by
SACS. Accreditation carried with it the benefits o f SACS membership, a privilege
extended only to White schools (Carter, 2010). The Association o f Colleges and
Secondary Schools for Negroes (ACSSN), an accreditation body composed of African
American colleges and high school members, played a significant role in the formal
recognition of African American colleges, universities and secondary schools by SACS
(Carter, 2010). Established in 1934 at Spelman College through the merger of
Association o f Colleges for Negro Youth (ACNY) and the Association of High School
Education (SACS, 1971). According to Carter (2010), the ACSSN developed in response
to the General Education Board’s expressed desire to cease funding for SACS’ program
for approving African American schools. In the ensuing years, ACSSN advocated for
SACS approval for African American schools and collected membership fees to assist
organizations in the SACS approval process, among other assistance (Carter, 2010).

20

Few in number, underfunded and multi-purposed, a major focus of the
Association was the development o f their schools. McCuistion (1933)
identified the following challenges African American schools in attaining
regional approval: lack of attention given to high schools transcripts; (2)
the awarding o f various degrees: (3) lack of faculty training: inadequate
teacher salaries: and inadequate library services. To this end, Thompson
(1933) had three suggestions for African American college improvement.
Namely increased attention to socio-economic status issues; improved
training for teachers; and curriculum adjustment to develop an intelligent
African American leadership. (Carter, 1996, p. 101)
Although SACS was established in 1895, it did not establish library standards for
colleges until 1919. At its 24th meeting in Louisville, KY, SACS mandated that a college
library should contain at minimum 7,000 volumes and should be maintained through “an
adequate annual appropriation” (SACS, 1919, p. 28). The library standards continued to
evolve and were changed in 1920, 1926, 1929, and 1939 (Hoole, 1946). By 1939, SACS
library standards required a larger number of minimum volumes (12,000), provided perstudent recommendations on the minimum amounts o f expenditures for books,
periodicals, and binding, and stipulated qualifications for librarians. Additionally, by
1939, SACS required that students should receive instruction in the use of the library
(SACS, 1939).
The HBCU Library
The HBCU library offered a unique proxy for examining the impact of segregated
higher education in the United States. Systems thinking suggests that the HBCU library
provides an opportunity for leverage, or “seeing where actions and changes in structures
can lead to significant, enduring improvements” (Senge, 1990, p. 114). Consistent with
systems thinking, both preparation for work in and conditions within HBCU libraries
have largely been shaped and influenced by the state o f their parent institutions.

21

Black academic libraries and research collections: An historical survey (Smith,
1977) study is widely considered the definitive work on HBCU libraries; in the 38 years
since it was published, no study of HBCU libraries rivals its depth and breadth. Owens
(2001) updated and added to Smith’s (1977) study by bringing in a discussion of
technology and the digital divide. Dawson’s (2000) comprehensive bibliography of
African American librarians and librarianship is also worthy of mention. Both Smith
(1977) and (Owens, 2001) utilized chronological divisions for discussing the relevant
literature on HBCU libraries. For example, Smith (1977) grouped studies on HBCU
libraries into two distinct periods: 1917-1942 and 1946-1971. Owens’ (2001) work
grouped the studies into three periods: 1917-1952, 1965-1970 and 1971 to present. The
present review o f the literature augmented and updated those existing reviews and
presented the literature in a manner that supports the theoretical framework: 1) early
studies (1917-1952) 2) post Brown v. Board o f Education studies (1954-1995) and 3)
contemporary studies (2000-present). Systems thinking considers the organization (in this
case the HBCU) as the sum o f its parts, of which the HBCU library is but one. Consistent
with this framework, the following review presented studies on HBCU libraries in a
manner that is reflective of changes within the HBCU landscape. This review also
acknowledged a few smaller studies that appear in the literature, many authored by
HBCU librarians working in the field.
The earliest references to the inadequacies o f HBCU libraries and the need for
trained librarians appeared in general treatments of their parent institutions (Smith, 1977).
In the early decades o f the 20th century, three important studies o f educational conditions
for African Americans in the United States appeared in the literature. Although none o f

22

these works has HBCU libraries as its central focus, individually and collectively, they
provided important information on the historical state of these institutions.
The first o f these studies appeared in 1917 and was conducted under the direction
o f Thomas Jesse Jones, a social studies instructor at Hampton Institute, on behalf of the
Phelps-Stokes Fund (Anderson, 1988). This comprehensive study of African American
education explored opportunities for learning at 653 high schools and colleges and
provides insight into the availability and quality o f library services at the public, school,
and college levels. Most o f the schools had no library at all; only 27 had a “collection of
books that on the most liberal interpretation could be called a library” (Jones, PhelpsStokes Fund & United States, 1917, p. 173). Only 11 of these schools’ library collections
were deemed adequate. The others were described as “so unsuitable as to be almost
worthless, the discarded refuse of garrets and overcrowded storerooms, which should
have gone to the paper mill, but was sent to these poor children through mistaken
kindness” (Jones, Phelps-Stokes Fund & United States, 1917, p. 173).
Nearly a decade later, conditions appear to have not improved very much. A 1928
United States Bureau o f Education study o f 79 African American colleges found that
only 15 had library collections of 10,000 or more volumes; seven libraries were found to
have either no library at all or collections and services so deficient that they were not
even worthy o f being called a library. The practice of focusing on quantity of materials
versus quality, noted in the Jones et al. (1917) study, appears to have persisted; the 1928
study noted that among libraries that met the minimum standards for number of volumes
for college and junior college libraries, many contained works of little value. Despite

23
their control, whether public/land-grant or private-church-affiliated, the libraries under
study, much like their parent institutions, were found to be lacking (United States Bureau
o f Education, 1928).
The interconnectivity among the different components of the HBCU system was
confirmed by Embree and Waxman (1949) writing about the work of the Julius
Rosenwald Fund, a major benefactor o f African American education, who stated that:
In 1927, the scarcity of books in Negro colleges and teacher-training
institutions was even more appalling than the lack of reading materials in
the rural communities, for institutions of higher learning could not fulfill
their function without adequate libraries. A large proportion of the limited
books available were decrepit volumes on theology and history which had
come down in “missionary barrels” from charitable friends in the North.
With few exceptions, the meager libraries were administered by untrained
personnel and did not meet even minimum standards for library service.
(pp. 63-64)
Similarly, McCuistion (1933) reported that:
There is wide variation in the amount and quality of library services, some
colleges having small but effectively operated libraries, while others have
ample volumes but poor service. It is encouraging to find that more
college administrators and instructors are considering the library as the
heart o f the institution. (McCuistion, 1933, p. 38)
Among the three early studies containing information on HBCU libraries, a 1942
study (Brown, Blauch, Jenkins, Caliver, & United States, 1942) was the most detailed
and comprehensive. Although the study’s focus was African American education in
general, significant attention was devoted to the availability and quality of library service
in HBCUs. In comparison to earlier works, this study moved beyond the discussion of
collections that dominated the 1917 and 1928 studies and explored resources, finances,
and personnel. However, the following summary o f findings illustrated that the
conditions documented in the earlier studies persisted:

24
In general, it can be said that all types o f Negro institutions are spending
too little on their libraries. Whenever comparisons are available,
institutions for Negroes are shown at a disadvantage. They are spending
less on their books and periodicals, less on their staffs, and less per student
on the other items. The actual amounts expended are not sufficient to
provide adequate book stock and trained library personnel needed to
enable the library to perform its functions properly in the educational
programs. (Brown et al., 1942, p. 102)
The study by Brown et al. (1942) is perhaps the most useful of the early studies
due to its comparative nature. This study represented a shift in viewing the conditions of
HBCUs, as well as libraries. By comparing and contrasting the services, collections,
resources and staff o f HBCUs to libraries at PWI institutions, as well as core lists and
professional standards, the study placed conditions in HBCU libraries into a larger
context, serving as a small but convincing proxy for understanding the systemic
ramifications o f separate and unequal higher education. Hulbert (1943) summarized the
interconnectivity between the library and the parent institution this way:
Whatever the problems o f the Negro college library may be, educators
must realize that they are the problems of Negro education. In no instance
will library problems be apart from college problems. If the library is
deficient, the institution is certain to be weak. If the college has attained
considerable rank, measured by other criteria, it is still as weak as its
library, regardless of rating agencies, (p. 629)
Following these early studies, the next references to collections, expenditures, and
staffing in HBCU libraries came for librarians working in HBCUs and other individuals
and organizations concerned with their deficiencies. Many o f these studies appeared in
the Journal o f Negro Education, a referred, scholarly journal established at Howard
University. At its founding, the journal endeavored to “address[ed] the enormous
problems that characterized the education o f Blacks in the United States and elsewhere”
(Anderson, 1996, p. 240).

25
At the time o f its founding in 1932, “there was thus an urgent and critical need for a
scholarly journal that would identify and define the problems, provide a forum for
analysis and solutions, and serve as a vehicle for sharing statistics and research on a
national basis” (Anderson, 1996, p. 240). The journal played an important role in
documenting the effects o f segregated education (Anderson, 1996).
The articles on conditions in HBCU libraries that appeared in the Journal o f
Negro Education were consistent with the journal’s mission, as it provided a forum for
HBCU librarians to expose the ramification of the segregated and unequal conditions
under which they labored. One example came from Ruby Stutts Lyells, a graduate o f the
library school at Hampton Institute, and librarian at Alcorn A&M College, Mississippi’s
black land grant institution, beginning in 1931 (Hooper, 1998). Lyells authored a 1945
study, which examined library collections, staff, services, and resources in 1890 land
grant institutions and hinted at the inequality between 1862 and 1890 land grants:
The foregoing analyses indicate that there is much to be desired, that the
actual facilities for library service are meager and inadequate, that the
libraries, like the colleges of which they are a part, need increased funds.
The conclusion is inescapable that the role o f the library in Negro landgrant colleges has not been clearly visualized and its educational
potentialities are not fully understood, (p. 163)
Lyells (1945), similar to Hulbert (1943), attributed the HBCU library deficiencies
to the inadequate resources o f their parent institutions, stating:
What can we do about it? What are the needs for remedying the situation,
since the fate o f the libraries is inevitable bound up in the fate o f the
colleges? As long as the colleges bear the limitations o f restricted finance,
just so long will their libraries fail to function adequately in terms o f the
needs o f those whom they serve. The very obvious need is more money
for the colleges themselves, (pp. 163-164)

26
McAllister (1954), circulation librarian and supervisor at Howard University, wrote out
o f concern for library resources for graduate students in Southern universities for African
Americans and compared library resources in HBCUs that had been able to offer
graduate degrees following Gaines v. Missouri (1938) to their white counterparts.
This survey o f the library resources o f eleven southern universities for
Negroes shows that though they have made rapid and substantial
improvement, they are far from being adequate for the research and
curricular needs o f the colleges as measured by the library resources of
other institutions o f offering similar graduate instruction, (p. 58)
Jones (1965), a librarian at Atlanta University, concurred with the sentiment
expressed in the McAllister (1954) study, and suggested that although some states had
allocated additional funding for new, segregated graduate and professional programs,
little consideration was given for the investments in the libraries serving these programs.
When given, this support usually was for information resources only, without thought
given to the professional library staff that would be required to process the new materials
(Jones, 1965). Smith (1951), head librarian at Dillard University, studied the
demographics o f head librarians working in HBCU libraries, finding that nearly a third
earned less than the starting salary recommended by the American Library Association.
In some instances, head librarians at HBCU libraries received salaries below the
recommended starting salaries for clerical library workers.
Collectively, the studies on HBCU libraries that appeared from 1917-1951
painted a dismal picture. The earliest of these studies were simply descriptive in nature
and provided insight into the conditions of the libraries as a group.

As time progressed, studies began to compare the conditions in HBCU libraries to their
white counterparts and against professional standards, emphasizing that separate higher
education was truly unequal. Work by Lyells (1945) and McAllister (1954) highlighted
the unintended and residual consequences of legislation designed to remedy segregation.
In the decades following the Brown v. Board o f Education (1954) verdict, the
dual, inferior system o f higher education firmly established by Plessy v. Ferguson (1896)
and the Morrill Act o f 1890 began to weaken, as southern PWI institutions “grudgingly”
began to accept African Americans for admission (Allen & Jewel, 2002, p. 248). Allen
and Jewel (2002) referred to this period as the second “Great Migration,” a mass
movement o f African Americans from HBCUs to PWIs (p. 249). A review o f conditions
in HBCU libraries post-Brown indicates some improvements. For example, McGrath
(1965), working on behalf of Columbia University, noted that between 1950 and 1960,
per student library expenditures at HBCUs increased by 116%, representing the largest
increase in any of the observed educational or general expenditures studied. Despite the
new opportunities afforded by desegregation legislation, a collective view of studies
during the period suggests the persistence o f pervasive inequality between HBCUs and
PWIs. The tone o f these studies and their tendency to compare HBCU libraries to their
white counterparts suggested growing frustration with the slow pace of bringing HBCUs
up to speed. Several studies noted that existing funding mechanisms failed to account for
a history of underfunding and recommend an infusion o f financial support from both state
and federal sources, as well as private organizations (McGrath & Columbia University,
1965; Council on Library Resources, National Association of State Universities and
Land-Grant Colleges, National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant

28
Colleges, & American Association o f State Colleges and Universities, 1979; National
Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges, Hill, J.R., & American
Association o f State Colleges and Universities, 1976; Jordan, 1970).
McGrath’s (1965) study on behalf o f the Institute of Higher Education, funded by
the Carnegie Corporation, devoted an entire chapter to HBCU libraries. Consistent with
other studies, variables included space, collections, services, staff, and expenditures.
Despite the increases noted previously, the study revealed that HBCU four year and
junior college libraries still did not meet minimum professional standards in several
areas. Analogous to the 1917 and 1928 studies, the 1965 study noted that HBCU
libraries’ practice o f focusing on quantity o f collections instead o f quality persisted,
driven by accreditation requirements and professional standards on minimum collection
size. Additional findings regarding the staff of HBCU libraries indicated that many
HBCU libraries employed more professional librarians than paraprofessionals, which
forced librarians to perform clerical tasks instead o f attending to more professional work,
such as collection development and direct work with students. Professional development
for HBCU librarians was highly recommended by the study (McGrath & Columbia
University, 1965).
When ACRL published new standards for college libraries in 1960, two
researchers investigated whether or not HBCU libraries were meeting the new
requirements. Josey (1963) surveyed both public and private HBCU libraries, while
Totten (1969) exclusively examined libraries at United Negro College Fund (UNCF)
member institutions. Both researchers concluded that the libraries were “beset by a
number o f problems, “including deficiencies in acquisitions budgets, collections, and

29
staffing (Totten, 1969, p. 75). Totten’s study is noteworthy in that it also explored UNCF
librarians’ participation in campus governance, finding that 70 percent of librarians held
faculty status and that some reported directly to the president (44%) and that the rest
(56%) reported to the dean o f the college or the vice-president of academic affairs. Josey
(1963) discovered that most (82.3%) library directors reported directly to the president
and that most were members of the curriculum committee (79.4). Seventy-three and one
half percent reported that professional librarians enjoyed faculty status. Both authors
blamed accrediting agencies for the “sorry present state of affairs” in HBCU libraries,
maintaining that if teams would emphasize the need to upgrade the libraries and would
deny accreditation to schools whose libraries were deficient, “real progress could be
made” (Josey, 1963 p. 2996).
Jordan (1970) provided an inventory of 85 HBCU libraries, exploring collections,
operating expenditures, staff, and salaries. Information obtained was categorized by
control o f institution, with a distinction being made for public and United Negro College
Fund - affiliated institutions. The following summary described the magnitude o f the
problems:
The present condition of library services in most of the black colleges can
be summed up in the statement that the physical facilities are in general
more adequate than the books, journals, films, records they contain, or the
number o f library staff... Their collections and staff need extensive
strengthening to rectify a history of insufficient support and to help lift
instruction and learning out of ritual and routine. (Jordan, 1970, p. 30)
Research by the Office for Advancement of Public Negro Colleges, a division o f the
Association o f State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges, recognized the progress of
HBCU libraries, yet suggested that much work was still needed to bring them into parity

30
with their white counterparts. The study of 34 institutions also noted that present funding
mechanisms in public institutions failed to account for years of inadequate funding
(1976).
Gravois (1994, 1995a, 1995b) authored three comparative works on public HBCU
libraries and their white counterparts, the first studies to attempt such a comparison since
Lyells (1945) and McAllister (1954). The first study (1994) compared public HBCU and
PWI university libraries in Georgia, while the second study (1995a) did the same in
Tennessee. The third study (1995b) extended the comparison to libraries in eighteen
states. In addition to comparing HBCU and PWI libraries collectively, Gravois (1995b)
also conducted comparisons within states, suggesting that such comparisons might better
indicate equality or lack thereof within states. When grouped together, HBCU libraries
and PWI libraries were found to be nearly equal when variables such as volumes per
student, library staff per student and professional librarians per student were considered.
Additionally, the HBCU libraries as a group were superior to PWI libraries in both salary
per student and salary per staff member. The within-state comparisons appeared to be
more telling. While most states showed respectable scores for their HBCUs in staffing
and volumes, scores for salaries were generally lower in the HBCU in-state comparisons.
Only in Delaware was the HBCU in-state comparison superior to the PWI group.
According to Gravois (1995b), “Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Ohio, South Carolina, and
Virginia.. .appear to support their non-HBCU libraries more than their HBCU libraries...”
(p. 529).
Gravois’ (1994, 1995a, 1995b) comparisons of public HBCU libraries with their
non-HBCU counterparts were updated and expanded upon in work by Nyberg and

31
Idelman (2005) and Askew and Phoenix (2011), both of which used data from the
Academic Library Survey from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) to
compare HBCU and non-HBCU libraries on collections, expenditures and staff. The
studies, collectively known as The State o f Libraries in HBCUs Reports, were produced
in collaboration with the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, SOLINET (now Lyrasis), and
the National Commission on Libraries and Information Science. In addition to comparing
HBCU libraries with their non-HBCU counterparts, these studies were similar to other
studies (Jordan, 1970; Brown, 1993) which considered “institutional demographic
differences,” such as enrollment, Carnegie classification, and control (public or private)
in their analyses (p. 2).
Findings on several variables in the State o f Libraries at HBCUs (2005, 2011)
were similar to the studies referenced earlier in this review. For example, consistent with
work by Gravois (1995b), both studies revealed that HBCU libraries had higher ratios of
professional library staff per 100 student FTE than their non-HBCU counterparts did
(Nyberg & Idelman, 2005; Askew & Phoenix, 2011). Average salaries for librarians and
other professional staff as a group were nearly 14% lower than PWIs as a group. In the
area o f technology, HBCU institutions lagged slightly behind their PWI counterparts in
the area of electronic submission o f student-produced theses and dissertations (14% to
27% in PWIs). Most HBCUs reported that they delivered reference services
electronically (80%) but this number was lower than that reported in the same category
for PWIs (92%). HBCUs also reported digitizing documents at lower rate (45%) than
PWIs (58%). Encouragingly, more HBCUs included information literacy in their
missions and institutional strategic plans than PWIs (Askew & Phoenix, 2011).

32
In 2004, while preparing for a library leadership development program for HBCU
librarians, HBCU educational leaders gathered for a series of focus groups to determine
the needs of their institutions as they related to libraries. Collectively, the leaders
identified three main areas o f concern: (a) leadership growth, (b) fiscal constraints, and
(c) staying abreast o f technological developments. In summarizing the feedback from
these focus groups, the consultant (HBCU Library Alliance, 2004) stated that:
The longevity or tenure o f most HBCU library staff perhaps, to a degree,
retards the potential for the growth of these libraries. As was noted by the
directors, these longtime employees rarely participated in professional
development events outside their local area or sought professional
opportunities to gain new skills or knowledge. Their reluctance to move
outside their comfort zone establishes an organizational culture that is
resistant to change and prohibits forward movement of the library.
Whether mirroring the culture o f the overall institution or not, this
stagnation results in the perception that HBCU library operations remain
the same no matter what. (p. ii)
The demographics o f the HBCU library deans/directors who participated in the
focus group are important to note. O f 78 participants representing 74% of the 105
HBCUs, over 80% were age 49 and up (HBCU Library Alliance, 2004). One researcher
predicted that between 2005 and 2013, HBCU libraries would experience a 60% turnover
(Askew, 2013). According to the HBCU Library Alliance’s web site (2015), 12 percent
o f HBCU libraries currently have vacancies or interim appointments in the library
dean/director position.
Other research supported and augmented the findings from the State o f Libraries
at HBCU libraries reports. Walsh (2012) investigated marketing activities and library
usage among HBCU libraries, finding that both circulation and reference transactions
declined during the period studied (2000-2008), while gate counts increased. Hill’s 2012
study o f HBCU library web sites revealed that this institutions employed Web 2.0

33
technology and online instructional aids (Hill, 2012) at a lower rate than PWI libraries.
Similarly, Evans (2012) discovered that HBCU libraries’ awareness and usage of openaccess scientific literature (Evans, 2012) was lacking. In the area of information
discovery, research by Guthrie and McCoy (2012) showed that HBCU libraries have
been slow to adopt library discovery tools, the “next generation” catalogs o f the future.
Their research found that only 50% of HBCU libraries had embraced library discovery
tools; for the 50% who had not, cost was identified as the primary reason, with awareness
and training, and information technology support also identified as impediments.
Studies on HBCU libraries have primarily dealt with collections, services, and
resources. Research on HBCU library directors or leadership within HBCU libraries is
lacking in the literature. Five studies explored the library director position in HBCU
libraries (Smith, 1951; Ball, 1995; Neal, 2005; Young, 1980; Youmans, 2009). With the
exception o f work by Young (1980) and Youmans (2009), no studies of the broad
concept o f leadership in HBCU libraries appeared in the literature.
To summarize, studies on the collections, staff, services, and resources o f HBCU
libraries span a period o f nearly 100 years and have been authored by a wide range o f
individuals, organizations, and government entities. A synthesis of the available literature
on conditions in HBCU libraries indicated that these organizations have be challenged
from their very beginnings. Though there was much variation among these studies
(Owens, 2001) and direct comparison was difficult, a collective view lent validity to the
perception o f the consultant from the 2004 planning report of the HBCU Library Alliance
(2004) that “ .. .HBCU library operations remain the same no matter what” (p. ii).

34
Regardless o f the motivations of the author, the time, or the type of analyses, no study in
the literature suggested superiority of HBCU libraries or even parity with non-HBCU
libraries.
Organizational Development in HBCU Libraries
To address some o f the deficiencies identified in the literature, there have been a
series o f both organizational and leadership interventions designed to improve the skills
o f librarians employed, as well as the organizational development of the libraries and the
parent institutions as a whole. Library development for African Americans, whether
school, public of within colleges/universities, has historically been driven by a general
desire to improve education o f this population and has been largely shaped by
philanthropic efforts. The following section explored some o f these initiatives.
Senge (1990) stated that understanding complex managerial problems necessitates
seeing the entire system that created the issue. As noted earlier in this review, an
understanding of the history o f the American higher education system is essential to
understanding the historical problems faced by African American library workers and
HBCU libraries in their quest to obtain qualified workers. The historical system of
segregated higher education created a quandary for HBCUs and their libraries,
particularly as relates to the HBCU library workforce. HBCUs could not provide library
services to their students, faculty, and staff in the absence of trained library workers.
(Dumont, 1986). Until 1926, when the library program at Hampton University
commenced, no school in the Southern United States admitted African Americans to the
college-level training deemed necessary to prepare them for work in HBCU libraries

35
(Dumont, 1986). Prior to 1926, most African American library workers were prepared
through apprenticeship programs, summer courses, or library courses at the
undergraduate level.
Writers describing the challenges faced by African Americans seeking education
for work in HBCU libraries, regardless of the era, pointed to one general cause of the
problem: an inability o f African Americans to attend formal library programs in the
South due to Jim Crow segregation laws. Secondary reasons for the lack of professionally
trained librarians included lack o f preparation at the undergraduate level and inability to
assume the expenses and the necessary living arrangements associated with attending
library school in the North (Curtis, 1935; Dumont, 1986). In response to a 1939 survey
question on the performance of African American students in Northern library schools,
one school responded as follows:
While we have every sympathy for the Negro woman student of course no
prejudice, we discourage them for trying to enter th e
School for
Library Science or indeed any department of the University, because there
is literally no satisfactory place for them to live i n
. We have had,
therefore, no Negro graduates since 1936. (Barker, Jackson & the
American Library Association, 1939, p. 41)
In explaining African Americans’ slow entry into the library profession, Curtis
(1935), the first and only leader of the Hampton Institute library school, traced the
problem back to the parent institutions, reasoning that “the economic and educational
conditions of the institutions which might command their services” played a significant
role in this lack o f development (p. 94). Dumont (1986) went a step further in describing
some o f the barriers experienced by African Americans in their quest for library
education. Noting the narrow path, the author suggested that African Americans’ slow
entry into the profession was affected by their inability to attend southern colleges and

36
universities, relegation to inferior public 1890 land grant colleges and inadequate
preparation for higher education in segregated elementary and high schools (1986).
Foundations have figured prominently in the development of education for library
work in the United States. Education for African American librarians developed within
this context. Three organizations have played major roles in this work: the Carnegie
Corporation, the General Education Board, and the Julius Rosenwald Fund.
The Carnegie Corporation has a long and storied history of library and
educational development in the United States. Andrew Carnegie is perhaps best known
for helping to establish hundreds of public libraries across the United States. Carnegie
initially refused to fund library education when first approached in 1890, but after
discovering that many o f the public libraries he had invested in lacked qualified
personnel to make them successful, he relented. The corporation first invested in library
education at Western Reserve University, and later supported training programs at the
Carnegie Library o f Pittsburg, the Carnegie Library o f Atlanta, and the New York Public
Library (Smith, 2008). Any discussion of the history of library education must
acknowledge that prior to the 1920’s, library education for both blacks and whites was
lacking. C.C. Williamson, a trained economist, sociologist, librarian, and author of
several studies conducted on behalf of the Carnegie Corporation, is well known for a
report that shed light into this problem. Known as the “Williamson Report” the document
was highly critical o f library training and made several 11 recommendations for its
improvement (1923). The Carnegie Corporation responded to the “Williamson Report”
with a program called the “Ten Year Program in Library Service,” which ran from 19251935. The program assisted in founding library schools at several universities, including

37
the University o f Denver, Hampton Institute, the University of North Carolina and the
Atlanta Library Training School, which eventually became a part of Emory University
(Churchwell, 1975).
Similarly, for African Americans, the Carnegie Corporation played a significant
role in developing librarians for work in public, school, and academic libraries. The
corporation has been instrumental in aiding the provision of library services to African
Americans, both on HBCU campuses and within Southern towns and cities, primarily
through grants to establish library buildings but also through the support o f library
education for African Americans (Fultz, 2006; Jones, T. J., Phelps-Stokes Fund, &
United States Bureau o f Education, 1917; Radford & the American Library Association,
1984; Wheeler, Johnson-Houston & Walker, 2004). Through the first Carnegie public
library established for African Americans in Louisville, KY, the corporation played a
small but significant role in early education for African American library workers.
Thomas Fountain Blue, a graduate o f Hampton Institute, is credited with creating the first
training program for African American library workers, an apprenticeship program that
operated out of the Carnegie library for African Americans in Louisville. Cities from
across the south sent individuals for training at the Louisville’s Western Colored Branch,
as there were no other available options in the South (Fultz, 2006). The program
graduated 37 women, who went on to work in libraries in cities throughout the South
(Gunn, 1989). The apprenticeship program ran from 1912 until 1926, when the library
school at Hampton Institute was established (Wright, 1955).
Prior to the establishment o f the apprenticeship program at Louisville, KY,
educational opportunities for African American library were workers were scarce.

38
Edward Christopher Williams is credited with the distinction of being the first trained
African American librarian. Williams received a certificate of completion from the New
York State Library School in 1900. (Dumont, 1986; Josey, 1969). The next formally
trained librarian was Virginia Proctor Powell, who matriculated at the Pittsburgh
Carnegie Library School, finishing in 1923 (Josey, 1994). These examples stand out in
the literature, suggesting that with few exceptions, opportunities for formal library
education, especially for African Americans living in the South, were rare. According to
Curtis (1935), only approximately 70 African Americans enrolled in library school
between Williams’ 1900 graduation and 1934; only two o f the seventy received master’s
degrees.
The General Education Board, an educational foundation established in 1903
through a one million dollar grant from John D. Rockefeller, Sr. (Sola, 1996a) has also
played a significant role in education for African American librarians. According to Gunn
(1986), the GEB’s philanthropic interest in education for African American librarians
sprang from a longstanding interest in education in general. Gasman (2007) and
Anderson (1988) suggested that the GEB and other northern-based philanthropic
organizations were motivated by self-interest, however their influence cannot be denied.
The following summary o f field agents working in 1925 on behalf of the board described
the need for library education for African Americans and the systemic impact o f the lack
of such (Howe, 1942):
The Negro child in the southern area is not reading; he has no books; his
teachers do not read and have no books; there are few good libraries in the
schools or colleges where these Negro teachers are trained; there is no
library school for Negroes and we feel there should be one to improve
these conditions, (p. 561)

39

In 1925, the American Library Association’s Board for Education in
Librarianship (BEL) the Carnegie Corporation, and the General Education Board
collaborated to establish a library school for African Americans at Hampton Institute, a
private, black vocational school located in Hampton, Virginia (Howe, 1942). During its
existence, the school graduated 183 librarians who primarily assumed positions in
colleges, but also high schools and public libraries (Gunn, 1989; Smith, 1940a). The
Hampton Library school operated from 1925-1939. In addition to educating African
American library workers for positions in HBCUs, high schools and segregated public
library branches, the Hampton Institute library school also served as a resource for many
HBCU libraries via a collaboration with the Julius Rosenwald Fund, another significant
investor in African American education and HBCU libraries. Rosenwald, described as a
“capitalist/philanthropist,” served as president of Sears Roebuck and is highly regarded
for his financial support o f African American schools, contributions to improving
healthcare and support for educational endeavors via scholarships and fellowships (Sola,
1996b, p. 390). He is perhaps best known for the schools in rural communities that he
helped to establish. Additionally, Rosenwald made significant contributions to both
secondary and post-secondary African American education through the support that the
fund provided to libraries and historically black colleges and universities. For HBCU
libraries, this support came in the form o f book grants, scholarships, and facility
improvements that reportedly increased the value o f collections from $6000 to $200,000,
facilities from $20,000 to $2.5 million, and the number of trained librarians from six to
48 (A. Johnson, personal communication, October 29, 2014).

40
The Rosenwald Fund’s Library Program ran from 1927-1948 and started through
an experiment with five HBCUs; Agricultural & Industrial State College (now Tennessee
State University), Southern University (Baton Rouge), Tuskegee Institute (now Tuskegee
University), Petersburg Normal & Industrial Institute (now Virginia State University) and
Winston-Salem State Teacher’s College (now Winston-Salem State University). The
primary vehicle o f the library program was the distribution of book grants. Recipients
benefited from up to a maximum o f $2,500 of “well-balanced books” from a list prepared
by Florence Rising Curtis, director o f the Hampton Library School (Smith, 1940b, p. 5).
The grants came with several conditions, including stipulations that the library employ a
trained librarian, and a requirement that the college provide a reading room with
appropriate shelving and furniture. The HBCUs were supported in meeting the staffing
requirement through scholarships that were provided by the Rosenwald Fund for African
Americans to attend the Hampton Library School (Smith, 1940a).
Once the initial experiment proved to be successful, Rosenwald expanded the
program and from 1928-1934, the fund invested in forty-three HBCU libraries spanning
sixteen states (Embree & Waxman, 1949). In addition to the book grants and
scholarships for African Americans to obtain library training, the Rosenwald Fund is
credited with providing HBCU libraries with much-needed consultant support. Florence
Rising Curtis, with support from the fund, reportedly traveled to HBCU libraries to assist
with weeding, collection development, and other areas of deficiency (Gunn, 1986). The
Rosenwald Fund’s support o f libraries has been credited as integral in assisting HBCUs
with securing accreditation from SACS (Embree & Waxman, 1949). Curtis’s work in
particular, most notably her Rosenwald-funded extension visits, has been credited with

41
not only assisting high schools and colleges with gaining accreditation, but also
positively influencing the “whole educational program” of schools the school she visited
(Gunn, 1989, p. 79).
Despite the philanthropic investments in the program, the Hampton Institute
Library School closed in 1939. The literature attributes its demise to several factors,
including the curriculum (industrial/vocational vs. classical), lack of funding, institutional
control issues and geographic location (Smith, 1940a). Gunn (1986) provided two
primary reasons for the Carnegie Corporation’s decision to cease support for the library
school: (a) a feeling by the Carnegie Corporation that Hampton Institute was not
contributing fairly to the operations of the school, and (b) the retirement of its one and
only director, Florence Rising Curtis. Gunn’s (1986) study detailed the Hampton’s
dwindling support for the school, highlighting the fact that between 1925 and 1936, its
parent organization only contributed just over 9% of the school’s operating costs. The
rest o f the costs were borne by philanthropic agencies, such as the Carnegie Corporation.
When the Carnegie Corporation ceased its year-to-year grant program to library schools
in 1935, funding to the school dwindled. Lack of support from the Carnegie Corporation
and an inability to operate independently ultimately forced the library school at Hampton
to close in May 1939.
For two years after the Hampton Institute Library School closed, with the
exception of a little known library education program that existed at four HBCUs to
educate teacher-1 ibrarians (1939-1941), there appears to have been no formal library
education program available for African Americans in the South (Sutton, 2005). Referred
to as the “Negro Teacher-Librarian Program” or the NTLP, the GEB-funded program

42
operated from 1936-1939 and educated 279 teacher-librarians from 16 states. Operating
on the campuses o f Atlanta University (now Clark-Atlanta University), Fisk University,
Hampton Institute (today Hampton University) and Prairie View Normal and Industrial
College (today Prairie View Agricultural and Mechanical University or Prairie View
A&M), the program consisted of 12 credit hours designed to help attendees improve the
libraries o f their public schools (Sutton, 2005).
In 1941, a new school dedicated to the education o f African American librarians
opened at Atlanta University, a private HBCU located in Atlanta. The library school was
established via a grant from the General Education Board. Eliza Atkins Gleason, the first
African American to receive a PhD in library science, served as its first director (Dumont,
1986). In 1988, Atlanta University merged with Clark College, another private HBCU, to
form Clark-Atlanta University. The library school is distinguished as graduating more
librarians of color than any other library program in the country (Sutton, 2005). The
Clark-Atlanta University School of Library and Information Science closed in 2005.
Similar to the situation at Hampton, the reasons given for its closure given by the
school’s administration were related to both academics and finances (Donsky, 2004). At
the time of its closure, the library school had recently been placed on probation by the
American Library Association and reportedly relied heavily on a $500,000 annual grant
from the Georgia Board o f Regents. Additionally, there was fear that an emerging library
science education program at Valdosta State University, a public PWI, would put the
program in jeopardy should the grant from the Board of Regents not be renewed. The
special assistant to the president for operations o f the school stated that the grant “is not
something we could really depend on, and we don't have the finances here to do this

43
major overhaul that would be needed to get them up to speed” (Donsky, paragraph 13,
2004). Even though the president o f the American Library Association countered that, the
program was “healthy” and that the problems identified in the probation decision were
minor and easily fixed (Donsky, 2004), and despite outcry from alumni, faculty and the
library professional community, the school graduated its final class in 2005. Smith (2008)
surmised that the Clark-Atlanta library school’s closure “can be viewed as [a] steps
backward, undoing investments made by the Carnegie Corporation...” (p. 160).
In addition to the Hampton and Clark-Atlanta University library schools, two
other library education programs also operated on HBCU campuses, one at Alabama
A&M University, and another at North Carolina Central University. Both were
established with philanthropic support. Alabama A&M University’s school media
program was founded in 1969 with support from the Kellogg Foundation. The library
education program at North Carolina Central University, which was established in 1941
with support of the Carnegie Corporation and accredited in 1975, is the sole remaining
library school operating on a predominantly African American campus (Smith, 2008).
In summary, education for librarianship for African Americans has been largely
dependent on a few dedicated individuals and several philanthropic organizations. Until
the closure o f the library school at Clark-Atlanta University in 2005, this education has
primarily been relegated to HBCUs. As early as 1925, the Bureau of Education for
Librarianship reasoned that “the proper development of library work with Negroes in the
South necessitates the preparation o f Negro librarians in that environment” (Bureau of
Education for Librarianship Annual Report, 1924-1925, as cited in Smith (1940). Much

44
like higher education in the United States in general, the literature confirmed that library
education in the United States, with few exceptions, operated within a two-tiered system
for nearly 80 years (1925-2005).
Dumont (1986) notated that prior to 1975, no public university “with
predominately black enrollment” offered an accredited library science degree. Similarly,
no library science education program prior to 1975 was accredited without private
support (Dumont, 1986). Dumont provides the following analysis of support for library
education:
The historical evidence...shows that black representation in professional
education for librarians has depended on the monumental efforts of a very
few white and black library leaders to develop special programs for
blacks. They have had to rely on the interest and contributions of
foundations and most recently the federal government to provide a full
range o f opportunities for blacks to study librarianship. The overall
effectiveness o f the various programs support by these private and public
sources has not been measured. In the end it seems that the lack of
knowledge o f effectiveness is also an impediment to equal opportunity.
(Dumont, 1986, pp. 243-244)
Viewed through Senge’s (1990) systems thinking framework, the educational
interventions at both Hampton and Atlanta University were not system solutions and
were limited in their organizational effectiveness to address the problem of lack of
educational opportunities for African American library workers. Although the following
quote applies to government programs, it appeared to have relevance to the present
discussion:
The long-term, most insidious consequences o f applying non-system
solutions is increased need for more and more o f the solution. This is why
ill-conceived... interventions are not just ineffective, they are ‘addictive’ in
the sense o f fostering increased dependency and lessened abilities o f the
... people to solve their own problems. (Senge, 1990, p. 61)

45
These solutions, well-intentioned as they may have been, failed to assist the
parent organizations in maintaining the library schools for African Americans. The
literature confirmed that both schools’ reliance on external funding left them vulnerable
in its absence. Another view lent credence to long-standing criticisms of philanthropic
interventions in African American education, which many scholars argued did little to
challenge segregation and may have actually perpetuated it. In speaking about
segregation with library education, Wheeler (2005) opined as follows: “realistically, there
is no need for research regarding the resegregation of library schools. Statistically
speaking, there are few, if any, that have truly integrated” (p. vii).
Support for HBCU libraries has not been limited to educational endeavors and has
included staff and leadership development activities. Much like support for education,
philanthropic institutions have figured prominently in these efforts. Specifically, the
Southern Education Foundation (SEF) and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation have
supported leadership development programs for HBCU libraries. Some of the problems
that these interventions were aimed at addressing included assisting HBCU librarians in
developing better relationships with administrators, highlighting the libraries’ role in
contributing to institutional effectiveness, assistance in preparing for accreditation
reviews, staffing, including staff development (Segal, 1987). These challenges are
consistent with those identified by many of the earlier researchers on HBCU libraries.
While articles on library leadership programs in general appear frequently in the
literature, discussions o f library leadership programs for librarians of color and librarians
working in minority serving institutions (MSIs) were largely absent. For example, the
American Library Association’s list of library leadership programs, which is frequently

46
referenced in the literature, made no mention of the HBCU Library Alliance Leadership
Program, an LDP for librarians working in HBCUs.
(http://www.ala.org/offices/hrdr/abouthrdr/hrdrliaisoncomm/otld/leadershiptraining).
Similarly, the few research articles that attempted to gather both historical and
contemporary lists of such programs failed to identify these programs. For example,
Mason & Wetherbee (2004) cited the University o f California at Los Angeles’ Senior
Fellows Program (1982) as the first library leadership development program and list 21
additional library leadership development programs established between 1996 and 2002.
Zauha (2007) listed Columbia University School o f Library Science’s 1971 Institute for
Library Leadership Development for Inner City as the first such program and also
referenced the 1978 Leadership at Leavenworth (WA) workshop as a pioneer leadership
program. At least two library leadership development programs for librarians working in
HBCUs existed during this time period; a third was founded in the same year that Mason
and Wetherbee’s (2004) study was published.
The need for leadership development in HBCU libraries was apparent as early as
1974, when a group o f HBCU librarians, led by Virginia Lacey Jones, dean of the library
school at Atlanta University, came together to address the issue. In addition to leading the
nation’s second library school for African Americans for over 40 years, Jones was also
the second African American to obtain a PhD in library and information science (Sutton,
2005). The group partnered with ACRL and received a $500,000 grant from the Andrew
W. Mellon Foundation to improve management skills and build leadership capacity
among HBCU librarians. Jordan and Lynch (1998) provided a detailed background o f the
ACRL Academic Library Internship Program for Administrators of Black College

47
Libraries, revealing that the Mellon Foundation recognized the role of librarians in
supporting the teaching and research activities of faculty and was interested in the project
because it supported the overall development o f HBCU institutions. Simultaneously,
Jones was driven by the impending retirement of many leaders o f HBCU libraries (Norlin
& Morris, 2001). In describing the problem that necessitated the creation of the program,
ACRL (1979) lamented the aging workforce in HBCUs, and stated that:
The proportion o f aging administrators in these libraries is larger than in
predominately-white institutions of the same type. Financial problems and
personnel shortages have limited the continuing education opportunities
for staff members. The ‘middle-management’ component in these
libraries, through no fault o f its own, often have head insufficient exposure
to the great changes that are taking place in the library and information
field, (p. 1)
The ACRL Academic Library Internship Program for Administrators of Black College
Libraries operated from 1974 to 1978 and included 25 program participants who interned
with well-regarded PWI libraries, under the direction of the library director (Drake,
2003).
Interest in developing HBCU libraries continued within ACRL following the
completion o f the ACRL Academic Library Internship Program for Administrators of
Black College Libraries (Jordan & Lynch, 1998). In 1987, the Mellon Foundation once
again provided financial support for the development of additional projects aimed at
improving HBCU libraries. A committee known as the HBCU Library Planning Project
Committee met and proposed several programs. Collectively, these efforts are known as
the ACRL/Mellon Historically Black College & Universities Libraries Projects and
consisted o f three main programs. One component was the generation o f updated
statistics on HBCU Libraries. Molyneux, Davis, Nelson and the Association of College
and Research Libraries (1991) stated that prior to initiation of the ACRL Historically

Black Colleges and Universities Library Statistics Project, the last collection of statistics
on HBCU libraries had taken place in 1969. Jordan and Lynch (1998) contradicted this
statement, recognizing the work of Smith (1977) and Jordan (1974) as important
additions to the small body o f research on HBCU libraries. Nevertheless, although
Molyneux et al.’s (1991) study did not compare HBCU libraries to their non-HBCU
counterparts, its design, based on the form used by ACRL for other surveys, was selected
to assist HBCU libraries in doing so. Jordan and Lynch (1998) credited the survey with
assisting HBCU libraries in securing resolutions, additional funding, and legislation
designed to improve HBCU libraries.
Although the statistics project appears to have been well received and was
recommended for renewal to ACRL by the HBCU Library Planning Project Committee
(Jordan & Lynch, 1998), no further statistical projects under this program appeared in the
literature. A second component of the ACRL/Mellon Black Library Projects focused on
humanities programming within HBCU libraries. A workshop for HBCU librarians and
public librarians and humanities faculty took place in Atlanta, GA from February 22-24,
1989. Participants went through activities designed to assist them in developing
humanities programs at their home institutions and within their local communities
(Jordan & Lynch, 1998). The third and final component of the ACRL/Mellon Black
Library Projects was designed to assist HBCU libraries in aiding their institutions in
meeting recently changed accreditation standards by SACS (Jordan & Lynch, 1998;
Owens, 2001). Recognizing the importance o f libraries in the accreditation process,
ACRL offered two workshops, one in Dallas in 1989, and another in Atlanta in 1991, for
this purpose. Supported with resources from the Maxima Corporation and ACRL, the

49

workshops focused on the new standards’ change of focus from input measures, a
traditional view o f assessment of academic libraries, to outcome measures (Jordan &
Lynch, 1998).
Similar to the ACRL Projects and also with support from the Andrew W. Mellon
Foundation, the Southern Education Foundation (SEF) sponsored the Black College
Library Improvement Projects (BCLIP) from 1987 to 1997 (Segal, 1988). Like the
Carnegie Corporation and the General Education Board, the SEF has supported minority
education for many years. The foundation was established in 1937 as a merger among the
Peabody, Slater and Jeanes Funds, three existing funds dedicated to supporting African
American education (Greer, 1996). The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation provided an
initial grant o f $3.2 million to SEF in 1987, which was renewed for another $3.5 million
in 1990 (Southern Education Foundation, 1993). In 1986, SEF hired a consultant to report
on the conditions in private HBCU libraries. The consultant stated:
the real tragedy is that the picture hasn’t improved since the earliest
studies o f black college libraries were done. Black college libraries have
suffered constantly from limited resources, and without increased
development, they may never be up to par with other institutions.
(Southern Education Foundation, 1997, p. 22)
BCLIP provided twenty participating libraries with grants ranging from $35,000
to $50,000 “to enlarge humanities collections, promote library use by students and faculty
and sponsor professional development for libraries” (Southern Education Foundation,
1993, p. 4.) Systems thinking drove the implementation of the program; its purpose of
was to help “ libraries to enhance their collections, participate in professional
development activities and improve services to faculty and students” (Southern Education
Foundation, 1991, Excellence in the Black Colleges: Implications for the Library, para.
1). In discussing the need for such a program, Dr. N.N. “Nat” Fullwood stated “ .. .HBCU

50
librarians themselves are stalled in current administrative hierarchy and should be freed if
they are to play a greater role in institutional effectiveness” (Southern Education
Foundation, 1991, p. 11). Research by Totten (1971) indicated that librarians working in
HBCU libraries were largely absent from the governance process. According to Samuel
Nabrit, second president o f Texas Southern University and an integral figure in
establishing BCLIP, the program complimented another Mellon-funded program focused
on improving humanities in general at HBCUs. Nabrit stated, “You cannot teach
humanities, history and other subjects without adequate libraries, so we decided to
attempt to improve the libraries” (Southern Education Foundation, 1991, p. 15).
The HBCU Library Alliance
The most recent responses to issues in HBCU libraries have been coordinated by
the HBCU Library Alliance. Formally established in 2002, the HBCU Library Alliance
(HBCULA) is a consortium o f libraries serving historically black colleges and
universities. The consortium promotes collaboration among HBCU Libraries, with
emphasis on digitization and preservation o f unique resources, leadership development
and training, research, and other collaborative efforts (Allen & Brooks-Tatum, 2014).
History o f the HBCULA
The HBCULA traces its founding to a series of communications that took place
among deans and directors of HBCU libraries and members of the board of directors of
the Southeastern Library Network (SOLINET), beginning around 2001 (Hart et al.,
2007). Prior to the formation of the HBCULA “no existing organization or committee
offered an agenda or venue on behalf of all of the libraries on the designated White
House HBCU initiative; not in the American Library Association (ALA), not in the Black
Caucus o f the ALA (BCALA), not in the National Association for the Equal Opportunity

in Higher Education (NAFEO, and not in the United Negro College Fund” (Parham,
Franklin & Nevins, 2006). From 2003-2004, assisted by funding from the Andrew W.
Mellon Foundation, the HBCULA and SOLfNET worked collaboratively to conduct a
planning project, which identified some the challenges that prohibited HBCU libraries
from being more involved in teaching and learning activities on their campuses. Included
among these challenges was a lack o f participation at professional meetings of
organizations such as ALA and ACRL due to insufficient funding resources (Allen &
Brooks, Tatum, 2014). Among other outcomes, one result of the planning project was a
sense that building leadership capacity among HBCU librarians would best address the
challenges and should be a top priority (Hart et al., 2007). In addition to the leadership
program, HBCULA has also been in a pioneer in digitizing and preserving archival
collections within HBCU libraries and has conducted two well-respected studies of
conditions in HBCU libraries (Askew & Phoenix, 2011; Nyberg & Idleman, 2005). More
recent endeavors include a partnership with Wayne State University to create an online
masters o f library science (MLS) program to educate students from underrepresented
populations and a collaboration with the HBCU Faculty Development Network to better
understand and improve library services to support faculty research on HBCU campuses
(Allen & Brooks-Tatum, 2014).
The HBCU Library Alliance Leadership Program
In 2005, following the planning project, the HBCULA received a $500,000
implementation grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to implement a series of
professional development activities for HBCU librarians, including a two-part leadership
institute, site visits, an exchange program, and support for HBCU librarians to attend
workshops. The organization received additional funding from the Andrew W. Mellon

52
Foundation for additional cohorts o f its leadership programs in 2007 and 2011
(Galloway, 2011; Orphan, 2007). The purpose of the HBCULA Leadership Program is
“to provide theoretical and practical instruction and useful resources to encourage the
development o f leadership skills within the HBCU library community and on their own
campuses” (HBCU Library Alliance, n.d.-a). To date, four separate leadership institutes
have been held. To achieve their stated goals, the institutes have used a variety of
methods, including theoretical instruction, mentoring, and collaborating with non-HBCU
libraries (HBCU Library Alliance, n.d.-a).
Studies o f Interventions to Improve HBCU Libraries
Although there have been numerous attempts at improving the spaces, collections,
staff and services o f HBCU libraries, very few studies o f these efforts are available. The
overwhelming majority o f the literature on these initiatives consists of individual reports,
anecdotal summaries, recommendations, etc. When the concept o f a learning organization
is considered, interventions to improve HBCU libraries, such as the HBCULA
Leadership Institute, warrant study at the system level. A synthesis o f the literature on
efforts to strengthen HBCU libraries indicates that these efforts, well-intentioned as they
may have been, did not employ systems thinking.
For example, following the ACRL’s Academic Library Internship Program for
Administrators o f Black College Libraries (1974-1978), interns, host directors, and home
institution supervisors received evaluation questionnaires. Based on the responses
received, the evaluators concluded that the experience “did broaden the horizons of the
interns, introduced them to new management methods and styles and [gave] them a
working knowledge o f effective management methods ad principles” (Association of

53
College and Research Librarians, 1979. p. 17). Six of the 25 interns reported being
promoted or “promised promotion” after participating in the program (p. 13). Others
reported being assigned additional projects at their home institutions (ACRL, 1979). The
evaluator suggested a five-year follow-up study, however no such report was found in the
literature. Additionally, no statistical information is provided from the surveys nor is a
thorough determination on how the evaluator came to the above-mentioned conclusions.
In the final report to the Mellon Foundation, ACRL (1979) suggested that impacts and
outcomes o f such programs are best observed over time.
Similarly, little information is available about the impact of ACRL/Mellon Black
Libraries Projects (1987-1991), a descendant of the ACRL Internship Program for
Administrators o f Black College Libraries. In describing the impact of the program,
Jordan and Lynch (1998) noted that “the pre-conferences were well-received, and the
advisory committee agreed that they had served a useful purpose. None of the HBCUs
lost its accreditation” (p. 163). However, though there is no evidence to suggest that
librarians or administrators from either institution attended the pre-conferences, it is
interesting to note that following these interventions, HBCUs continued to be impacted
by failure to meet library accreditation standards. In years following the accreditation
workshop, both Selma University (Mercer, 1998) and Knoxville College (Mercer, 1998)
lost their accreditation for failure to meet library standards, among other reasons.
Additionally, other HBCUs, including Shaw University (Yates, 2002), the
Interdenominational Theological Center (Blake, 2003), Paine College (SACS, 2013),
LeMoyne-Owen College (Basken, 2008), North Carolina Central University

54
(Quinn, 2008), Talladega College (“SACS continues probation”, 2006) and Savannah
State University (Few, 2000) have faced sanctions or threat o f sanctions by SACS for
failure to meet library standards.
The BCLIP (1987-1997), a similar organizational development program for black
college libraries, conducted yearly conferences that brought librarians from the
participating libraries together. Scant information about the project was available outside
o f the program books from the conferences. A review o f these documents indicated that
evaluations o f the yearly conferences were conducted, but little is known about the role
o f the program in developing leadership abilities among participants or how they used
what they learned within their individual libraries and institutions. At the final workshop
in 1997, librarians from participating institutions provided anecdotal references on the
impact o f the project on their campuses, and suggested that the projects improved
collections, professional development, collaborations with faculty, library usage, library
branding, and marketing, preparation for accreditation, networking, community outreach,
automation/technology, and programming. Robert Skinner, library director at Xavier
University in New Orleans, remarked: “If we hadn’t had the SEF/Mellon focus, then we
might still be in a small, dilapidated building with a leaky roof and collections that look
like they came from 1906” (Southern Education Foundation, 1997, p. 18.)
The HBCULA Leadership Program (2004- present), is the most recent
organizational and leadership intervention designed to strengthen HBCUs and their
libraries. Consistent with evaluations of other library leadership programs for HBCUs,
beyond the descriptive information provided on the organization’s web site, a few
participant self-reports (McCullough & Sims, 2009; Sims & Sutton, 2008) and

55
descriptive summaries (Hart et al., 2007; Parham, Franklin & Nevins, 2006), very little
information about the role o f the program in building leadership skills among participants
or how participants have used what they learned within their libraries and on their
campuses is known.
Leadership Development Evaluation
According to Collins (2001), organizational performance is “inferred, implied or
assumed” in most leadership development programs. Two meta-analyses that examined
the prevalence o f evaluation of organizational outcomes from leadership development
program evaluations were found in the literature. The first (Burke & Day, 1986) meta­
analysis o f the effectiveness o f leadership development program evaluations showed that
only three percent o f the studies were evaluated at the organizational level while 30% of
leadership development programs in this analysis measured organizational variables” (p.
52). Collins (2001) updated the work o f Burke and Day (1986) with a meta-analysis of
leadership program evaluations, and found that most leadership programs did not report
the effectiveness o f their programs. Collins (2001) suggested that due to the increased
significance o f outcomes-based requirements, evaluations of leadership development
programs at the organizational level should be paramount. Collins (2001) went as far to
state that, “organizational level outcomes should be the driving force behind the design
and implementation of all leadership development programs” (p. 51). Systems thinking
confirms the findings o f the above-mentioned scholars. Senge (1990) stated that a
learning organization is one that is “continually expanding its capacity to create its
future.” (p. 14)

56
Russon and Reinelt (2004), working on behalf of the William K. Kellogg
Foundation, conducted a comprehensive scan of leadership development programs. The
aim o f the study was to determine “the status o f change-oriented leadership programs.”
Among their findings was that most leadership development programs lack the resources
to extend the evaluation o f their programs beyond the individual domain and that
longitudinal evaluations held promise for understanding the leadership development
process, which often takes place over time (Russon & Reinelt, 2004).
Evaluation of Library Leadership Programs
The lack o f evaluation of the impact of interventions in HBCU libraries is
consistent with a lack o f evaluation o f library leadership development programs in
general. Romaniuk and Haycock (2011) provided the most comprehensive review of
library leadership program evaluation. Their results were consistent with previous
findings by Russon and Reinelt (2004) and Zauha (2007), and made the case for more
formal evaluation o f library leadership programs. Like prior researchers, Romaniuk and
Haycock (2011) found that most library leadership programs lack stated goals and
objectives, making evaluation difficult. O f the library leadership program evaluations
analyzed in the Romaniuk and Haycock (2011) study, only one was found to have any
long-term community or organizational impacts. The authors argued that longitudinal
assessments o f library leadership program impact, outside o f individual outcomes, are
necessary. Zauha’s (2007) review discovered that participant self-reports on the impact
of library leadership development programs dominated in the literature, noting that indepth qualitative analysis of participant self-reports, interviews with participants and
mentors and longitudinal studies of cohorts were rare.

57
In addition to these findings o f Romaniuk and Haycock (2011), the lack of formal
evaluation o f library leadership programs was noted by several additional scholars
(Mason & Wetherbee, 2004; Puente, 2009; Neely, 2009). In reviewing the literature on
evaluation of library leadership program evaluation, Mason and Wetherbee (2004) found
very few published formal evaluations. The authors grouped the evaluations that they
discovered into three main groups: 1) descriptive narratives o f program components 2)
participant self-reporting and 3) summaries of post-training evaluations.
A review o f the literature on library leadership development program evaluation
indicated that since Mason and Wetherbee’s (2004) study, little has changed in library
leadership program evaluations. Most evaluations continued to consist of participant selfreports (McCullough & Sims, 2009; German, Owen, Parchuck & Sandore, 2009; Kalin,
2008; Puente, 2009; Roy, Cooper, Tysick, and Waters, 2006), and descriptive narratives
(Hart et al., 2007; Webster & Young, 2009; Weiner, Breivik, Clark, & Caboni, 2009;
Rumble & MacEwan, 2008: Thull, 2006). Only a few of these studies reported on
leadership development programs for librarians of color (McCullough & Sims, 2009;
Hart et al., 2007; Puente, 2009; Roy, Cooper, Tysick, & Waters, 2006; Thull, 2006).
Among these, only three reported on programs designed for librarians working in
minority serving institutions (McCullough & Sims, 2008; Hart et al., 2007; Thull, 2006).
Collectively these evaluations provided little empirical information of program impact
beyond reports on participant satisfaction. Evaluations falling into the third category
identified by Mason and Wetherbee (2004), formal evaluations o f library leadership
programs, were scarcer still. Aside from Neely’s (2009) evaluation of the ARL
Leadership and Career Development Program, no formal evaluations of library leadership

58
programs targeting librarians o f color or librarians working in minority serving
institutions, such as the HBCU Library Alliance’s Leadership Program, appeared in the
literature since Mason & Wetherbee’s (2004) study.
Summary
The historical development and current conditions in HBCU libraries strongly
mirrored those o f their parent institutions. The preceding literature review outlined the
context in which these libraries developed by briefly exploring the development of
HBCUs and the challenges that they have faced since their inception. Most of these
challenges can be traced to a history o f discrimination, which has resulted in a lack of
funding, particularly for public HBCUs. The results of this discrimination and funding
also resulted in systemic struggles for HBCUs, perhaps most notably a struggle to attain
and maintain regional accreditation.
The HBCU library provides a proxy for exploring the residual effects of the
problems faced by their parent institutions. HBCU libraries, inclusive of collections,
staffs, physical structures, etc., developed within this system and have faced numerous
challenges, most o f which can be traced to inadequate and inconsistent funding within
their parent institutions. For example, in attempts to meet the necessary minimum
volume counts required by SACs, the regional accrediting agency o f most HBCUs, the
libraries have focused on amassing large physical collections, sometimes with a focus on
quantity rather than quality. Another example from the literature of the interrelatedness
of the library to the institution was the education o f librarians working within HBCUs
libraries. The literature revealed the struggles of African American library workers to
obtain the necessary credentials to serve HBCU libraries. This training was often

59

relegated to library education programs operating within HBCUs, programs that faced the
same funding struggles as their parent institutions. As a result, education for African
American library workers has historically been perilous, uncertain, and largely dependent
on external contributions. Maintaining the professional skills of HBCU librarians has also
been a challenge for the libraries and their institutions. To mitigate these problems,
HBCU libraries have been the focus o f several interventions that were designed to
improve the libraries, with the expectation that such improvements would extend to the
parent institution. Several organizations, including ACRL, the Andrew W. Mellon
Foundation, the General Education Board, and the Julius Rosenwald Fund, have played a
critical role o f providing education and professional development for African American
library workers. The HBCU Library Alliance, a non-profit consortium of HBCU libraries
that has been largely funded by the Mellon Foundation, emerged from the literature as the
most recent champion o f efforts to improve and strengthen HBCU libraries.
Leadership programs were found in the literature to be a common solution to
challenges faced by academic libraries and their parent institutions. Whether expressed
or implied, most leadership development programs focused on organizational
development, but few studies o f the organizational outcomes of leadership programs were
found in the literature. The available literature on library leadership programs varied and
included program descriptions, personal narratives, anecdotal references, with few formal
studies available. Literature on leadership programs serving librarians of color and those
working in minority serving institutions such as HBCUs was found to be lacking.

CHAPTER 3
METHODOLOGY
This study used a mixed methods approach to explore the outcomes and impact of
the HBCU Library Alliance Leadership program, a leadership development program for
librarians working in HBCU Libraries. Among librarians working in HBCU libraries, the
issue o f retirement is particularly pronounced; Youmans’ (2009) research on succession
plans among HBCU libraries revealed that while many HBCU library directors
anticipated retiring shortly, few had formal or even informal succession plans in place.
Youmans (2009) recommended a study of participants in interventions designed to
address this problem, such as the HBCU Library Alliance Leadership Program, to
determine whether participants advanced in their careers following participation in the
program. This study addressed this gap in the literature, as well as explored how
participation in the program influenced the libraries and institutions where participants
are employed.
The participants were restricted to those who attended the first, second and third
of the four existing cohorts of the HBCU Library Alliance Leadership Program. The
executive director of the organization volunteered to share the email recruitment script on
its listserv, which assisted in recruitment. The recruitment script was also posted within
several other online venues likely to be frequented by participants. Participants received
a brief background on the study, accompanied by a request to participate form and an
informed consent document. The researcher collected data using an open-ended,
60

61

electronic survey. Willing participants were solicited from the survey to participate in
one-on-one interviews. Archival evidence from the program, including participants’
culminating presentations and reports to the funder of the program, was also reviewed.
The researcher analyzed the data to identify critical incidents, themes, and patterns.
Research Questions
The following research questions guided this study:
RQ1: What was the role of the leadership program in developing leadership
abilities among participants?
RQ2: How did the participants in the program use what they learned in the
leadership program within their immediate workplaces (libraries)?
RQ3: How did participants in the program use what they learned in the leadership
program within their larger campuses and in professional organizations?
Research Design
This study used a sequential explanatory mixed methods design (Tashakkori &
Teddlie, 2003), which involved the collection of both quantitative and qualitative data
and integrating the two forms for data for a more complete understanding of the research
problem than either single approach individually (Creswell, 2014). The rationale for
using mixed methods research was that it can answer research questions that other
methodologies cannot, provide stronger inferences, and present more divergent views
(Tashakkori & Teddlie, 2003). Mixed methods complement each other and allow for
more complete analysis via the five functions: triangulation, complementarity,
development, initiation, and expansion (Greene, Caracelli, & Graham, 1989; Tashakkori
& Teddlie, 2003). In mixed methods the researcher is under the “dictatorship of the

62
research question” as they use a pragmatic worldview (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 2003, p.
21). Pragmatism supports both the qualitative and quantitative research paradigms and
resists the notion of “incompatibility” between them. Pragmatism avoids the
metaphysical debate o f what is “truth” and “reality (Howe, 1988). Pragmatism as a
philosophical movement began in the late 19th century with further expanded upon by
Charles Sanders Peirce and William James, John Dewey, and George Herbert Mead.
What highlights this worldview or epistemology is the fundamental agreement to reject
the traditional assumptions about the nature o f knowledge in inquiry (Tashakkori &
Teddlie, 2003). There was a focus on a search for meaning within the theoretical
perspective o f social reform. Dewey’s writings transformed this philosophy into social
science investigation o f larger communities. While Peirce believed in logic as the method
of science, Dewey’s view of the scientific method focused on “common sense” and to
“drop the conception o f science as a system of absolute truths” (Reichenbach, 1951, p.
182). This historical theme supports the idea that multiple methods have value and
expand “the interpretive dimensions o f social science research and lay bare the
assumptions about the nature o f reality, the human mind, and the tools that investigators
employ in research” (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 2003, p. 86).
The researcher selected the case study method as the methodology. Creswell
(2007) stated that “case study research involves the study of an issue explored through
one or more cases within a bounded system (i.e., a setting, a context)” (p. 73). According
to Yin (2012), “all case study research starts from the same compelling feature: the desire
to derive a (n) (up) close or otherwise in-depth understanding of a single or small number
o f ’cases’ set in their real-world context” (pp. 141-142). The case study method was

63
selected because it is considerate of contextual conditions, in this case, the HBCU, which
is the setting in which the leadership program operated. According to Yin (2012), “other
methods will likely treat any blurring between the focus of study and its context as, at
best, an annoyance” (p. 143). Case study research, according to Yin (2012), begins by
defining the case that will be studied. For the proposed research study, the case was the
HBCU Library Alliance Leadership Program. Specially, this study used an embedded
arrangement, where the main case was the HBCU Library Leadership Program and the
individual participants in the leadership cohorts were a secondary unit of analysis.
According to Yin (2009), “the evidence from multiple cases is often considered more
compelling, and the overall study is therefore regarded as more robust” (Herriott &
Firestone, 1983, p. 53).
The study used systems thinking as it applies to learning organizations as a
theoretical framework. According to Senge (1990) a learning organization is one “that is
continually expanding its capacity to create its future” (p. 14). Giesecke and McNeil
(2004) described the learning organization this way: “A learning organization is an
organization skilled at creating, acquiring, and transferring knowledge and at modifying
its behavior to reflect new knowledge and insights” (p. 55). This framework was utilized
to explore how participants in the HBCU Library Alliance Leadership program have used
what they have learned to influence their libraries, as well as the colleges and universities
where they are employed.
The primary data collection method was an online survey that was distributed to
the participants via Survey Monkey. The survey included demographic questions
designed to collect information about the participants, such as age, educational

64
credentials, and information about the libraries where they are employed or were
employed at the time they participated in the leadership program. Open-ended questions
were used to collect data on the experiences of the participants and the impact of program
participation on their libraries and institutions. The purpose of these questions was to gain
insight into how participants applied what they learned in their work settings and if they
feel they were successful in integrating the library into the teaching and learning
activities o f their campuses, one of the primary goals o f the program.
The secondary qualitative phase o f the study included a data collection strategy
of one-on-one interviews with participants, a purposeful sample, from the online survey
who indicated a willingness to participate in such a process. These interviews were
conducted via telephone or Skype. Participants agreed to have the interviews recorded,
which facilitated future transcription and analysis.
A third data collection method was document analysis. The HBCU Alliance has a
wealth o f written information that provided insight into the outcomes of the leadership
program. A component o f the leadership program required participants to complete a
related project at their home institution and present the results of the project during the
program. These presentations were readily available on the HBCU Alliance’s web site.
Additionally, the Executive Director of the HBCU Alliance provided the researcher with
the proposals for each o f the iterations of the program, as well as the final reports that
were submitted to the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the primary funder o f the program.
Population
The HBCU Library Alliance Leadership Program has been in existence since
2005 and has included four cohorts of participants. The population for this study included

65
participants from the first, second and third cohorts. Only librarians who were not library
directors at the time o f their participation in the program were recruited. These
delimitations were imposed by the researcher for several reasons, but primarily because
there has been some variation in the curriculum and experiences among the cohorts.
Among the four cohorts, the first, second, and third cohorts appeared to have had the
most similar experiences. The first cohort was unique in that it utilized a “train-thetrainer” format, where seasoned HBCU library directors received training in an attempt to
equip them with the skills to serve as mentors to emerging library leaders working in
HBCU libraries.
The second and third cohorts moved away from this format and targeted emerging
HBCU library leaders almost exclusively. Existing library directors participated in the
first three cohorts, but they appear to have served primarily as mentors and were not the
primary focus o f the program. Therefore, participants who were already library directors
were excluded from the population. The fourth and final cohort was excluded from the
population, because their experience in the program ended just several months prior to
the beginning o f this study. The researcher believed that these participants might not have
yet had opportunities to apply what they learned in the program.
Sample
Criterion sampling, a process that requires purposeful selection of cases that meet
specified criteria, was used. According to Creswell (2007), “criterion sampling works
well when all individuals studied represent people who have experienced the
phenomenon” (p. 128). The researcher obtained the sample from a listing on the HBCU
Library Alliance’s web site.

66

Participants
The participants included librarians who were not directors at the time o f their
participation in the first, second and third cohorts of the HBCU Library Alliance
Leadership Program which constitutes criterion sampling (Patton, 2002). The total
number o f participants meeting these criteria was 45. The first cohort included 22
participants, the second and third included 8 and 15 participants, respectively. No
incentives were offered to the participants for their participation; however, the
participants may have received some benefits through their participation. For example,
participation in the study allowed the participants to reflect on their experiences in the
program. This exercise provided an opportunity for participants to consider their
experiences in the program in new and alternative ways.
Instrumentation
The study used a modified version of Neely and Winston’s (1999b) survey o f the
Snowbird Leadership Institute. The researcher selected this instrument because it had
been used as the basis for several other studies o f library leadership programs, including
the Northern Exposure to Leadership (Phelan, 2005), the Aurora Leadership Institute
(Barney, 2004) and the ARL Leadership and Career Development Program (Neely, 2009)
and would lend some generalizability and comparability to the findings (Neely, 2009).
While the external validity or generalizability may be limited to the sample population,
mixed methods uses a term called “inference transferability” as a term to describe both
the quantitative term, external validity” and the qualitative term transferability
(Tashakkori & Teddlie, 2003). The researcher needed to know the context to know how
transferable the results to another situation are. Although the research may not be

67
generalizable because o f the design, the use of an existing instrument as the basis for the
current study’s instrument added to the “small but rich body o f published evidence
available about the perceptions of the effectiveness of library leadership programs”
(Neely, 2009, p. 813). The researcher obtained permission from Neely prior to using and
modifying the existing instrument.
In mixed methods, the term “inference quality” is used the rather than validity
(Tashakkori & Teddlie, 2003). Inference quality refers to the quantitative “internal
validity” or the qualitative term “credibility” (Tashakkori & Teddlie, 2003) which
includes the term “trustworthiness” (Denzin & Lincoln, 2000).

Trustworthiness of the

qualitative research was maintained using the following strategies: triangulation,
clarification o f researcher bias, member checking and external audit.
Berg and Lune (2012) defined triangulation as “the use o f multiple lines of sight”
(p. 6). Triangulation in its simplest form involves using multiple data collection
techniques to confirm a phenomenon. Triangulation was achieved by using at least three
different sources to confirm the major findings o f the study. Findings from this study
were triangulated by 1) a survey 2) follow-up interviews with willing participants and 3)
document review. Glesne (2006) suggested that researchers should consider their own
“subjectivity and how you [they] will use and monitor it in your [their] research” (p. 37).
The researcher acknowledged her personal biases. The researcher is a graduate of two
HBCUs, and acknowledged an affinity for these institutions. The researcher
acknowledged that she had hoped to participate in the HBCU Library Alliance
Leadership Program but was denied the opportunity to do so. Additionally, the researcher
acknowledged her familiarity with libraries based on 13 years of work in the field. To

68

counteract these acknowledged biases, the researcher used both member checking and
external audit to provide additional validity for the study. In social science research,
member checking is the process of confirming the validity and representativeness of data
with research participants. The researcher confirmed the collected data through 1) sharing
the aggregate data from the online survey with participants 2) providing participants from
the one-on-one interviews with transcripts o f the interviews along with the identified
themes from the analysis and 3) external audit of the study from a colleague.
Data Collection
The data for this study were collected through the survey, the one-on-one
interviews, and the document review. The survey was created using SurveyMonkey, an
online survey creation tool. The one-on-one interviews were conducted using Skype and
were recorded and transcribed for further analyses. The documents were saved as PDFs,
which facilitated the process for later importation into NVivo, the qualitative data
management software that was used for the analysis.
Institutional Review Board
Prior to beginning the collection of data, the researcher submitted the Institutional
Review Board application, which was approved. The researcher submitted one
application for modification o f the original Institutional Review Board. The modification
application was also approved.
Response Rate
Participants from the first, second and third cohorts of the HBCU Library
Alliance Leadership Program who met the defined criteria were recruited via email to
participate in the study. Recruitment scripts were posted on the listservs of the HBCU

69

Library Alliance and the Black Caucus of the American Library Association (BCALA).
Participants were also recruited from the BCALA Facebook group and from the Black
Librarian’s Nation Linkedln Group.
The researcher anticipated a response rate o f 50 percent. Such a response rate was
consistent with Creswell’s recommendation o f not including more than 4 or 5 cases
within a single study, which was recommended for providing sufficient enough cases to
perform both cross-case and theme analysis (2007). The actual response rate for the
survey was 32%. Six participants from the survey agreed to participate in the one-on-one
interviews.
Data Analysis
Descriptive statistics from the quantitative survey items were summarized in the
text and placed in tables sequence using SPSS (IBM, 2013). Frequencies were conducted
to identify valid percent responses as necessary. The interview data and open-ended text
from surveys were de-identified and imputed into NVivo, a qualitative software
program,(QSR International, 2013) and consequentially underwent line by line coding.
Thematic analysis, a process by which qualitative data are “segmented, categorized,
summarized, and reconstructed” in a way that provides meaning (Ayres, 2008, p. 867),
was performed. Some codes were identified from the literature and themes were
identified through the analysis o f the qualitative data from the survey, interviews, project
presentations, and documents.

70
Reporting Results
Results were presented in the order of the research questions in Chapter 4.
Consistent with sequential mixed-methods designs, quantitative results were presented
first. The qualitative results followed, which helped to refine and explain the previously
presented quantitative information.
Summary
The study used a mixed-method to explore the research questions. The primary
data collection method was an online survey; a secondary data collection method was
one-on-one interviews. Thirdly, the study employed document analysis of documents
related to the participants’ required projects, and historical documents related to the
program.
Participants were recruited from several listservs and online communities where
they were likely to maintain a presence. After consenting to participate in the study,
participants were presented with an online link to the survey, which was created using
Survey Monkey, an online survey tool. Participants for the one-on-one interviews were
recruited from the survey. Those participants who agreed to participate in the interviews
were presented with four open-ended questions. The interviews were conducted either via
telephone or Skype. All interviews were recorded which facilitated future transcription
and analysis.
The quantitative data from the survey were imported into SPSS, cleaned, and
explored. Descriptive statistics were run and Wilcoxon signed-rank test was conducted
on selected questions. Qualitative data from the open-ended survey questions, documents,
and the interviews were de-identified and imported into NVivo, a qualitative data

71
analysis software. NVivo’s auto-coding feature was used on the open-ended survey
questions and the interview questions, which assisted in reviewing the data and
comparing and contrasting codes both within and across cases, a process that was
instrumental in refining the codes. A constant comparative process was used to collapse
the subthemes into main themes.
Trustworthiness o f the qualitative research was maintained using the following
strategies: triangulation, clarification o f researcher bias, member checking and external
audit. Triangulation was achieved through the use of three different data sources: the
survey, the interviews, and the document review. The researcher also identified her bias
and used member checking and an external auditor to maintain the trustworthiness of the
data.

CHAPTER 4
RESULTS
The purpose o f this study was to explore the role of the HBCU Library Alliance
Leadership Program in creating future library leaders. Using a sequential explanatory
mixed-method design, this case study collected data from the first three cohorts o f the
program to gain understanding into how it developed leadership skills among participants
and how participants used what they learned within their libraries and on the campuses
where they were employed. An online survey, one-on-one interviews, and document
review were used to collect the data for the study. The quantitative data were de­
identified, reformatted, and exported into SPSS, for descriptive and inferential statistical
analysis (IBM, 2013). The qualitative data were de-identified and imported into NVivo
(QSR International, 2014), a qualitative data analysis software program, where coding
and analysis took place to identify themes and patterns (Richards, 2006).
The sample size for this study was relatively small. Regarding the quantitative
results that are presented, conducting statistical analyses with small sample sizes can
produce results that can be misleading. The researcher acknowledges the small sample
size and makes no attempt to purposely inflate the results or mislead the reader. For the
paired sample analyses that are presented, the researcher included the effect size. For
other results that were presented, the number o f participants included in the analyses is

72

73

included. The reader is cautioned to consider the number o f participants when reviewing
the results. As noted in Chapter 3, the results of this study are not intended to be
generalizable.
This chapter will begin by providing demographic and characteristic information
about the participants, followed by a presentation of the findings in the order of the
research questions. In mixed-methods sequential explanatory designs, quantitative data is
collected, analyzed and presented first, followed by the presentation of qualitative data
and its analysis that “help explain, or elaborate on the quantitative data presented in the
first phase” (Ivankova, Creswell, & Stick, 2006, p. 5). With this in mind, the quantitative
data for each research question, if applicable, will be presented first, followed by the
qualitative data which will “refine and explain” the previously presented statistical results
“by exploring participants’ views in more depth” (Ivankova, Creswell, & Stick, 2006, p.
5).
Research Questions
RQ1: What was the role of the leadership program in developing leadership
abilities among participants?
RQ2: How did the participants in the program use what they learned in the
leadership program within their immediate workplaces (libraries)?
RQ3: How did participants in the program use what they learned in the leadership
program within their larger campuses and in professional organizations?
Respondents
Fourteen participants responded to the survey out of a sample of 44 for the three
cohorts of the program, resulting in a response rate of 32%. Six interview participants

74
were recruited from the survey participants. Detailed demographic and characteristic
information about the survey respondents is presented below.
Demographics o f Respondents
One hundred percent of respondents to the survey were female. Nearly one-third
(28.6%) preferred not to answer the question on age range; of those who responded, the
majority (57.2%) were age 46 and above. Ninety-seven percent of the respondents were
African American.
Participants’ undergraduate degrees were dispersed through the humanities
(28.6%), social sciences (14.3%) and natural sciences (14.3%). More than half reported
that they had undergraduate minors, the majority o f which were in the social sciences
(57.1%). All (100%) o f the participants reported that they possessed a Masters in Library
Science (MLS), the terminal degree for librarians and nearly half (42.9%) received their
terminal library degrees from library education programs at historically black colleges
and universities (HBCUs). Two participants reported receiving additional graduate
degrees in management information systems and management respectively, one reported
an EdS in Teacher Leadership and another reported an EdD in Administration and
Leadership. The demographics and characteristics o f the participants are presented in

Characteristics o f Participants
Participants’ years o f professional experience, including the total years of
experience, as well as the years of experience at the time of program participation and
years in their current positions, are presented in Table 2. The participants’ average
number o f years o f experience as a professional librarian was 15.21. Participants
averaged 9.91 years of experience prior to participating in the leadership program and
had a mean o f 4.55 years o f experience in their current positions. The variation in the
number o f years as professional librarian was larger (SD=8.069) than both the variation
in the number years o f experience prior to participating in the program (SD=5.873) and
the years in the current position (SD=3.110), respectively.

Participants were nearly evenly split among the 2005-2006 (42.9%) and 2009-2012
(42.9%) cohorts; only 14.3 % of respondents were from the 2007-2008 cohort, which was
the smallest o f the three cohorts included in the sample.
Participants were geographically concentrated in the southern United States; only
one participant was located outside of this area at the time o f participation. Only two
states, North Carolina and Louisiana, had more than one participant to go through the
program. Slightly more participants were employed in public institutions than private
institutions at the time o f participation and most participants were employed in master’s
colleges during the program.

Research Question 1
RQ 1: What was the role o f the leadership program in developing leadership
abilities among participants? The purpose of this question was to identify those aspects
of the leadership program that influenced participants’ leadership abilities. The data for
this question came from the archival documents, the survey, and the interviews.
Quantitative Results
Promotion to new positions and internal transfers to positions with additional
authority were two proxies for examining career progression and leadership development.
A review o f participants’ current job situation relative to their job situation at the time of
participation in the program is provided in Table 4 and provides insight into the role of
the program in developing the necessary skills to assume leadership positions. More
participants (42.9%) reported being in different positions at the same institution than any
other current job situation.

Sixty percent of participants reported that they felt their career paths would have been
different without the program and 75% attributed the program to their ability to obtain
positions following participation in the program.

The leadership program was multi-faceted and provided learnings and benefits to
participants through multiple components, including workshops and webinars, a
mentoring program, on-site visits, and an exchange program with members o f the
Association o f Southeastern Research Libraries (ASERL). Participants also attended the
alliance’s membership meetings and had access to a listserv. Table 6 provides
participants’ rankings o f the benefits and learning received from the various program
components. Among those experiences, participants believed they received the greatest
degree o f learnings and benefits from the workshops/webinars (91.67%), listserv (91.66
%) and the mentoring relationships (83.33%) that the program provided.

Participation in campus and professional leadership activities before and since
participating in the leadership program was another proxy for exploring the development
o f leadership skills o f participants. Most participants were not required to engage in
scholarly endeavors to obtain promotion and tenure, neither in their current positions
(61.54%) nor in positions in which they had been employed since participating in the
program (66.67%). Without such a requirement, statistically significant differences in
participation in these types of endeavors had the potential to lend additional credibility to

82

the program’s role in developing leadership skills. To determine the difference in
productivity in these pursuits before and after the program, a Wilcoxon signed-rank test
was conducted on the campus and professional activities before and since participating in
the program.
O f the 14 participants who responded to the question on their professional
presentations before and since the program, participation in the leadership program
elicited an increase in professional presentations in 10 participants, whereas three
participants saw no increase and one participant produced fewer presentations. A
Wilcoxon paired samples signed-rank test determined that there was a statistically
significant increase in presentations after participants experienced the leadership program
(MD=4.50) compared to before experiencing the program, (MD = 1.0, z = 2.281, p =.023,
r = .43).
O f the 14 participants who responded to the question on their participation in
professional associations before and since the program, participation in the leadership
program elicited an increase in professional association participation in eight participants,
whereas six participants saw no increase. Professional activities before and after
experiencing the leadership program were compared using a Wilcoxon paired samples
signed-rank test, which determined that there was a statistically significant increase after
participants experienced the program (MD before=1.0, MD after=2.0) (z = 2.585,/?
= 010, r = .49).
When all o f the professional and campus activities were combined into a single
variable, o f the 14 participants who responded, participation in the leadership program
elicited an increase in these activities in nine participants, whereas three participants saw

83
no increase, and two saw a decrease. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test determined that there
was a statistically significant increase (MD =3.50) in all activities after participants
experienced the leadership program (MD before = 5.0, MD after =12.0) (z = 2.135,/?
=.010, r = .40).

The quantitative data for this research question revealed that there were large
increases in the number o f participants who reported currently being library directors
(400% increase in deans and directors). A larger percentage (42.9%) of participants
reported that they were promoted within the same institution where they were employed
during the program than those who remained in the same position in the same institution
(14.3%) or those to whom neither o f the previous statuses applied (35.7%). Regardless
o f their career progression, 75% o f participants reported that they felt their career paths
would have been different had they not participated in the program.
Participation in campus and professional activities is another measure of
participants’ leadership development. Although most participants were not required to
engage in scholarly endeavors in their current positions or in positions held since
participating in the program, statistically significant differences in professional
presentations (p =.023), professional activities (p =.010) and a combination variable of
professional and campus activities (p =.010) were observed. Participants’ evaluation of
the value of the various program components also provides evidence of the program’s
contributions to career development. When asked to rate the degree of benefits and
learnings received from the various program components, participants recognized the
workshops/webinars (91.67%) and mentoring program (83.33%) as most beneficial.
Qualitative Results
The initial deductive codes for this study came from the literature reviewed in
Chapter 2 and were organized into hierarchical system of emerging themes. Variations in
the codes were organized into sub-categories through a constant comparative method
with a selection o f conceptual similarities under the main codes. Thematic analysis was
utilized as qualitative data were “segmented, categorized, summarized, and

85

reconstructed” in a way that provides meaning (Ayres, 2008, p. 867). The data were
coded and then logically pieced together into broader themes (Yin, 2014). All qualitative
data were imported into NVivo for data retrieval and analysis. A systematic, deductive
thematic analysis for identifying, analyzing, and presenting categorical patterns within
data was utilized (Boyatzis, 1998; Braun & Clarke, 2006). To gain as much information
as possible, all textural data from interviews were coded line by line integrating a
deductive and inductive analytic approach (Boyatzis, 1998; Fereday & Muir-Cochrane,
2006). Research strategies were employed to build abstractions, concepts, hypotheses,
or theories (Merriam, 1998). Creswell (2007;(Creswell & Plano Clark, 2007) surmised
that case study research “involves the study o f an issue through one or more cases within
a bounded system” (p. 73).The initial codes reflected the historical and contemporary
problems faced by libraries at HBCUs as identified in the literature. Additional
deductive codes came from the five disciplines that make up systems thinking (Senge,
1990). The codes from the open-ended survey questions and the interviews primarily
came from the participants themselves; in a few instances, where participants’ choice of
language varied, the researcher assigned codes appropriate for inductive thematic
analysis. NVivo’s auto-coding feature was used on the open-ended survey questions and
the interview questions to assist in the process of refining the codes. This feature allowed
the open-ended survey questions and the interview questions to be grouped by question.
The query and code-striping features in NVivo were also used to compare codes within
and across questions, which allowed the codes to be further collapsed into main themes.
The qualitative data for this research question, which came from the open-ended
survey questions and the interviews with participants, provided further clarity and support

86

via triangulation for these quantitative findings. While the quantitative data analysis
highlighted the relationships among academic productivity and professional and campus
leadership activities and the various program components, the qualitative data expanded
upon those findings by illuminating the meaning o f those experiences for participants.
The qualitative data analysis for this question validated the contribution of the program to
participants’ ability to affect change within their libraries and on their campuses, as well
as their success in advancing their careers following completion of the program. Three
themes from the qualitative data for this question were: networking and community,
promotion and career planning, and empowerment. The themes and sub-themes for RQl
are illustrated in Figure 1.

Network and community. In the quantitative data analyses for RQ1, the value of
the leadership program components (mentoring program, listserv, site visits, membership
meetings, and exchange program) were ranked by the participants. The qualitative data
expanded on these findings by illustrating what participants believed they were able to do
as a result of those experiences. Participants clarified the meaning of the various program
components. By describing the benefits received from the mentoring and peer
relationships they developed, participants revealed the value of those relationships.
Through the community that was created, participants were able to identify service and
programming models that could be replicated at their institutions, select examples of best
practices, and develop contacts that could be called upon for advice and support in future
endeavors.
The quantitative analyses of the data for this research question indicated that
83.33% o f program participants believed that they received benefits and learnings from
the mentoring program. The qualitative data analysis confirmed this finding, as the
mentoring component o f the leadership program was regarded as valuable by three o f the
interview participants. Through the relationships that it fostered, the mentoring
component provided participants with a resource for future use, as illustrated by the
reflective comment below from one participant who is now a doctoral candidate and
changed institutions because o f the mentoring program:
Well, you know there's a part o f the experience that I had, which is the
mentoring piece. I found that to be helpful to me. I found that now, even
though we're - what - four years out o f my having participated in the
experience I can still call my mentor and talk with her. And then it was
also helpful when I was able to become a mentor with the Leadership
Institute—some o f the things that I noticed that my mentor did, I was able
to pattern some o f my mentor-mentee experience just with my mentees.

88

Another participant recalled her experience this way:
But then these institutes brought us together so that we could, in a sense,
collaborate but it was more. When the walls move more from the mentor
(which they always will be), but more as collaborators in my formation as
a librarian and as a leader, I found the project just very—the institute just
very, very significant in that.
The examples above revealed that as participants advanced in their careers, these
relationships grew from being mentor-to-mentee to peer-to-peer collaborations.
Participants also highlighted the informal mentoring benefits fostered by the program,
revealing that it provided an opportunity for them to see HBCU library deans at meetings
and to contact them. Overall, the mentoring program allowed participants to gain insight
from someone with an alternative (new) perspective. As stated by one participant from a
public master’s college one university, the mentoring component “provided an outlet for
honest communication.”
In addition to developing one-on-one relationships through the mentoring
component o f the program, participants revealed that the program facilitated the
development o f a peer networking group. On the value o f developing relationships with
other librarians employed at HBCUs, one participant, who was employed at a research
university and was promoted to a department head position since participating in the
program, described the benefit o f the networking community as follows:
One o f the greatest benefits was being able to network with other people
in the profession who were servicing the same type o f organizations. And
to be able to gain insight and experience from them, like, we tried to do
different projects or just getting general feedback on what their
experiences were.
Another stated in a historical documents related to the program that:
Unlike when I attend other conferences, I didn't have to explain that my
institution is a private HBCU in [large city in South] that boasts 1,800
students and is pressing on amidst the reality of rising costs coupled with

89

declining budgets. There was no need to debate whether HBCUs are still
necessary in a post-modern and, some say, post-racial society. Most
importantly, after a negatively eventful past year where [private HBCU
located in a Southern state] received back-to-back bad press, I didn't feel
compelled to defend our university.
One participant who had experienced other leadership programs contextualized her
experience in the HBCU Library Alliance’s Leadership program by describing it this
way, revealing the significance of the HBCU context, “The HBCU Library Alliance
Leadership Institute is unlike any other leadership institute that I've participated in, in the
fact that it is more aligned with what I have experienced as a librarian at an HBCU
library.”
Though the listserv, exchange program and site visits were not as highly ranked as
the mentoring program and membership meetings, each provided an opportunity for
participants to connect with others, both mentors and peers. The participant below
acknowledged the value o f the workshops and webinars and appreciated the program:
For the ongoing support that the institute gave, even by sharing
information from the Library Alliance listserv, and some of those
supplementary workshops, or emails, or information that was passed back
and forth.
Promotion and career planning. Quantitative findings for R Q 1 revealed that
nearly half (42.9%) o f participants were promoted within their institutions after
participating in the program and that the percentage o f those participants reporting being
library deans and directors and assistant deans/directors also increased when compared
with pre-program levels (400% and 60%, respectively). The qualitative data analysis for
this question enhanced these findings by revealing that some participants who changed
institutions were also promoted. It also augmented these quantitative findings by
exposing the fact that the participants believed that leadership program was influential in

90

their decisions regarding the future direction of their careers, particularly their decisions
to pursue promotions and to obtain advanced degrees. Additionally, the qualitative data
for this question explained how the leadership program experience changed the way that
participants saw themselves, as well as their beliefs about how others perceived them.
The quantitative findings for RQ1 showed that 75% of participants felt that their
careers would have been different and the qualitative findings help to explain several of
the reasons for this belief. For example, participants felt that the program aided in
building their confidence, as illustrated in the comments below from a participant, who
transitioned to a leadership position within another HBCU library after completing the
program:
Without the additional leadership training from the HBCU Library
Alliance, I honestly do not believe that I would have been able to accept
the subsequent positions that I have held since the institution. The
institution helped me to see my own leadership potential and gave me the
confidence that I was lacking as a leader.
Another participant, who is now Associate Director at an HBCU library, confirmed this
sentiment, stating that “it [the leadership program] certainly gave me support and the
confidence to pursue additional leadership positions in HBCU libraries.”
In addition to seeing themselves differently and feeling more confident,
participants felt that the leadership program helped them to be perceived differently by
others. One participant, who is now the library director at a public HBCU master’s
college, gave direct credit to her participation in the leadership institute for being
considered for a promotion:
The most immediate career or job change that I made after my
participation in the program was I went from acting Assistant Director in
the Public Services to full-pledged Assistant Director Head of Public
Services. The “acting” was because the President at that time said that I
didn’t have enough leadership training. So after the program, I was finally

91

moved to Assistant Director Head of Public Services... I think the institute
did influence that change, especially for that position...I think it also had
an impact on the fact that I was offered an interim director position and
from interim to full-fledged director, because I had participated in the
Leadership Institute for the HBCU Library Alliance...
Armed with self-confidence and a belief that the leadership program experience
set them apart, participants reported thinking about their careers differently. Several
participants stated that the program cemented their decision to pursue administrative
positions. “I think the leadership institute helped solidify my decision to move into an
upper management position,” stated one participant, who went on to obtain a doctoral
degree and was promoted to an associate library director position at another library.
Another participant, who had accumulated ten years of library experience prior to
participating in the program, reflected as follows: “I’m not there anym ore...! really did
not want to go, at least at that place, for middle management. I had been working in
libraries for ten years and I said, ‘Okay. What now?...Do I become a supervisor?’” When
her institution’s administration made the decision to cut positions within the library,
armed with what she had learned, this same participant’s decision to pursue a PhD was,
in her words, “sealed” This kind of thinking was consistent with what Senge (1990)
refers to as personal mastery, or “continually clarifying what is important to us.” (pp.
139-141).

92

For example, the participant above credited the program with helping her to consider the
trajectory of her career.
I believe my career path would have been different in that I probably
would not have taken nn any leadership roles. Basically, it encouraged me
to think about my career just a little bit differently. It encouraged me to
think about the ‘what next.’
Seventy-five percent o f participants credited the program to their ability to obtain future
positions.
Collectively, these quotes provided evidence that through the program,
participants where provided with an opportunity to clarify their personal vision, a key
component o f personal mastery (Senge, 1990). Personal mastery is not necessarily a goal
of learning organizations, but learning organizations reap benefits when their employees
refine and develop their personal visions (Phipps, 1993).
Participation in campus and professional leadership activities was another proxy
for exploring the leadership skills o f participants before and since participating in the
program. The quantitative findings for RQ1 revealed that several statistically significant
increases in scholarly and professional activities took place (presentations,/?=.023;
participation in professional associations, p=.010; combination variable all professional
activities p = .033). Qualitative findings for this theme supported and helped to explain
the quantitative findings and reinforced the previously presented results on the meaning
and value o f the networking and community that the program created, as revealed in the
quote below.
Librarians at my institution are tenure track. Publications, presentations,
and service is a part o f the job requirement. So, I would probably be still
doing those things if I had not attended the program but attending the
program did provide networking opportunities that resulted in coauthoring publications.

93

Another participant described the change that took place after participating in the
program this way:
I started attending the bi-annual conferences...so it was the beginning of
our inclusion, because before, like I said, they just paid their dues and that
was it. It just goes back to reiterate the point o f we needed to see how
other people were running.
Education was another proxy for exploring the development of leadership skills
within this sample. Sixty-seven percent of the interviewees reported either the pursuit or
receipt o f advanced degrees since participating in the leadership program and several
credited their relationships with mentors, both formal and informal, for encouraging to
them engage in those pursuits. One participant who obtained a PhD in Educational
Leadership since participating in the leadership program stated:
Some of those side conversations and inspired our conversations and gave
me some suggestions for continuing that pursuit (career planning). One of
which also included the pursuit of a terminal degree - o f course, knowing
that the MLS is a terminal degree in librarianship, but also looking at a
doctorate as a way to support my ambition but then also give me a wellrounded understanding o f one, what researchers would actually have to go
through - and these would be part o f the people that I'm serving - but, two,
also being able to compete, if you will, with my peers.
Another participant who is currently pursuing a doctoral degree gave direct credit to her
mentor for her pursuit o f a PhD when she stated: “If it wasn't fo r.. .my mentor, she
actually is the reason why I pursued a PhD and she wrote my recommendation letter. I
had her undying support.” As mentioned previously, these qualitative findings further
validated and expanded upon the previously presenting quantitative findings that
participants perceived the mentoring program to be valuable.
Empowerment. In addition to crediting the program with creating a community of
support and informing career planning decisions, participants explained the program’s
role in providing them with tools and resources which served as sources of

94

empowerment. While the mentoring program was perceived to be of particular value to
those who were interested in promotions and in influencing career planning decisions, the
workshops and webinars were also regarded as valuable (91.67% agreed that they
received benefits and learnings from the workshops and webinars to some extent or a
great extent). One participant, who launched several programs based on examples
encountered during the program, stated: “I felt empowered after having attended
those.. .workshops.” Analysis o f the data for this theme indicated that the workshops and
webinars provided an opportunity for the participants to learn about their own leadership
styles, as well as those o f others, as illustrated in the following quote:
I learned.. .the type of personality that I have, and how I have to relate to
others, because I’m an analytical person. And the institute let me saw
[sic] the way other people are, some people are more sensitive and
creative. I’m a numbers person and I have to deal differently with a
creative-type personality. And it gave me some tools to be able to meet
those people where I find them, and not try to pull them over to my way of
doing things.
Additionally, the program provided participants with models of best practices and
examples o f programs and initiatives that had been successful in other HBCU libraries,
including management practices, examples projects, and programming ideas. One
participant stated: “I was able to learn best practices and emerging techniques; I also was
provided with a greater sense o f self-awareness and empowerment.” Another participant
who is now pursuing a doctorate in information science, revealed the value of the models
that she was exposed to through the program:
[Seeing how] the [a large consortia of HBCU libraries] is run and how
[private southern HBCU library] is run and so many other institutions.
There’s [large northern urban HBCU library] and how they have such
dynamic programs. They have excellent archives. They have such a
system and an expectation of excellence. I needed to see that from the
Alliance and also of our peer institutions... I think my attitude changed.

95
She also reflected that she “needed to see a model of highly effective leadership.”
Another participant highlighted the value of the program in this area:
One is adding to a knowledge base that already existed, but then also
presenting creative ways that peers and other institutions within the
alliance, what they were doing, it certainly stretched my creativity in some
ways that I could impact librarianship in traditional ways, but also space
and leverage to do some more creative things, as well.
In the quantitative data analysis, the workshops and webinars, which focused on
building skills among participants, were perceived as being the most beneficial aspect of
the program (91.67% reported that they felt they received benefits and learning from this
component). Analysis o f the qualitative data supported those findings and revealed that
the program was influential in developing participants’ skills in areas such as strategic
planning, project management, and human resource management.
Research Question 2
RQ 2: How did the participants in the program use what they learned in the
leadership program within their immediate workplaces (libraries)? The purpose o f this
question was to explore how participants used what they learned in the leadership
program within their libraries. The data for this question came from the document review
o f the project presentations, the post-program reports, the interviews, and the open-ended
survey questions. Analysis o f the document data revealed that participants used what they
learned in the program to develop the required projects, as well as residual projects and
initiatives in their everyday work after the program ended. The AESRL/HBCU Library
Alliance Exchange Program, another facet of leadership program, provided a similar
experience. Similar to the main projects, the exchange program allowed participants to
collaborate with senior library staff from AESERL libraries to develop projects for
implementation at their home libraries.

96
Deductive coding based on the literature was used to categorize the participants’
projects into the following themes, which came from the literature: assessment,
collections, funding, information literacy, marketing and programming, services, space,
staffing and professional development, strategic planning, teaching and learning
technology. The literature confirmed that these areas were ripe for development within
HBCU libraries and the interviews supported these results through triangulation. The
number o f projects for each are presented in Table 8.

HBCU libraries have been evaluated against professional library standards and
have often come up insufficient (Josey, 1963; Totten, 1969). Specific attempts to
respond to assessment data, a hallmark of systems thinking, is missing from the literature.
According to Morgan (2006), in learning organizations, employees “scan and anticipate
change in the wider environment to detect significant variations” but also move beyond
collecting and processing information to the “creation o f insight and knowledge” (pp. 8788). Many o f the projects involved assessing the current state o f services and resources
and using that information to make necessary adjustments aimed at creating lasting
change. By acting on the results of these assessments, participants exhibited a key
characteristic of a learning organization, the practice of “examining the status quo and
considering alternative modes of operating” (Morgan, 2006, p. 90). Reflections for the
assessment theme included references to “continuous work,” “periodic evaluation,” “data
driven decisions” and assessment as a “continuous process” that involved “reflection”
and “revision.” These attributes suggested that these activities were not episodic, but
continuous events that have become a part o f the libraries’ operating norms.
The literature on HBCU libraries indicated the development and maintenance of
library collections has been a historical challenge for these libraries (Brown, Blauch,
Jenkins, Caliver & United States, 1942; Gravois, 1994, 1995a, 1995b; Jones, PhelpsStokes Fund & United States, 1917; McAllister, 1954; McGrath, 1965; United States
Bureau o f Education, 1928). Analysis of the projects for this theme indicated that the
libraries experienced a shift from the historical attempts to amass large physical
collections, as participants applied new solutions to the age-old challenge o f providing
information resources to the campus constituencies. These activities included conducting

98
collection analyses, developing an institutional repository, digitizing collections, and
engaging faculty in the collection development process. One participant credited the
exposure to digitization projects at other HBCUs that she received through the program
with providing examples of what was possible.
I had that prime knowledge because I had already networked and heard
and seen with the [important] collection, what they're doing with digitizing
the [historical figure] papers. So I had those things that were presented and
had that knowledge base, basically.. .we were able to go see what other
HBCUs were doing.
Funding has also consistently been identified as a weakness among HBCU
libraries (Council on Library Resources, National Association o f State Universities and
Land-Grant Colleges, National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant
Colleges, & American Association of State Colleges and Universities, 1979; Gravois,
1994. 1995a, 1995b; Jordan, 1970; McGrath & Columbia University, 1965; National
Association o f State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges, Hill, J.R., & American
Association of State Colleges and Universities, 1976; Smith, 1951). Across the projects,
participants exhibited behaviors that reflected shifting “mental models” or previously
held assumptions or beliefs about what is possible in this area. Examples included crosstraining employees, participating in webinars (reduced travel costs), collaborating with
other departments to maximize the impact of investments, and engaging in innovative
collection development projects.
More projects focused on information literacy, the ability to locate, evaluate, and
ethically use information, than any other area. The provision of services in this area is
important, because it is among the four SACS library standards (Southern Association,
2012). The need to better integrate the library into the teaching and learning activities
has been mentioned in the literature (Josey, 1963; Totten, 1969) and was also a primary

99
goal of the leadership program. The projects in this area demonstrated the application of
learning to this area. Example projects included the development of an information
literacy program to support distance education, several efforts to integrate information
literacy into the curriculum through collaborations with faculty and staff, and efforts to
provide information literacy instruction and information at the point of need.
Participants described working with the their staffs in new ways and overcoming
historical challenges, including small staff size, inexperienced staff, limited staff,
territorialism, staff stability, scheduling problems, locating inexpensive training, aging
staff, lack o f staff to cover need (IL sessions). One way that participants applied
learnings from the leadership program was through various staff development activities,
such as low and no-cost webinars and internal cross-training and mentoring programs.
After participating in the workshops and webinars, participants reported that they
returned to their home institutions with a desire to work differently with their library
staffs. One strategy that was employed by participants was moving decision making
down the organization by involving staff members in the decision making process. A
reflection by one participant summarized the sentiments of several:
... I came back to my library and did some cross-training. I allowed the
public service staff - whom I had immediate charge o f - to kind of serve in
a leadership role. And taking my role and helping me make decisions
about those day-to-day things that I had to make decisions about for public
services. I was responsible for their work schedules. ... making sure they
were aligned with the hours of coverage, when I just had them to be
responsible for the work schedule. That's just an example. As I moved up
into the director role, I did the same thing. I called it job shadowing. We
worked together and created an internal assessment committee for the
library where I have representatives from all departments in the library to
do assessment, as opposed to the standard way o f just the director being
responsible for it. That way, I've learned to empower staff by letting them
take on leadership roles and being the lead person for a project.

100
Another strategy that participants utilized was creating a teamwork environment by
improving communication and collaboration among individual library staff and among
library departments. One participant described how she used what she learned below:
From what I learned in that program - when I came back from the
program, I immediately tried to implement some of the strategies that we'd
learned there by creating a teamwork environment where we work on
projects in teams as opposed to one individual having to implement a
project by his or herself.
One participant stated that she learned to “use the voice o f all to develop a
plan...sometimes it’s the persons in the trenches that have great ideas.”
Research Question 3
RQ 3: How did participants in the program use what they learned in the leadership
program within their larger campuses and in professional organizations? The data for this
research question came primarily from the review of the projects and was enhanced by
reflections from the participants who participated in the one-on-one interviews. Two
themes were present for this question; the first, shared vision, was developed through a
deductive coding process and comes from the chosen theoretical framework. The second
theme, collaboration, reflected an inductive coding process
Shared vision. Senge (1990) defines shared vision as follows:
all [of the disciplines] are concerned with a shift of mind from seeing parts
to seeing wholes, from seeing people as helpless reactors to seeing them as
active participants in shaping their reality, from reacting to the present to
creating the future (p. 69).
This quote aptly described the behavior and habits of participants in this study and
how they used the learnings and experiences from the leadership program to develop
shared visions with other campus departments and their institutions as a whole. The
primary vehicle through which program participants used what they learned in the

101
leadership program and developed their leadership skills within their larger campuses
was through support for their parent institutions' strategic plans. The most significant
contribution reported by participants to system-level initiatives was through the creation
and/or alignment o f library strategic plans that were consistent with and supportive o f
university strategic plans.
Through the strategic planning process, participants led their libraries in the
identification and development of shared values and institutional commitments. The
various initiatives that were developed provided a forum for participants to guide their
libraries beyond traditional library roles to better support and align with institutional
priorities. The following description o f one library’s strategic planning process
effectively summarizes the collective approach: “It [the strategic plan] is a picture of its
[the library’s] future, organized by determined actions for achieving specific outcomes,
consistent with the mission o f X College.” Participants led and coordinated efforts to
refine and develop vision and mission statements, identified and engaged stakeholders,
conducted SWOT analyses, and conducted environmental scans. Although participants
were guided by and received support from mentors in the development and
implementation o f their projects, their reflections revealed that they were also able to
independently apply what they learned after the program. All o f the interview
participants reported using some aspect of the learnings and experiences from the
program in additional projects or in their everyday work. The strategic planning
learnings were mentioned by several. In reflecting on how she had used these learnings in
her everyday work, one participant stated: “ . ..I used the SWOT analysis quite often in
terms o f how we mostly we're looking at our strategic plan, when we are looking at

102
different staff development experiences. I use SWOT analysis for that, as well.” Several
participants credited the skills that they learned through the leadership program’s
workshops and webinars as being critical to the development of these plans. One
participant offered the following testimony:
So I knew what a strategic plan was, but it was very foggy and when we
had to pay proper attention to that I was able to— I'm telling you, people
always did that stuff for us at [private southern HBCU]. We were forced to
sit down and really sit with it and marinate on governance, so just those
HR terms, those managerial terms entered my vocabulary.
An early participant, who was a part of the first cohort and now serves as a
department head for bibliographic, metadata and discovery services, confirmed the above
sentiments, reflecting as follows: “I just remember some of the skills and tools they had
given us on developing strategic plans and coming up with sustainable ideas. Those are
things that are really stuck to me.”
Collectively, the projects illustrated a shift o f mind from library-specific priorities
to institutional priorities. For example, several libraries worked to better integrate
information literacy into the curriculum. Another example of this new kind of thinking
was the experience o f one participant who used what she learned at a leadership program
workshop on effectively using data for advocacy to conduct a peer analysis using a
national library data set from the United States Department of Education. Not only was
she able to use the comparison within the library to argue for an increase in the library’s
budget, she was also able to illustrate how a more robust budget could assist the
university in meeting its accreditation requirements.
Collaboration. Armed with shared vision, participants engaged in system-level
collaborations with campus stakeholders, examples o f which appeared throughout the
participants’ projects. The projects were not created in isolation; stakeholders were

103
intentionally and consistently identified and engaged in the development and
implementation processes. Libraries worked strategically to target their efforts to
students, faculty, and administrators. These stakeholders’ perspectives were included
throughout the project and their participation in the projects was actively sought.
Consistent with Senge’s description of shared vision, partnerships were developed around
mutual areas o f concern.
For example, one participant described her collaborative efforts this way: “I
reached across campus more.” She added, “I was probably just a little too enthusiastic but
it was to my benefit, because I made partners across campus.” This same participant
spoke o f the admiration she had for her mentor, who insisted on meeting with the
university’s provost to discuss the value of the library to the institution during her site
visit. Following that observation and after attending a program webinar on succession
planning, the participant exhibited a greater sense o f confidence, as illustrated in the
following quote:
I went to the Provost [who does that!], ‘We need to think about succession
planning for the library. It can’t be a culture of grandfathering.’ He says
‘Who are you?’., .not enough attention was given to what’s going to
happen with the library...It [the succession planning webinar] articulated
what I was thinking. 1just didn’t know it was called succession planning.
This participant also credited her experience in the program with providing her
the confidence to collaborate with humanities professors at her institution on several
grants, which was consistent with her university administration's emphasis on obtaining
sponsorships and outside funding. These activities, particularly the grant-funded
digitization o f a noteworthy archival collection, brought positive attention to the
participant’s university. In addition to this report, several other participants recalled
projects that helped to expand access to archival collections at their universities, activities

104

that not only preserved these collections for future use, but also cataloged institutional
memory and brought prestige and recognition to their campuses. Through these
experiences, the value o f the library and interconnectedness with its parent institutions
was also highlighted, an example of which follows:
So after the digitization project, we got a lot o f press. Myself and a lot of
the humanities professors started just massively grant writing, which was
one o f the goals o f the previous administration.. .so everybody was under
pressure. People needed the library. They needed the skills o f the
librarian and the resource skills...
Summary
This study provided insight into the role of the HBCU Library Alliance’s
Leadership Program in developing future library leaders. A sequential, mixed-methods
design was used to explore participants’ individual growth as leaders and the
contributions that they were able to make within their libraries and on their campuses as a
result o f their experiences in the program. The quantitative data for this study revealed
that a larger percentage (42.9%) o f participants reported being promoted within the same
institution, when compared to those who remained in the same position in the same
institution (14.3%) or some other career change status (35.7%). The rate o f increase in
the library dean/director position was 400%; there was a 60% decrease in the number of
participants who reported being associate dean/directors, so it is likely that the many who
were already in the pipeline progressed into the director’s position. The mentoring
relationships and the workshops/webinars provided by the program were rated as
particularly beneficial, from the perspective o f the participants.
The qualitative data for this study helped to explain, refine, and expand upon the
quantitative findings. Participants shared how the one-on-one relationships established
through the program helped them to plan their career paths and served as both personal

105
and institutional models o f excellence. The program helped to create a network of
support that was able to transcend the confines o f the cohort experience, as participants
reported still calling on their mentors and peers for feedback, examples, and advice.
While it is difficult to imply that the program alone can be credited with participants’
leadership growth, it is clear that participants felt empowered by the experience and used
program learnings in their workplaces and on their campuses to address many of the
historical challenges faced by HBCU libraries and their parent institutions.

The

leadership program experience appeared to have caused what Senge (1990) refers to as a
“shift o f mind,” as participants were able to see the larger picture of the institution as a
whole, its needs, and the myriad ways that the library could support those needs (Senge,
1990, p. 68). The proceeding chapter will summarize the study in its entirety and provide
a discussion o f the findings including relevant connections to the literature. Conclusions
and an exploration o f possible implications for further study and consideration will also
be presented.

CHAPTER 5
SUMMARY, DISCUSSION, CONCLUSIONS, AND IMPLICATIONS
The purpose o f this study was to explore the role o f the HBCU Library Alliance
Leadership Program in creating future library leaders within historically black colleges
and universities (HBCUs). According to the Higher Education Act (2013), HBCUs are
institutions founded prior to 1964 with the expressed intent o f educating African
Americans. As the United States aspires to have 60 percent o f its citizens ages 25-64
possess a bachelor’s degree by 2025, HBCUs are poised to play a significant role in this
achievement (Lee & Keys, 2013c); although they no longer educate the majority of
African Americans who earn college degrees, HBCUs continue to contribute
disproportionately in this area, particularly in the STEM fields and in education (Lee &
Keys, 2013c). In addition to declining market share, HBCUs as a body face significant
challenges, particularly in the areas of accreditation and funding. The libraries of these
institutions play a major role in the accreditation process, as the accreditor of most
HBCUs, the Southern Association o f Colleges and Schools (SACS), includes four library
standards among the requirements institutions must meet to maintain accreditation.
Several HBCUs have been sanctioned for failing to meet these standards and lack of
compliance has also played a role in the loss o f accreditation at several HBCUs (Mercer,
1998; Yates, 2002; “SACS continues probation”, 2006; June, 2002; Blake, 2003; Quinn,
2008; Basken, 2008; SACS, 2013).

106

Not unlike other academic libraries, libraries within HBCUs are expected to
experience an increase in retirements in coming years; previous research has indicated
that few o f these libraries have succession plans in place (Youmans, 2009). Youmans
(2009) suggests that a better understanding o f the role o f programs such as the HBCU
Library Alliance Leadership Program is needed to mitigate the effects of this crisis. The
purpose o f this study was to explore the role of the HBCU Library Alliance Leadership
Program in creating future library leaders. Founded in 2002, the purpose of this
organization to promote library resources and services designed to enhance libraries at
HBCUs. Between 2005 and 2014, the HBCU Library Alliance ran a leadership
development program to foster leadership development within member-institution
libraries. Several anecdotal references to the program’s existence appear in the literature
(Allen & Brooks-Tatum, 2014; Hart et al., 2007; McCullough & Sims, 2009; Parham,
Franklin & Nevins, 2006; Sims & Sutton, 2008), but no formal exploration of the
program’s role in developing future library leaders exists.
The present study explored the role o f the program in developing leadership skills
among those who participated in it and how these individuals applied what they learned
within their libraries and on the campuses where they were employed.
This study was guided by three research questions:
RQ1: What was the role of the leadership program in developing leadership
abilities among participants?
RQ2: How did the participants in the program use what they learned in the
leadership program within their immediate workplaces (libraries)?

108
RQ3: How did participants in the program use what they learned in the
leadership program within their larger campuses and in professional
organizations?
Senge’s (1990) systems thinking was used as a theoretical framework for the
study. Chapter 2 reviewed the literature on HBCUs and their libraries and illustrated the
interconnectivity between the parent institution and the library. The literature review also
described in detail some o f the previous attempts to address the problems faced by HBCU
libraries and highlighted similar studies on library leadership development programs.
The literature review revealed the dearth of studies on library leadership programs for
librarians o f color or those working within minority serving institutions (MS Is), such as
HBCUs. Using a sequential explanatory mixed-method design, data for this study was
collected using a survey, one-on-one interviews, and document review, the combination
o f which aided in triangulation. The quantitative data were de-identified, cleaned and
analyzed using SPSS, where descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were
conducted. The qualitative data were de-identified and analyzed using NVivo, a
qualitative data management software, where they were categorized to identify themes
and patterns. The preceding chapter presented the findings of the study, beginning with
the demographic and institutional characteristics of the participants, followed by the
presentation o f the quantitative and qualitative findings presented in the order o f the
research questions.
Major Findings
This study provided insight into the role of the HBCU Library Alliance’s
Leadership Program in developing future library leaders. A sequential, mixed-methods

109
design was used to explore participants’ individual growth as leaders and the
contributions that they were able to make within their libraries and on their campuses as a
result o f their experiences in the program. The quantitative data for this study revealed
that a larger percentage (42.9%) of participants reported being promoted within the same
institution, when compared to those who remained in the same position in the same
institution (14.3%) or some other career change status (35.7%). The rate o f increase in
the library dean/director position was 400%; there was a 60% decrease in the number of
participants who reported being associate dean/directors, so it is likely that many who
were already in the leadership pipeline progressed into the director’s position. The
mentoring relationships and the workshops/webinars provided by the program were rated
as particularly beneficial, from the perspective o f the participants. Statistically significant
increase in presentations and professional association activities were also observed.
The qualitative data for this study helped to explain, refine, and expand upon the
quantitative findings. Participants shared how the one-on-one relationships established
through the program helped them to plan their career paths and served as both personal
and institutional models o f excellence. The program helped to create a network of
support that was able to transcend the confines o f the cohort experience, as participants
reported still calling on their mentors and peers for feedback, examples, and advice.
While it is difficult to imply that the program alone can be credited with participants’
leadership growth, it is clear that participants felt empowered by the experience and used
program learnings in their workplaces and on their campuses to address many of the
historical challenges faced by HBCU libraries and their parent institutions.

The

leadership program experience appeared to have caused what Senge (1990) refers to as a

110
“shift o f mind,” as participants were able to see the larger picture that of the institution,
its needs, and the myriad ways that the library could support those needs (Senge, 1990, p.
68 ).

Discussion of Major Findings
The major findings of the study are presented below. The quantitative findings,
which focused on promotions and professional and campus activities will be presented
first. The qualitative findings will follow the quantitative findings. The discussion o f the
findings will be follow the order o f the research questions.
Job Promotions
More participants reported being promoted within the same institution in the
current study (42.9%) than in Neely and Winston’s study (1999a) (25.33%), and fewer
also reported remaining with the same institution in the same position (14.3% compared
to 38.66%). Phelan (2005) grouped participants who had changed jobs into a single
category, making comparison to the present study difficult, however, it is noteworthy that
fewer participants (14.3%) in the current study reported remaining in the same job than in
the Phelan (2005) study (47%).
The findings on the internal promotions among participants in the current study
were very consistent with those of Neal (2005), who discovered that HBCU libraries
serve as incubators for future HBCU library dean/director positions. The current findings
as they relate to promotions refine previous findings by Youmans (2009) who reported
that HBCU library deans reported having difficulty finding applicants for positions. The
results imply that internal development of talent might be a solution to this impending
crisis of succession planning (Youmans, 2009). These findings also update research by

Ill

Neal (2005) and affirmatively answer the question posed in that study as to whether
HBCU librarians will continue to be a source of HBCU directors.
Professional and campus activities
The results o f the current study indicate that while most of the participants were
not required to participate and scholarly activities to obtain promotion and tenure,
statistically significant increases in presentations and professional activity were still
observed after the program. This finding was similar to Barney (2004) and Neely and
Winston (1999), both o f whom reported increases in professional activities following
participation in the program. Although the requirement to participate in such activities
was similarly low in other studies that used the same instrument (Neely, 2009; Neely &
Winston, 1999a), the findings in the current study suggest that HBCU librarians may lack
tenure and promotion and the many benefits associated with both. To further support this
speculation, a statistically significant increase in participation in campus leadership
activities was not observed (p=.257). Collectively these findings raise important
questions about the participation of HBCU librarians in the governance practices on their
campuses. Two o f the three previous studies containing data on the academic status of
librarians on HBCU campuses suggested that many held faculty status or academic
appointments (Cannon, 1969, Josey 1963, Totten, 1971). It may be that the status of
HBCU librarians has changed over the past forty years and that opportunities to
participate in the governance structure on HBCU campuses have declined. Certainly this
would limit the influence o f HBCU librarians at the campus level.
Networking and Community
Across the studies o f library leadership programs, networking opportunities were
highly regarded by participants (Neely, 2009; Neely & Winston, 1999a; German, Owen,

112
Parchuck & Sandore, 2009; Phelan, 2005; Thull, 2006). Although other studies of
programs that focused on developing leadership capacity o f librarians o f color (Neely,
2009; Roy, Johnson-Cooper, Tysick & Waters, 2006) found that participants reported
benefits from participating in a community with other peers of color, the current study
was distinct in that participants appear to have valued the benefits o f networking with
others serving the same type of institution. In the data analyses, references to this
phenomena were coded “HBCU Context.” Considering the historical challenges and
stigma associated with HBCUs, participants seemed to find value in networking in an
environment that was free from judgment and that also provided accessible service and
program models that could be replicated on other HBCU campuses. Similarly and
relatedly, the findings on the value o f mentoring from the present study were distinct
when compared to several other programs for librarians o f color (Neely, 2009; Roy,
Johnson-Cooper, Tysick & Waters, 2006). While participants in the studies of the
Spectrum and ARL Leadership and Career Development Programs expressed some level
o f frustration and disappointment with the mentoring aspect of those programs, the
mentoring program that was a part of HBCU Library Alliance Leadership Program was
rated second only to the workshops and webinars in terms of the degree of benefits that
participants felt they received after the program.
Empowerment, Shared Vision and Collaboration
Across many o f the leadership programs identified in the literature, developing
confidence among participants was a common theme. The findings of the current study
were comparable in this area. Additionally, much like the findings of Weiner, Breivik,
Clark, and Caboni (2009), the present study suggests that the leadership program created
a forum where participants had an opportunity to apply their knowledge to a specific

113
plan. Both the HBCU Library Leadership Program and the Peabody Program stand out
in the literature due to their focus on the higher education context and emphasis on
creating new roles and partnerships for librarians on campus. The present study is unique
in that it is the only such study to consider such factors within an MSI environment.
Conclusions
It can be concluded from this study that participants exhibited disciplines of
systems thinking as defined by Senge (1990):
Systems thinking is a conceptual framework, a body of knowledge and
tools that has been developed over the past fifty years, to make full the
patterns clearer and to help us to see how to change them effectively (p.
7).
The following section will describe in detail how the results of the study can be viewed
through a systems thinking framework. The disciplines of personal mastery, team
learning, shared vision, and mental models will be used to show how the leadership
program contributed to the development of this way o f thinking and behaving.
Personal Mastery
The leadership program provided an opportunity for participants to leam about
themselves, which in turn prompted many to consider or reconsider their career paths,
including aspiring to leadership positions and gaining additional education. These
behaviors are consistent with the discipline o f person mastery or “continually clarifying
what is important to us” and “continually learning how to see current reality more
clearly” (Senge, 1990, p. 141). The workshops and webinars, in addition to arming
participants with knowledge and skills that could be applied in the workplace/campus,
also allowed participants to leam about themselves. These learnings were complimented
by the mentoring program, which fostered the development of one-on-one relationships

114
between participants and seasoned HBCU library deans/directors and provided examples
o f leadership that could be emulated at participants’ home institutions.
The activities that some of the participants engaged in following the program,
such as the pursuit o f advanced degrees and leadership positions within libraries reflect
the characteristics o f personal mastery. They experienced what Senge refers to as
“creative tension,” the “gap” that exists “when we hold a vision that differs from the
current reality” (p. 152). According to Senge, “truly creative people use the gap between
vision and current reality to generate energy for change” (p. 153). Within this
framework, the pursuit o f advanced degrees and aspirations to leadership positions
outside o f one’s comfort zone reflect attempts to resolve that tension.
Team Learning
One of the primary ways that the participants in the current study were able to
develop and implement the required and residual projects was through redefining
relationships with peers within their libraries. The program learnings provided
participants with the knowledge and skill necessary to return to their campuses and to
work with and lead their teams differently. Inherent in this change was a shift from
individual learning/focus to what Senge refers to as “team learning” or “the process of
aligning and developing the capacity of a team to create the results is members truly
desire” (p. 236.) Central to this work were emphases on professional development, crosstraining, communication, and collaboration. Through the projects, the libraries “built the
future that no one individual can [could] envision” (Phipps, 1993, p. 24).
Shared Vision
Research question two indicated that many of the projects that came out o f the
leadership program focused on strategic planning. Collectively, attempts to engage in

115
strategic planning suggested that both internally and externally, the libraries made
intentional attempts to develop what Senge refers to as “shared vision,” or “the process of
unearthing shared ‘pictures o f the future’ that foster genuine commitment and enrollment
rather than compliance” (Senge, 1990, p. 9). One participant described the strategic
planning process this way: “ It [the strategic plan] is a picture of its [the library’s] future,
organized by determined actions for achieving specific outcomes, consistent with the
mission of X College.”
Mental Models
Senge (1990) defines mental models as beliefs that shape how one acts. They are
“deeply ingrained assumptions, generalizations, or even pictures or images that influence
how we understand the world and how we take action” (Senge, p. 8-9). Senge (1990)
posits that many opportunities to improve organizations are never implemented because
they conflict with prevailing mental models. The final report for the planning grant that
drove the implementation of the leadership program is replete with information on the
historical mental models within HBCU libraries. According to the report’s author,
“whether mirroring the culture of the overall institution or not, this stagnation [within
HBCU libraries] results in the perception that HBCU library operations remain the same
no matter what” (HBCU Library Alliance, 2004, p. ii). The following quote from a focus
group from the report participant provided an example of this kind of thinking:
This is my third job at an HBCU ... close to three years from now it will be
thirty years later. It's still the same, it seems like nothing has changed in
the new millennium ... it's still like 1974. You know that it is always the
same thing at the HBCUs that I've been associated with; it's always the
same thing. (HBCU Library Alliance, 2004, p. 16)
It is evident that to some degree, a shift of mind took place as a result of the
program. If the projects are compared to the assumptions and beliefs expressed within

116
the planning report, it becomes evident that through the program, participants
reconsidered their roles both within the library and within the institution. For example,
the literature review indicated that in response to minimum volume requirements from
accreditors, many FIBCU libraries have focused on amassing large book collections, with
perhaps more focus on quantity than quality. It is interesting to note that not one of the
projects that resulted from the leadership program focused on print collection building.
Instead, a great number o f them involved digitizing unique collections and making
information more accessible for use. Another example is the shift in focus from
traditional library instruction to course integrated information literacy instruction.
In describing how mental models have impacted academic libraries, Shipp (1993)
presented the following reflection:
Librarians continue to see themselves as subservient to others, secondary
players in the educational process, unable to assert their view of the
importance o f empowering students to connect to sources of knowledge
outside the classroom. They do not see themselves as necessary
collaborators having something to contribute that they alone can
contribute, (p. 24)
In comparison, the following post-program quote from one of the participants suggests
the kind o f change in thinking that took place as a result of the program:
So after the digitization project, we got a lot o f press. M yself and a lot of
the humanities professors started just massively grant writing, which was
one of the goals o f the previous administration.. .so everybody was under
pressure. People needed the library. They needed the skills o f the
librarian and the resource skills...
Implications
For the HBCU Library Alliance, this study provides insight into the value of the
different program components as perceived by the participants. The results of the study
could be used to approach a new funder in order to revive the leadership program and to

117
strategically direct resources to those aspects of the program that have been shown to be
particularly beneficial. The study revealed that the mentoring and networking aspects of
the leadership program have continued, however informally, well past the life of the
cohorts. With technological advances such as social media, it may be possible to build
upon the community foundation that was established by the program in a low-cost way.
Neely (2009) indicates that many of the library leadership programs have active
networks, listservs, and other online communities that continue to serve as a resource for
program participants; outside of its main listserv, no such network appears to be in
operation on behalf o f the HBCU Library Alliance. Additionally, although the number of
participants in the current study was small, it could easily be replicated, perhaps
including the fourth and final cohort. A larger sample size might allow for additional
statistical analyses that might help to further clarify valuable aspects o f the program that
are worthy o f replication.
Additionally, other library organizations that are concerned about developing
future library leaders and particularly library leaders of color may find the results of this
study to be helpful. The findings as they relate to mentoring were unique when compared
to some o f the other studies of library leadership programs for librarians o f color (Neely,
2009; Roy, Johnson-Cooper, Tysick & Waters, 2006). It is interesting to note that the
participants in the current study placed a high level of value on networking and
mentoring with librarians not necessarily o f the same race, but with those serving the
same type of institution (HBCU). The HBCU Library Leadership Program and the Tribal
College Librarians Institute are the only two programs focused on leadership
development within the MSI context. While previous research (Neal, 2004) indicates that

118

HBCU libraries serve as incubators for future HBCU library deans/directors, it is
unknown if such is the case in other minority serving institution types. At a time when
the profession o f librarianship still struggles with achieving diversity, particularly within
its leadership ranks, it may be worthwhile to consider an assessment o f leadership
dynamics within the MSI library leadership dynamic.
Leadership on HBCU campuses, including presidents, vice-presidents for
academic affairs and other administrators may find value in the current study. The results
imply that within the HBCU environment, the library represents a unit where “leverage,”
or “seeing where actions and changes in structures can lead to significant, enduring
improvements” exists (Senge, 1990, p. 114.) It is worthwhile to note that although the
formal leadership program has ended, the HBCU Library Alliance continues to provide
professional development opportunities and other programs designed to strengthen
HBCUs by developing their libraries. The results o f this study highlight the potential
value of organization’s offerings; as leadership on HBCU campuses wrestle with
allocating finite resources, investments in the activities of the Alliance may be
worthwhile and deserving o f the allocation of both human and capital resources. Phipps
(1993) supports this recommendation:
In times o f funding shortages, investing in staff learning and training may
not be seen as the most obvious way to get more done for less. Limiting
opportunities for travel seen by our funders, the taxpayers, as
entertainment and perquisites, is not really a savings. Supporting such
opportunities for learning, rather inexpensive investments, may have the
biggest long-term payoff for helping our libraries to become ultimately
successful. Building collaborations with professionals outside libraries and
with our faculty are other not so obvious areas where high gains may be
had. (p. 28)
Lastly, advocacy groups, such as the United Negro College Fund, the National
Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher Education, the Southern Education

119

Foundation and other organizations, such as funders, who are concerned with the
longevity and vitality o f HBCUs may also find the value in the results o f this study. The
findings suggest that collaborations between units on HBCU have the potential to
contribute to institutional outcomes and priorities in unique ways. The literature review
for this study recognized the historical role o f external organizations in using HBCU
libraries as catalysts to support HBCUs. The projects that resulted from the leadership
program certainly provide examples that could be replicated on a larger scale on HBCU
campuses. This study suggests that the atmosphere is ripe for the development o f new
and innovative collaborations with advocacy groups and funders.
Suggestions for Future Research
A future study might (a) have a larger sample (b) consider the role o f institutional
demographics and (c) consider the use of a control/treatment groups. The demographics
provided by the project planning grant for this leadership program should be updated and
should include information not only on HBCU deans/directors, but also non-supervisory
librarians and staff, as well. This information might help to better assess the
organizational health o f HBCU libraries. A study of the faculty status of HBCU
librarians and their participation in shared governance on their campuses would also be
helpful in strategizing ways that they can effectively contribute to issues o f institutional
interest and significance. Future programs might consider the use of control and
treatment groups, as recommended by Romaniuk and Haycock (2011). Such a design
might allow for more robust future studies with better potential to correlate library
leadership program participation and career advancement.

120
Summary
The purpose o f this study was to explore the role of the HBCU Library Alliance
Leadership Program in developing future library leaders. The study employed a
sequential mixed-method design to gain a better understanding into how the program
developed leadership skills among participants and how participants applied what they
learned within their libraries and on their campuses. Senge’s (1990) systems thinking
was used as a theoretical framework for the study. An online survey, one-on-one
interviews, and document review were utilized in a triangular fashion to collect the data.
Participants were queried on their demographic backgrounds, career progression, and the
ways in which they used the benefits and learnings provided by the program.
The findings from the study revealed that more participants were promoted
internally than any o f the other career change category. The number o f participants who
reported attaining library dean or director positions increased by 400%. Participants
reported that they received the most benefits and learnings from the workshops and
webinars provided by the program, followed by the mentoring program. The qualitative
data helped to further refine the quantitative findings, revealing how the program assisted
participants in developing career plans and facilitated the creation of a network of
mentors and peers from the same type o f institution. Additionally, the qualitative data
revealed the ways in which the program empowered participants and how they applied
the learnings they received within their libraries and on their campuses. The projects that
the participants developed were closely aligned with the historical challenges faced by
HBCU libraries, as identified in the literature review in Chapter 2. Qualitative analyses

121
of the data also revealed the ways that participants collaborated with other campus units
and developed shared vision through the identification of mutual interests.
The findings, particularly as they related to mentoring and networking, were
similar to other studies o f library leadership programs. A unique finding o f this study,
which included participants who were 97% African American, was that participants
believed that they received benefits from networking with other librarians serving the
same type o f institution (HBCU). Previous studies of library leadership programs for
librarians o f color found that librarians expressed strong sentiments regarding networking
with other librarians o f color, a finding which as not discovered in the present study.
Statistically significant increases in presentations and professional activities were also
observed, findings that were similar to those in other leadership program studies. The
findings from the study suggest that the HBCU library has the potential to be a source of
“leverage” or a place where small changes may provide lasting benefit for the parent
organization. It is recommended that future studies investigate the demographics of the
HBCU library workforce, as well as HBCU librarians’ participation in campus
governance.

focus is primarily on a ca d e m ic librarianship, an d it is difficult t o tie re s p o n s e s of any of t h e qu eries directly to

Good luck in y o u r re s e a rc h an d I'm h ap p y to talk with you any tim e a b o u t this if you wish,
