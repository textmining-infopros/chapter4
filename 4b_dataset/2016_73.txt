ABSTRACT
A PARALLEL STUDY OF ACADEMIC LIBRARY ADMINISTRATORS
LEADERSHIP BEHAVIORS
by
Theresa Storey Hefner-Babb

The purpose of this mixed method study was to examine the relationship between
leadership behaviors of library administrators and the expectations of the librarians they
supervise framed within the Ohio State Two Factor Theory and the Theory of Role
Differentiation and Group Achievement. A combination of survey and interviews
provided information about leadership behaviors desired by librarians and currently in
practice by administrators. The results of Spearman correlations on the subscales of
Consideration and Initiation of Structure found weak correlations between the ideal
behaviors desired by librarians and the real behaviors indicated by administrators.
Findings of the qualitative interviews confirmed leadership behaviors mentioned in prior
library studies that could be considered for leadership competencies in the library
profession. Recommended actions include revising library school curriculums to include
leadership courses, professional development for future library leaders via professional
organizations and the development of leadership competencies for the profession.
Keywords: leadership, academic libraries, competencies

Chapter I
Introduction to the Study
Academic libraries are on the verge of losing their experienced leaders to the
graying of the profession with prospects of replacements from a generation of librarians
with no leadership background (Edge & Green, 2011; Rooney, 2010). Jordan (2012)
demonstrated the need for leadership preparation for any librarian who assumes an
administrative role in an academic library so it is important to examine leadership
behaviors of academic library leaders. According to Hicks and Given (2013), the library
profession does not have a designated set of desired leadership competencies for
professional librarians that can help organizations identify the best candidate for the
position. National organizations, such as the American Library Association (ALA),
examined their professional codes to make sure that leadership was addressed.
Consequently, the leadership problem prompted then American Library Association
President Leslie Burger to convene a task force in 2006 to create a set of core
competencies related to librarianship.
The ALA Presidential Task Force on Library Education compiled a list of core
competences based upon input from various constituencies within ALA and received
approval for the proposal from the ALA Executive Board in 2008 and the ALA Council
in 2009 (Hicks & Given, 2013). The final statement entitled,

Library Association, 2009, p. 5). Despite the selection of transformational leadership and
the establishment of the core competences, the profession still lacks a set of leadership

Hefner-Babb 2
competences (al Ansari & al Khadher, 2011; Ammons-Stevens, Cole, Jenkins-Gibbs,
Riehle, & Weare, 2009; Jantii & Greenhalgh, 2012). Jordan (2012) emphasized the need
for leadership preparation for any librarian who assumes an administrative role in an
academic library.
The purpose of this mixed method study was to examine the relationship between
leadership behaviors of library administrators and the expectations of the librarians they
supervise framed within the Ohio State Two Factor Theory and the Theory of Role
Differentiation and Group Achievement. This chapter includes the following sections:
background of the problem, problem statement, the theoretical framework used for this
study, purpose for the study with research questions and significance and rationale of the
study. Included in this chapter are the assumptions, limitations, and delimitations of the
study. The chapter concludes with a definition of terms and a summary of the
organization of the study.
Background of the Problem
The library profession is experiencing a transition in library leadership due to
retirements and the decline in professional librarians qualified or willing to undertake
administrative positions (Brundy, 2014; Edge & Green, 2011; Rooney, 2010). Data from
the Occupational Outlook Handbook 2014-2015 indicates a 7% change in the number of
librarians between 2012 (148,400) and 2022 (159,400) in the United States; projected
annual job openings due to growth and net replacement is estimated at 4,440 (United
States Department of Labor, 2012). A more recent study by the AFL-CIO (2015) in 2013
indicated that 42% of librarians were over age 55. Hernon, Powell, and Young (2001)

Hefner-Babb 3
anticipated that the turnover in Association of Research Libraries directorships would
continue given that many directors are in their late 50s.
The subject of leadership as it relates to librarianship is difficult to define (Herold,
2014). Upon concluding their study, Hicks and Given (2013) determined that leadership
meant a call for librarians who could motivate people and guide the profession forward
into an uncertain future. Gilstrap (2009) defined leadership as it relates to organizational
development in the academic library setting by providing a summary of the leadership
theories used in librarianship. According to Mackenzie and Smith (2009), librarians in the
profession have yet to agree on a definition and type of leadership system that works
within the organizational structure.
Statement of the Problem
The specific problem is that some academic library leaders are career librarians
either hired or promoted into administrative level positions and they are not meeting the
expectations of the librarians who work with them (Cawthorne, 2010; Dewey, 2012).
There are numerous studies on the need for leadership competencies for librarians
however the profession has not determined specific competencies (al Ansari & al
Khadher, 2011; Ammons-Stevens, et al., 2009; Jantii & Greenhalgh, 2012). Librarians
transitioning into leadership roles in academic libraries such as assistant directors,
associate directors, or library directors need a specific set of leadership skills (Ameen,
2006; Dewey, 2014; Rooney, 2010).
Theoretical Framework
This study used two related leadership behavior theories rooted in research
conducted at Ohio State University under the Ohio State Leadership Studies program.

Hefner-Babb 4
The first is the Ohio State Two Factor Theory which evolved from research by Halpin,
Coons, and Stogdill during the late 1950s. The framing questions for this research
included 1) What does an individual do while he operates as a leader? 2) How does he go
about what he does? (Hemphill & Coons, 1957, p. 6). Research conducted at Ohio State
sought to define leadership as behaviors versus traits. A series of studies determined the
original nine dimensions that formed the basis of the Leadership Behavior Descriptions
Questionnaire (LBDQ). Succeeding studies of military commanders and educational
administrators by Halpin (1957a) indicated that the two most important dimensions were
Consideration and Initiating Structure, and the theory became known as the Ohio State
Two Factor Theory.
Stogdill proposed the Theory of Role Differentiation and Group Achievement in
1962 based upon the foundation of Consideration and Initiating Structure found in the
Ohio State Two Factor Theory. Stogdill reasoned that the two dimensions indicated that

The Purpose of the Study and Research Questions
The purpose of this mixed method study was to examine the relationship between
leadership behaviors of library administrators and the expectations of the librarians they
supervise framed within the Ohio State Two Factor Theory and the Theory of Role
Differentiation and Group Achievement. The overarching question of the study was:
What is the relationship between the real leadership behaviors of Texas academic library
administrators and the ideal leadership expectations of the librarians they supervise? The
following quantitative questions guided the study:
1. What is the relationship between library administrators actual consideration
leadership behaviors and ideal consideration leadership behaviors preferred by
academic librarians in Texas?
2. What is the relationship between library administrators actual initiating
structure leadership behaviors and real initiating structure leadership
behaviors preferred by academic librarians in Texas?
The following qualitative questions guided the study:
3. Describe what and how input behaviors are practiced by the library
administrator in their current position.
4. What group structure and operations control are practiced by the library
administrator?
5. How does the library administrator influence group achievement?
Rationale and Significance of the Research
Librarians transitioning into leadership roles learn that they have gaps in their
professional education (Dewey, 2014; Hicks & Given, 2013; Arns & Price, 2007). Jantii

Hefner-Babb 6
and Greenhalgh (2012) found that the reason librarians did not seek upper leadership
positions was due to an inability to close the leadership knowledge gap. Jange (2012)
determined that internally promoted administrators may or may not have the skill set
required for the transition to leading an organization.
Librarians in the profession have yet to agree on a definition and type of
leadership system that works within the organizational structure of a library (Mackenzie
& Smith, 2009). Young, Hernon, and Powell (2006) reported on a generation gap
developing in the library profession between Baby Boomers, Generation X and the
Millennials that is accompanied by generational differences in leadership. Long and
Sheehan (2015) noted the increased number of older librarians and the challenge of
  

        

   Library

directors and administrators are retiring in greater numbers and it is difficult to find
leaders capable of leading the organizations into the 21st century (Mackenzie & Smith,
2009). The library profession is currently experiencing a transition among its leadership
with the retirements of the Baby Boomer generation and the migration of millennial
librarians into leadership roles (Murray, 2011). Thus, the impending shortage of library
leaders brings leadership programs to the attention of librarians seeking continuing
education on how to lead in a library setting (Romaniuk & Haycock, 2011).
The significance of this study was to determine a group of ideal leadership
behaviors required by academic library administrators thus creating a set of leadership
competencies that could become part of library education and professional development.
There is an international demand for leadership competences for the profession to aid
current and upcoming library leaders (Al Ansari & Al Khadher, 2011; DeBoer, Bothma

Hefner-Babb 7
& Olwagen, 2012; DÃ¼ren, 2012; Hicks & Given, 2013; Jordan, 2012). Research shows
that preparation programs for librarians do not teach leadership concepts and that it is not
always gained through work experience (Ameen, 2006; Edge & Green, 2011; HarrisKeith, 2015a; Harris-Keith, 2015b).
Assumptions
Creswell and Miller (2000) defined assumptions as views that shape a
 

   . This study was conducted based on the

following assumptions. The first assumption of this study was that the researcher was
able to locate and interview 10 librarians who matched the requirements of the study. The
second assumption was that the questions were answered truthfully by each of the
respondents. The third assumption was that the researcher did not allow bias to interfere
with the research. The use of open ended questions assumed that the questions being
asked were appropriate for the purpose of the study.

& Glatthorn, 2013, p. 209). The following limitations impacted the outcome of this study:
1. Due to low participation rates among administrators and librarians the findings for
this study could not be applied to the population.
2. The lack of available demographic data describing the academic librarian
population of Texas prevented comparison between the sample and the
population.
3. Self-reported data by the librarians and administrators in the surveys and the
interviews could not be verified as fact by the researcher.

study included:
1. Library administrators invited to participate had to hold MLS degrees or
equivalent and had to have at least one academic year of experience working in an
administrative role at their current library.
2. The librarian needed to be working in some administrative function that directly
supervises librarians, which traditionally means a head of public services or
technical services, an assistant or associate dean or director, and library dean or
director. In academic research libraries this would include coordinators who
oversee librarians and staff.
3. Additionally, the library administrator needed to be in a Texas academic library at
a four-year degree granting institution because the duties of an academic library
administrator differ from those of a public, school or special librarian. Four-year
degree granting institutions include universities that grant bachelors, masters, and
doctoral degrees.
4. Only Texas academic library administrators and librarians were included in the
study.
5. Only administrators and librarians at four-year degree granting institutions could
participate in the study.

Hefner-Babb 9
6. Only librarians who work for administrators could respond to the survey; nondegreed professional staff were not included.
7. Only administrators with five years of experience or more participated in the
interviews.
8. Library administrators whose tenure was less than one academic year were not
included because their inexperience could impact the evaluations of the librarians
who work for them.
9. Academic libraries at two-year degree granting institutions were not studied
because the number of degreed professional staff in the individual libraries is
smaller than in academic libraries at four-year degree granting institutions.
10. Non degreed professional staff were not included in the study because the focus
of the study was the relationship between the administrator and the degreed
librarians.
11. Library administrators without direct supervision of librarians were excluded
from the study because the study examined leadership behaviors and these
positions did not include leadership.

The purpose of this mixed method study was to examine the relationship between
leadership behaviors of library administrators and the expectations of the librarians they
supervise framed within the Ohio State Two Factor Theory and the Theory of Role
Differentiation and Group Achievement. This contains the following components:
foundations of leadership behavior theory, leadership in academic libraries, leadership
competences in librarianship and leadership development and mentoring in academic
libraries.
Foundations of Leadership Behavior Theory
Stogdill (1975) discussed two major predecessors to leadership behavior theory:
the situational school and the personalist school. The first school dates back to the turn of
the twentieth century and theories proposed by Cooley, Mumford, and Bogardus. Cooley
(1902) defined a leader as someone of substantial individualism and understanding.
Mumford (1906-07) (as cited by Bass, 1990), observed that leaders are those who rise
above the group in a situation and are able to take control. Bogardus (1920) discussed the
social psychology of leadership including the qualities of leadership and the types of

d traits, and experience all contribute to

leadership. Theorists in the 1920s founded the personalist school which focused on the
leader and the group who deferred to the leader in all respects. Munson (1921) defined a
leader as one who can glean cooperation from a group while remaining devoid of

Hefner-Babb 12
disagreements. Munson also believed the leader should be the creative and morale
building force for the group.
Leadership Theory
Bass (1990) defined leadership as members of a group who react to a situation
based upon the circumstances and their opinions. Shartle (1957) argued that a specific
leadership theory did not exist in 1945 and that was the impetus for the study of
leadership by a group of scholars at Ohio State University. Research on leadership
conducted prior to World War II focused on traits of leaders however researchers, such as
Charles Bird, William O. Jenkins, and Ralph Stogdill, determined that the trait approach
was ineffective when choosing leaders.
The topic of leader behavior is difficult to condense and categorize (Yukl, 2012).
Smith and Krueger (1933) determined that leadership was a combination of the interrelationships of the members the mutual goal of the group. Charles Bird (1940) found
limited experimental research on leadership which he used to compile a list of 79
leadership traits with limited duplication amongst the studies. Jenkins (1947) concluded
that the literature of the period had not determined leadership behaviors or a definition of
leadership. DeRue, Nahrgang, Wellman, and Humphrey (2011) recommended modifying
existing measures to provide better descriptions of leader behaviors. Yukl (2012)
determined that leader behavior research focused on the way the behaviors were used but
not on the conditions surrounding the leadership behaviors and effects.
According to Bass and Bass (2009), one of the seminal works in leadership
behavior research is the study of personal factors conducted by Ralph M. Stogdill and
published in 1948. Stogdill (1948) determined that an analysis of leadership needs to

Hefner-Babb 13
include studying both the leaders and the situations in which they lead. Leadership is not
limited to one person but is instead the interaction of the group and its members. Stogdill
(1967) proposed the need for a theory that encompassed organizational, behavioral, and
mathematic models and argued specifically that behavioral theories are based upon
satisfaction and productivity of the organization.
Ohio State Leadership Studies
According to Shartle (1957), the Ohio State Leadership Studies originated in 1945
for the purpose of testing hypotheses related to situational leadership behaviors. Halpin
(1955) examined the leadership behaviors and ideology of educational administrators and
aircraft commanders while focusing on Initiating Structure and Consideration dimensions
of leadership behavior. The purpose of the study was to determine if the leadership
ideology and style of the two leaders differed significantly. Halpin used the Leader
Behavior Description Questionnaire (LBDQ) and determined Initiating Structure and
Consideration as the two primary leader behaviors (Halpin, 1957a; Halpin & Winer,
1952; Hemphill & Coons, 1950).

them. Initiating

structure was defined as achieving the goals of the group (Halpin, 1957a, p. 1; Halpin,

(Taylor, Crook & Dropkin, 1961, p. 12). It

is also argued that the two dimensions can help determine whether a leader is effective or
ineffective (Taylor, Crook & Dropkin, 1961, p. 12). Yukl (1971) sought to develop a

Hefner-Babb 14
theory to determine how leader behavior and other variables impact productivity and
satisfaction of subordinates and found additional research was necessary to determine the
impact of leader effectiveness on groups. Kerr, Schriesheim, Murphy and Stogdill (1974)
suggested that the Ohio State research is not to be labeled historical, but rather as
continuing research. Schriesheim, Kinicki and Schriesheim (1979) then conducted a
series of five studies to determine how leniency impacted how subordinates reported
Consideration and Initiation of Structure and determined that leniency impacted all
leadership measurement scales. Jago (1982) determined that leadership research divided
into universal and contingent theoretical areas and also into focal leadership constructs of
either traits or behaviors.
Validity of the LBDQ. Stogdill (1969) sought to provide proof of validity for the
LBDQ instrument using two hypotheses: 1: Two different actors playing the same role
will not be described as significantly different on the subscale for that role. 2. The same
actor playing two different roles will be described as significantly different on the

House (1971) explained the effect of leader behavior on subordinates using the
path-goal theory of motivation. Three studies were conducted and findings validated the
results of the previous research and the Path Goal Theory (Stogdill, 1969; Halpin, 1955).
House (1971) used the Path Goal Theory to determine that leadership behaviors exhibited

consideration, then the follower will learn about the rewards available. Likewise, the

study and its lack of production related questions. Schriesheim and Stogdill (1975)
examined definitions of initiating structure and its relationship to leadership and
determined that the items in the three scales: SBDQ, LBDQ, and LBDQ XII differed in
each instrument. Research into the three instruments showed that the LBDQ XII has a
strong correlation between the initiating structure and consideration but the original
LBDQ and the SBDQ version are weakened because they measure autocratic, punitive,
and production oriented items not found in the revised version. Some examples of these
items include questions that have personalized reactions to subordinates, punitive actions
that push subordinates for work, and use of words like insist, arbitrary, and resistance that
increase bias (Schriesheim & Stogdill, 1975).
Schriesheim (1979) found that there was a relationship between both individual
oriented and group oriented lea  

individual and group outcome measures. More recently, Judge, et al. (2004) showed that
the two areas are still relevant and that the original LBDQ and LBDQ XII have the
highest validity in Consideration and Initiating Structure among the instruments used in
leadership studies.

Leadership in Academic Libraries
The position of library director requires a background in both management and
leadership (Arnold, Nickel & Williams, 2008; Brundy, 2014; Farrell, 2013b; Hayati &
Barahmand, 2012; Hernon, 2011; Jange, 2012). An academic library director requires
being a leader of the library organization and serving in leadership roles at the
institutional level (Dewey, 2014; Hernon, 2011). Leadership and management skills are
needed once a librarian reaches a position of department head, whether interim or
permanent, and those skills are not part of the library school curriculum (Farrell, 2013b;
Hayati & Barahmand, 2012). However, Ameen (2006) argued that library school
programs do not include leadership skills as part of the management courses.
Building on existing supervisory skills, a manager gains more responsibilities by
overseeing an aspect of the budget, project management, long term and short term
planning, and meting organizational goals (Farrell, 2013b). Harris-Keith (2015a)
determined that work in prior departments does not prepare librarians for the leadership
requirements of a library director. Leadership experience comes from membership in
professional organizations, mentoring and continuing education and other skill building
activities (Arns & Price, 2007; Dulin, 2008; Farrell, 2013b). Konya and Gurel (2014)
found that library leaders need varied skills to meet the changes that face libraries and
library users.
Leadership. Davis & Macauley (2011) concluded that true leadership inspires
and influences others. Hernon and Schwartz (2011) noted how leadership divides into

that vision

(p. 259). Cawthorne (2010) explored the experiences of middle managers in academic

Hefner-Babb 17
libraries with shared leadership and determined that academic libraries need a new
approach to leadership that includes personnel at all levels. Carpenter (2012) interviewed
library directors who identified risk taking, ability to accept failure and the importance of
establishing partnerships as key attributes of being an entrepreneurial leader. Farrell
recommended that leaders should take responsibility for decisions and seek the opinions
of others when making decisions and ultimately realize they are accountable (2013b).
Konya and Gurel (2014) suggested that leading an organization is successful when the
leader can get others to support the goals of the organization.
Institutional leadership. The nature of the academic library director position
requires leading the library organization and serving in leadership roles at the institutional
level (Arns & Price, 2007; Dewey, 2012; Dewey, 2014; Hernon, 2011; Jange, 2012). In a
study conducted by Hernon (2011) every library director indicated that leadership was

Dewey suggested that librarians who are transitioning into administrative roles should
consult the literature to learn about the experiences of others. External hire library
directors should focus on learning about the new organization and then establish their
credibility; no decisions should be made about changes until a few months have passed
(Brundy, 2014; Dewey, 2012). Internal hire library directors face the challenge of
separating their new position from the old and learning to view the campus from the

Hefner-Babb 18
perspective of an administrator. Interim directors face a difficult task of leading an
organization without the ability to make changes (Dewey, 2012).
Leadership gap. Management skills are key for the new librarians entering the
profession and many who are in middle management positions are not inclined to move
into upper administrative positions (Arnold, et al., 2008; Edge & Green, 2011; Goulding,
Walton, & Stephens, 2012). As the Baby Boomer generation of librarians prepares for
retirement, there is a gap of experienced library leadership to fill the vacant positions
(Arnold, et al., 2008; Arns & Price, 2007). The future workforce comes from a more
diverse background in library education and a different form of librarianship than prior
generations (Edge & Green, 2011). Van der Walt and du Plessis (2010) indicated that
library leaders needed to plan for a large number of staff retirements and should
implement management and leadership training for staff moving into the administrative
positions. A new librarian must prove ability to lead during the transition period (Dewey,
2012).
Transformational leadership. The American Library Association selected
transformational leadership as a component of the Core Competences of Librarianship
approved in 2009 (Hicks & Given, 2013). DÃ¼ren (2012) stated that transformational

cited by Hicks &

Given, 2013). The focus of transformational leadership for librarians is on change and
how to work with the implications of change in libraries (Hernon & Schwartz, 2008;
Phillips, 2014). Transformation is a part of leadership based upon the following definition

Antonakis, p. 5, 2012).
Millennial generation. The emergent leader in libraries today is the millennial
librarian, a person born after 1980 and a product of the digital age (Murray, 2011). They
are supervised by librarians who meet the characteristics of baby boomers or Generation
X thus creating a cross-generational workforce (Murray, 2011). Graybill (2014) explored
the leadership perceptions of millennial librarians. Findings indicated that
communication, vision, and personal connection are key to the millennial generation.
Murray (2011) stated that knowledge of millennial leadership behaviors will help ease
tensions between the new leader and the established librarians and staff. Research about
the millennial generation has indicated differing leadership styles incorporating
collaboration, multitasking, tendency to experiment and other generalizations. Murray
pointed out another issue that arises between the generations is the use of immediate

          s case to seek validation

of their decisions. Graybill (2014) found that millennials indicated interest in leadership
roles in their library but they believed barriers prevented them from leadership roles in
professional organizations.
Management. Managerial skills also contribute to successful library leadership
(Hayati & Barahmand, 2012; Jange, 2012; Mugyaboso & Matovelo, 2000; Unaeze,
2003). Academic library leaders require management skills as they relate to people, tasks,
and critical thinking (Hayati & Barahmand, 2012; Jange, 2012; Mugyaboso & Matovelo,
2000; Unaeze, 2003). Ameen (2006) found that management skills are often confused

Hefner-Babb 20
with leadership skills for example: policy making, planning, and organizing skills.

       

a need for library school programs to focus more on

teaching leadership skills to prepare the future librarians in the profession. Mackenzie
and Smith (2009) found that the library profession cannot agree on what is required for
leadership versus management positions. Library school graduates need to be proactive in

that goal (p. 140).
Successful Leadership Practices
Communication, vision, and personal connection are key to the millennial
generation (Brundy, 2014; Graybill, 2014). Library leadership required strong skills in
morale building, openness to change and ideas, ability to communicate and achieve
results and professionalism (Jange, 2012). An effective leader must be able to
successfully use the talents of the library organization to keep up with the rate of change
in the profession (Davis & Macauley, 2011; Heifetz, Grashow, & Linsky, 2009). Rogers
(2009) recommended that library leaders encourage their librarians and staff to contribute
to their organization with ideas and to draw upon their support to become better leaders
and thus they will help others become leaders.
Communication. Effective leaders have communication skills that contribute to
their success (DÃ¼ren, 2012; Farrell, 2013b; Jange, 2012). Farrell (2013b) noted that
librarians improve their communication skills during the middle management phase of
their career when they supervise staff and also function as part of the library
administrative team. In t  

needs while passing information down from the administration to their departmental

Hefner-Babb 21
employees. Furthermore, leaders also need to be able to communicate their message
clearly and serve as a diplomat between the various interests. Cawthorne (2010) found
that while library managers believed they had responsibility for the decisions made in
their departments they also felt that upper level administration did not communicate the
information they needed to perform their jobs better. Leaders also need to advocate for
their organization and prove its value among the other draws of academic institutional
resources (DÃ¼ren, 2012; Gwyer, 2010; Reyes, 2006).
Vision. Library leaders need to develop a long term vision for their library
(DÃ¼ren, 2012; Farrell, 2013a; Farrell, 2015; Gwyer, 2010; Jange, 2012; Saunders, 2015).

leads to consistency (Carpenter, 2012; DÃ¼ren, 2012; Farrell, 2013b). Leaders should use
framing to provide clarity and to maintain focus (Macauley & Davis, 2011). Gwyer
(2010) found that libraries need a new type of leader that encourages vision, collaboration

faced included managing a balance between tradition and change within the library
setting as it applied to technology and budgets (Carpenter, 2012). Farrell (2013b) argued
that a library leader should be able to motivate people and educate those outside the

broader outlook beyond their department to include the library and even the community.
Strategic plans are still focused on the traditional aspects of libraries and that
library leadership is not defining a vision of the future of the library (Carpenter, 2012;
Saunders, 2015). Further, Jantz (2012) argued that leaders are able to prevent
organizational drift when they establish a strategy. Thus it is recommended that library

Hefner-Babb 22
leaders should use their strategic plans to increase library visibility on campus. However,
middle managers have disagreed about whether their opinions mattered in the library
strategic planning process.
Innovation and change. Jantz (2012) suggested that leadership in innovation and
change is an area that lacks a process for administrators to follow. Further Jantz (2012)
argued that the leader who heads an organization and their team impact organizational
innovation. Yi (2013) found that female directors were less likely to use multiple
approaches to evaluating change and directors who held more varied positions during
their careers were likely to use dual approaches. Leaders must be prepared to address
resistance to change in the traditional areas of the library where transformation is needed
(Carpenter, 2012; DÃ¼ren, 2012; Jantz, 2012; Miller, 2012). Library leaders need to be
able to communicate a vision that advocates change as required; it cannot be optional
(DÃ¼ren, 2012; Farrell, 2015; Hayati & Barahmand, 2012; Jantz, 2012; Miller, 2012).
In relation to change the library and its staff must be flexible and willing to
change at a faster rate than in prior generations (Jantz, 2012; Michalak, 2012; Miller,
2012). Jantz (2012) concluded that academic library leaders will be forced to address
innovation both as a force of change and as a cause of conflict. Dewey (2014) stressed
that institutional leadership is the focus of the library dean or director in a university
setting. The role of library leader encompasses participation on university committees
and serving on administration councils as a representative and advocate of the library. As
the library leader, the director oversees the strategic planning process and the
organizational transitions that may occur as the university grows and moves forward into
the 21st century. Constant change facing libraries called for leadership that is aware of the

Hefner-Babb 23
need for change with greater focus on library users and their needs (Siriprasoetsin,
Tuamsuk & Vongprasert, 2011).
Personal connection. Leadership is not guaranteed by a set combination of
factors but rather it comes from conversations and relationship building with people in
the library organization (Brundy, 2014; Davis & Macauley, 2011; DÃ¼ren, 2012; Farrell,
2015). Goulding, et al. (2012) found that the ability to form solid working relationship
with others in the community, whether in the university setting or the public library, was
a necessary leadership skill. Mallon (2014) reported that some new librarians experience
a lack of support from their supervisors that impacts their interest in the profession.
Experienced library leaders explained that library leaders need to establish relationships
in the library and in the institution to bring about change via a group effort (DÃ¼ren, 2012;
Farrell, 2015; Jange, 2012; Ryan & Currie, 2014). Leadership is not guaranteed by a set
combination of factors but rather it comes from conversations and relationship building
with people in the library organization (Davis & Macauley, 2011). New library directors
who are transitioning into a new library position need to build relationships with their
new colleagues (Brundy, 2014; Harris, 2011).
Professional Development
Mackenzie and Smith (2009) indicated a lack of agreement about leadership and
management preparation within the profession. Librarians are transitioning into
leadership roles and finding out that they have gaps in their professional education (Hicks
& Given, 2013). Mackenzie and Smith examined library school curriculums and found
that leadership is included in just over half of the required management courses and even
fewer of the electives. Farrell (2013b) recalled a deficiency of two key leadership skills

Hefner-Babb 24
needed as a department head: ability to motivate employees and establishing a vision for
the library. Thus, the profession needs to encourage professional and personal
development for all who are potential leaders in a library organization (David &
Macauley, 2012). Professionals should take the initiative to pursue educational
opportunities to improve their skills and share what they learn (Ameen, 2006; Konya &
Gurel, 2014).
Leadership training is needed in the profession because library leaders need to be
able to connect with their users, address change, and exhibit confidence in their
leadership skills (Jange, 2012; Konya & Gurel, 2014; Romaniuk & Haycock, 2011).
Researchers recommend that library leaders have formal leadership training and
continuing professional leadership development to address the changing profession and
the ever changing leadership roles (Farrell, 2013b; Harris-Keith, 2015a; Harris-Keith,
2015b; Hayati & Barahmand, 2012; Konya & Gurel, 2014). Library leaders need to
optimize their staff during times of tight budgets and consult literature outside of the
profession for ways to manage their departments (Harris, 2011). Brundy (2014)
recommended that librarians who want to be directors should attend leadership institutes
and be mentored by other leaders. Crawley-Low (2013) found that employees who

Leadership institutes. The role of leadership institutes in the library profession is
to identify and educate emerging leaders in the library profession so they can undertake
greater leadership roles (Arnold, et al., 2008; German, Owen, Parchuck, & Sandore,

Hefner-Babb 25
2009; Sheehy, 2004). Facilitators and mentors at the leadership institutes are recognized
leaders in the profession including library deans and directors, coordinators and state
librarians. Institutes are also seen as a way to prepare the next generation of leaders for
the library profession (Romaniuk & Haycock, 2011; Arnold, et al., 2008). Herold (2014)
recommended that potential attendees of the leadership institutes examine the outcomes
of the program for beneficial content. Among these outcomes are establishing roots to
create change, ability to apply content learned at the workshop in the library, confidence
to undertake leadership positions after completing the program. Sheehy (2004) reported
that the Synergy program in Illinois included sessions on leadership assessment,
formulating a vision and how to implement a shared vision. The Synergy program
transformed the librarians into library leaders prepared to fill leadership gaps at their
institutions
The reasons for creating leadership programs included diverse job options for
library school graduates and being able to recruit librarians into leadership positions
vacated by retiring librarians (Kaufman, 2002). Goulding, et al. (2012) reported that a
series of studies of UK librarians determined an absence of leadership in the profession
causing concern about the next generation of library leaders. Romaniuk and Haycock
(2011) indicated that the initial purpose of leadership development programs focused on
teaching organizational effectiveness. Programs address the unique characteristics of the
profession including the predominance of females and introverted personality types
(Kyrillidou & Bland, 2009; Romaniuk & Haycock, 2011; Scherdin & Beaubien, 1995).
Skills taught at leadership institutes include (Arnold, et al., 2008; Fieldhouse, 2004;
German, et al., 2009; Winston & Neely, 2001):

Attendees also reported that the leadership institute offered a clearer
understanding of the role of the library and library administrator within the larger
organization i.e., university, state, or school district. Fallon, Maxwell, McCaffrey, and
McMahon (2011) found that attendance at a leadership institute helped them to identify
current leadership roles, potential roles, diversity, and that there is no single leadership
style that applies to everyone. Leadership programs like the program sponsored by the
Association of Research Libraries (ARL) support the profession in the areas of
succession planning for academic institutions by providing eager, emerging leaders to fill

Hefner-Babb 27
vacant positions (German, et al., 2009). Participants in the ARL program are well
grounded in management skills and exhibit leadership qualities and learn leadership via
an immersion setting (Webster & Young, 2009). The length of commitment to leadership
programs vary for example the Synergy program in Illinois requires a year-long

school library media specialist certification (Sheehy, 2004).
Arnold, et al. (2008) found that many participants selected for leadership
institutes are recommended by administrators who see leadership potential in the librarian
while others are required to attend. Participants selected for the ARL Research Library
Leadership Fellows and other similar programs bring leadership characteristics with them
that are untapped such as confidence and knowledge of their own abilities (Neely, 2009).
Herold (2014) suggested that provosts who choose to send a librarian to leadership
conferences receive a library leader in return who can contribute to the campus
community.
Mentoring. Leadership institutes often serve as a route to mentoring relationships
or mentoring programs (Arnold, et al., 2008). Lorenzetti and Powelson (2015) studied
mentoring programs for academic librarians and found that numerous programs exist and
they have varied levels of success. The mentoring process aids librarians in the process of
adjusting to academia and the pursuit of professional development (Lee, 2009; Lorenzetti
& Powelson, 2015). Mentoring programs in libraries can result in better supervision and
improved ability to navigate the profession (Hicks, Buckingham, & Law, 2010; Mallon,
2014; Munde, 2010). Lee (2009) reported that mentoring allows individuals to pass
knowledge gained through experience on the job on to new inexperienced professionals.

Hefner-Babb 28
Mentoring new professionals is an investment in the future and they mentee is likely to
serve as a mentor in the future. Lacy and Copeland (2013) suggested that library school
graduates benefitted from mentoring programs providing exposure to academic
librarianship. Mentors supported the program because the students learned current
practices and the mentors had opportunity for self-examination. Mentoring programs
benefit new librarians by providing counsel for concerns and increased confidence
(Phillips, 2014).
Library based programs. Camille and Westbrook (2013) reported that the
incentive to establishing an in house library leadership program was the newly hired
librarians needed to maintain professional development, participate in library
organizations and contribute to the literature. Results of the program included increased
communication and an improved organizational culture among the librarians and staff.
Mierke (2014) described the internal leadership program established at the University of
Saskatchewan resulting in employees interested in pursuing leadership roles in the
workplace. Feldmann, Level & Liu (2013) discussed the leadership program established
at Colorado State University based upon librarian desire to pursue leadership training and
experience. Librarians cited a decline in leadership positions in the library, organizational
structure, and workload as reasons for not pursuing leadership development
opportunities. Subsequently, the libraries addressed the issue by reorganizing,
establishing task forces, and committees and resulted in renewed interest in leadership by
the librarians.

Hefner-Babb 29
Leadership Competencies
Library leaders are defined as successful when they exhibit certain characteristics
or skills that are also classified as competencies (Ammons-Stephens, et al., 2009; DÃ¼ren,
2012; Jordan, 2012). The topic of leadership competencies for academic librarians is
addressed in the literature (DÃ¼ren, 2012; Hernon & Rossiter, 2007; Hernon, Powell, &
Young, 2003; Hernon, Powell, & Young, 2002; Hernon, et al., 2001; Winston &
Williams, 2003). According to Ammons-Stephens, et al. (2009), the collection of

to determine if they can be an effective leader; the profession does not have a list of
leadership competencies for aspiring leaders to reference (DÃ¼ren, 2012; Jordan, 2012).
According to Jordan (2012), even the definition of competency varies but it typically

Liebst, 2005; Giesecke & McNeil, 1999; Jordan, 2012, p. 37). According to Jordan
(2012) after conducting a Delphi study the following items made up the final set of
competencies:
#

Enthusiasm: optimism, positive emotional connection.

#

Demonstrating leadership: being perceived as a leader; taking charge of situations
effectively.

#

Delegation: handing off of both responsibilities and sufficient authority to
accomplish necessary tasks.

#

Accountability: taking responsibility for results $ positive and negative.

#

Planning: setting goals and developing strategies to achieve those goals.

Hefner-Babb 30
Integrity: following professional code, being honest, being a role model for how
to behave; honesty.
Risk Taking: not taking the easy way; taking a chance of failure; bold or
courageous action.
Credibility: building trust in others; doing what you say you will do; being
consistent in speech and actions.
Management: finding money, facilities to accomplish goals
Creativity: seeing different ways to accomplish goals; bringing forward new ideas
Customer service: both internal and external; remembering that patrons are the
Focus of the library
Interpersonal skills: effectively working together with others of different levels or
different position (staff and public); good social skills; building rapport
Communication skills: speaking, writing, listening; understanding your message
and conveying it to others
Flexibility: changing course when necessary, changing plans to be successful
Vision: looking at the future and see where the library can go; articulating
directions.
Political understanding: governing relations, Board relations, working with City
departments, understanding organizational structure.
Maturity: calm and in control, emotional intelligence, thinking of others first.
Problem solving: assess a situation and see what needs to be done.
Advocacy skills: being visible in the community and library, active in community
organizations, building relationship with decision makers (p.42).

Hefner-Babb 31
Jordan recommended a set of competencies based upon research would help librarians
determine the skills needed to be a successful leader.
American Library Association efforts. American Library Association (ALA) is
examining their professional codes to determine a set of leadership competencies
(Ammons-Stephens, et al., 2009; Hicks & Given, 2013). Hicks and Given (2013) noted
that the association was tasked with creating a set of core competencies that would fill the
gap between library school curriculums and the skill set needed librarian positions. The
resulting draft list of competencies for approval by ALA in 2009 did not include
leadership and principled transformational leadership was added by a floor motion and
approved. Hicks and Given determined that the addition of transformational leadership to
the competencies was a due to the uncertainty among members of the profession and the
need for future leaders. The final document included eight core content areas
accompanied with a list of competencies for each; leadership is found under the section
for management and administration (See Appendix D).
The Library Leadership and Management Association of ALA compiled a
competency model for library leadership based upon prior research and the results of
small group meetings and interviews with library leaders (Dole, Hurych & Liebst, 2005;
Promis, 2008; Shannon, 2002; Winston & Dunkley, 2002). Ammons-Stephens, et al.
(2009) reported that the findings of the LLAMA study resulted in the Core Leadership
Competency Model:
Cognitive Ability includes problem solving, decision making, and
reflective thinking inclu    

Vision includes the ability to think globally, think creativity [sic] and
foster innovation, as well as the ability to be forward-thinking.
Interpersonal effectiveness describing leaders who can create a positive
atmosphere centered on respect, responsibility, and motivation. Includes
culturally competence, accountability, team building, development,
inspirational or motivational, and communication skills.
Managerial effectiveness which includes the ability to manage change,
manage resources, plan for the future, collaborate with others, and have
the ability to be flexible (p. 68-70).

International perspectives. The issue of core competencies is one of
international interest (Al Ansari & Al Khadher, 2011; de Boer, Bothma & Olwagen,
2012; DÃ¼ren, 2012; Grgic & Zivkovic, 2012; Jantti & Greenhalgh, 2012; Tanloet &
Tuamsuk, 2011). DÃ¼ren (2012) argued that during times of change library leaders need to
employ a variety of special competences to meet the needs of the profession. DeBoer,
Bothma and Olwagen (2012) investigated the need to develop leadership competencies in
South Africa by examining the thinking processes of library leaders and connecting them
to leadership preferences. The results indicated a need to develop the thinking skills
associated with the position occupied by the leader so that the leader does not limit their
views to existing knowledge. Jantti and Greenhalgh (2012) determined that library

Hefner-Babb 33
leaders need to commit to leadership development and put those leadership behaviors into
practice in the workplace. Partridge, Menzies, Lee and Munro (2010) examined the lists

and focus on interpersonal skills versus technology.
Al Ansari and Al Khadher (2011) studied the competencies needed in Kuwait
libraries for successful leadership. Initially they sought to define a competency model and
determined two model types: work related decisions that gain results and the knowledge
brought to the position from experience (Klemp, 2008). Results of the study narrowed 20
competencies into six categories including: managerial skills, cognitive skills, social
skills, motivational, personal, and occupational (Al Ansari & Al Khadher, 2011). The
skills selected in this study are recommended for use in library education, professional
development, and training in Kuwait. A similar study conducted in Thailand found three
attributes for inclusion as competences: leadership capacity, achievement motivation and
adaptability (Tanloet & Tuamsuk, 2011). Results of a study by Grgic and Zivkovic

collection procedures are documented. Next, follows the details of how the data were
analyzed. The final section concludes with a summary.
Purpose Statement and Research Questions
The purpose of this mixed method study was to examine the relationship between
leadership behaviors of library administrators and the expectations of the librarians they
supervise framed within the Ohio State Two Factor Theory and the Theory of Individual
Behavior and Group Achievement. The overarching question of the study is: What is the
relationship between the real leadership behaviors of Texas academic library
administrators and the ideal leadership expectations of the librarians they supervise? The
following quantitative questions guided the study:
1. What is the relationship between library administrators actual consideration
leadership behaviors and ideal consideration leadership behaviors preferred by
academic librarians in Texas?

Hefner-Babb 35
2. What is the relationship between library administrators actual initiating
structure leadership behaviors and real initiating structure leadership
behaviors preferred by academic librarians in Texas?
The following qualitative questions guided the study:
3. Describe the input behaviors: performance, interaction, and expectation, are
practiced by the library administrator in their current position.
4. What is the group structure and operations control practiced by the library
administrator?
5. How does the library administrator influence group achievement?
Research Design
This convergent parallel mixed methods study examined Texas academic library
administrator real and ideal leadership behaviors. According to Creswell and Clark
(2011), a convergent parallel mixed methods design is a type of design in which
qualitative and quantitative data are collected at the same time, analyzed separately, and
then merged. Creswell (2012) stated that this mixed method design allows for one
research design, qualitative or quantitat    

Hefner-Babb 36
The first part of the study consisted of quantitative research through survey
design. Creswell (2012) defined a survey as a process when the participant chooses
answers to questions       

        ).

The survey instrument was the most effective way to collect data from librarians across
the state of Texas. Using a cross sectional survey allows the researcher to learn about
   current attitudes or practices within a short time frame (Creswell, 2013). The

revised instruments incorporated nominal levels of measurement for demographic data

respondents while maintaining confidentiality, numbers represented the libraries.
The second part of the study used a qualitative phenomenological narrative
analysis. According to Creswell (2012), the purpose of this type of study is to explore a
central phenomenon shared by a group of individuals such as library administrators in
academic library settings. The use of narrative inquiry methods provides the option for
the participants to tell their unique story and experience with the phenomenon (Creswell,
2013). The researcher examined trends in the results of the separate dimensions of the
survey and sought information about leadership behaviors of the library administrators to
learn more about the views of the participants (Creswell, 2013). Using a mixed methods
design incorporating quantitative and qualitative data provided a more thorough
examination of the research problem.
Quantitative sample. For this study, the population of library administrators

Qualitative participants. For the second phase of the research, the researcher
chose to use a combined convenience and purposeful sample of Texas academic library
administrators who are at 4-year degree granting institutions. A purposeful selection of
10 library administrators with at least five years of experience in library administration at
academic libraries was conducted. Selected individuals were interviewed for the
qualitative aspect of the study. Participants came from the libraries where both the
administrator and the librarians participated in the surveys. The benchmark of five years
was selected based upon a recent study that reported 40% of respondents (119 of 289)



had been in their library director position at master s level colleges and universities less
than four years (Harris-Keith, 2015b, p. 249). The number of directors with 5 or more

Hefner-Babb 42
years totaled 59% while those with 10 or more years of experience totaled 34% (HarrisKeith, 2015b, p. 249).
Each librarian invited to participate worked in an administrative role in their
current library serving under a variety of job titles ranging from dean or director to
associate dean or director. The titles varied based upon the size of the institution of higher
education served by the library. Tier one libraries as determined by Carnegie
classification are nationally competitive research universities, have deans, associate
deans, and coordinators who are in leadership roles supervising librarians and staff
(Bennett, 2010). Smaller academic libraries at private schools may only have a dean or
director in the administrative roles. The emphasis was on librarians in leadership
positions and the leadership behaviors they exhibited while performing their jobs.
Each library administrator who participated in this study worked in the library of
a four-year degree granting institution in Texas. Six administrators work in libraries at
public universities in Texas and four are at private u   

higher education. Eight of the administrators are active in the American Library
Association and the Texas Library Association with three who participated in the Texas
Accelerated Library Leaders program as librarians; two administrators served as mentors,
ALA Snowbirds, or other recognized professional leadership programs. The
administrators have served in their current positions range from eight years to twenty and
all but two of the administrators are in the 61 to 70 age group.

Instrumentation
This convergent parallel mixed method study incorporated two types of
instrumentation. For the quantitative data, a survey was utilized to collect demographic
information about the sample, and the primary data for analysis. For the qualitative data,
a semi-structured interview protocol was developed. In this section, each of the
instruments will be discussed in depth.
Quantitative. The surveys used in this study included demographic questions
(see Appendix H) and questions from the Consideration and Initiation of Structure
subscales (see Appendices I and J). The first survey instrument is derived from the
LBDQ-XII-R-Ideal (Fisher College of Business, The Ohio State University, 1962a).
Questions for the second survey instrument are from the LBDQ XII-R-Self (Fisher
College of Business, The Ohio State University, 1962b).
Two dimensions of Leadership behavior are: Consideration (e.g., behaviors such
as mutual trust, respect, and warmth in relationship) and Initiation of Structure (e.g.,
delineates relationships between self and followers, establishes well-defined patterns of
organization, and ways of getting a job completed) (Halpin, 1955), were measured using
the Leadership Behavior Description Questionnaire-XII Revised (LBDQ-XII-R). The

available leadership studies the authors found that Consideration and Initiation of
Structure are still relevant in leadership.
Qualitative. For the qualitative portion of this study, participants were asked 14
open-ended questions (Appendix K). Since the participants resided in various cities in
Texas, the interviews took place via telephone or in person. Administrators were invited
to participate directly via email by the researcher after they completed the LBDQ-XII-RSelf. The interviews were conducted in a 45 to 60 minute time period. Confidentiality of
participants was protected by using numbers to represent the librarians and their library.
Upon completion of the interviews, the data collected were electronically analyzed and
stored on a password protected computer.

Data Collection Procedures
After receiving the approval of the Lamar University Institutional Review Board
(Appendix A), the data collection for the study began. This section provides details of the
data collection process in the order of its implementation for this convergent parallel
mixed methods study.
Quantitative. This phase of the study used electronic versions of the Leader
Behavior Description Questionnaire Form XII (Stogdill, 1963), created on
S 

   ), which consisted of two different forms; one for

the administrators and one for the librarians. Written permission to use the LBDQ was
not required (Ohio State University, 2014). A list of Texas academic libraries was
provided by the Texas Higher       lists of
Independent Universities and Public Universities, which contained internet links to each
university home page. Contact information for academic library administrators and
librarians was collected from academic library websites linked to the university home
pages. Contact information was then compiled into a master contact list. Invitation emails were sent to all library administrators and librarians for whom email addresses
were found, providing them an overview of the study, instructions on how to participate,
and an estimated time range it would take them to participate (see Appendix C).
Electronic links to the LBDQ-XII-R-Self, which measured the admini
behavior from their personal perspective, were sent to library administrators and the
LBDQ-XII-R-Ideal, which measured what the librarians expected of their administrator,
were sent to their librarians. The survey remained open for five weeks, and follow-up
emails were sent in weeks 2 and 5. The response rates for administrators were 24% and

Hefner-Babb 47
21% for the librarians. Once the survey closed, the data was downloaded from

 

as an Excel file, which was then imported into Statistical Package for

the Social Sciences (SPSS, ver. 22, n.d.) for analysis. The survey data files were saved on
a password protected computer to protect the privacy of the participants.
Qualitative. The use of narrative inquiry methods provides the option for the
participants to tell their unique story and experience with the phenomenon (Creswell, p.
71). The questions for the guided protocol (Appendix K) included background questions

Achievement. Each participant received the same set of questions from the researcher and
had the option to review their comments prior to inclusion in the study. The interviews
explored individual behavior and group achievement beliefs of current Texas academic
library administrators.
According to Creswell (2013) the process of interviewing is a detailed data
collection process that is part of the larger research. The data collection methods for this
study included in depth interviews conducted in person, via telephone and when
necessary, email. Interviews were conducted using the same set of questions for each
candidate and when possible the interview was conducted in person. Research questions
were open-ended and focused on the phenomenon of leadership. Interviews with each
librarian were recorded and transcribed and sent back to the individual for follow-up to
make sure that the transcription was correct. Participants also were provided with IRB
consent forms as part of the interview process. After the participants submitted the
surveys, data were collected and analyzed electronically on a password protected
computer.

Hefner-Babb 48
Data Analysis
The data for both phases of the study were analyzed in two separate steps. The
first phase focused on the quantitative analysis and the qualitative data was analyzed in
the second phase. Interpretation of the results followed analysis of the data.
Quantitative. Descriptive statistics were calculated for the demographic variables
and used to provide a quantitative description of the respondents to the survey. A Pearson
Product-Moment correlation was conducted to test the relationships between
Administrators and their librarians regarding the two domains of leadership behaviors.
Prior to analysis, all data was evaluated to assure that test assumptions were met. When
  

 Rho, a non-parametric alternative to the

Pearson, was used. Prior to analysis, the librarian scores for the Consideration and
Initiation of Structure subscales were combined by averaging librarian scores for each
library, to provide a single score on each subscale. Administrator scores for the
Consideration and Initiation of Structure subscales were also combined providing a single
score for each subscale for each library for which an administrator responded. The
subscale scores were then averaged to arrive at a single average score for consideration
and another for initiation of structure.
Qualitative. The data collected from the interviews were classified and
interpreted. Interview content was coded into categories of information based upon
keywords that were frequently mentioned by the candidates. The coded information was
combined into themes and interpreted for a larger meaning. Creswell (2013) recommends
that the researcher use at least two of the eight procedures to validate their study. The
data collected were corroborated via triangulation using curriculum vitas and resumes,

biographical information on library websites, print resources and theories that suggest
that the information is valid. Peer review was used to keep the researcher honest and
served as a sounding board for ideas. The researcher clarified personal bias and examined
how their position might impact the study. Members who participated in the study were
invited to participate in member checking where they read the results of the study and
submitted their views on the outcomes to the researcher to vali   
findings.
Epoche
As an experienced librarian, I have observed and participated in the phenomenon
of trying to undertake leadership roles without leadership training. Librarians are elected
to leadership positions within their professional organizations, libraries, and institutions
and often struggle with the responsibilities. As a new librarian fresh from library school, I
accepted a position that included tenure and promotion. My coursework in library school
included management and library administration, but I had little knowledge of how to
supervise or be a leader. My supervisor suggested that I apply for the Texas Accelerated
Library Leaders program through the Texas Library Association, and I was accepted. The
institute focused on organizational skills, stepping outside of your comfort zone, and
communication. As part of the program, I had to set a professional goal that would be
accomplished within two years and a personal goal as a member of the Texas Library
Association.
Summary
In Chapter III, the researcher presented the methodology. Chapter IV contains the
analysis of data by the researcher followed by the narratives in Chapters V through

Hefner-Babb 50
Chapter XIV. Chapter XV summarizes the narrative findings. Chapter XVI provides the
summary of the research, conclusions, implications for practice, and recommendations
for further research.

Chapter IV
Analysis of Data
The purpose of this mixed method study was to examine the relationship between
leadership behaviors of library administrators and the expectations of the librarians they
supervise framed within the Ohio State Two Factor Theory and the Theory of Role
Differentiation and Group Achievement. This study was guided by the following
quantitative research questions:
1. What is the relationship between library administrators actual consideration
leadership behaviors and ideal consideration leadership behaviors preferred by
academic librarians in Texas?
2. What is the relationship between library administrators actual initiating
structure leadership behaviors and real initiating structure leadership
behaviors preferred by academic librarians in Texas?
This chapter contains information about the assessment and modification of raw
data before analysis, the analysis process and the results. The results are also interpreted.
The chapter is organized by research questions guiding this study.
Data Preparation
Before analysis, the data were evaluated for missing values and the violations of
assumptions related to correlation analysis. Six administrator responses and three
librarian responses were removed due to skipped questions or no librarian responses to
correlate to the administrator. No violations of assumptions were detected in regard to
linearity or extreme outliers, but the variables were not normally distributed. As such, it

Hefner-Babb 52

         rho would be the most appropriate test to use
(Salkind, 2011).
Prior to conducting the analysis, the scores for librarians were totaled for the two
subscales and averaged. The scores for the administrators were totaled and administrators
without corresponding librarian responses were removed.
Findings for Research Questions One and Two
Research question one examined the relationship between library administrators
actual consideration behaviors and librarians ideal consideration leadership behaviors by
academic librarians in Texas. A Spearman correlation was computed to test the
relationship between the actual consideration leadership behaviors of library
administrators (n=18, M=41.05, SD=3.33) and the ideal behaviors preferred by academic
librarians (n=18, M=39.74, SD=3.40). Analysis revealed that there was a weak, positive
correlation that was not statistically significant between the administrators real behaviors
and the ideal behaviors sought by the librarians, rs(18)=.277, p=.265. This suggests there

actual and ideal initiation of structure behaviors preferred by academic librarians in
Texas. A Spearman correlation was computed to assess the relationship between the
actual initiation of structure leadership behaviors of library administrators (n=18,
M=38.94, SD=4.19) and the ideal behaviors sought by academic librarians (n=18,
M=39.52, SD=4.23). Analysis revealed that there was not a statistically significant

the two groups, there was not much difference between the actual and preferred.
Likewise, the means for Initiating Structure were lower than the means for
Consideration, which means that the Consideration behaviors were preferred by
librarians over Initiating Structure behaviors.
Summary
In Chapter IV, the researcher presented quantitative analysis of findings. The
results of the research found a statistically, weak, positive correlation between the real
consideration leadership behaviors and the ideal behaviors desired by librarians. The
correlations showed there was not a correlation between the actual and ideal initiation of
structure behaviors. Qualitative narrative findings are presented in Chapters V through
XIV. A narrative summary of the findings is in Chapter XV. Study, conclusions and
implications for practice, and recommendations for further study are discussed in Chapter
XVI.

people that report to me periodically at least throughout the academic year. We
meet as a faculty and we meet as a management group, which is the faculty and

proposition. A lot of libraries even have both where they have a dual track you

My final question examined integration of the library organization. Matthew
responded after thinking about the question
Getting people to work outside of the departmental lines starts with the
supervisors, who in many cases can be very territorial people and very
antagonistic if their employees attempt to do that. Trying to get the supervisors on
the page first is, I think, the hardest part. I think most people that work in our
library are eager to do anything that will help the library, but I think sometimes
we get bogged down, at least in our particular library, by one or two people who

Lucie is currently in her 9th year at a private academic university library. When I
asked her what positions she held prior to being director she responded:
I started as the cataloging librarian and after a couple of years and became the
technical services coordinator. Within that same year that I became technical
services coordinator, unfortunately, our director that I was hired under passed

When asked to describe her library organization she told me she reports to the associate
provost and provost who divide library duties. She then detailed the internal organization
saying:
Then reporting to directly to me, see Figure 2, I have an assistant director who is
the head of our reference area. Then I have an interlibrary loan supervisor who
reports directly to me. The technical services coordinator reports directly to me.
Then I have a distance education librarian who works with our off-campus sites
and online education. She reports directly to me.

I then asked Lucie how she assesses and rewards performance of the librarians
who work with her. She said she meets with the librarians annually:
We discuss annual goals, what they expect. We review what they consider their
highlights from the previous year, what they thought they could have done better,
what they were proud of, what they consider their best achievement for the year.

librarians. Initially she indicated a personal preference for face-to-face conversations
describing her pattern saying:

When asked how she lets librarians know her expectations as their leader Lucie
referred to her practices in the annual meetings. She remarked:

elaboration on the group organization. Lucie commented providing more detail about
select duties in each position saying:

is an additional full-time librarian under him and one part-time librarian under
him. There is somewhat structure. Our coordinator of technical services oversees
the periodicals and other cataloging. Acquisitions is under her area although direct
purchasing is done out of my office. All of the purchase orders come through me.

focused on collaboration and team work. She also explained how she led the library soon

to be the director. I was looking at ways in which I would appreciate hearing from
others who might have done this a little longer than I had done this.
I then asked how she relayed her expectations to the library organization as a
whole. Lucie replied stressing what she saw as the purpose of the library:
I think that goes back to that question C under your first question. Through the
staff meetings, through the meetings with annual goals, and then also as I share
above me with the associate provost and with the provost, sharing with them what
we, as a team, have come to understand our purpose to be here for the university
and for the students.

described a dependence on statistics. She explained:

When discussing assessing productivity Lucie reflected on library contributions to
recent changes to student evaluations. She described them as follows:
One of the things that I pushed for that, this year, did take place was to add. They
revised our student course evaluation courses form this year. It was nice to be able

whole form, it just seemed like a good time to insert some things having to do
with information literacy and to see what kind of research students were having to
do in some of their classes and if the resources we had were meeting those needs.

My final question to Lucie focused on how she integrated her library as a group.
She replied indicating a dependence on a variety of meetings:

The Goal is Consensus, Not Compromise
John has been the director at his library since 1996. He began the discussion by
stating the following:
I came as library director and then about 10 years after I came, they changed it
from library director to executive director of library services. My standard joke

moved out here. I had 3 courses left to take and then the proposal and the

services which is the traditional reference, (ILL) inter-library loan, and
information literacy. Then we have our technical services unit which is cataloging

Collection which is our special collections area in and the University Archive.
Then there is a library business manager, and community engagement coordinator
position which reports directly to me as well.

Input Behaviors
My first question to John focused on the various input behaviors he used as a
library administrator. I focused on how he evaluated and rewarded performance of the
librarians who worked for him and he replied:
We have a standardized performance review system here on the campus which is,
I think, pretty similar in a lot of different institutions where we look at the
requirements of their particular position and how well they perform particularly in
5 key areas. That will vary from person to person depending on what their
assignments are and what they have chosen to emphasize as well. We do not have

another component to have to look at is, how well do they perform as

special projects they might be working on. All of that goes into a formal review
document that we use here on campus.
I then asked John what his formal process for rewarding performance entailed.
John replied indicating it was not based on merit but rather on an alternative system:

In my final question for this section we discussed how John relays his
expectations to the librarians. He responded:
I think part of that is to have strong goals and objectives planning system for the
year. Each year, we map out the goals and objectives for the library and then they
go out and map their unit goals and objectives. This year, I reversed the process

Share Credit for Successes; Shoulder Blame for Failures
Deb is a career librarian with over 20 years at the same library in a variety of
roles. When asked about her positions to date she replied:
I have been working here since 1995, so 20 years and a few months, and the
positions that I held ... I came really as a government documents librarian, and
then within a few years moved to head that department, and then from there I
moved to an assistant dean position for the information technology services that
included digital library, the systems, and network, et cetera, and a user interfaces
group. After a few years with that, then I moved into the associate dean role that
has responsibilities across the library.
I then asked Deb for information related to her educational background. Deb

Coordinating Council in Texas. I was the faculty representative from a state
university on that committee for 12 years. We did reports to the legislature
recommending how to deal with records management issues, in particular as we
move more into the digital word, and how to preserve records that are not in any
format, but digital.
That was a good experience, getting to know records managers from

information technology. Then, earlier than that, government information.
With government information it was as we watched government
information move more to digital. I became really interested in capturing the
websites of agencies that were going out of business. That got me involved in the
world of technology, and in the world of digitization because we were wanting to
get things available online, and government information; which then prepared me
for the next job, information technology services in the library.

My first question to Deb related to assessing and rewarding performance of

assessment structure in her organization stating:

plan that has overarching goals, and targets our objectives within that. Each of the

I then asked how Deb lets her direct reports know her expectations as their leader.
She referred back to the strategic planning document and the evaluations used for
librarians and staff saying:
I think that our expectations are pretty clear in our strategic plan. The goals and
targets that we develop. We always run into this for the librarians. Our staff, we

issues then you have to be much more circumspect.
Group Structure and Operations Control
I first asked Deb to elaborate on the group structure of her organization. She
discussed the positions outside of the divisions that reported to her:
We do have a few positions that floats a little outside of our divisions and offices.
We have a director for assessment that floats a bit outside. Reports directly to me,
but we want to keep that emphasis as being across the library. We have a person
in a library publishing position that reports directly to the dean. That position is
more working with special corrections, and our university press, and others
related to publishing. We do have a few of those outliers. The university press

actually reports to the dean of libraries as well. We have a few of those positions

first of all, of the development of strategic plan, and how we implement the
setting the objectives that we need to set to reach our goals outlined in our
strategic plan.
When I asked Deb how she relayed her expectations to the library and she again
stressed the various communication avenues within her organization. She remarked:
Well, I think I discussed that somewhat earlier, in we have several avenues of
communicating, just with everyone in the library. The coffees are, I think, a good
way of doing that. Having some time for people to ask questions is an important

Hefner-Babb 98
factor. But also allowing them to submit them in writing anonymously through
the library assembly, I think is a good thing.
We also have an internal newsletter that we tend to add things to from the
administrative offices. A lot of it is communication across the divisions and
offices about

and accessed information is just in constant flux. You have to be always prepared
to change the way you do things. To provide better services to students who are
much more tech savvy, but may not have a clue about critical thinking skills, and
selecting authoritative sources.
Before, in libraries, we selected authoritative sources for them to use.

My first question to Kathy in this section concerned how she assessed and
rewarded performance of librarians who report to her. In her response she detailed the
formal evaluation process and how it is tied to the assessment plan.
Okay, well, first of all, the actual main part of the evaluation, annual evaluation
thing, a good part of that is our mutually-established goals. Okay, so we look at

some of that is by example. Some of it is by a lot of time, and actually trying to

referred back to library goals and planning saying:

Again we come around pretty much our goals and planning that we do, and we try
to integrate multiple departments in those goals. Then new initiatives that come
up at the university level, we try to integrate those as well. That involves multiple
people normally.

My first question in this section inquired how Cara assessed and rewarded
performance of the librarians she supervised. Cara replied:
It is, in fact, already governed by the processes that the university has in place.
We have an annual performance evaluation process that we go through with forms

Hefner-Babb 122
that are filled out by each supervisor and manager. Everything comes to me at the
top and I review everything before it goes over to HR. We also have a merit raise

all the

supervisors to define who gets additional merit.
Then I asked Cara what modes of interaction she used to communicate with her
librarians. She told me that she has two management groups and proceeded to explain
both of them:
One I meet with weekly called the Management Team, which is, in fact, the three
assistant deans, my financial officer, and the two other directors of the libraries. I
also then have an expanded group called the Leadership Team which meets once
a month and includes my development directors, the director of the friends of the

I want to mention because I really forgot, when you were talking about

have a series of awards that we hand out at the end of the year for all the librarians

The same with search committees. We will have search committees led by

When asked how she relays her expectations to the library Cara referred back to
her response to the prior question. This time she spoke about instituting a promotion
process for her librarians:
I think we talked about that a little bit earlier; basically, modeling the behavior
that I want our librarians to develop. Of course, when I first came here, we
actually had no promotion process for librarians. You were just what you were
hired at. We are not faculty, but I managed to create a promotional process. You
can go up through four. We have four categories of librarians through the ranks. I
managed to get some money from the provost to add into this.
My librarians were not used to going out and publishing or having to do a
lot organizationally. If they were interested in professional development, they

they could be promoted just by having been there for ten years. Looking at their
vitas, it was clear. They had showed no evidence of professional development. It
took a while for them to get that, that in actual fact, they have to follow the

Hefner-Babb 127

engaged, so engaged I had to actually create another position because there was
definitely much more work than one person could handle. Again, the productivity
is measured in these kinds of ways.
Then, of course, we do the annual reporting on our strategic plan. We have
goals and we measure that progress. How did we get achieve our goals? What did
we contribute there?

When I asked Jacob how his library organization is arranged he referred to the
organizational chart he sent via email. His library organization differs slightly than
traditional library structures:
I sent you a chart you can refer to (see Figure 8), but the positions that report to
me are two associate directors, one associate director for public services, one
associate director for technical services, the unit head for what we call digital
systems essentially a web master who helps run digital commons and things like
that reports to me, the assistant director for operations reports to me, and I have an
administrative assistant that reports to me.

Input Behaviors
My first question to Jacob in this section is inquired how he assessed and rewards
performance. He responded after asking for clarification on assessment saying:

except for administrative librarians, who

have definite administrative responsibilities; however, you only talk about
assessing the librarians in the organization. Well the assessment of my
administrative people is based solely on administrative. The responsibilities they
have to carry out for cataloging, public service, and administrative operations. For
the librarians and these individuals also have responsibilities. As I said in my
written response, we look at three areas of performance: one is information

Hefner-Babb 137
literacy teaching in classes and other venues, one is working reference and service

and the third area we assess is subject matter specialist work where librarians
have either departments or colleges assigned to them they are the subject matter
of specialists for that college department and we assess that area.
What we look at is numbers, we actually go in there and we have an
assessment tool that we actually visit the classes when people are teaching

and public service work we track the number of interactions they have and any
sort of feedback we get from people. With subject matter specialists we look at
how efficiently they spend their budgets for each year, we look at their
interactions we expect them to meet with the dean at least once a semester, with
their department chair twice a semester, and with their liaison at least once a
month.

positions or people that do have scores below a 3, which is acceptable, they do not
get merit and we try to use that money and reward people who have performed
exceptionally.
I asked how Jacob communicated with those who report to him. He replied that
his library transformed to a learning commons and that impacts communication practices
saying:

information literacy. Teaching, they probably meet with them on a weekly basis.

Group Structure and Operations Control
The first question to Jacob in this section focused on the structure of the library
organization. He replied:
No, our goal since I took over the library is to become more embedded into the
university and into the academic side. If you look at our organization structure I

know; however, what we did is we separated out a priority sheet and on the
priority sheet we measure things like the number of visitors we have, the hits on
our website, how many people have instructed, visitors to special collections, and
things we consider the important factors in measuring whether people are using
us. We collect that and distribute that on a monthly basis and I actually share that
with the president every so often.
We also produce on a monthly basis a spreadsheet of all our electronic
databases, how many hits they hav 

being used it is not going to continue to be purchased and if you ordered it for
somebody in your department then you had best go speak with them about it not
being used. That sort of thing like that. Then of course we have budget, we are
totally funded by library fees nowadays. We have to watch our budget. So we do
budget analysis every month also.

The final question in this area focused on how Jacob relayed his expectations to

Hefner-Babb 142
and the information literacy teaching person, having those three people signed on
believing in this and constantly steering our decision-making in that direction. We
hire new librarians with certain skill sets, the last librarian that we hired that
caused us to hire this person over others was the fact that she had teaching
experience. That was the deciding factor. We kind of hire like-minded people.

a subject division at the time so I started out replacing the science library and then

a nine-month contract because so much is online and you need somebody

replied:

of social media for archives and promoting the archives and special collections.
Things like that get noted in emails to everybody, but that tends to be it.
I then asked about what modes of communication she used most with her
librarians. Kaitlyn responded:

things, too but those are current things that I am doing. In terms of the have I held,
there is a whole bunch of other stuff, too.
I asked Anne to describe her leadership positions in the library and by connection
on campus. She mentioned the larger roles she filled:
My current library is on, library director, university librarian. On campus,
probably the real biggie is, I was chair on the faculty senate. Which is an elected
position for three years. 2009 to 2012. I have chaired, I am currently chairing the
campus master plan committee.
I then asked Anne to describe the organizational structure of her library. She
discussed the current structure and upcoming changes saying:
The associate university librarian, who is over public services, reports to me.

rather hear the new one, or the old one? (See Figure 10)

primarily the cataloging and other discovery functions. She also runs the
institutional repository. Head of collection development and resource sharing.
Then, a staff position called, assessment and user services librarian. User
experience librarian. I am sorry. I said, user services, user experience.
What is going to change is the person over discovery systems, is going to
be over a larger tech services unit. Budgeting, acquisitions, finance will all be
under her. The person over collections will be taking on, she will be giving up
some roles, those are the ones I just described, and will be taking on supervision

have mostly to do with playing to peoples administrative strengths. Trying to put
people in the place where they will function the most effectively.

Input Behaviors
My first question related to input behaviors asked Anne about how she evaluates
promotion. Her response was:

strong librarianship.
That however, is mostly individual behavior. The piece that is sort of outside of
that is the management piece. Anybody who is supervising other people, and
basically I am watching all the time to see whether people are effective managers
of the people working under them feeling informed. Do they seem to be
productive? Are they engaged? All those kinds of things.
I asked about whether Anne  

had a merit plan. She indicated

that while there is one the raises are minimal:
Well. That is a goo 

there is not a lot of wiggle room on that. People that are performing at a very high
level, do not make that much more in terms of financial compensation than the
person who is just getting by. That to me is a frustration. Although, there is a
pretty strong school of thought that the pay thing should be separated from the
evaluation piece. I think there is a lot to be said for that.
The way [our] system works is, we go through this annual evaluation
process in the early winter. Those recommendations are used to determine salary.

no matter what. Not a lot of wiggle room there.

librarians she supervises. She reflected:

money.
My final question to Anne for this section inquired how she relays her
expectations to librarians. She found it an interesting question and then said:
We meet at least once, monthly. As a library faculty. I would say that we as a
group tend to determine where we are going and what we are doing. Although, I
feel like my job is to guide that. Make people feel like we are really moving, this
is the direction I hope we are moving in, or I believe we should be moving in, and
try to basically get enough energy going, that everybody agrees.

we are a pretty collaborative group of people, in terms of decision making. I do
not believe I am right all the time. I am interested in hearing other points of view
and can be talked into thinking about something, differently.

Hefner-Babb 173
I also, I will say, one real big expectation of mine is that we will try things
out, and yes sometimes we will fail, and that is okay. Better to try things out than
not try things out.
Group Structure and Operations Control
My first question to Anne in this group asked for a description of the library
organization. She responded in detail saying:

s see, under the Assistant University Librarian (AUL), and public services.
There are two librarians. One the head of access services. One the head of
instruction. Under the head of instruction are four liaison instruction librarians
that he coaches pretty significantly, and quite well. Under the head of access
services is a daytime manager, nighttime manager, and boatload of students.
Then there are two, there is a person who is systems and technical support
for the entire library. She also, reports to the AUL, because that is ultimately
public support for the public. She does a lot of work with the folks that are in tech
services, as well. They do  

higher up, so there is sort of a signal that she belongs to all of us.
Then there are two ladies that, for years, we had a, reference desk. We had
two reference assistants, paraprofessional people that have been here for quite a
while, and can handle everyday reference really well. This past year and a half,
they have provided their service from the circulation desk, and it may be that we
alter that reporting relationship, as well. But, for the moment they still report to
the AUL for public services. In large part, because he was, years ago, they had a

are, it may not make sense. But, it does make sense given that we do.
I asked Ann to discuss their public reference desk. She replied
Not anymore. We closed that down, about probably seventeen months ago. It
      

 

  ers, in terms of requests in

assistance has gone up, since we put it in a more visible location. A lot of it just
has to do with your floor plan. You know, what do people encounter, and what
do they expect to see where?
Ours beg for it. Yeah. Okay. That is that group. Then, head of discovery
services has another professional librarian whos involved with e-resources,
assessment of those things. Basically, just counting use, counts per use,
monitoring all that kind of stuff.
Then, a group of paraprofessionals that do everything from copying the
catalog and physical processing. I am trying to think what else. Doing entry of
content into the institutional repository, the actual work of doing that. Catalog
maintenance, all that kind of stuff.
In the current environment, under the collections person is acquisitions,
finance, and payment, kind of efforts. Again, those things are going to move over
to what was discovery services, and we are going to be more holistic tech
services. Inter-library loan, reports now, and will continue to report to the head of
collections and resource sharing.
Then, let me think. I am just mentally moving through the building. Who
am I forgetting? Anybody? I think that is it. There is a professional librarian in

Hefner-Babb 175
charge of archives, special collections. Currently she reports to the AUL or the

Who is having trouble meeting their goals and deadlines in the promotion and

emphasis is on the supervisors. She remarked:

I asked Anne how she evaluates productivity in her library. She replied at length
about making data driven decisions:
I saw something, I think this was yesterday, actually, I was looking at some
documents that the Association of Research Libraries has out there, and there is a
program that they offer, apparently a continuing education program. The sort of
catch word of the thing is manage what you can measure. We are very much a
data driven organization, and we make decisions based on data not on feeling.

But, in terms of determining what we are able to accomplish, we rely very heavily
on those kinds of measures.
I asked if she could provide an example for those who may be unfamiliar with
academic libraries. She referenced the recent Quality Enhancement Plan (QEP) saying:
Yeah. Probably, the very best example that I can give you, Trinity chose
information literacy as its QEP, the one that began in 2008. And, finished in 2013.
The library certainly did the work and background. We had some teaching faculty
be the front people on it, so that it did not look like it was solely a library. Project.
We did all the assessment on that. We ended up with really remarkable results
from that effort. Huge changes not only in the sophistication and quality of

Hefner-Babb 178
student work, both at the first year level, what they use to do and what they do
now.
More impressively at the senior level. We also, saw that the number of
faculty that were willing to engage with, and use the library as a resource of
people, guidance, and content in their teaching, changed over that time. For the
better, and a number of them said they would continue to operate that way, and
use what they learned through that process in their other courses. Rather than just

then. The first thing is, it really impressed upon me that I work first in higher

perspective from librarian to higher education. That has been very helpful to me,
ever since. I see us as integral part of a living breathing organism, and we are here
to support it. But, our alignment is with our institution, and where we fit that way,
first. I think that has been really helpful.

Chapter XV
Narrative Analysis
The purpose of this mixed method study was to examine the relationship between
leadership behaviors of library administrators and the expectations of the librarians they
supervise framed within the Ohio State Two Factor Theory and the Theory of Role
Differentiation and Group Achievement. In order to investigate this phenomenon, the
researcher first conducted a survey of academic librarians and administrators and then
interviewed ten academic library administrators who participated in the surveys. Analysis
is organized by research question. In Chapter XV the researcher presents a collective
analysis of the narratives of academic library administrators, presented in Chapters V
through XIV.
For the purpose of the qualitative study, academic library administrators were
considered leaders if they met the following criteria: (a) academic library administrator
with five years or more experience in administration; (b) library administrator with a
Masters in Library Science or the equivalent; and (c) academic library administrator at a
four-year degree granting institution in Texas. This study documents the leadership
practices of each of these experienced library leaders.
Research Question Three: Input Behaviors
Research Question Three investigated input behaviors demonstrated by academic
library administrators in their leadership roles. These input behaviors were: assessing and
rewarding performance, interaction and making expectations known to librarians they
supervise. The emerging themes from respondents included: formal evaluation processes,
reward systems, communication practices, meetings, and planning.

Hefner-Babb 185
Formal evaluation processes. All ten of the library administrators indicated use
of formal evaluation procedures to assess the librarians they supervised. The formal
promotion documents included establishment of personal goals which are used during the
evaluation process to determine evaluation scores. In some libraries, these goals were tied
to strategic planning documents for the library as a whole. Jacob indicated that his
evaluation process included a formal assessment tool for librarians who teach information
literacy sessions and examination of how collection development specialists spent their
budgets and communicated with their liaison departments. Deb indicated that their

In addition to personal goals some libraries also required scholarship and service
as part of the evaluation process. Anne commented on how their tenure and promotion
document was used to evaluate librarians. She stated the following:
It lets us really try to evaluate on the basis of strong librarianship. That however,
is mostly individual behavior. The piece that is sort of outside is the management
piece. Anybody who is supervising other people, and basically I am watching all
the time to see whether people are effective managers of the people working
under them feeling informed. Do they seem to be productive? Are they engaged?
All those kinds of things.
Anne finished stating that the way the system works is there is an annual evaluation
process that occurs in the early winter.
Rewards systems. Eight of the library administrators interviewed described a

hearing other points of view and can be talked into thinking about something

Acceptance of change. Deb, John, Jacob, and Kathy stressed how administrators
need to accept change when integrating their library organization. Deb stated that unlike
when she started in the library profession 30 years ago the ability to cope with change
might indicate a need to charge careers because:

Summary, Conclusions, Implications, and Recommendations
The purpose of this mixed method study was to examine the relationship between
leadership behaviors of library administrators and the expectations of the librarians they
supervise framed within the Ohio State Two Factor Theory and the Theory of Role
Differentiation and Group Achievement. In this chapter, the researcher provides a
summary of the study which includes an overview of the problem, the purpose statement,
research questions, review of the study design, and a summary of the major findings of
the study. The research presents findings reported in chapters IV and XV, discusses
implications for practice, makes recommendation for further studies, and provides
concluding remarks.
Summary of the Study
The summary of the study begins with the overview of the problem. It is followed
by the purpose statement and the research questions. The next section includes a review
of the study design including the sample, data collection and data analysis techniques. A
summary of the major findings concludes the summary section.
Overview of the problem. The specific problem is that some academic library
leaders are career librarians either hired or promoted into administrative level positions
and they are not meeting the expectations of the librarians who work with them
(Cawthorne, 2010; Dewey, 2012). The current leaders in the library profession are
reaching retirement age and it is contributing to an increasing dearth of leaders who are
qualified to take their place (Brundy, 2014; Edge & Green, 2011; Rooney, 2010).
Libraries continue to experience constant change and there is a need for people to lead

Hefner-Babb 204
during this time of transition (DÃ¼ren, 2012; Farrell, 2015; Hayati & Barahmand, 2012;
Jantz, 2012; Miller, 2012).
There is a call amongst those in the profession both here in the United States and
internationally, for a set of leadership competencies to help prepare librarians for
leadership roles (DÃ¼ren, 2012; Hernon & Rossiter, 2007; Hernon, et al., 2003; Hernon, et
al., 2002; Hernon, et al., 2001; Winston & Williams, 2003). A number of studies have
been undertaken to try and determine a set of competencies but to date no such
recommendation exists (al Ansari & al Khadher, 2011; Ammons-Stevens et al., 2009;
Jantii & Greenhalgh, 2012). The American Library Association began this process in
2006 but the result was the ALA Core Competences of Librarianship which only
mentioned transformational leadership (Hicks & Given, 2013). This study seeks to
narrow down competencies that will aid future leaders in the field by examining the
leadership behaviors of library administrators.
Purpose statement and research questions. The purpose of this mixed method
study was to examine the relationship between leadership behaviors of library
administrators and the expectations of the librarians they supervise framed within the
Ohio State Two Factor Theory and the Theory of Role Differentiation and Group
Achievement. The overarching question of the study was: What is the relationship
between the real leadership behaviors of Texas academic library administrators and the
ideal leadership expectations of the librarians they supervise? The following quantitative
questions guided the study:
1. What is the relationship between library administrators actual and ideal
consideration leadership behaviors preferred by academic librarians in Texas?

Hefner-Babb 205
2. What is the relationship between library administrators actual and real
initiating structure practices preferred by academic librarians in Texas?
The following qualitative questions guided the study:
3. Describe what and how input behaviors are practiced by the library
administrator in their current position.
4. What group structure and operations control are practiced by the library
administrator?
5. How does the library administrator influence group achievement?
Review of the study design. This convergent parallel mixed method design study
employed both qualitative and quantitative data to determine leadership behaviors of
academic library administrators. When convergent parallel mixed methods design is used
qualitative and quantitative data are collected at the same time, analyzed separately, and
then merged (Creswell & Clark, 2011). According to Creswell (2012) a researcher can
use qualitative or quantitative research design to reinforce the other design and to obtain
    

 

        

In this study the quantitative analysis supports the qualitative research using the
process of integration through connecting. The researcher collected the quantitative
survey data first and followed up with the qualitative interviews to interpret the
quantitative results (Creswell, 2012). Themes in the
Population and data collection. This convergent parallel mixed methods design
study included responses from administrators (n=18) and librarians (n=52) from (N=18)
four-year degree granting institutions in Texas. Administrators completed LBDQ-XII-RS surveys and librarians completed the LBDQ-XII-R-I survey via SurveyMonkeyÂ®. To

Hefner-Babb 206
protect the identity of the participants each library was assigned a number and
administrators and librarians were coded with either a 1 or 2. The data from the surveys is
saved on a password protected computer.
The qualitative phase of the study incorporated the use of phenomenological
narrative analysis and involved contacting ten library administrators from the 18
participating libraries for interviews. Ultimately the researcher conducted ten interviews,
nine via phone and one in person, with administrators who had responded to the survey
and also had librarians who participated. The interviews used a guided protocol and the
narratives were coded for common themes. Once the interviews were transcribed copies
of the transcript were sent to the interviewee for member checking. Narratives and the
recordings are saved on a password protected computer.
Data analysis. The data from the librarians and administrators was uploaded into
Statistical Package for Social SciencesÂ® (SPSS) ver. 22 and used to conduct the
statistical analysis and calculations for this study. Nonparametric statistical analysis,
specifically Spearman correlations were used to test the relationships between the
librarian and administrator responses to the Consideration and Initiation of Structure
subscales. According to Salkind (2011) the reason to use nonparametric tests is because
the data is categorical or ordinal and ranked; in the case of this study the data is ranked.
The Spearman rank correlation coefficient was chosen for this study to test the
first two research questions. Creswell indicates that the degree of association ranges
between -       

         

   

Salkind (2011) defined the correlation coefficients as follows: .8 to 1.0 indicates a very
strong relationship, .6 to .8 indicates a strong relationship, .4 to .6 indicates a moderate

Hefner-Babb 207
relationship, .2 to .4 indicates a weak relationship and 0 to .2 indicates a very weak to no
relationship.
Summary of Major Findings
For this study the researcher investigated five research questions related to
academic library leadership behaviors. The first two questions examine the real (self)
leadership behaviors of library administrators in consideration and initiation of structure
and the ideal behaviors desired by the librarians who work with them. The remaining
three questions are based on the Ohio State Two Factor Theory and the Theory of Role
Differentiation and Group Achievement. The major findings from this study are
organized by research question.
Research question one. Research question one examined the relationship
between library administrators actual and ideal consideration leadership behaviors
preferred by academic librarians in Texas. A Spearman correlation was computed to test
the relationship between the actual consideration leadership behaviors of library
administrators (n=18, M=41.05, SD=3.33) and the ideal behaviors preferred by academic
librarians (n=18, M=39.74, SD=3.40). Analysis revealed that there was a weak, positive
correlation that was not statistically significant between the administrators real behaviors
and the ideal behaviors sought by the librarians, rs(18)=.277, p=.265. This suggests there

Research question three. Research question three sought descriptions of what
and how input behaviors are practiced by the library administrator in their current
position.


All of the administrators interviewed indicated using formal evaluation
processes to assess librarians they supervised.



Eight of the leaders indicated the use of merit to formally reward librarians
while others discussed staff awards and other forms of informal
recognition.



Library administrators reported email as their main form of interaction and
also stated the importance of open door policies and leaving the directors
office to talk with their librarians.



Another common theme among the administrators was the use of
meetings, both formal and informal, to meet with their librarians and
communicate their expectations.

Hefner-Babb 209
The final theme under input behaviors was the reliance on strategic
planning to reinforce expectations and performance evaluations.
Research question four. Research question four explored the group structure and
operations control practiced by the library administrator.
All ten libraries had traditional organizational structures with only one
operating without an assistant or associate director.
Assessment was used in nine of the ten libraries to aid in organizational
control and the evaluation of expectations for the entire library
organization.
All ten administrators used meetings to further communication with staff
and organizational control.
Research question five. Research question five surveyed group achievement as
assessed by the library administrator.
Every administrator indicated the use of assessment practices to examine
productivity in their organization.
Many of the administrators responded that they used observation to gauge
morale within their organizations.
Administrators indicated communication as a way to both assess morale
and to integrate their organizations.
Some administrators stressed the need to lead by setting a good example.
The final aspect of group achievement is the negative impact of barriers on
both morale and integrating the library organization.

Hefner-Babb 210
Merged results. This study used a convergent parallel design in which the
quantitative data was collected before conducting the qualitative interviews.
The themes in the interviews corroborated with the themes found in the
literature. Examples include the problems associated with change and
barriers, the need to have a vision and to plan strategically for the future,
and the importance of communication.
Similarly the interview themes connected with the concepts found in the
consideration subscale including: doing little things to make it pleasant to
be a member of the group, treating group members as his/her equals, being
friendly and approachable, and looking out for the welfare of group
members.
Interview themes found in the initiation of structure subscale were: letting
group members know what is expected of them, making attitudes clear to
the group, assigning tasks, willingness to make changes, maintaining
standards of performance and use of rules and regulations.
The demographics of this study reflect the current situation in librarianship
in that the majority of the administrators were aged 61 and older while the
librarians who participated were between 30 and 50 years of age.
Conclusions
The primary conclusion drawn from this study is that there appears to be
disconnect between the reported real behaviors of library administrators and the ideal
behaviors desired by the librarians who work with them. The apparent source of this lack
of connection seems to be rooted in communication behaviors. Many of the problems

Hefner-Babb 211
administrators faced dealt with resistance to change, finding ways to communicate their
expectations to librarians, and establishing a shared vision combined with strategic
planning. The final communication problem administrators faced is the need to turn their
focus outward and looking at library as a functional part of the university.
The population for this study is small and is only representative of librarians in
Texas however the results from the interviews with the library directors are reflective of
the current themes in library literature. The purpose of this study was to frame it within
     

Theory of Role Differentiation and

Group Achievement. The themes from the interviews reflected the topics examined in the
survey questions related to consideration and initiation of structure. Thus concluding that
the topics in the surveys are areas where library administrators are currently struggling as
leaders within their organizations.

the two groups, it is possible to conclude that there was not much difference between the
actual and preferred behaviors. Likewise, the means for initiating structure are lower than
the means for consideration which means that the consideration behaviors are preferred
over initiation of structure. One can also conclude that librarians appear to prefer a
balance of consideration and initiation of structure whereas the administrators place more
emphasis on initiation of structure. The findings in this study indicate a very weak
correlation between the real actions of the library administrators and the ideal actions
desired by librarians in both subscales. Correlation scores are slightly stronger in the area

Hefner-Babb 212
of consideration versus initiation of structure; two areas that determine the effectiveness
of a leader (Taylor, Crook & Dropkin, 1961).
Consideration. The consideration subscale of the Ohio State Two Factor Theory
includes interpersonal behaviors and the implementation of change. Results of the survey
indicate that it is the preferred behavioral dimension but the correlation is very weak.
Library directors indicate in the interviews that they use communication via email, in
person, and remain visible to their library staffs. The results would seem to indicate that
librarians are not satisfied with the mode of communication that is currently in use.
Communication skills contribute to the success achieved by a leader (Duren, 2012;
Farrell, 2013b; Jange, 2012). Research by Cawthorne (2010) agree with the findings here
that librarians are not satisfied with the level of communication within the organization.
Farrell (2013b) stressed that any information communicated within an organization needs
to be communicated clearly and often.
The second concept of consideration is accepting change. One area that leaders
mentioned that is focused on in the research is a resistance to change and this is a
problem for administrators and librarians alike. Librarians and staff need to be able to
adapt to change in libraries at a faster rate than before (Jantz, 2012; Michalak, 2012;
Miller, 2012). Library directors indicate the need for change and problems due to barriers
from middle management but based upon the findings it appears the problem is also in
the administrative levels however it could also be as Jantz (2012) states that there is not a
process for an administrator to follow.
Initiation of structure. The subscale of initiation of structure is focused on
achieving the goals of the group and based upon setting expectations, procedures and

Hefner-Babb 213
designating tasks among the group. Librarian dissatisfaction with this area could be
traced to inability to contribute ideas that will be implemented. Rogers (2009)
recommended that library leaders encourage contribution of ideas from their librarians.
Jantz (2012) reported findings about librarians failing to take initiative when asked to
contribute ideas because under the existing system ideas came from the top of the
organization and led to a fear of failure.
Input behaviors. Input behaviors include leadership behaviors reward systems,
modes of communication, and presenting expectations to those a leader supervises.
Leaders in academic university settings are somewhat limited by official guidelines for
rewarding employees. Most of the library directors indicated formal merit systems to
provide raises. Others created staff awards or used professional development
opportunities to reward librarians. Research by Jantz (2012) mentions the use of
rewarding librarians who offer innovative ideas by setting aside funds in the budget for
special projects.
The subject of communication is mentioned in the literature and is a common
theme among the results of this study (Grgic & Zivkovic, 2012). Interpersonal
effectiveness is rooted in communication, motivation, and a positive work environment
(Ammons-Stephens, et al., 2009, Jordan 2012). Various styles of communication are
reportedly used by the library directors including emails, phone, walkabouts, meetings
and notes but still it appears that librarians are not satisfied with the current
communication practices. The library administrators indicate open door policy for their
offices and frequent meetings with librarians both formal and informal. Graybill (2014)
found that the key to the millennial generation is communication and personal

Hefner-Babb 214
connection. Murray (2011) indicates one need of the millennial generation is immediate
feedback and this is one area where library administrators may be faltering because they
rely on the annual reviews or a quarterly individual meeting as the time to give feedback.
However, most report acknowledging accomplishments if they are informed about them.
Vision. Hernon and Schwartz (2011) indicated a need for a leader who can create
a vision, get others to buy into it and implement the vision. This statement was echoed
during the study as a key to successful organizational leadership which corroborates the
findings of the LLAMA study that found vision included ability to think globally,
creatively, innovatively and toward the future (Ammons-Stephens, et al., 2009). Library
administrators emphasized the need for the library director, indeed the whole library, to
look outward to the population they serve, that is the university. Dewey (2012) indicated

another area of emphasis stressed by some of those interviewed. Further transformational

Antonakis, 2012, p.5).
Group structure and operations control. This facet of the group achievement
theory focuses on communicating expectations. Studies indicate a preference among
millennials for collaboration, multitasking, and a desire to experiment and take risks
(Murray, 2011). Ameen (2006) indicated confusion between leadership skills and
management skills among librarians so practices like policy making, planning, and
organizing skills are not taught. Librarians appear to be expecting their library leaders to
know certain skills which they may or may not have in their backgrounds. Administrators

Hefner-Babb 215
indicated an overwhelming use of traditional library structure which relies on a tiered
system of communication and an assumption that the information is trickling down from
the director to the coordinators to the staff. The reliance upon email is also problematic.
Yes, it provides a record for reference, it is easy to use when people are busy but it relies
on the recipient to read it and interpret it. What is lost is the interaction between people,
the visual cues of understanding, and the dialogue that happens during a face to face
conversation. The tiered structure works in libraries where there are adequate staff in the
positions; a library director who is often occupied with external duties needs people in the
middle management positions with leadership abilities.
Influence group achievement. The final area of group achievement includes
morale, assessing performance, and integrating the organization. Administrators indicate
a heavy reliance on statistical reports, annual reports, and strategic plans to assess their
organization. Studies indicate that emphasis on these traditional forms of evaluation
impacts defining a vision for the library (Carpenter, 2013; Saunders, 2015). Emphasis on
strategic planning by administrators is met with resistance from librarians because they
feel removed from the process and that their opinions do not matter (Jantz, 2012).
However, administrators rely on strategic planning to meet the assessment requirements
of their university administrations and accreditation.
Change is happening so fast in the library profession that, as one library
administrator indicated,    

a problem for administrators and librarians alike. Administrators have to address change
affecting the library from the external factors like budgets and restructuring or internal

Hefner-Babb 216
problems like departmental silos, staff barriers, and low morale. The leader needs to be

able to support the decision when others make the statement.
Implications for Practice
Librarians and administrators who are among the current and future leaders of the
profession will benefit from this study. Based upon the findings of this study it appears
that the age gap between administrators and librarians is impacting the relationship
between the two groups (Graybill, 2014; Murray, 2011). Library administrators indicate
reliance upon email for communication and an open door policy however this does not

be hesitance among younger librarians to take advantage of an open door policy. Library
organizations are still reliant on the traditional hierarchical organizational structures and
in some cases legacy services which impact the productivity of an organization.
The first recommendation is for library organizations like the American Library
Association to revisit the concept of leadership competencies with a combined task force
of millennial librarians and current library leaders. The profession needs to determine a
definition of leader that is not confused with management and then work towards creating
a set of competencies that can be the basis of a library school course or a leadership
immersion program that is based upon the academic, public, special libraries tracks
(Mackenzie & Smith, 2009). This set of competencies should call upon input from
librarians around the world since the topic is truly one of international interest (Al Ansari
& Al Khadher, 2011; de Boer, Bothma & Olwagen, 2012; DÃ¼ren, 2012; Grgic &
Zivkovic, 2012; Jantti & Greenhalgh, 2012; Tanloet & Tuamsuk, 2011).

Hefner-Babb 217
Leadership competencies. One desired outcome of this study was a list of
suggested leadership competences for the profession. Despite the small population of the
study there are some competences mentioned in prior studies (Jordan, 2012; Al Ansari, &
Al Khadher, 2011; Ammons-Stephens, et al., 2009) that also are evident in this study.
Demonstrating leadership. This competency includes modeling behaviors you
want staff to emulate including communication, research, work habits and more (Jantti &
Greenhalgh, 2012; Jordan, 2012). Library leaders need to be seen as part of the library
staff and as an advocate for the library on campus both internally and externally (DÃ¼ren,
2012; Farrell, 2013b; Gwyer, 2010; Reyes, 2006). Further library leaders should lead by
example with interactions with library users, professional organizations and responding
to needs of library personnel (Farrell, 2013b).
Planning. Library leaders need to be aware of how to plan for library services,
budgets, and for the constant change occurring in the profession (Jordan, 2012). Strategic
planning and other forms of assessment are expected in the academic library setting
today. Administrators use planning to align library goals to university goals and some
align personal goals with the library strategic plan. A successful library leader is one who
sets goals and is able to get others within the organization to support those goals (Konya
& Gurel, 2014).
Risk taking. Library leaders need to be willing to take risks and to encourage their
library staff to do the same (Carpenter, 2012; Jordan, 2012). One should not be afraid to
try a new idea proposed by a fellow librarian who recently attended a conference. If the
idea is successful then it is a positive investment if the idea fails then use it as a learning
experience and explore what could be improved (DeBoer, et al., 2012).

Hefner-Babb 218
Delegation. A library leader is often busy representing the library to the
university administration and the community which cuts into the time they have leading
the library (Farrell, 2013b). Most Texas libraries have a director and an assistant director
who assists with public services and day to day library operations. As a leader the
director should be willing and able to delegate authority for projects, committee work,
and departmental supervision (Jordan, 2012).
Interpersonal skills. Interpersonal skills are a major component of being a leader
(Jordan, 2012). The leader should be able to communicate their expectations to all
members of the staff, the university administration, and the community (Cawthorne,
2010; Jange, 2012). Communication should be done using all potential methods: email,
phone and in person because reliance on one form of communication may not meet the
needs of all library staff.

   

    , feedback, and

personal connection more than prior generations (Graybill, 2014).
Communication skills. Leaders must have solid spoken and written
communication skills (Jordan, 2012). They should be comfortable speaking in meeting
settings and large groups settings. It is key that the leader be able to communicate the
needs of the library as part of the university (DÃ¼ren, 2012; Farrell, 2013b; Gwyer, 2010;
Reyes, 2006). Leaders should also be able to communicate information to other areas of
the library to allow librarians and staff to do their jobs more effectively (Cawthorne,
2010). Leadership comes from building relationships within the library and
communicating with library personnel (Brundy, 2014; Davis & Macauley, 2011; Harris,
2011).

Hefner-Babb 219
Flexibility. Leadership requires a person capable of seeing the need for change
and willing to undertake it (Carpenter, 2012). The library is not the brick and mortar
institution of forty years ago it is internet based and serving patrons in the physical
building but also virtually around the world. This facet requires a new style of library
leader who is willing to change with the times and the demands of library users (Hernon
& Schwartz, 2008; Phillips, 2014; Siriprasoetsin, et al., 2011; Tanloet & Tuamsuk, 2011).
Library leaders also need to be able to recognize talent within their organization that can
aid in the change process (Davis & Macauley, 2011; Heifetz, Grashow, & Linsky, 2009).
Vision. The library leader of today must have vision and the ability to make
others see and realize that vision (Farrell, 2013b, Gwyer, 2010; Hernon & Schwartz,
2011). Leaders need to be able to establish a vision for their library and be able to sell it
to those they supervise and to university administration (Farrell, 2013b). When
establishing vision for the library a leader should use the practice of framing to maintain
clarity and focus (Jantz, 2012; Macauley & Davis, 2011). Leaders need to encourage
innovation and the sharing of ideas as part of establishing vision for the library (Ammons
Stephens, et al., 2009).
Political understanding. The world of higher education includes a degree of
political understanding (Jordan, 2012). Library leaders desire monies and resources from
the same budgets that other educational departments wish to use. Leaders need to
understand the processes behind budgeting and also the laws and regulations that govern
state budgets and agencies (Farrell, 2013b).
Problem solving. As a leader and administrator problem solving will be an area of
constant challenge (Jordan, 2012). Administrative responsibilities including finding

Hefner-Babb 220
money in the budget to meet increasing expenses, coping with human resources issues,
and working to motivate supervisors and employees. Another aspect of problem solving
is to work to break down barriers between departments and to integrate and cross train
staff to be flexible and put the institution first (Carpenter, 2012; DÃ¼ren, 2012; Jantz,
2012; Miller, 2012).
Advocacy skills. Library leaders today need to have a strong set of advocacy skills
for use both within the library and outside when working with administration (Dewey,
2014; DÃ¼ren, 2012; Farrell, 2013b; Gwyer, 2010; Reyes, 2006). These advocacy skills
also will be beneficial in professional organizations that represent libraries and librarians.
Immersion Programs
Leadership immersion programs can be designed at the state and national levels
with varying degrees of focus. Based upon the research conducted in this study and its
focus on Texas librarians and administrators a future immersion program for library
leaders could have a variety of areas of emphasis. First, Texas library administrators need
information on how to cope with barriers to change within their organizations posed by
people, budget constraints, and university restructuring. A second area for focus is how to
   



and the library director as a university administrator. The third concept is for library
administrators at all levels to be visible, interactive, and more discriminative in their use
of email for communication.

Recommendations for Future Research



Hefner-Babb 221
Future research on the subject of leadership behaviors of academic library
administrators should be expanded to include a broader research focus. The population
for this current study should be expanded to include library administrators and librarians
from across the nation in order to obtain a clearer picture of leadership in the profession.
Academic library administrators participate in leadership roles and positions outside of
their libraries so research emphasis could be placed on leadership in the university and in
professional organizations. Another aspect for research is the merging of library
administration with university information technology departments and the impact it has
on leadership decisions in libraries and in information technology. Research might also
be conducted to see if the number of librarians versus administrators in an academic
library impacts which factor, consideration or initiation of structure, is stronger. How
does the changing organizational structure and management structure impact the
outcome?
The use of the Leadership Behavior Description Questionnaire (LBDQ) should be
modified in further research. In this study the researcher relied on a convenience sample
of administrators and librarians which resulted in a low participation rate for some
libraries. When the original studies were conducted by Halpin and Stogdill they used on
site surveying where all leaders and those they supervised participated; this might be an
option for a future study. Another aspect should be conducting interviews with librarians
based upon the group achievement theory to help explain the weak correlation. A final
approach would be to look at the averages for Consideration and Initiation of Structure to
determine which leadership behavior is more important to librarians and to
administrators.

Hefner-Babb 222
Concluding Remarks
Numerous studies have been published about the leadership behaviors of
academic librarians and the need to identify leadership competences for the profession.
The findings of this study corroborate those in prior studies of leadership in libraries.
Despite the small convenience sample in this study it is clear that there is little or no
correlation between the actions of the administrators and those desired by the librarians in
the areas of consideration or initiation of structure. Of the two subscales the
administrators are scored higher on the consideration scales.
The three areas related to the Group Achievement Theory indicated the need for a
flexible leader with a certain skillset. Input behavior findings indicate a reliance on email
for communication and a strong need for a leader who is able to share their vision and get
buy in from those who work for them. Group structure and operations control results
focus on communication throughout the library organization and a designated skill set
that includes policy making, risk taking, and ability to establish and share expectations.
The final area of the theory centers on influencing group achievement and addressing
problems related to morale, assessing group performance and breaking down barriers to
integrate the organization. Recommended actions for the profession at the state and
national levels is to re-examine the library school curriculums and include leadership
practices within the core classes. The profession should examine the studies on leadership
competencies and compile a recommended list to guide future leaders in the profession.

Dear Participant:
As a doctoral candidate at Lamar University, I am conducting a study for my dissertation to
examine leadership behaviors of academic library administrators in four year degree granting
institutions. The purpose of this mixed methods study is to examine the relationship between
leadership behaviors of library administrators and the expectations of librarians who work for
them framed within the Ohio State Two Factor Theory and the Theory of Role Differentiations
and Group Activity. I will be examining the real leadership behaviors of library administrators
and the ideal behaviors expected by librarians they supervise. The results should be of interest
and value to librarians interested in leadership, library schools, and future library leaders who
want to determine what skills they need to be an effective leader.
Approximately 300 people will be invited to participate in this study. Criteria for participation
include the following: a library administrator with at least one year of experience as an
administrator at their current library or librarian at a four year degree granting institution in an
academic li                  
degree in Library Science or an equivalent.
During the first week in November 2015, you will receive an e-mail containing a link to the
survey. You will be requested to complete the on-line survey, which should take no more than
approximately 20 minutes of your very valuable time. The web-based survey will be available for
two weeks. Your responses will be completely anonymous, and no individual names or
institutions will be recorded during the course of this survey. Your name will not be associated
with any research findings. The data will be stored electronically in a secure place.
This study has been approved by the Lamar University Institutional Review Board. You are free
to decide not to participate in this study or to withdraw at any time without adversely affecting
your relationship with the investigator or Lamar University. There is no compensation for
participating, however, on completion of this study, I will share a summary of the findings with
you. Your input is extremely valuable for the preparation of academic library leaders in Texas. If
you have any questions regarding the study, please contact the Principal Researcher or the
