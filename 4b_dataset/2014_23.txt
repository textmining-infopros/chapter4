Abstract
Academic libraries are key contributors to the instructional and research missions
of their parent institutions, but often struggle to demonstrate specifically what they do
and how that affects institutional outcomes. High-impact educational practices are one
area where libraries make a difference, but where explicit connections between activities
and outcomes are not always articulated. Faculty and graduate student research is another
area where libraries’ contribution makes logical sense, but specific relationships are not
necessarily drawn. Libraries may place different emphasis on these two areas, effectively
choosing different business strategies, to support their institutions’ missions. Two
national surveys collect data about library expenditures, staffing, services, and use of
resources. This study aims to explore the extent to which a library’s business strategy
might be visible through patterns in these national data sets. What can the data we already
have tell us about differences between libraries and how those differences affect library
services and use? To what extent can library use data predict an institution’s external
research dollars? By using a variety of statistical techniques, including structural equation
modeling, MANCOVA, and multiple regression, the researcher explores these questions.
The study also explores ways in which current data falls short in being able to connect
library activities with high-impact educational practices and faculty and graduate research
productivity, and proposes new ideas for measuring library activities such that they could
be connected more clearly with institutional outcomes.

Chapter 1: Purpose
People generally like libraries. Universities often include library buildings on
brochures to convey an image of scholarship, although this may mean glass and steel at
one school and ivy-covered stone at another. These days, it is common for university
faculty to involve librarians in their teaching and research. But library patrons and
university administrators are generally unclear about what libraries actually do to provide
their services and collections, and whether they will continue to be relevant.
What libraries do has changed dramatically in the past 20 years. The creation of
the internet meant information would increasingly be shared online. The advent of the
World Wide Web—the graphical interface to the internet—meant that searching and
finding online information became activities the general population felt they should be
able to perform. Users’ expectations related to accessing information online skyrocketed.
Meanwhile, the information marketplace underwent a series of dramatic changes, most
notably with efforts to protect intellectual property and ensure profitability. Libraries
have navigated a series of dramatic swings in assumptions and implications. The idea that
“all information will be free online” was swiftly quashed by publishers enforcing digital
protections and by challenges with digitizing historical information. The idea that library
patrons would be able to easily find information themselves, with no library instruction,
seemed plausible until the patron moved past needing “any ten journal articles” to
needing specialized information sources like psychological measurement instruments,
historical financial data, or Congressional hearings. The list of changes goes on,
illustrating that libraries face ongoing challenges when trying to understand just what it is

2
that they are doing and how to explain their service and collections models to
stakeholders.
The Association of American Colleges & Universities and others have recently
identified a number of “high-impact practices” in higher education (National Leadership
Council for Liberal Education & America’s Promise, 2007; Kuh, 2008). First-year
seminars, learning communities, service learning, undergraduate research, and capstone
experiences have been found valuable for students and their institutions, increasing
persistence, academic performance, critical thinking, and engagement (Brownell &
Swaner, 2009). In 2013, a survey of business and non-profit leaders by the National
Leadership Council for Liberal Education & America’s Promise (LEAP) found that 93%
of employers said “a demonstrated capacity to think critically, communicate clearly, and
solve complex problems is more important than [a candidate’s] undergraduate major”
(LEAP, 2013, p. 1). Furthermore, employers endorsed several college activities as key to
workplace success, including conducting research and using evidence-based analysis.
What is the library’s relationship to these high-impact practices? Riehle and
Weiner (2013) found that information literacy is often included in discussions of highimpact practices in educational literature, but often not by that name. Librarians know
they play an important role in first-year seminars, learning communities, research
methods, and capstone courses. Some of their activities show up quantitatively in counts
of library presentations to groups, but many other activities go uncounted or unconnected.
The current work to revise the Association of College and Research Libraries’
Information Literacy Framework represents an exciting new opportunity to articulate the
specific ways in which libraries may contribute to high-impact educational practices, but

3
additional effort will be required to assess how the new framework connects to outcomes
(ACRL, 2014).
Additionally, libraries' contributions to high-impact practices go beyond
information literacy instruction. The learning commons environments libraries develop in
their buildings provide spaces for students and faculty to think, communicate, and
collaborate in an academic setting. These activities may be one driver of library building
“gate counts.” In some libraries, professional staff provide educational technology
support, working with faculty to make better pedagogical use of online course
management systems, new media, and classroom technologies. Libraries are highly
relevant to this area of high-impact practices and employer-endorsed skills, but the
connections may not be obvious to others.
Libraries need to demonstrate how activities they are already doing connect with
student learning outcomes (e.g., Dahlen & Baker, 2014). To do so, they may need to rethink how they measure their services and activities or how to re-interpret existing
metrics. ACRL has received a collaborative planning grant from the Institute of Museum
and Library services to explore how to demonstrate the value of academic libraries, and
the project team is currently focused on how library factors affect high-impact practices
(Malenfant & Brown, 2014).
Libraries also contribute to the university’s mission through the licensing,
acquisition, and provision of electronic and print materials necessary for faculty and
student research. For the humanities, this has historically meant collecting monographs,
primary sources, and special collections. For the sciences, electronic journals have
become pre-eminent. For business and social sciences, a variety of source types are

4
important. People know libraries offer such collections. But it is unclear just what work is
required to provide them in our modern information marketplace.
Before brainstorming a list of new measures, it is important to learn what some of
the current data about libraries can tell us. Historically, U.S. academic libraries have
measured and reported three common “outputs” to provide benchmarks of their work:
circulation, full-text articles, and gate count (building use). Looking at just doctoral
institutions in 2012, there are large differences on these metrics across libraries. For the
bottom 25% of doctoral institutions, 4 or fewer books circulated, 52 or fewer full-text
articles were requested, and there were 1 or fewer library building visits per full-time
student and faculty member.1 Meanwhile, the top 25% of doctoral schools saw more than
114 full-text articles requested, 10 books circulated, and 2 or more library building visits
per full-time student and faculty member. What could be the reasons for these
differences? If comparing baccalaureate schools to doctoral universities, these differences
might not be surprising—but doctoral schools have comparatively similar missions.
While counts of circulation, full-text articles, and gate count are not measures of highimpact educational practices or faculty research support, perhaps they begin to tell a story
about how much the library is used. They may also be useful as indicators of the success
of library business strategy.
One possible reason for the disparity between libraries may be found in
differences among libraries’ service offerings—the ones which do relate to high-impact
practices and research support. Academic libraries do not merely provide information
passively. Professional librarians market resources to students and faculty, instruct them

study (N=169).

5
in their use, answer reference questions, and partner with them in research. Libraries have
also been changing their building programs to promote higher levels of student
engagement, which could result in increased library use. Social media provides new
channels for librarians to connect with their user communities. Most libraries offer
interlibrary loan services, but some go further than others. With extra investment,
libraries have set up systems that fulfil requests in the evening and on weekends, and
provide article delivery services so patrons can get digital copies of print journal articles.
Libraries may also invest proportionally more in ongoing resource expenditures (e.g.,
databases and journals) or in one-time expenditures (e.g., monographs and videos). These
are just some of the ways libraries make different choices that can affect use.
Exploration of hypotheses in this area is just beginning, meaning that as libraries
allocate their budgets, the proportions spent on services, collections, and the building are
largely dictated by historical practices, anecdotal evidence, and use statistics of specific
services, collections, and buildings. Librarians may see increases in use of disciplinary
materials after relevant library instruction classes and logically, spending more on library
materials would result in higher use, but there are few holistic examinations investigating
how library services and expenditures might influence library use.
This research aims to explore patterns in U. S. academic libraries’ data to learn
the extent to which various library services and expenditures affect collection and service
use when controlling for size of institution. Relationships between library variables and
external research dollars will also be investigated. Because little research of this kind has
been conducted, this study will necessarily be exploratory, but will provide information
about the relative strength of relationships.

6
In an age where so much information is discoverable with Google, it might be
easy for a university administrator to question the need for library services. He or she
may not see a connection between library activities and high-impact practices, or library
activities and external research dollars. Why are so many staff resources allocated to
answer reference questions, teach library instruction classes, and support faculty? Is all
the hubbub surrounding “information commons” in the library buildings (Lippincott,
2010; Turner, Welch, & Reynolds, 2013) just hype, or does it result in increased library
use? Wouldn’t it be better for the library to spend these funds on more full-text journals?
Furthermore, to what extent does money spent on librarians and library staff even affect
engagement with library services? As technology provides methods for people to connect
asynchronously and more efficiently, couldn’t a smaller number of librarians and support
staff handle the library’s service programs? As library deans converse with college
administrators, they need better answers to such questions.
At the highest levels, this study is situated with in strategic management theory,
specifically, business strategy. In the private sector, business strategy is defined as “how
the firm competes within a particular industry or market,” or competitive strategy (Grant,
2010, p. 19). In the public sector, business strategy may usefully be thought of as how an
organization or unit aligns itself with its parent organization’s strategic plan. Grant
describes the task of business strategy as “how the firm will deploy its resources within
its environment and so satisfy its long term goals, and how to organize itself to
implement that strategy” (2010, p. 12). For libraries, a strategy may be visible through
patterns in how the money coming in supports the collections and services that support

7
the institutional mission and strategic plan in a way that leverages library-specific
capabilities.
Individual concepts within strategic management have been applied in academic
libraries, such as SWOT analyses (Atkinson, 2003; Johnson, 1994), and Balanced
Scorecard (Mengel & Lewis, 2012; Taylor & Heath, 2012). The overall concept of
business strategy as the private sector knows it has not generally been applied to libraries,
but recent library conference presentations have begun urging libraries to consider
institutional priorities and higher education trends more deliberately, and provide
evidence showing how libraries are aligned with university strategy (Gilchrist, 2014).
Academic libraries may lack interest in business strategy theory because of its
emphasis on competition, shareholders, and profit. Although libraries have conceived of
themselves as “competing” for users’ attention in the information marketplace (Bell,
2014), and as competitors for institutional resources, they do not conceive of themselves
as competing with one another. However, it could be useful for libraries to compare
themselves to one another to learn which strategies are working well. They could also
think about needing to compete with and differentiate themselves from other units on
campus. Similarly, while “shareholder interests and profit” are not directly relevant to
academic libraries, these concepts can potentially be modified to “stakeholder interests”
(the interests of library customers, campus peer groups, and senior administration) and to
the outputs and outcomes specified in the library’s mission.
In the context of competing for users’ attention in the information marketplace,
theories related to resource-based strategy are relevant for academic libraries. The
resource-based view moves beyond traditional strategy analysis, which focused on the

8
organization’s identity and purpose, and emphasizes how a firm’s distinctive resources
and capabilities enable it to fit the environment’s challenges. Peteraf (1993) reviewed
theory development research in the 80’s and 90’s, and proposed a general model
describing the theoretical conditions that supply resource-based competitive advantage
which I have interpreted here in the context of academic libraries. For this discussion,
“full-text articles” is used as an example of a resource libraries offer. Not only was fulltext articles one of the dependent variables in the present study, their use is a major
component of the return on investment for libraries. Full-text journals compose a very
large proportion of academic libraries’ ongoing expenditures, and are valuable to library
stakeholders (faculty and students). While full-text articles can cost $20-30 per use for
the public, library license agreements and bulk purchasing make each full-text article use
cost just $1-2, demonstrating the savings accrued to library users.
The first theoretical condition that supplies resource-based competitive advantage
is that heterogeneous resources and capabilities provide the ability to exploit differences.
Thus, the goal is to develop superior resources and capabilities to others in the
marketplace. Peteraf notes that “resources” may include knowledge-based competencies
that involve collective learning (e.g., Pralahad & Hamel, 1990). Thus, libraries’ expertise
in information organization and research skills provide them with superior capabilities for
helping students and faculty find relevant full-text articles than do public search engines.
By way of contrast, public search engines have higher visibility and simpler user
interfaces, which are useful for many other kinds of searching.
A second theoretical condition is limits to ex post competition, including
“imperfect imitability” and “imperfect substitutability.” (Peteraf, 1993, p. 182). This

9
condition exists because of a monopoly-like condition, such as libraries’ monopoly on
“free” access to electronic resources because of the licensing work that they do on behalf
of the institution. An entrepreneurial student could not simply set up a competing
academic library, because it would be extremely difficult for her to negotiate any
agreements with publishers. It would be more possible, but still challenging, for another
unit on campus to imitate the library’s information literacy instruction program. Barney’s
(1991) description of social complexity seems to fit libraries and provide an explanation
for why even a big player like Google may not be able to compete with academic
libraries: “Several firms may possess the same physical technology, but only one of these
firms may possess the social relations, culture, traditions, etc. to fully exploit this
technology in implementing strategies” (p. 110).
A third condition for resource-based competitive advantage is limited resource
mobility: valuable resources and capabilities remain with the firm. Although traditional
library services that support access to full-text articles have a lot of inertia, newer areas in
library organizations like support for online learning are less “attached” to the library per
se.
A final condition for resource-based competitive advantage is ex ante limits to
competition: the costs of implementing strategy do not exceed the profits. For libraries,
rising costs of journal subscriptions threaten competitive advantage in this area, although
so far the publishers value the library market enough that they cannot push things too far.
Peteraf notes that the resource-based strategy can be applied by administrators wishing to
determine which of the organization’s resources and capabilities are stronger contributors

10
to competitive advantage than others. The resource-based view provides a broad
perspective of how an academic library’s allocation of resources relates to library use.
Although libraries may not have thought of themselves as “competing” on
campus or aligning their resources to execute a strategy, observing the decisions they
have made in allocating their budgets and staff time are one way to explore their strategy.
The present study seeks to look for patterns in how libraries have invested in staffing,
how that investment supports library services, and the extent to which various library
services contribute to library use.
Although this research does not directly examine how library use affects an
institution’s research outcomes or student learning outcomes, it increases libraries’ ability
to be able to do so in the future. The findings of this research suggest new data that
should be gathered in order for libraries to connect inputs not only with library outputs,
but to better connect library use with meaningful indicators of research outcomes and
student learning outcomes. While some of the metrics libraries currently gather may
provide some indication of the library’s role, they may not provide evidence for the
logical connections library leaders need to make between the work libraries do and the
high-impact practices and research productivity metrics that are now a major focus of
higher education. However, libraries should first take stock of what they can already
learn from the vast amount of information they have been gathering over the years.

11
Chapter 2: Literature Review
While not usually situating their studies within strategic management theories,
libraries have taken a variety of approaches to explaining “what libraries do” based on
use data. Many have focused on their own institutions, offering “how we did it” case
studies to inform other practitioners. Several studies have demonstrated methods for
correlating cost data with use data to inform specific purchasing decisions or demonstrate
single-institution effectiveness (e.g., Killick, 2012; Zappen, 2010). Others have studied
use of electronic resources to determine curricular relevance of the library’s collections
(e.g., Kennedy, 2006; Miller, 2012). Likewise, librarians have studied the effectiveness of
instruction (e.g., Bluemle, Makula, & Rogal, 2013; Hsieh & Holden, 2010) and reference
services (e.g., Mu, Dimitroff, Jordan, & Burclaff, 2011) at their institutions. These studies
are all examples of what composes the majority of library literature: case studies focusing
on a single aspect of library services.
Other scholars have focused their eyes on the forest rather than the trees.
Especially in recent years, there has been an increase in research examining the influence
of library data on institutional outputs such as student enrollment, retention, and
graduation rates (e.g., Hinchliffe, Oakleaf, & Malenfant, 2012; Schwieder & Hinchliffe,
2012; Soria, Fransen, & Nackerud, 2013; Stemmer & Mahan, 2012). This trend began in
response to the shift in higher education to a focus on outcomes-based assessment. Such
research is important for learning how to connect library outputs with institutional
outputs. However, libraries still need to understand what happens within their own
organizations to produce the library outputs.

12
Somewhere between the forest and the trees, another body of research has
attempted to study libraries across institutions—and not just one aspect of library
services, but libraries as complex organizations. This level of focus offers more
generalizability than the case study research, but perhaps more practical, specific
implications than the current research connecting library outputs with institutional
outputs. It is within this body of research that the present work is situated.
Some of the more notable studies in this category are reviewed here in reverse
chronological order. Regazzi (2012) analyzed U.S. academic library spending, staffing,
and utilization trends from 1998 to 2008, and concluded that despite a feeling of
constraint, libraries are actually receiving increases in resources over time. He also found
that use of physical library assets has declined. His findings varied by type, size, and
Carnegie class of institution, which suggests these institutional variables should be
explored when investigating similar research questions.
Hunter and Perret (2011) correlated ACRL data with LibQUAL+ scores across 73
universities to examine bivariate relationships between library expenditures, usage
statistics, and library patron satisfaction scores on LibQUAL+. LibQUAL+ (2014) is an
instrument used by over 1,000 libraries to measure satisfaction across three dimensions of
library services: library as place, information control, and affect of service. Hunter and
Perret (2011) hoped to discover correlations that suggested which areas of library
services were “the most cost-effective to fund when attempting to increase user
satisfaction” (p. 407). They adjusted some variables to control for institution size, for
example, dividing reference transactions by student FTE, but did not do so
systematically. They found evidence that higher ACRL statistics correlated with higher

13
patron expectations for information control, but these increases were not matched with
higher perceived satisfaction scores. Furthermore, more expenditures and larger
collections correlated with lower overall satisfaction. Their study is intriguing, but it also
reveals the limitations of bivariate correlations in exploring relationships among data.
Martell (2008) examined ARL university libraries’ circulation rates, reference
counts, and gate counts over time and illustrated an overall decline in the use of physical
collections and services and an increase in use of electronic resources. While impressive
for its historical trend analysis, his study points at the importance of attempting to link
inputs, which were not examined, with outputs. For example, the study did not appear to
control for the change in expenditures or in volumes held over time, which could have a
direct effect on circulation rates.
Jones (2007) examined NCES Academic Library Survey (ALS) data for those
liberal arts colleges chosen by U. S. News and World Report as the top 50 “Best Liberal
Arts Colleges.” She examined the input variables Total Library Expenditure, Librarians
& Other Professional Staff, Total Staff, and Books as a proportion of combined faculty
and student FTE, and the output variables Annual Circulation Transactions per FTE,
Annual ILL Provided, Annual ILL Received, Reference Transactions per Week, and Gate
Count per Week. She determined that $2,000 was spent per FTE on library resources
among the top third of best-ranked libraries; $1,400 in the middle third, and $1,000 for
the bottom third, whereas only $200-$400 per FTE was spent by all academic libraries.
She also noted that the “best-ranked” colleges had higher annual circulation transactions
per FTE. Although it was unclear why the study chose to use FTE to normalize some

14
variables but not others, her study illustrates an interesting method for using ALS data to
compare libraries.
As the previous studies demonstrate, there is still uncertainty about the extent to
which variables internal to the library affect the use of the library. Researchers have made
some initial forays into that problem space, but have not fully leveraged statistical
techniques. This study will attempt to build on previous research by using structural
equation modeling (SEM) to explore relationships among library variables. Standard
regression techniques allow researchers to predict a dependent variable using a linear
combination of independent variables. Regression does not provide information about the
measurement error inherent in the variables. SEM, however, allows researchers to specify
both measurement models and structural models simultaneously, meaning the researcher
can examine error due to measurement of the variables as well as the factor structure in
the same model.
Although SEM is powerful, it only offers the ability to test how well data fits a
theoretical model. Therefore, it is important to have a strong theoretical basis for which
variables are included in SEM models. For the data internal to libraries, the researcher
believes she has found sufficient theoretical basis to use SEM. Even if overall models do
not fit, analysis of the residuals may prove fruitful. However, much less work has been
done examining the relationships between institutional variables such as external research
dollars and library use. Therefore, different techniques were employed. Multiple
regression models attempted to describe the relative contribution of library use variables
to external research dollars, while MANOVA was used to describe group differences
across institution types.

15
This literature review will now turn to examining the theoretical support for the
inclusion of variables in the models and the relationships among them.
Institutional variables
This study’s central exploration concerns how libraries’ decisions influence
library use. However, academic libraries exist within an institutional context. Some
decisions about how to handle institutional and demographic characteristics need to be
made, even for the SEM models that primarily focus on the libraries’ data.
Institutional size
One of the most logical covariates to include is one relating to institutional size: A
university with 50,000 students is going to have higher circulation, full-text article
downloads, and gate counts than one with 500 students. However, there are many ways to
count students. IPEDS / ACRL data offer student counts split up by full-time, part-time,
graduate, and undergraduate. There are also faculty and staff to consider: they also use
the library. Unfortunately, library use statistics do not usually separate counts by patron
type.
Studies have taken different approaches when including this variable depending
on the research questions of interest. Regazzi (2012) segmented libraries by Carnegie size
classes (<1,000, 1,000-2,999, 3,000-9,999, and 10,000+) and described groups’
characteristics, but did not perform statistical tests of group differences. Jones (2007)
used combined total student and faculty full-time equivalents to normalize total library
expenditures, libraries and other professional staff, books and other paper, and annual
circulation transactions, but did not use any FTE variable to normalize interlibrary loans,
reference transactions, or gate count. Weiner (2005) used the number of faculty, graduate,

16
and undergraduate students as independent variables, along with number of library staff
and total library expenditures, to predict reference transactions, group presentations, and
attendees at presentations. While she found that 31% of the variance in her dependent
variables was due to the independent variables, it was difficult to determine whether there
were interaction effects among the independent variables. Davis (2004) used the number
of unique IP addresses to represent the size of the readership community in their study
investigating whether requests can predict the number of total users. The disadvantage of
Davis’s approach for the present study (in addition to the data not being available) is that
non-users would not be represented in the concept of size.
The number of full-time students, undergraduate and graduate, plus the number of
full-time faculty, was hypothesized for use as a general control variable for institutional
size in this study using data from the ACRL ALTS survey. Disadvantages to this variable
include limiting information about part-time versus full-time and undergraduate versus
graduate student enrollment. Because the researcher did not have theories to test
involving part-time students, and adding the ACRL part-time students variable would
have meant additional cases with missing data, part-time students were not included in
the covariate. In retrospect, the IPEDS variable “Estimated full-time equivalent
undergraduate enrollment academic year” could have been a useful way to include full
and part-time undergraduates without a significant loss of data.
Average expenditures per student
The level of resources available to an institution may also be relevant to the
services libraries are able to provide. In this study’s 2010 dataset (N=330), the lowest
quartile of institutions spent $19,830 or less per student and the highest quartile spent

17
$31,030 or more per student. Even within one state, there may be an intentional hierarchy
of postsecondary institutions with very different levels of resources, which has been
suggested to relate to student quality (Sallee, Resch, & Courant, 2008). Researchers have
previously included expenditures per student in models predicting efficiency and
effectiveness (Powell, Gilleland, & Pearson, 2012) and when investigating relationships
between institutional characteristics and rankings (Lee, Sanford, & Jungmi, 2014).
Therefore, average expenditures per student was tested as a possible covariate to control
for the variability between a resource-poor institutions and resource-rich institutions.
Carnegie Classification
Scholars at the Carnegie Foundation note that the Carnegie Classifications are
based on “secondary analysis of numerical data collected by other organizations”
(McCormick & Zhao, 2005). They note that “Colleges and universities are complex
organizations that differ on many more dimensions than the handful of attributes used to
define the classification’s categories” (p. 55). Yet, researchers still feel like it’s a good
idea to test for differences among different types of institutions, and the Carnegie
Classifications provide a consistent way to do that. In library literature, Jaggars, Smith,
and Heath (2009) found statistically significant differences between faculty expectations
and perceptions of service quality between research universities and masters-level
universities, but did not find differences in faculty ratings of service adequacy — that is,
the “extent to which faculty perceive that a library meets their expectations” (p. 317).
Smith (2011) charted median library expenditures per FTE student by Basic Carnegie
Classification, and showed an increase along the continuum from Master’s (smaller) to
Research Universities (very high research activity). Fagan (2014a) reported that the Basic

18
Carnegie Classifications contributed statistically to regression models predicting full-text
articles and database searches, but added a comparatively small amount of predictive
ability beyond that of student FTE. Because the research seems inconclusive, some basic
statistical tests were conducted in this study to investigate the potential differences among
Carnegie Classification groups.
The specific nature of the potential effect of Carnegie class is unknown. For
example, one might hypothesize that undergraduate-focused institutions would have
larger library instructional programs proportional to FTE, because of a mission focused
more on teaching than research. Yet Williams (1995) and Owen (1992) posited that small
undergraduate universities may have heavier teaching loads, which “may result in an
undeveloped research culture, and teaching and learning which do not integrate library
use” (Williams, 1995, p. 46). Although error variance exists within the Carnegie
categories, it would be useful to describe differences among the groups and to note the
potential effect of their exclusion on interpretation of the results. The current Carnegie
Classifications were assigned based on data from 2008 and 2010 (Carnegie Foundation,
2014).
Effects of graduate programs and research emphasis
The degree to which an institution focuses its resources on its graduate programs
has a variety of effects on the library. Nackerud, Fransen, Peterson, and Mastel (2013)
found that graduate students at the University of Minnesota were the highest users of the
library in proportion to their population size across most colleges. Graduate research is
generally more specialized than undergraduate research, requiring deeper disciplinary
collections and heavy use of interlibrary loan (Du & Evans, 2011; Egan, 2005; Frank &

19
Bothmann, 2007; Herrera, 2003; Vezzosi, 2009). Graduate students must act more
independently and benefit from library instruction as they become scholars in their
disciplines (Rempel, 2010). One question explored in this study was “How do libraries
differ on the variables in this study in relationship to their institutions’ focus on graduate
programs?”
Regazzi (2012) found that Carnegie-classed doctoral institutions offer the highest
salaries to librarians and library staff. He also noticed that while expenditures on print
books decreased at Master’s and Baccalaureate degree-granting institutions, Doctoral
institutions experienced increasing expenditures on books between 1998 and 2008.
Doctoral institutions also increased spending on overall collections and staff. Although
Regazzi did not examine ongoing resource expenditures by Carnegie class, one would
expect that libraries at institutions with graduate programs would need stronger full-text
collections, meaning higher ongoing resource expenditures. Full-text article requests,
circulation, and interlibrary loans could be higher because of the more exhaustive nature
of their information use. Some libraries focus on library instruction programs to
graduates, but many do not (Rempel & Davidson, 2008), and because of their smaller
numbers, these may not make much difference in the count of “participants in group
presentations” in the aggregate. Likewise, the smaller numbers of graduate students may
limit the magnitude of their effect on gate count, reference transactions, reserves, and
social media use.
Because of the mystery surrounding how graduate programs might affect library
data patterns, and because they certainly would have meaning for library planning, this

20
study explored the effect of graduate program emphasis on the variables in this study
using the Carnegie “Graduate Instructional Program” Classification.
Dependent Variables: Circulation, Full-Text Articles, and Gate Count
Researchers have measured the idea of library use in several ways over time.
Grimes and Charters (2001) used the number of hours spent in the library by the student
as their dependent variable. The use of “hours spent” ended up being somewhat
confusing to interpret, because library instruction correlated with less time spent in the
library, which the researchers thought indicated efficiency, while reference interactions
resulted in more time spent, which the researchers thought indicated an investment of
“library-specific human capital” by students.
Whitmire (2001) defined library use as including any of the following activities:
using computers for library searches, using indexes to journal articles, developing a
bibliography, using card catalog or computer, asking librarian for help, reading in reserve
or reference section, checking out books, checking citations in things read, reading basic
references or documents, or finding material by browsing in stacks (p. 532). Haddow
(2013) measured library use by counting log-ins to authenticated resources and borrowed
physical items.
The present study’s models used three indicators of library use: initial circulations
of physical items, full-text article requests, and gate count. The researcher also explored
these indicators’ correlations with one another. It was hypothesized that gate count and
circulation would be positively correlated, gate count and article requests uncorrelated,
and article and requests and circulation slightly positively correlated. Although it seems
logical that online use would rise as physical item use falls, the evidence is mixed.

21
Longitudinal studies have suggested declines in circulation accompanied by increases in
electronic resource use (Martell, 2008), but studies focused on student groups have
shown that students who use more electronic resources also check out more items, and
vice versa (Haddow, 2013, p. 135; Goodall & Pattern, 2011). Alternative models were
tested: one with a latent variable “library use” measured by these three variables, and one
with these three dependent variables predicted separately by Engagement With Library
Services, Ongoing Expenditures, and One-Time Expenditures (Figure 1).
Figure 1. Two options for testing the dependent variables Circulation, Full-Text Articles, and
Gate Count.

Circulation
Checking out books has often been chosen as an indicator of library use (e.g.,
Harrell, 1988; Martell, 2008). Although there is some evidence that overall circulation in
libraries is declining, Martell (2008) demonstrated that the trend is not universal and that
selecting specific groups or years of libraries may reveal circulation increases. In a study
of “the library brand,” the nonprofit library organization OCLC (2010) found that the
association in peoples’ minds between libraries (of all types) and books is stronger than
ever. In a single-institution study, Soria, Fransen, and Nackerud (2013) found that
checking out books had a positive correlation with academic achievement.

22
Library delivery services, ranging from mailing physical items to distance
learners to delivering items to faculty mailboxes on campus, have proliferated in the last
decade and add to circulation counts (King & Pendleton, 2009; Long, 2009; Schoonover,
Siriwardena, & Jones, 2013). Although the use of such services is growing, the trend does
not yet seem large enough to affect the use of circulation as an indicator of physical
engagement. For example, at Florida State University, deliveries accounted for 2.3% to
4% of circulations from 2010 to 2012, while at Auburn University, deliveries accounted
for 1% to 1.3% from 2006 to 2008.
ACRL (2012) explains that the count of initial circulations excludes reserves
(materials circulated for intentional use inside the library) and renewals. Although most
circulations are books, the count also includes circulation of other physical items such as
CDs, videos, kits, and even equipment. Circulations to and from remote storage facilities
for library users are included, but those supporting transfers or stages of technical
processing are not. Some studies have included renewals (Regazzi, 2012; Soria, Fransen,
& Nackerud, 2013), and the count of all circulations including renewals is available from
NCES ALS. However, since this indicator is one of physical engagement, and users do
most renewals online, just initial circulations were used (referred to as “Circulation”) in
this study.
Full-Text Articles
Borin and Yi (2011) included full-text articles among the metrics for indicating
user interest in the collection. COUNTER standards have improved the reliability of this
metric by curtailing technology-related artifacts, for example, by ensuring multiple
requests for the same article within 30 seconds are disregarded (Davis, 2004). Davis

23
(2004) demonstrated with regression that full-text requests can predict the number of ejournal users, even after controlling for institutional effects and the time of year. This
suggests the relationship between full-text requests and number of users is not skewed by
users with extreme behaviors, although such users are present in the data. Davis (2004)
also found this relationship held across journal subjects, popularity, and size.
It is important to note that the number of full-text requests does not show how
items were used, or how valuable they were to the user (Grogg & Fleming, 2011;
Nicholas & Huntington, 2006). However, there is some indication that requests relate to
usefulness in some way: Duy and Vaughan (2006) found significant, positive correlations
between full-text requests per journal and citation patterns at Concordia University,
suggesting a relationship between e-journal full-text requests and usefulness. In singleinstitution studies, Goodall and Pattern (2011) and Soria, Fransen, and Nackerud (2013)
found positive correlations between online library usage and academic achievement. New
research is exploring ways to measure journal article sharing (as opposed to
downloading) using social media, institutional repositories, and bibliographic tools like
Mendeley (Tenopir, 2014).
This study uses the “Number of successful full text article requests” variable from
ACRL’s ALTS, which uses the Project COUNTER (2012) definition, and refers to this
variable as “Full-Text Articles.”
Gate Count
Gate Count is collected by NCES as part of the Academic Library Survey as “the
number of persons who physically enter library facilities in a typical week” (NCES,
2012, p. 9). Libraries are instructed to collect data during any seven consecutive calendar

24
days that are neither unusually busy nor slow, with no vacation periods. Libraries that
count a year’s worth of data may divide it by the number of weeks the library was open.
From year to year, gate count can be dramatically affected by things unrelated to library
services, such as the opening or renovation of library buildings and installation of nearby
or in-library coffee shops.
Even beyond such events, gate count has been somewhat mysterious to libraries.
Greenwood, Watson, and Dennis (2013) noticed a spike in gate count at the University of
Mississippi, but were unable to determine any specific service changes that could have
been responsible, even when examining their LibQUAL+ survey results from the years
bracketing the event. Opperman and Jamison (2008) noticed an increase in gate count in
the Ohio State University Science and Engineering Library from 1999-2006 was
accompanied by decreases in many traditional on-site activities such as photocopying and
checkouts. They speculated that students increasingly used the facility for studying as
well as accessing online library resources. In their words, “the physical library is
transformed from a print-focused collection into a more inviting campus destination
dedicated to discovery and learning” (p. 571). Researchers are currently exploring ways
to at least split up gate count by type of patron to get more demographic details (Bailey &
Slemons, 2014).
Related to gate count are studies of library building use. Yoo-Lee, Lee, and Velez
(2013) conducted a survey of 100 undergraduates at North Carolina State University, and
found that students used the library frequently in their everyday life, mostly on weekday
nights with friends or in a group. Communal and social spaces in library buildings and
the idea of a “Learning Commons” are becoming increasingly important, while

25
interactions with librarians may be becoming less correlated with physical library use.
Yoo-Lee, Lee, and Velez urged future research to include use of library space in studies
of library use in addition to other metrics. Chang (2014) analyzed graduate students’ use
of library spaces and found that graduate students generally used the library building at
least 2 days per month, and that they used the building for both solo and group work.
A question surrounding gate count is whether to normalize it in some way by the
number of hours the library is open (a statistic that is available in the ALS dataset).
Regazzi (2012) normalized gate count by both enrollment and hours open. Although this
may have been appropriate for his investigation, this study does not normalize by hours
open. Because of varying demand in a 24-hour period, extending or reducing hours may
not have a dramatic effect on gate count. As just one example, Oakland University and
University of Massachusetts, Boston have a similar gate count per full-time FTE (0.67
and 0.69). Yet because Oakland University’s library is open almost twice as many hours
as UM Boston (156 to 84), its gate count per FTE per hour is half that of UM Boston. It
would seem invalid to say that Oakland’s students are half as engaged with the library as
UM Boston’s due to this numerical difference. Libraries determine which hours to be
open be based on evaluation of patron expectations and use. Gate count per hour would
be useful to examine if trying to determine whether to open or close earlier. When
looking at a national sample of libraries and using gate count as an indicator of library
engagement, this study will assume each library has already made the determination of
the appropriate hours to be open for their campus.

Predictors of Circulation and Full-Text Articles: Ongoing Expenditures and
One-Time Expenditures
Database searches and ongoing expenditures are two variables that seem to
predict full-text requests. Fagan (2014a) found relationships among these variables in her
study predicting full-text requests from database searches, ongoing expenditures, and
other variables. Soria, Fransen, and Nackerud (2013) found a positive correlation
between database use and academic achievement. However, numerous problems have
been found with the measurement of database searches (Coombs, 2005). The count of
database searches in libraries includes reports from numerous vendors, and libraries are
challenged to assemble the counts into a single number. This decentralized reporting
results in a large amount of missing data and high, construct-irrelevant variance.
Database searches is also a new variable: ACRL began collecting data about database
searches in 2012. Because of these issues, database searches was not used in this study.
The indicator “ongoing expenditures” signifies a library’s current investment in
its collections. Borin and Yi (2011) noted that expenditures is superior to “volumes
added” or “number of titles owned” to provide an idea of investment in library resources
because of the increase in consortially-purchased titles, package deals, and the confusion
of ownership and access. This trend is one reason why in 2012, ACRL began counting
specifically “ongoing library materials expenditures,” which was defined as subscription
expenditures for serial and other publications including “paid subscriptions for print and
electronic journals and indexes/abstracts available via the Internet, CD-ROM serials, and
annual access fees for resources purchased on a “one-time” basis” (p. 4). Previously,
ACRL had counted print and online ongoing materials expenditures separately.

28
One-Time expenditures are defined by ACRL as “all library materials that are
non-subscription, one-time, or monographic in nature.” The library’s books are included
in this figure, but so are one-time purchases of electronic journal backfiles. Therefore,
alternative models was tested where One-Time Expenditures predicts both Full-Text
Articles and Circulation.
In this study, the variables Ongoing Expenditures and One-Time Expenditures
were thought to be predicted by Library Expenditures as a Proportion of Institutional
Expenditures with the idea that better-funded libraries would be able to afford more
resources. Ongoing Expenditures was hypothesized to predict Full-Text Articles, and
One-Time Expenditures was hypothesized to predict Circulation and possibly Full-Text
Articles.
Engagement With Library Services
Libraries have long been the most active champions for information literacy on
college campuses, which has received new attention in light of employer surveys
showing an interest in skills that cross discipline boundaries, including evidence-based
research (LEAP, 2013). Yet, libraries have not always articulated this connection as a
strategic advantage that distinguishes them from other units on campus (Barney, 1991).
Riehle and Weiner (2013) found that information literacy is often included in discussions
of high-impact practices in educational literature, but often not by that name. For
example, librarians are often engaged in first-year seminars, learning communities,
research methods, and capstone courses through the creation of online tutorials, library
instruction classes, and collaboration with students and faculty. Showing how libraries
contribute to these practices is critical for demonstrating the relevance of the modern

29
academic library. A modern academic library’s services are rapidly changing and in fact,
are targeting student engagement, critical thinking, and problem solving. Libraries now
sponsor hackathons, provide support for integrating resources with course management
systems, and offer expertise with digital preservation, to name just a few activities.
Because of this study’s focus at the institutional level, it is necessarily limited to the
services for which data is tracked. Yet, there are still counts of how much use students are
making of some relevant library services. In this study’s primary theoretical model,
Engagement With Library Services was measured by the number of Participants in Group
Presentations, Interlibrary Loans, Reference Transactions, Reserves Circulation, and
libraries’ use of social media.
Engagement With Library Services—Participants in Group Presentations
Fagan (2014a) found a small but statistically significant effect of Participants in
Group Presentations on Full-Text Articles in two models. Based on data from a sample of
business students, Booker, Detlor, and Serenko (2012) found that library instruction had a
positive effect on users’ intentions to use the online library in the early stages of research.
However, they also proposed that there is a “saturation point” after which additional
library instruction does not help. This suggests the number of participants instructed
could be a more useful variable than class sessions, which could include repeat
participants. In a survey of over 4,000 continuing education students at a Canadian
undergraduate university (with a response rate greater than 80%), Williams (1995) found
students who had library instruction reported using the library twice as much as those
who did not. This study uses ACRL’s count of participants in group presentations, which
is defined as “the total number of attendees in all group presentations,” including “formal

30
bibliographic instruction programs” and “other planned class presentations, orientation
sessions, and tours” (2012, p. 6).
Engagement With Library Services—Interlibrary Loans
Most research using interlibrary loan statistics has involved single-institution
studies and focused on programmatic improvements. Yet, the studies provide some
insight to the validity of this variable as an indicator, and identify possible sources of
variance. For example, Leykan (2008) reviewed the publication date, subject headings,
and requestor’s academic status in conjunction with library liaison services. Although
interlibrary loan was available to all faculty, staff, and students, the majority of users
were from a limited number of academic departments, and use by department seemed to
vary with liaison activity. Therefore, overall librarian liaison activity at an institution
could influence interlibrary loan use. Several studies have reviewed lists of items
borrowed via interlibrary loan to inform acquisitions practices (e.g., Ruppel, 2006),
suggesting that some libraries may have reduced interlibrary loan statistics because they
have implemented buy-instead-of-borrow programs. Unfortunately, there is no data about
whether the libraries in these datasets have implemented such programs.
ACRL counts interlibrary loan statistics for the number of requests for materials
provided to other libraries separately from the number of filled requests borrowed from
other libraries or providers (ACRL, 2012). While materials provided to other libraries
may be a sign of collection quality, interlibrary loans borrowed is a sign that a library’s
patrons are engaged with research. Interlibrary loans may include the loan of physical
items, photocopies, and digital PDFs. It does not include any locally owned items (some
libraries offer services to scan in print articles for patrons; these would not be included).

31
Soria, Fransen, & Nackerud (2013) found statistically significant correlations between
interlibrary loans and database, electronic journal, electronic book usage, reference, and
library instruction classes. This provides support for including ILL as an indicator of
Engagement With Library Services.
Engagement With Library Services—Reference Transactions
ACRL defines a reference transaction as “an information contact that involves the
knowledge, use, recommendations, interpretation, or instruction in the use [or creation of]
one or more information sources by a member of the library staff” (p. 6). Because library
search tools are usually visible only to authenticated users, many students may not
discover them unless shown by a professor or reference librarian. In Grimes and
Charter’s (2001) study, reference transactions was positively correlated with more hours
spent in the library; and in Fagan (2014a), reference transactions had a small but
statistically significant effect on Full-Text Articles in two models. Reference transactions
may also relate to physical activity in the library.
Any library public service staff member would be quick to point out that these
days, reference transactions may occur via chat or email. ACRL (2012) specifically notes
that e-mail, web form, and chat transactions, and transactions of any length are counted
with this metric. However, virtual reference transactions represent only a small
proportion of total reference transactions (Mu, Dimitroff, Jordan, & Burclaff, 2011;
Radford & Kern, 2006). Virtual reference transactions are not counted as a separate
metric by ACRL or NCES.

32
Engagement With Library Services—Reserves Circulations
Reserves Circulations is also collected by NCES as part of the Academic Library
Survey. Unlike the ACRL “Initial Circulations” statistic, reserve transactions include
both initial transactions and renewals. Libraries that effectively market Reserves services
to faculty should see a higher Reserves Circulation count (even if the trend over time is a
decrease in Reserves Circulation across libraries). Because the patron must usually visit a
library desk to renew reserves materials, and they must be used in the library, reserves
activity may increase use of gate count. Martell (2008) reported this statistic as declining
for academic libraries from 1995 to 2006.
Engagement With Library Services—Social Media
Social media is also proposed as a sign of Engagement With Library Services.
ACRL just added the social media questions in 2012. Libraries were asked whether they
used specific social media technologies (e.g., blogs, Facebook) and for what purpose
(e.g., Community building, Friends of the Library). This study used the “purpose” aspect
to determine the extent of social media use, since a library using one technology for
numerous purposes better fits the idea of high social media use than a library using many
technologies for a single purpose. For this study, Social Media score was calculated by
giving libraries one point for each “Yes” answer to each “Social Media – Purpose”
question. Since there were nine questions, that meant a library could score from 0-9 on
this indicator.
The question of whether social media use by libraries has an effect on library use
is still under debate. Special Collections departments are heavy users of social media:
Griffin and Taylor (2013) found that 73% of ARL libraries’ special collections

33
departments had profiles on at least one social media site (p. 262). A few studies have
found that promoting digital special collections through social media increases use
(Bagget & Gibbs, 2014; Elder, Westbrook, & Reilly, 2012). However, Wu et al. (2014)
surveyed 1,513 first-year students at seven institutions and found many were unaware of
or did not use social media technologies other than Facebook. Furthermore, over half
their respondents said they were unlikely or extremely unlikely to friend the library on
Facebook (p. 127). It is therefore unclear if libraries’ social media use has affected any
variables in this model.
Library Budget as a Proportion of Institutional Expenditures
In order to pay library staff, provide library services, and acquire resources, a
library needs a budget. There are many ways to capture the institution’s investment in the
library, including library budget as a proportion of institution’s budget, library budget as
a proportion of academic support budget, and total library expenditures as a proportion of
instructional expenditures. All these options were explored for use in these models, but
the first was chosen since it has commonly been used in other studies. Also, it seemed
that the way in which an institution might classify expenses as “academic support” or
“instruction” and where the library’s budget line fit in an institution’s budget could
introduce large amounts of construct-irrelevant variance to this model.
Weiner (2009) examined how library expenditures related to institutional
reputation of doctoral institutions. She found that total library expenditures contributed
significantly to all her models predicting reputation, including those where institutional
variables were entered into the model first. There seemed to be only a small amount of
variance in the proportion of institutional budget devoted to the library across institutions.

34
Applegate (2007) found that the library’s allocation proportion varied across institutions
by institutional type: libraries accounted for less than 2% of associates institutions’
budgets, while private, ARL libraries accounted for 2.8% of their institutions’ budgets.
The proportional budget appears to be decreasing over time: in a 2005 study, Weiner
found that the average allocation of university expenditures to ARL libraries decreased
from 3.91% in 1982 to 3.32% in 1992. As of 2012, the average was 2.1% for pubic, fouryear institutions that reported data for both library and total institutional expenditures
(N=988, ACRLMetrics, 2012).
Investment in Library Staff
Garvin (1988) discussed two contrary theories concerning quality and staffing
costs, both of which are relevant to libraries. One set of theories posited a positive
relationship between cost and quality: that is, you get what you pay for. If you invest
more money in library staff, whether by hiring more staff or paying them better (or both),
you will get higher quality library services. The opposing theory is that as quality
increases, costs decrease because high-quality products and services result in greater
satisfaction, meaning reduced follow-up costs. In libraries, one might hypothesize that if
libraries invest in developing excellent online search interfaces, reference questions will
go down because students and faculty can find what they need on their own. Therefore,
the cost of staffing reference desks could go down.
Garvin also discusses the relationship between quality and productivity. A
traditional management view is that to do better work, workers will need to slow down.
However, he cites many studies suggesting there is a positive correlation between quality
and productivity, although there may be an initial period of learning where things do take

35
longer. Libraries implementing online instruction programs have faced this: it requires an
enormous initial investment to develop and launch online tutorials and to test and
improve them. But as the online materials are refined, more students can be reached.
Specific research concerning the effect of staffing levels on organizational
performance is seemingly nonexistent in libraries, and has shown mixed results in the
business world. Investigations related to the effects of fewer staff often focus on
downsizing. Williams, Khan, and Naumann (2010) found that downsizing immediately
and negatively impacts customer satisfaction and retention. Iverson and Zatzick (2011)
found that the negative influence of downsizing on labor productivity in highperformance work systems was mitigated by showing consideration for employees’
morale and welfare. Love and Nohria (2005) found that downsizing is contingent on the
circumstances for the reduction. Tsai and Shih (2013) suggested that a “responsible
downsizing strategy” can result in the development and enhancement of dynamic
capabilities (a firm’s “ability to integrate, build, and reconfigure internal and external
competences for addressing rapidly changing environments,” according to Teece, Pisano,
and Shuen, 1997). In other words, “it depends.” Although the research is ambiguous, this
study hypothesizes that a greater investment in staff increases a library’s ability to
provide library services.
The ALS and ACRL surveys differ in the instructions for counting staff. The ALS
specifically separates librarians (“the total FTE of staff whose duties require professional
education (the master's degree or its equivalent) in the theoretical and scientific aspects of
librarianship”) from other professional staff (“the total FTE of staff whose duties require
education and/or training in related fields (e.g., academic disciplines, archives, media,

36
computing)”) (NCES, 2012). The ACRL survey items related to staff haven’t changed
since 2006; they combine librarians and other professional staff into one category:
Since the criteria for determining professional status vary among libraries, there is
no attempt to define the term “professional.” Each library should report those staff
members it considers professional, including, when appropriate, staff who are not
librarians in the strict sense of the term, for example computer experts, systems
analysts, or budget officers. (2012, p. 5)
Support staff are simply defined as staff who “are not included in Professional.” The
NCES ALS definitions provide more granularity and have been commonly used by
researchers investigating staffing; however, there was more missing data for the ALS
salary variables than for ACRL in this study’s datasets. Thus, the ACRL staff-related
variables were used in this study. Additionally, the benefit of the ALS’s granularity
would have been lost in this study because the ALS does not track librarian salaries
separately from other professional staff salaries.
Using the NCES ALS data, Regazzi (2012) performed an inflation-adjusted
longitudinal analysis of staffing patterns in academic libraries from 1998 to 2008. He
found that large and doctoral institutions have increased both collection and staff
spending well above the mean for all libraries, while small libraries have decreased in
expenditures on staff. Across all institutions, librarian staff levels have increased by 9%,
while other professional staff (non-librarians with professional qualifications) have
increased 51%. Overall, “Other paid staff” have declined by 6% and student assistants
have declined by 15%. The increase in use of “other professional staff” is most visible
when looking at libraries grouped by Carnegie Classification: “for every one staff FTE

37
added as Librarian staff to Doctoral research institutions, 13 other professional FTEs
were added.” Expenditures per staff, however, have remained about the same from 1998
to 2008.
Applegate (2007) also used NCES ALS data to explore librarian distribution
among large, medium, and small institutions. She investigated staffing ratios by size,
type, and Carnegie Basic classification. For investigating size, she created groups
“derived from a connection between size and Carnegie Classification” (p. 64). Her groups
were: small libraries, 1-9 staff; medium libraries, 10-24; and large, greater than 24. She
found that public institutions generally have a greater proportion of non-librarians and
had larger librarian-to-student ratios. Small schools had more students per librarian than
large schools. For example, on average, at large public schools, each librarian served 466
students, while at small public schools, the librarian-to-student ratio was 574 to one (p.
66). At large private schools, each librarian served an average of 223 students, while at
small privates, the ratio was 423 to one. Across Carnegie classes at public institutions, the
librarian-to-student ratio varied, but non linearly; the greatest librarian-to-student ratio
was found at Baccalaureate - Associates institutions (914), but the second highest was at
Master’s-I institutions (585). While the lowest was at Doctoral-Extensive (454), the nextlowest was Baccalaureate-Liberal Arts (470). Based on these studies, it is not clear how
staffing levels at libraries relate to other institutional characteristics.
The relationships between salaries and institutional characteristics are also
unclear. Regazzi (2012, Table 6) found that doctoral institutions had the highest average
librarian/professional salaries in 2008 constant dollars, rising from $55,538 to $58,448
from 1998 to 2008, but Associates schools had the next highest, although they decreased

38
from $54,739 to $53,778 during the period he examined. Masters’ institutions ranked
next, followed by Baccalaureate, each of which increased a small amount from 1998 to
2008. Other paid staff followed a similar pattern, except associates’ institutions saw a
decrease in average salary from $32,138 to $30,783 while all other Carnegie
Classifications saw an increase in average staff salary during the period.
Arranged in the overall model, the researcher hypothesized that all these variables
provide a framework in which libraries’ business strategy choices can be seen.
Administrators divide the incoming library budget into staff, one-time materials
expenditures, and ongoing materials expenditures. Investment in staff enables the
provision of library services. The Engagement with Library Services variables join OneTime Expenditures and Ongoing Expenditures in producing the library use variables
Circulation, Full-Text Articles, and Gate Count.

39
Chapter 3: Methodology
Instruments
Academic libraries have two national sources of data about library services,
expenditures, and outputs: the NCES Academic Library Survey (ALS) and the ACRL
Academic Library Trends & Statistics survey (ALTS). A strength of these datasets is the
number of institutions which participate and the number of available years of data. Thus,
the sophistication of statistical analysis is not likely to be limited by sample size even
after dealing with missing information. Having multiple years of data provides additional
options for cross-validation of models. The IPEDS identifier means the two data sources
can be linked with each other using ACRLMetrics online software
(http://www.acrlmetrics.com/) and with other IPEDS datasets.
The NCES Academic Library Survey (ALS) has been conducted every two years
since 1988 and offers descriptive statistics for approximately 3,700 U.S. degree-granting
institutions and their academic libraries (NCES, 2013). The primary audience for the data
is Congress and federal grant agencies, including the Institute of Museum and Library
Services, National Library of Medicine, and the Library of Congress (NCES, 2011). State
education agencies and library administrators also use the data to plan funding, and
library researchers use survey results “to determine the status of academic library
operations and the librarian profession” (NCES, 2011, p. 1). The NCES publishes a “First
Look” report that summarizes results for each year (NCES, 2010).
The ACRL Library Trends and Statistics (ALTS) survey has been conducted
since 1999 and the most recent dataset (2012) included responses from 1,689 libraries.
There have been two reports presenting a comprehensive, historical look at the ALS data,

40
one for the period 1974-1996 (Cahalan, et al., 2001), and one covering 1994-2004 (Lu,
2007). ALS and ACRL survey data from 2000-2012 are available through a subscription
product called ACRLMetrics, which was described in detail by Stewart (2011, 2012).
The tool offers reports for commonly desired ratios, rankings, and crosstabs, and datasets
can be created and downloaded for use with statistical software.
Additional data regarding external research dollars was obtained from the NSF’s
HERD database from the most recent year available, 2011 (see Appendix A).
Samples
The population of interest for this study is non-profit four-year U.S. colleges and
universities with academic libraries. The ALS variable “Sector of Institution” was used to
limit to the categories “Public, 4-year or above” and “Private nonprofit, 4-year and
above.” The ALTS variable “Country” was used to limit to U.S. schools.
This study will use datasets from 2010 and 2012 (the ALS is conducted in only
even-numbered years). Because this study is exploratory, the 2010 datasets were used for
conducting preliminary analysis and testing models, and the 2012 dataset was reserved
for testing final models. This approach involved a tradeoff: reserving the 2012 data would
allow cross-validation but prevent the ability to analyze changes from 2010 to 2012.
Procedures
Data Screening
In her study of the effects of several variables on full-text articles, Fagan (2014a)
included libraries meeting a minimum level of service and removed libraries with fewer
than 100 participants in group presentations, 100 items borrowed via interlibrary loan, or
365 reference transactions. Because this study evaluated both a structural component and

41
a measurement component using SEM, cases were not limited in this manner. However,
cases with missing or zero values were listwise deleted. Table 2 shows the number of
cases deleted because of missing values for each dataset. There were 730 cases in 2010,
and 450 cases in 2012 missing one or more of the dependent variables. Looking at the
450 deleted cases from 2012, about 300 were Carnegie-classified as being small or very
small schools. Small schools may not have adequate library staff to report data on such
surveys. An 89 additional schools were Carnegie-classified as special-focus institutions—
law schools and seminaries being two examples. Therefore, removing the missing data
limited the generalizability of this study’s findings to exclude these types of schools. The
remaining 61 schools with missing data were a mix of large, medium, and small, and
many probably just did not report one or more pieces of data that particular year.

Total Cases Remaining

Cases with no “Yes” answers to the Social Media question were not removed,
because an additional 116 additional libraries did not report data for this variable set. By

42
not removing these cases, the researcher had the option to run models with and without
this new variable.
The 2012 dataset had several different variables than 2010. First, the Social Media
questions were not added to the ACRL survey until 2012. So the Social Media answers
from 2012 were added to 2010 by matching on the IPEDS identifiers. Second, library
materials expenditures were tracked differently prior to 2012: instead of two variables,
one-time and ongoing expenditures, there were four: monographs, current serials, other
library materials, and miscellaneous. Appendix 2 discusses the specific definitions of
these variables. After deleting missing data for Monographs and Current Serials, the
researcher computed new variables: One-Time Expenditures 2010 summed monographs
plus Other Library Materials, and Ongoing Expenditures 2010 summed Current Serials
plus Miscellaneous.
After the first round of SEM models, a third dataset was created from the 2012
dataset with 1,148 cases to test some simpler path models with just Carnegie-classified
doctoral institutions. Because fewer variables were needed, fewer cases needed to be
deleted due to missing data. This 2012 set had 181 cases after limiting to doctoral
institutions with the variables Full-Time Students, Full-Time Faculty, Full-Text Articles,
Ongoing Expenditures, Participants in Group Presentations, and Interlibrary Loans. The
2010 dataset did not have sufficient cases with all these variables to provide a crossvalidation sample, so just 2012 was used. A fourth dataset was also created from the 2012
dataset to test the same path models with Master’s and Baccalaureate institutions
combined. This Master’s plus Baccalaureate dataset had 381 cases after limiting in the
same way as the 2012 Doctoral dataset.

43
After removing cases with missing data, the datasets were screened for univariate
and multivariate outliers. Univariate outliers were detected through the use of boxplots.
The researcher only deleted extreme outliers that showed a clear separation from the data.
Multivariate outliers were detected by using a regression on all variables in the model
(except Social Media) to predict the id number of the case. While many outliers in these
datasets come from clerical errors, other outliers may be correct values but represent a
specific, unusual circumstance that still justifies the case being deleted. For example, a
library that closes its building for renovation one year may report an extremely low gate
count. In such a case, the building closing may have affected other variables in a way that
is not so obvious. There were also some cases where the institution was simply one of the
biggest or smallest institutions. Table 3 shows how many cases were deleted for outliers
for each of the variables in the primary model in this study.

The required sample size for SEM models is a topic of much debate (Weston &
Gore, 2006). Kline (2011) recommends at least 10 cases, preferably 20, per parameter

44
estimated, but also notes that most published literature uses a minimum of 200 cases.
More complex models, non-normal data, or a need for more statistical power increases
the requirements for sample size. For this study, the final number of cases in each sample
provided sufficient data for all the measurement models in this study (the most complex
has 27 estimated parameters), but only the 2012 data was close to sufficient for testing
the most complex of the initial hybrid models, which had 36 estimated parameters.
However, 2010 was still used to perform initial tests of the measurement models.
For the path models with just doctoral schools, and Baccalaureate + Master’s
schools, the most parameters estimated was 12, meaning a minimum of 120 cases was
needed. The 169 cases available for the Doctoral dataset fell short of the ideal 20 cases
per parameter guideline, which limited the power of these model tests. However, the 367
cases in the Baccalaureate + Master’s was more than sufficient.
Normality, heteroscedasticity, and linearity of the data
Fagan (2014a) found that most ACRL data appears to be non-normal in shape,
and used a log transformation prior to performing regression analyses. The
transformation made interpretation more difficult; however, the extreme shape of the data
could have caused problems for running the models in this study. Because this study is
exploratory, the overall fit of models was of more interest than interpreting parameter
estimates. Also, the sample sizes for some of the datasets were at the lower end of the
recommended guidelines, pointing to a need for more normal data. Therefore, a log
transformation was applied to the variables in this study. A constant (1) was added to the
variable “Library Expenditures as a percent of Institutional Expenditures” before
applying the log transformation to avoid negative numbers.

45
Even after performing a log transformation, the data demonstrated non-normality
according to Mardia’s Normalized Multivariate Kurtosis. Among the measurement
models, values ranged from 14 for the model with the fewest variables (Model A-3) to 38
(for models C-3 and C-5) for the 2010 dataset. For the 2012 Doctoral and 2012
Baccalaureate plus Master’s datasets, the values ranged from -35 to -59. Bentler (1998)
noted there was no real cut-off point for kurtosis, but that in his experience a value of 10
was a good indication that the data are not normal. Therefore, maximum-likelihood (ML)
estimation with the Satorra-Bentler adjustment to standard errors and fit indices was
used. This method rescales the x2 test and standard errors by the amount of kurtosis.
PRELIS 2.80 was used to prepare the covariance matrixes (Jöreskog & Sörbom, 2007b),
and LISREL 8.80 was used for the SEM analyses (Jöreskog & Sörbom, 2007a).
Basic descriptive information about the 447 cases in the 2012 dataset, the 330
cases in the 2010 dataset, the 169 cases in the 2012 doctoral set, and the 367 cases in the
2012 master’s and Baccalaureate set is provided in Tables 4 through 7.
SEM models are affected by violations of homoscedasticity (the variability in one
variable across the values of the other variables) and linearity, therefore
homoscedasticity was evaluated using residual plots and linearity was evaluated using
bivariate scatterplots between all variables in the model. Other than the issues with
multivariate normality discussed earlier, these assumptions seem to have been met after
log transformation of the data.

Correlations among the data
Bivariate correlations among the data controlling for full-time students and
faculty show no extreme multicollinearity, which would imply variables were redundant
(See Tables 8-11). The variables Average Librarian / Professional Salary, Average Staff
Salary, Reserves Circulation, and Social Media variables did not appear to correlate
highly with anything, so the SEM models were tested with and without these variables.

Procedures—Structural equation modeling
Structural equation modeling is a family of statistical techniques permitting the
evaluation of models including both observed and latent variables (Kline, 2011). Latent
variables are constructs such as “intelligence” that cannot be observed directly but are
instead measured by two or more indicators that the researcher hypothesizes are
appropriate to measure the construct. As MacKenzie (2001) explained, latent variables
can broaden the scope of theoretical models by helping researchers think “in terms of
entire systems of conceptual relationships that better represent the complex environments
to which [they] hope [their] theories apply” (p. 159). Latent variables test whether
indicators group together to make meaningful factors.

51
In Figure 2, “Investment in library staff” is a latent variable measured by two
indicators, the number of librarians and the number of professional staff. Observed and
latent variables can be connected with paths that represent relationships, or structures,
among the variables. The latent variable “Investment in Library Staff” is hypothesized to
predict another latent variable, “Library Use,” which is observed through the indicators
Circulation and Full-Text Articles. Such models are often called confirmatory factor
analysis (CFA) models.
SEM models can also include only observed variables; these are called path
models. Models may combine both CFA and path models. These are called hybrid
models or full structural regression models.
Although SEM paths are often drawn with arrows, the direction of any path is
based entirely on theory. There is no statistical way to evaluate which direction is more
appropriate for a path. In summary, SEM allows a measurement model to be combined
with a structural model.

Figure 2. A structural equation model.

52
Many scholars have described historical abuses of SEM (Kline, 2011, 189). To
avoid those pitfalls, this study was sure to:
•

Make model specification decisions based on theory (Kelloway, 1998;
MacCallum & Austin, 2001).

•

Test alternative models (Kline, 2011).

•

Use fit indexes critically, examining both model fit and approximate fit
indices (Kline, 2011, p. 194-195).

•

Report and describe residuals to help diagnose areas of model misfit.

Anderson & Gerbing’s (1988) two-step approach was chosen for testing
alternative, nested models. In their approach, saturated CFA models are used to test
various measurement models. For example, the measurement model for Figure 2 appears
in Figure 3. The structural paths are removed and all latent variables are set to correlate
so the error in measurement between latent variables and their indicators can be
examined.

Figure 3. A measurement model.

53
Depending on the fit of the measurement model(s), then following Anderson &
Gerbing, a null model (with all relationships between latent constructs fixed to zero)
would be tested. This tests the null hypothesis that none of the latent constructs are
related. The second of Anderson & Gerbing’s two steps is to test the theoretical model
and any alternative theoretical models.
For models that are nested, chi-square difference tests can test whether they are
significantly different from one another. A model is said to be nested within another if a
free parameter can be fixed (usually, set to zero) to form the other model. For non-nested
models, the Aikake’s Information Criteria (AIC) was used for comparisons (Kline, 2010,
p. 220).
The x2 test was used to evaluate the models’ fit to the data using a critical value of
p< .05 (Bryant & Satorra, 2012). Satorra-Bentler (S-B x2) was calculated as described in
Bryant and Satorra (2012) because LISREL 8.80 incorrectly uses Normal Theory
Weighted Least Squares x2 instead of S-B x2 when calculating the S-B x2. Several
additional fit indices were used to provide additional information about the degree of
difference in fit between models. The root-mean-square-error-of-approximation
(RMSEA) and standardized root-mean-square residual (SRMR) were chosen from the
family of absolute fit indices. The RMSEA addresses the parsimony of the model by
estimating the proportion of specification error per degree of freedom (Raykov &
Marcoulides, 2000), while the SRMR summarizes the average covariance residuals. The
comparative fit index (CFI) was chosen as this study’s incremental index; it compares the
fit of the hypothesized model against an independence model where all observed
variables are uncorrelated. Hu and Bentler (1998, 1999) recommended these model-data

54
fit indices because they are sensitive to misspecified factor loadings and misspecified
factor correlations.
This study followed Fagan’s (2014b) approach to interpreting fit indexes: a
RMSEA cutoff value of .06 or less to indicate close fit (Hu & Bentler, 1999), with .10 or
greater indicating bad fit (Browne & Cudeck, 1993); a CFI value of .95 or above (Hu &
Bentler, 1999); and an SRMR cutoff value of .08 or less (Hu & Bentler, 1998, 1999).
This study also examined standardized covariance residuals: high positive residuals
suggest a model is underestimating relationship between items, while negative residuals
indicate items are less related than the model implies.
Because the measurement models included a covariate which affected as many
latent variables as were specified, they were not nested and were therefore compared with
AIC. Some path models were nested, and these were compared with the Satorra-Bentler
x2 difference test (Bryant & Satorra, 2012).
Procedures—MANCOVA
Groups of libraries were created using the Carnegie Classifications Basic, Size &
Setting (Residential Status), Undergraduate Instructional Program, and Graduate
Program. Undergraduate Instruction Program was further divided into its two component
parts, Balance between Arts & Sciences vs. Professional Programs (“Program Balance”),
and Graduate Program Coexistence (“Graduate Coexistence”).
Multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) was conducted using SPSS 20
to determine the extent to which these groups varied in terms of Circulation, Full-Text
Articles, and Gate Count. Separately, MANCOVAs were conducted to determine the
extent to which these groups varied across the independent variables Participants in

55
Group Presentations, Reference Transactions, Interlibrary Loans, Reserves Circulations,
Ongoing Expenditures, One-Time Expenditures, Librarian / Professional FTE, Staff FTE,
Average Librarian / Professional Salary, Average Staff Salary, Library Expenditures as a
Proportion of Institutional Expenditures, and Social Media.
MANCOVA is a statistical test building off the principles of analysis of variance
(ANOVA), which uses a linear model to compare differences between the means of more
than two groups. Both MANCOVA and ANOVA test the ratio of systematic variance to
unsystematic variance (the F-ratio) and compare groups to determine if the group means
are statistically different. If the groups are statistically different, follow-up tests can be
performed to determine which of the groups are different. MANCOVA is different than
ANOVA because it 1) includes a covariate in the model, allowing the researcher to
control for factors such as age (or in this study’s case, full-time students and faculty) and
2) allows the model to predict multiple dependent variables simultaneously. By
performing a MANCOVA instead of an ANOVA, Type-I error is reduced by the number
of dependent variables included in the model. Also, MANCOVA accounts for
relationships between the dependent variables. Thus, MANCOVA allows researchers to
detect whether groups are different on a combination of variables, controlling for a
covariate.
To determine whether the sample size provided adequate statistical power, the
procedures proposed by D’Amico, Neilands, and Zambarano (2001) were followed.
Because the sample size for 2010 was so much smaller than 2012, only the 2012 sample
was used for the MANCOVAs. The SPSS MANOVA procedure was used on a data
matrix containing the mean and cell size values for each IV and covariate, the average

56
standard deviation, and a correlation matrix. For models with three dependent variables,
sample sizes were more than sufficient, however for the models with twelve IVs, power
estimates were sufficient for multivariate tests and for most (but not all) univariate tests.
For the most complex model (twelve IV and five groups), the power estimate for
multivariate tests was .95, and most power estimates for univariate tests were .90 or
above. Low power levels for univariate tests were discussed when less than .75.
Univariate and multivariate outliers had previously been removed from the
datasets used for the MANCOVAs and assumptions of normality (after log
transformation) linearity, and multicollinearity had previously been supported (see Data
Screening section). While sample sizes across cells were uneven, multivariate normality
for each cell was supported by having more cases than DVs in each cell (Tabachnick &
Fidell, 2007). SPSS’s default method was used to adjust for unequal n. Box’s M provided
an initial sign of whether the covariance matrices are homogenous (a significant Box’s
test suggests the matrices are not homogenous). However, Tabachnick and Fidell (2007)
noted that Box’s test is very sensitive to unequal group sizes. When Box’s M is
significant, the researcher further evaluated homogeneity of variance-covariance matrices
by comparing sample variances for each DV across the groups; all were found to be well
below the recommended ratio of 10:1 (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2007). A scatterplot of
predicted values and standardized residuals for each dependent variable further supported
normality of the data.
Since some of the Box’s M tests were significant, Pillai’s Trace was chosen as the
multivariate test to report for each MANCOVA based on recommendations by
Tabachnick & Fidell (2007), because it is more robust to unequal group sizes. For each

57
MANCOVA analysis, univariate tests were also examined. These tests show what the
results would have been from an ANCOVA using the same groups, but with only the
individual dependent variable. It is important to keep in mind that these univariate results
therefore do not include any effects of correlation among the DVs.
For the significant univariate results, graphs of means for each dependent
variable, adjusted for the covariate, were generated in the original units of measurement.
The procedure was to take the inverse log of the adjusted means and 95% confidence
intervals (Bland & Altman, 1996b). It is important to note that reversing a log
transformation of a mean produces the geometric mean of the original data. The
geometric mean is still a measure of central tendency, but is different from the value of
the arithmetic mean. Also, confidence intervals around the geometric mean may be
asymmetrical after reverse transformation. Thus, the graphs are useful for interpreting the
magnitude and significance of mean differences, but the mean values may not match
arithmetic means calculated directly from the original data.
The effect size partial eta squared (

2

) was calculated to enable comparison

across MANCOVAs. Partial eta squared is the proportion of variance explained in the
dependent variable(s) that is explained by the independent variable(s). Stevens (1996)
continues to recommend the following guidelines based on Cohen’s (1977) experience
with small, medium, and large effects for

2

, respectively: .01, .06, and .14. Careful

readers will note a seeming disparity between the magnitude of the effect sizes for the
DVs and the differences in adjusted means. This is because the effect sizes include
consideration of the correlation between DVs. For example, the correlations between
Gate Count and Full-Text Downloads, Gate Count and Circulation, and Full-Text

58
Downloads and Circulation (controlling for the covariate) were .16, .34, and .20,
respectively. While the multivariate effect sizes treat the three DV multivariately, and are
reduced based on these correlations, the adjusted means are based on simple pairwise
comparisons of adjusted means between the DVs and do not take the correlations into
consideration.
Procedures—Regression
After determining the extent to which groups of libraries differ, a series of
sequential regressions were conducted to determine how well the amount of external
research dollars could be predicted by the library use variables Circulation, Full-Text
Articles, and Gate Count. Selected Carnegie Classifications were also entered as
predictors using dummy coding, as well as the interactions between the library use
variables and Carnegie Classification variables. Full-Time Students Plus Faculty was
used as the covariate to control for institutional size.
The Carnegie Classifications chosen for the regression models included Carnegie
Classification – Basic, Graduate Coexistence, and Graduate Instruction Program. The
eleven Graduate Instruction Program categories were collapsed into four groups based on
the MANCOVA results related to this Classification: Doctoral Schools-Comprehensive,
Doctoral Schools-STEM, Other Doctoral, and Master’s Schools. For example, the
MANCOVAs suggested there were differences between the Doctoral Comprehensive
groups and the Master’s schools, but little difference among the Master’s school groups
themselves. The two other Carnegie Classifications (Undergraduate Programs, Arts &
Sciences vs. Professional Program Balance and Size & Setting) were not examined

59
because there was no hypothesized effect of these group differences on the variables of
interest with respect to external research dollars.
In general, regression procedures fit a linear model to a dataset and use the model
to predict a dependent variable from one or more independent variables (also known as
predictor variables). If theory suggests predictors could interact, then “interaction
variables” can be created by multiplying the two independent variables together and
entering the interaction variables as additional parameters in the model. Results of a
regression analysis provide an overall test of the fit of the model as well as estimates of
the contributions individual predictors and interactions make to the model. Overall fit is
evaluated with the F-ratio, which is a proportion of how much the model has improved
the prediction of the outcome variable to the level of inaccuracy of the model.
Sequential regression (sometimes called hierarchical regression) allows one or
more predictors to be entered into the model in “steps.” In this study, sequential
regression was used to enter the covariate, Full-time Students Plus Faculty in a first step,
thus allowing an estimate of how much influence it has on the outcome. The predictor
variables of interest were entered in Steps 2 and 3, and all interactions were entered in
Step 4.
Following recommendations from Cohen, Cohen, West, and Aiken (2003), all
continuous predictors were centered so they could be entered into analyses containing
interactions. Centering allows effects of individual predictors to be interpreted at the
mean of the sample, provides the average effects of individual predictors across the range
of the other variables, and eliminates multicollinearity between the individual predictors
and the interaction effects containing those predictors. The basic procedure for centering

60
is simply to subtract the mean of each variable from the value of each case’s value for
that variable.
As with the library data, the distribution of External Research Dollars was
extremely skewed, and was therefore log transformed for both 2010 and 2012 datasets.
Linearity of the data was examined using bivariate scatterplots and homoscedasticity was
examined by examining residual plots.
2010 Merged Dataset
The ACRL 2010 dataset (originally 330 institutions) was merged with 2010 data
from HERD by mapping IPEDS identifiers to FICE identifiers. This process left 142
cases in the combined dataset. As shown in Table 12, the merged dataset had lower
representation from Baccalaureate Colleges-General and higher representation from
Doctoral/Research Universities-Extensive. Interpretation of results therefore applied to a
somewhat different population of institutions than the other models in this study.
Mahalanobis distance was evaluated using a linear regression of all predictor
variables on ID, and six cases were deleted (two Baccalaureate, two medical schools, a
masters school, and a law school), bringing the total to 136.
2012 Merged Dataset
The ACRL 2012 dataset (originally 447 institutions) was merged with 2012 data
from HERD by mapping IPEDS identifiers to FICE identifiers. This process left 214
cases in the combined dataset. As shown in Table 13, the merged dataset had lower
representation from Baccalaureate Colleges-General and higher representation from
Doctoral/Research Universities-Extensive and Doctoral/Research Universities-Intensive.

Mahalanobis distance was evaluated using a linear regression of all predictor
variables on the case id, and three cases were deleted (a Medical School, a Baccalaureate
Colleges-General school, and a Doctoral/Research Universities-Intensive school),
bringing the total to 211. Linearity of the data was examined using bivariate scatterplots
and homoscedasticity was examined by examining residual plots.
For linear regression, Tabachnick and Fidell (2007, p. 123) suggest a sample size
of 50 + 8m, where m is the number of IVs for testing the overall regression equation, and
104 + m for testing individual predictors, assuming a medium effect size, α=.05 and
β=.20. For the Carnegie Classifications with 3 groups, there were 7 IVs (including the
covariate), meaning a sample size of 74 was required for testing the overall regression
and 111 for testing individual predictors, so both 2012 and 2010 samples were sufficient
for this series of models.
Hypotheses
Speaking in general terms, this study’s underlying theory was that a university
that believes in the value of its library invests increased resources in staff, and that in
turn, those staff support the library’s role in providing services. The proportion of money
spent on Ongoing Expenditures (subscription journals) and One-Time Expenditures
(books and journal backfiles) was also hypothesized to have an effect on the levels of
library use. Because of the exploratory nature of this study, the researcher has posed
several alternate models to explore.
For almost all the models in this study, it was theorized that Full-Time Students
Plus Faculty would make an effective covariate because of high correlations with the
indicator variables. For models with the Carnegie Size & Setting classification, an

63
alternative covariate, Part-Time Students Plus Full-Time Students and Faculty, was tested
because the classification uses part-time status as part of the group membership criteria.
Hypotheses—Covariates
Covariate Hypothesis 1a: There will be no meaningful correlation between Full-Time
Students Plus Faculty and the dependent variables Circulation, Full-Text Articles, and
Gate Count.
Covariate Hypothesis 1b: There will be no meaningful correlation between Average
Expenditures Per Student and the dependent variables Circulation, Full-Text Articles, and
Gate Count.
Covariate Hypothesis 1c: There will be no meaningful correlation between Basic
Carnegie Classification and the dependent variables Circulation, Full-Text Articles, and
Gate Count.
Covariate Hypothesis 2: After controlling for Full-Time Students Plus Faculty, there will
be no meaningful group mean differences between institutions’ Carnegie Classifications.
The covariate Full-Time Students Plus Faculty will be specified in SEM models
following Markell and Frone (1998) and Bengt and Muthén (1989). As with Markel and
Frone (1998), this study’s covariate consisted of a single item (Full-Time Students Plus
Faculty) and reflected objective demographic information, so no adjustments were made
for random measurement error. Thus, to include the covariate into the measurement
model, its factor loading was fixed to 1 and its measurement error was fixed to zero.

64
Hypotheses—SEM Model Family A: Dependent Variables as Observed
Variables
In model family A (Figure 4), it was hypothesized that Gate Count is predicted by
Engagement With Library Services because those services are what attract patrons to the
library building. Full-Text Articles and Circulation were hypothesized to be predicted by
Engagement With Library Services, but also to be influenced by ongoing and One-Time
Expenditures. Thus, a key attribute of this model family was treating Circulation, FullText Articles, and Gate Count as observed variables rather than combining them into a
latent variable. Because One-Time Expenditures includes journal article backfiles and
one-time fees, variants of this model were tested with and without a path between OneTime Expenditures and Full-Text Articles (as shown by the dotted lines). Engagement
With Library Services was thought to be predicted by Investment in Library Staff.
Finally, Investment in Staff and the two expenditure variables were all thought to vary
based on Library Expenditures as a Proportion of Institutional Expenditures. The
measurement portions of this model were tested with and without the salary variables,
reserves, and social media variables because of the suspiciously low bivariate
correlations.
Measurement Model A-1: The one factor model
Measurement Model A-1, The one factor model (Figure 5) was tested mostly for
comparison purposes. There was no real theoretical basis to this model other than that
these are all indicators of library activity. Since the more complex models are based on
theory, if they did not fit significantly worse than this model, that would support their use
in a hybrid SEM model.

65
Figure 4. Hybrid model for Model Family A.

Figure 5. Measurement Model A-1: One factor.

66
Figure 6 shows the full measurement model for Model A, with two factors.

Figure 6. Measurement model A-2: Two factors.

Engagement With Library Services can be measured with five indicators:
Participants in Group Presentations, Reference Transactions, Reserves Circulation, Social
Media, and Interlibrary Loans. Investment in staff is measured with the indicators
Librarian / Professional FTE, Staff FTE, Average Librarian / Professional Salary, and
Average Staff Salary.
A third measurement model, A-3, tested the model-data fit without the variables
Average Librarian / Professional Salary, Average Staff Salary, and Reserves Circulation.
Hypotheses—SEM Model Family B: Dependent Variables as Latent Variable
The only difference between model family A and model family B was that rather than
measuring Gate Count, Full-Text Articles, and Circulation as observed variables, they

67
were combined in one latent variable, Library Use, specified as predicted by Engagement
With Library Services, Ongoing Expenditures, and One-Time Expenditures (Figure 7).

Figure 7. Hybrid model for Model Family B

Because an additional latent variable was specified, there were additional
measurement models to test. The one-factor measurement model added the three
indicators Gate Count, Full Text Article Requests, and Circulation to Model A-1 to form
the one-factor measurement model for Model Family B (Figure 8).

68
Figure 8. One-factor measurement model for Model Family B

A two-factor measurement model to be tested loaded the “Engagement With
Library Services” indicators on “Investment in Staff” to form an “Investment” variable
(Figure 9).

Figure 9. Two-factor measurement model for Model Family B

69
The measurement model for Model Family B with all three factors is shown in
Figure 10, and was tested with and without the indicators shown with dotted lines.

Figure 10. Three-factor measurement model for Model Family B

Hypotheses—SEM Model Family C: Combining Staff and Resources
Model Family C experimented with creating a latent variable “Investment in Staff and
Resources” measured by Staff FTE variables and both One-Time and Ongoing
Expenditures (Figure 11). This was to reflect the reality that the two overwhelming
categories in an academic library’s budget are personnel and collections. Perhaps they
were both indicators of the institution’s investment in the library. Alternative hybrid
models are planned with this latent variable predicting Library Use directly as well as
through Engagement With Library Services, and also with this latent variable predicting
Library Use ONLY through Engagement With Library Services (with the dotted line to
Library Use removed).

70
Figure 11. Hybrid model for Model Family C

The one-factor measurement model for Model Family C (Figure 12) was the same
as for A and B, however the two-factor model differed by having the two expenditures
variables join the Staff FTE variables in measuring Investment in Staff and Resources.
The library salary variables would be specified as indicators of Investment in Staff and
Resources if they were retained in models A and B.

71
Figure 12. Two-factor measurement model for Model Family C

The three-factor measurement model for Model Family C separated the Library
Use factor from Engagement With Library Services (Figure 13). The model was tested
with and without the indicators shown with dotted lines. (Again, the library salary
variables would be specified as indicators of Investment in Staff and Resources if they
were retained in models A and B).

Figure 13. Three-factor measurement model for Model Family C

72

Hypotheses—SEM Structural Models
Evaluating the structural models depended on the success of evaluating the
measurement models. If the measurement models indicated the structural models should
be evaluated, the structural models would be tested with some variants.
For model family A, structures with and without the path between One-Time
Expenditures and Full-Text Articles were specified (Figure 14). Models with and without
paths between the expenditures variables were specified, as were models with and
without correlations between the three variables Circulation, Full-Text Articles, and Gate
Count.
Figure 14. Structural model for Model Family A

Similar variants with correlations between the expenditure variables and the three
indicators of library use in Model family B were also specified (Figure 15).

73
Figure 15. Structural model for Model Family B

For Model Family C, variants with correlations set between the three indicators of
library use were also specified, as were structural models with and without the path
between Investment In Staff and Resources and Library Use (Figure 16).

Figure 16. Structural model for Model Family C

Hypotheses—SEM Additional Models
Because this study is largely exploratory, it was unlikely for the measurement
models to reproduce the relationships found in the covariance matrixes with close fit. For
this reason, the researcher anticipated the need for several path models to be tested based

74
on analysis of the residuals in the models that do not fit, and on the other investigations in
this study.
Hypotheses—MANCOVA
MANCOVA Hypothesis 1: There will be no meaningful group mean differences
on a multivariate combination of Circulation, Full-Text Articles, and Gate Count between
institutions grouped by Carnegie Classification – Basic, Carnegie Classification – Size &
Setting (Residential Status), Carnegie Classification – Undergraduate Instruction
Program (Arts & Science vs. Professional Program Balance), Carnegie Classification –
Undergraduate Instruction Program (Graduate Coexistence), or Carnegie Classification –
Graduate Instruction Program.
MANCOVA Hypothesis 2: There will be no meaningful group mean differences
on a multivariate combination of Participants in Group Presentations, Reference
Transactions, Interlibrary Loans, Reserves Circulations, Ongoing Expenditures, OneTime Expenditures, Librarian / Professional FTE, Staff FTE, Average Librarian Salary,
Average Staff Salary, Library Expenditures as a Proportion of Institutional Expenditures,
and Social Media between institutions grouped by Carnegie Classification – Basic,
Carnegie Classification – Size & Setting (Residential Status), Carnegie Classification –
Undergraduate Instruction Program (Arts & Science vs. Professional Program Balance),
Carnegie Classification – Undergraduate Instruction Program (Graduate Coexistence), or
Carnegie Classification – Graduate Instruction Program.

75
Hypotheses—Regression
Regression Hypothesis 1: There will be no significant effect of Circulation, Full-Text
Articles, and Gate Count on External Research Dollars after controlling for Full-Time
Students plus Faculty.
Regression Hypothesis 2: There will be no significant effect of Carnegie Classification –
Basic, Carnegie Classification – Undergraduate Instruction Program, Graduate
Coexistence, and Carnegie Classification – Graduate Instruction Program on predicting
External Research Dollars after controlling for Full-Time Students plus Faculty.
Regression Hypothesis 3: There will be no significant interaction effect between
Circulation, Full-Text Articles, and Gate Count and the Carnegie Classifications on
External Research Dollars after controlling for Full-Time Students plus Faculty.
Limitations
This study’s design had several limitations. First, because libraries do not separate
statistics by patron type, almost all the variables in this study included a blend of student,
faculty, and community patrons. Furthermore, the proportion of students to faculty within
each variable may vary dramatically. For example, although students outnumber faculty,
faculty may be responsible for more full-text article downloads than students because
faculty research generally spans longer periods of time and often is of greater intensity
and focus. The proportion of students to faculty may also vary across libraries. Although
many libraries’ data for participants in group presentations will represent only students,
the official ACRL definition is not limited to students, and is broad in its conception. So
it is entirely plausible that a library with a workshop series designed for faculty has a
larger proportion of faculty in the reported count than a library that thinks of this count as

76
“just bibliographic instruction.” This study controlled for institutional size by using fulltime students and faculty. However there could have been variance in the model
unaccounted for related to the fluctuations among patron types.
Although this study was limited to four-year institutions, there are many other
institutional variables that might have affected the variables in this study (as discussed in
the literature review). While exploring research questions related to institutional
differences seems like an important area for future research, it was considered to be
beyond the scope of the present study. However, when interpreting results from this
study, it is important to keep in mind that this study’s findings will not account for
variance by institutional type. The examination of differences between Carnegie
Classification variables should at least provide some evidence of whether future studies
should examine institutional differences more closely.

77
Chapter 4: Results
Results—Covariates
As a first step to exploring the relationships of the covariates on the dependent
variables, bivariate correlations of the covariates and the three dependent variables were
conducted. Dummy coding was used for the variable Carnegie Classification – Basic to
create three groups: Baccalaureate, Master’s, and Doctoral institutions.
Dummy coding is a method for using categorical variables (i.e., nominal
variables) as independent variables (Cohen, Cohen, West, & Aiken, 2003). One category,
usually the first or last, is chosen as the comparison group, and coded variables are
created to represent different aspects (or levels) of the independent variable. In this case,
Baccalaureate institutions were chosen as the comparison group. When interpreting
results involving dummy codes, statistics are interpreted as “difference from the
comparison group.” If one wishes to compare differences between groups and neither
was selected as the comparison group, one can create a second set of dummy variables
using a different group as the comparison group.
Based on Hemphill’s (2003) meta-analysis of correlation coefficient guidelines
(which include a review of the famous Cohen guidelines) and his cautions in using such
guidelines, the following criteria were used to classify correlation coefficients: small
(<.20), medium (.20 to .40), and large (>.40).
Correlations between the Full-Time Students Plus Faculty and the three dependent
variables were large, ranging from .62 for Circulation to .70 for Full-Text Articles in
2010, and from .73 for Circulation to .82 for Gate Count in 2012 (Tables 14 and 15).
Thus, Full-Time Students Plus Faculty was retained for further analysis. Covariate

78
Hypothesis 1a, “There will be no meaningful correlation between Full-Time Students
Plus Faculty and the dependent variables Circulation, Full-Text Articles, and Gate
Count,” was rejected.

Correlations between Average Expenditures Per Student and the three dependent
variables were small in both the 2010 and 2012 data (Tables 14 and 15). Hypothesis 1b,

79
“There will be no meaningful correlation between average expenditures per student and
the dependent variables Circulation, Full-Text Articles, and Gate Count,” was supported.
Therefore, Average Expenditures Per Student was excluded from further use as a
covariate.
The correlations between the Carnegie Basic classifications and the three
dependent variables were low to moderate in size for the 2010 sample, ranging from .17
to -.37. These were dummy-coded variables, so the correlation indicates the increase in
relationship strength above that of the reference group, Baccalaureate institutions. For
example, in 2010, master’s institutions had .17 sd higher library circulation than
Baccalaureate institutions, while Doctoral institutions had .33 sd higher library
circulation than Baccalaureate institutions. In the 2012 sample, the change in correlation
from Baccalaureate to Master’s institutions were much smaller (.03 to -.07), while the
change in correlation between Baccalaureate and Doctoral was large (.51 to .54). Based
on these results, Covariate Hypothesis 1c, “There will be no correlation between Basic
Carnegie Classification and the dependent variables Circulation, Full-Text Articles, and
Gate Count,” was rejected.
To further analyze the covariates, a series of sequential linear regressions was
performed by entering each of the covariates in separate blocks, then adding all the
independent variables in a third block. The independent variables were Participants in
Group Presentations, Reference Transactions, Interlibrary Loans, Reserves Circulations,
Ongoing Expenditures, One-Time Expenditures, Librarian FTE, Staff FTE, Average
Librarian Salary, Average Staff Salary, and Library Expenditures as a Proportion of

80
Institutional Expenditures. Then, each of the three dependent variables was predicted in
turn.
When Full-Time Students Plus Faculty was entered in the first block, and
Carnegie Classification – Basic was entered in the second block, the only significant Fchange was when predicting Full-Text Articles, and the value of the change in R2 was
very small (0.02). Because of the increased sample size in 2012, the F-changes were all
statistically significant, but the effect sizes were similarly small. Because the additional
variance predicted by Carnegie Classification was so small, it was not used as a covariate
in the SEM analyses. However, Carnegie Classification was still explored in the
MANCOVAs to examine mean differences across institutional types.
As a side note, in all three equations the independent variables explained a
statistically significant amount of additional variance in the dependent variables: 25.5%
(Circulation), 7.7% (Full-Text Articles), and 12.5% (Gate Count). In 2012, the R2
changes were 16.1% for Circulation and 5.5% for both Full-Text Articles and Gate
Count. Tables 16 and 17 show the results from the 2010 and 2012 regression analyses.
Social Media – Purpose was not entered into the 2012 regression equations used
to analyze covariates so that 2010 and 2012 could be compared. However, an additional
three regressions were run with the Social Media – Purpose variable included for 2012 to
explore the effects of adding this variable. The results from the final step of the model are
shown in the fourth row for each of the dependent variables in Table 17. The R2 change
values increased slightly for the models predicting Circulation and Full-Text Articles
(1.4% and 1.1%) and decreased slightly for the model predicting Gate Count (-0.2%).

Results—SEM
The SEM measurement models were first tested on the 2010 dataset using FullTime Students Plus Faculty as a covariate. The 2012 dataset was held in reserve as a
potential cross-validation dataset for re-testing models that fit, or for testing alternative
models based on modifications to ill-fitting models from the tests with 2012 data.
Model Family A: Dependent Variables as Observed Variables
Measurement models A-1 and A-2 both failed the S-B x2 test, as shown in Table
18. Only Model A-1 met the chosen guidelines for fit. Looking at the Akaike Information
Criterion (AIC), Model A-3 (the one without the salary variables and Reserves
Circulation) is the most likely to replicate among these measurement models (Kline,
2010, p. 220). However, the RMSEA values of .12 and .14 suggest that the latent
constructs are a not a good fit with the data as specified.

Looking at the standardized covariance residuals for Model A-3 reveals potential
areas of misfit (Table 19). Librarian / Professional FTE and Staff FTE (indicators on the
latent variable Investment in Library Staff) share large standardized covariance residuals
with two of the indicators for Engagement With Library Services, namely, Reference

84
Transactions and Interlibrary Loans, indicating something is shared between them that is
not represented by the model.

Because the measurement models for Model Family A did not fit, and the
residuals suggested paths between staff and library service variables, the hybrid model
combining a measurement component and path model (A-4) was not tested. Instead, the
researcher went on to evaluate a series of path models where just one indicator was tested
in place of the latent variables Investment in Staff and Engagement With Library
Services. Because Participants in Group Presentations entails direct engagement with
students and bears the most relevance to “high-impact practices,” it was chosen to
represent Engagement With Library Services. Because librarians are usually the teachers
of these classes, the variable Professional FTE was chosen to represent Investment in
Staff. Because ILL and Participants in Group Presentations had a very small standardized
residual, it was hypothesized that Participants in Group Presentations could predict
Interlibrary Loans, as well as Gate Count, Full-Text Articles, and Circulation, During
library instruction classes, library services are advertised to students, theoretically

85
increasing use. Ongoing Expenditures and One-Time Expenditures were left in the model
as predictors of Full-Text Articles and Circulation. Variations in the model tested for
correlations among the DVs Interlibrary Loans, Gate Count, Full-Text Articles, and
Circulation, as well as the existence of a path between One-Time Expenditures and FullText Articles.
The simplest of these models, Path-A1, had no correlations among the DVs and
no path between One-Time Expenditures and Full-Text Articles (Figure 17).

Figure 17. Path Model A-1, Simplest path model predicting Interlibrary Loans, Gate
Count, Full-Text Articles, and Circulation, uncorrelated DVs.

The next model (Path A-2) added a path from One-Time Expenditures to FullText Article Requests (Figure 18).

86

The third model in the series added covariances to the four dependent variables
(Figure 19).

The fourth model in the series added a path between One-Time Expenditures and
Full-Text Articles (Figure 20).

As shown in Table 20, none of the path models fit, whether looking at the S-B x2
test, SRMR, or RMSEA.

Looking at the standardized residuals for these models revealed many large areas
of misfit. There were 13 standardized residuals greater than 3 for even the most complex
of the models (Path-A4), with no logical pattern among them. Therefore, the researcher
moved on to Model Family B.
Model Family B: Dependent Variables as Latent Variable
None of the B-family of models passed the S-B x2 test or fit the criteria for overall
fit set for this study (Table 21). Model B-1 came close, but its RMSEA did not meet the
guidelines. In addition, looking at the best-fitting model based on AIC, (B-3) there were
10 standardized residuals greater than 3 and one negative standardized residual. For B-4,
the most complex of the B-family of models (Three-factor, with dashed lines), there were
24 standardized covariance residuals greater than 3 and one negative standardized
residual.

This study investigated the possibility of creating latent variables using multiple
variables from ACRL and ALS data. However, none of the measurement models tested
met the chosen criteria for fit. Thus, the variables chosen do not seem to have formed
meaningful constructs. For that reason, the researcher’s next step was to continue
exploring data through the MANCOVA and regression models detailed in other sections
of this study, then return to SEM to propose and test several alternative path models that
tested relationships among the data by including only observed variables. Path models are
essentially an extension of linear regression but allow multiple mediated relationships to
be included in the model.

90
Alternative Path Models / Regressions
The variables to be explored in the alternative path models and the relationships
between them were chosen after examining the results from MANCOVA and regression
results of this study. A recurring area of interest across the models in this study was the
relationship between Full-Text Articles, Interlibrary Loans, Ongoing Resources, and
Participants in Group Presentations. Full-Time Students plus Faculty was a meaningful
covariate throughout the study, so it was included as a covariate in these alternative path
models as well. Because the MANCOVAs showed differences between Doctoral and
other institutions, the samples used for these path models were separated into just
Doctoral institutions and Master’s plus Baccalaureate institutions. As discussed earlier,
this limited the sample size and therefore the power of the test; however, the sample
exceeded minimum guidelines.
The theory behind these models was that libraries with more Participants in Group
Presentations will have greater Full-Text Articles and Interlibrary Loans, because
students and faculty will be more aware of library resources and services. Ongoing
Expenditures was also thought to predict Full-Text Articles because the more a library
spends on its subscriptions, the more articles are available for use by students and faculty.
These relationships could be situated in terms of resource dependence theory (Malatesta
& Smith, 2014), which describes how one part of an organization (faculty and students)
may be dependent on another (the library) for needed resources.
Alternative Path Model 1 specified these relationships, and added a covariance
between Interlibrary Loans and Full-Text Articles (Figure 21).

91
Figure 21. Alternative Path Model 1.

Alternative Path Model 1a was identical, but removed the covariance between
Interlibrary Loans and Full-Text Articles (Figure 22).

Figure 22. Alternative Path Model 1a.

92
Alternative Path Model 2 proposed that Ongoing Expenditures negatively relates to
Interlibrary Loans, because if a library spends sufficient dollars on its subscriptions, then
patrons should be finding what they need at their local library and not require so many
Interlibrary Loans. Also, the correlation between Interlibrary Loans and Full-Text
Articles was added back in (Figure 23).

Figure 23. Alternative Path Model 2.

Finally, Alternative Path Model 2a removed the covariance between Interlibrary
Loans and Full-Text Articles (Figure 24).

93
Figure 24. Alternative Path Model 2a.

Since the degrees of freedom were so small for these models, the RMSEA, which
is the specification error per degree of freedom, was not used as a criteria for model-data
fit. Mardia’s Normalized Multivariate Kurtosis values for the four models tested ranged
from -34.5 to -46.1, indicating the data was non-normal (despite the log transformation);
therefore, Satorra-Bentler adjustments to the chi-square test and standard errors were
used. While none of the models met the S-B x2 test for absolute fit, two of the models,
APM 2 and 2a, met the criteria for SRMR and CFI (Table 23).

The difference between APM2 and APM 2a was simply the removal of the
covariance between the two dependent variables, Full-Text Articles and Interlibrary
Loans. Model 2a did not fit significantly worse than Model 2 (S-B x2 diff =2.33, p=.13),
was more parsimonious, and had no theoretically-based advantage, so it is the one
championed.
Looking at the structural equations shown in Figure 25, 62% of the variance in
Full-Text Articles was explained by the model. For every standard deviation increase in
Ongoing Expenditures, Full-Text Articles increased by .55 sd. The coefficients for the
effect of Participants in Group Presentations on Full-Text Articles are shown for
comparison purposes, but were not significant (t=1.82, p<.05).
With respect to Interlibrary Loans, 50% of the variance was explained by this
model. For every sd increase in Ongoing Expenditures, Interlibrary Loans increased by
.51 sd. Again, the coefficients for the effect of Participants in Group Presentations on
Interlibrary Loans are shown for comparison purposes, but are not significant (t=.42,
p<.05). 47% of the variance in Ongoing Expenditures and 62% of the variance in
Participants in Group Presentations, was explained by this model.
The covariate, Full-Time Students plus Faculty, influenced Participants in Group
Presentations and Ongoing Expenditures much more than Interlibrary Loans or Full-Text
Articles. For every sd increase in Full-time Students and Faculty, Participants in Group
Presentations increased by .79 sd; Ongoing Expenditures increased by .69 sd. The
coefficients for the effect of Full-Time Students plus Faculty on Interlibrary Loans and
Full-Text Articles were not significant, (t=1.86; t=1.50, p<.05).

95
There was only one standardized residual noted, between Interlibrary Loans and
Full-Text Articles, of 2.18. However, since a model was tested where these two variables
were allowed to correlate, and it did not fit significantly better, this residual does not
seem meaningful to the model’s interpretation.

Because the MANCOVA tests showed differences between Doctoral institutions
and Baccalaureate and Master’s institutions, but no significant differences between
Baccalaureate and Master’s institutions, the researcher decided to test the championed
alternative path model using a sample combining Baccalaureate and Master’s institutions
(2012). The dataset was screened and cleaned as with the other datasets, resulting in 367
cases. Mardia’s Multivariate Normality coefficient was -59.24, meaning the Satorra-

96
Bentler adjustment with maximum-likelihood estimation would still be important to
correct standard errors and the chi-square test.
Probably because of the larger sample size (N=367), the model’s fit indexes
showed improvement (CFI=.99; SRMR=.03; AIC=44.97), although the S-B x2 was still
significant, indicating a lack of absolute fit (Table 24).

Looking at the structural equations shown in Figure 26, 57% of the variance in
Full-Text Articles was explained by the model. For every sd increase in Ongoing
Expenditures, Full-Text Articles increased by .27 sd. The coefficients for the effect of
Participants in Group Presentations on Full-Text Articles are shown for comparison
purposes, but were not significant (t=1.60, p<.05).
With respect to Interlibrary Loans, 45% of the variance was explained by this
model. For every sd increase in Ongoing Expenditures, Interlibrary Loans increased by
.60 sd. The coefficient for the effect of Participants in Group Presentations on Interlibrary
Loans was significant for Baccalaureate and Master’s; for every sd increase in
Participants, Interlibrary Loans increased by .26 sd.
Fifty-seven percent of the variance in Ongoing Expenditures and 67% of the
variance in Participants in Group Presentations in the Baccalaureate and Master’s dataset
were explained by this model.

97
The covariate, Full-Time Students plus Faculty, continued to influence
Participants in Group Presentations and Ongoing Expenditures much more than
Interlibrary Loans or Full-Text Articles. For every sd increase in Full-time Students and
Faculty, Participants in Group Presentations increased by .82 sd; Ongoing Expenditures
increased by .75 sd. The coefficients for the effect of Full-Time Students plus Faculty on
Full-Text Articles were significant with this sample; for each sd increase in Full-Time
Students and Faculty, Full-Text Articles increased by .44 sd. The coefficient for the effect
of the covariate on ILs was not significant (t=-1.87, p<.05).
Similar to the Doctoral schools, there was a standardized residual between
LOG_FT and LOG_ILL, but more interestingly, there was a large standardized residual
(6.40) between Ongoing Expenditures and Participants in Group Presentations, indicating
that for Baccalaureate and Master’s schools, these two variables have a relationship
unexpressed by the model.

Results—MANCOVA
Groups of libraries were compared using four of the Carnegie Classifications:
Basic, Size & Setting (Residential Status), Undergraduate Instruction Program, and
Graduate Instruction Program. Carnegie Classification Undergraduate Instruction
Program was further divided into its two component parts, Balance between Arts &
Sciences vs. Professional Programs (“Program Balance”), and Graduate Program
Coexistence (“Graduate Coexistence”). Thus, five sets of two MANCOVAs each were
performed. A summary of the levels of each of the five groups is shown in Table 25.

Carnegie Classification Basic
For this study, the many values for Basic Carnegie Classification (Carnegie
Foundation, 2014) were re-coded into Baccalaureate, Master’s, and Doctoral institutions.
Associates, Special-Focus, and Tribal Colleges were excluded from this analysis. Thus,
independent variables were the categories Baccalaureate, Master’s, and Doctoral
institutions. For the MANCOVA using three DVs, the sample of 447 was reduced to 410
after eliminating schools with other values for this classification (e.g., “Other Specialized
Institutions”). For the MANCOVA using the twelve variables, the cases were reduced to
329 because of missing values for the Social Media variable. Box’s M test was found to
be insignificant for the first MANCOVA involving the three DVs. However, it was
significant for the second MANCOVA, with the twelve variables, which is a sign the
covariance matrices of the DVs were not equal across groups. However, the variances
across DVs fell within the 10:1 ratio recommended by Tabachnick and Fidell (2007).
For the MANCOVA testing the three dependent variables Circulation, Full-Text
Articles, and Gate Count, the covariate’s effect on the combined DVs was significant and
had a large effect size (Pillai’s Trace F(3, 404)=200.80, p<.01,

2

=.60) (Table 26). The

combined DV’s variance across Baccalaureate, Master’s, and Doctoral institutions was
statistically significant, but with a small effect size (Pillai’s Trace F(6, 810)=5.93, p<.01,
2

=.04). Separate univariate tests showed significant effects of group membership on

Circulation F(2, 406)=6.58, p < .01,

individual DVs as predicted by Basic Carnegie Classification was about 3% for each DV.

Contrasts were performed using a Bonferroni adjustment to correct for Type I
error. For Full-Text Articles, Doctoral schools had statistically significantly higher means
than Master’s and Baccalaureate institutions. For Circulation, Doctoral schools had
significantly higher means than Master’s, but Baccalaureate and Master’s institutions did
not differ significantly from one another. It is important to remember that the samples for
this study excluded small and very small Baccalaureate institutions because of missing
data; more difference may have emerged if these schools had been included.
For Gate Count, Baccalaureate schools had the highest mean, which was
statistically higher than Master’s institutions. Master’s and Doctoral schools did not show
a statistical mean difference with respect to Gate Count. Graphs of means for each

102
dependent variable, adjusted for the covariate, were generated by taking their inverse log,
and error bars were calculated by taking the inverse log of the 95% confidence intervals.

A logical question at this point would be: what is the actual difference between
these groups in terms of books checked out, articles downloaded, or people walking into
the building? The answer seems easy to provide using arithmetic means calculated from

103
the original data. For example, in the 2012 dataset, Doctoral schools averaged 109,150
circulations, Master’s schools, 40,112, and Baccalaureate, 21,847. However, these
numbers do not control for the number of students and faculty. These means are also
skewed toward extreme values because the data is non-normal.
The geometric mean values provided by reverse-transforming the data from the
MANCOVA group means, which controlled for the number of students and faculty,
provide a better way to compare the groups. However, the magnitude of the numbers may
seem confusing to readers familiar with library data. Doctoral schools’ geometric mean,
controlling for the covariate, was 36,058 circulations; Master’s was 26,302, and
Baccalaureate, 32,433. Thus, Doctoral schools have 9,722 more circulations, on average,
than Master’s schools, but only 3,625 more than Baccalaureate (although this latter figure
is not statistically significant). For Full-Text Articles, Doctoral schools have 100,213
more requests than Master’s schools and 148,343 more requests than Baccalaureate.
Carnegie Classification Basic – twelve library variables
A separate MANCOVA predicted the twelve DVs Participants in Group
Presentations, Reference Transactions, Interlibrary Loans, Reserves Circulations,
Ongoing Expenditures, One-Time Expenditures, Librarian / Professional FTE, Staff FTE,
Average Librarian / Professional Salary, Average Staff Salary, Library Expenditures as a
Proportion of Institutional Expenditures, and Social Media. The multivariate test of the
effect of the covariate was significant, with an even larger effect size (Pillai’s Trace
F(12,316)=96.86, p<.01,

2

=.79). The linear combination of these twelve DVs also

varied significantly across the Basic Classification, with a smaller, but notable effect size
(Pillai’s Trace F(24,634)=6.609, p<.01, partial

included Participants in Group Presentations, Reference, Reserves Circulation, Average
Librarian Salary, Library Expenditures as a Proportion of Institutional Expenditures, and
Social Media. Power estimates for some of the non-significant variables in this model
(.05 level) suggested sample sizes may be barely sufficient or not sufficient for Reference
(.69), Average Librarian / Professional Salary (.23), and Social Media (.11). The lowpowered results were considered inconclusive.
Contrasts were performed on the groups demonstrating statistical difference and
adequate power using a Bonferroni adjustment to correct for Type I error. Doctoral
schools had statistically higher means than Master’s or Baccalaureate institutions for
Interlibrary Loans, Professional Staff, Support Staff, and Ongoing and One-Time
Expenditures (p<.05), but there was no statistical difference between Baccalaureate and
Master’s institutions—again, remembering that the Baccalaureate schools in this study do
not include the smallest schools (Figure 28).

Summarizing across both MANCOVAs, examining mean differences between the
groups Baccalaureate, Master’s, and Doctoral showed meaningful univariate effects of
the groups on Circulation, Full-Text Articles, and Gate Count. While Doctoral schools
had the highest means on Circulation and Full-Text Articles, Baccalaureate institutions
had the highest mean on Gate Count.
There were also meaningful differences among Baccalaureate, Master’s, and
Doctoral institutions with respect to Interlibrary Loans, Staff FTE, Ongoing
Expenditures, and One-Time Expenditures. Doctoral schools had the highest group
means for these variables, but there was no statistical difference between Baccalaureate
and Master’s institutions.
Carnegie Classification Size & Setting (Residential Status)
Carnegie Classification Size & Setting incorporates both institution size and
residential character (Carnegie Foundation, 2014) and includes consideration of part-time
students. Therefore, an additional covariate was tested for this Carnegie Class, Part-Time
Students and Full-Time Students Plus Faculty. Large, medium, and small schools were
combined in each of the three categories Highly Residential, Primarily Residential, and
Non-Residential to form the three groups for this pair of MANCOVAs, dubbed
“Residential Status.”
Carnegie defines Highly Residential as more than 80% full-time students with
more than 50% living in student housing, and Primarily Residential as more than 50%
full-time students with more than 25% living in student housing. Non-Residential schools
have fewer than 50% of students full-time with fewer than 25% living in student housing.
Carnegie adds:

108
It is important to note the variety of situations of students who do not live in
college or university housing. Some are true “commuting” students, while others
may live with other students in rental housing on the periphery of campus, and
still others are distance education students who rarely or never set foot on a
campus.
For the MANCOVA using Circulation, Full-Text Articles, and Gate Count as
DVs, the sample of 447 was reduced to 424 after eliminating schools with other values
for this classification (e.g., “Not applicable, special focus institution”), and to 415 for the
alternative covariate. For the MANCOVA using the twelve variables, the cases were
reduced to 340 because of missing values for the Social Media variable, and to 333 for
the alternative covariate. Box’s M test was found to be significant for all four
MANCOVAs.
For the MANCOVA testing the three dependent variables Circulation, Full-Text
Articles, and Gate Count, the original covariate’s effect on the combined DVs was
significant and had a large effect size (Pillai’s Trace F(3, 418)= 465.66, p<.01,

2

=.77).

The alternative covariate, including part-time students, had similar results (Pillai’s Trace
F(3, 409)= 396.51, p<.01,

2

=.74). The combined DVs varied across residential groups,

both when the original covariate was used (Pillai’s Trace F(6, 838)=8.51, p<.01,

2

=.06

), and when the alternative covariate was used (Pillai’s Trace F(6, 820)=11.48, p<.01,
2

=.08).
Separate univariate tests showed the covariate’s effects were significant for each

DV, with mostly large effect sizes (Table 28). The univariate tests using the original
covariate showed significant effects of group membership on Circulation F(2,

109
2

420)=17.40, p<.01,

=.08, and Gate Count F(2,420)= 17.04, p<.01,

2

=.08, but a non-

significant effect of group membership on Full-Text Articles, F(2, 420)=8.03, p=.41.
Univariate tests using the alternative covariate showed significant effects of group
membership on all three, although the effect size on articles was small: Circulation F(2,
411)=23.53, p=<.01,

2

=.10, Full-Text Articles, F(2, 411)=7.02, p=<.01,

Gate Count F(2, 411)=2.18, p=<.01,

2

2

=.03 and

=.11 (Table 29). Similar to the multivariate tests,

effect sizes were slightly higher when the alternative covariate was used.

Controlling for the original covariate, Highly Residential institutions had
significantly higher Circulation and Gate Count than either Primarily or Non-Residential
institutions (Figure 29). In terms of geometric mean differences, Highly Residential
schools had 15,821 more Circulations than Primarily Residential Schools; 33,680 more
Full-Text Article requests; and 3,529 additional visitors, all controlling for Full-Time
Students and Faculty. The other mean differences were not statistically significant.
Controlling for the alternative covariate, Highly Residential institutions had significantly
higher Circulation, Full-Text Articles, and Gate Count than either Primarily or Nonresidential institutions, and the geometric means showed larger differences than when
using the original covariate. After controlling for Full-Time and Part-Time Students and
Faculty, Highly Residential schools had 20,402 more Circulations, 96,731 more Full-Text
Articles, and 4,647 higher Gate Count than Primarily Residential Schools. The other
mean differences were not statistically significant.

Carnegie Classification Size & Setting (Residential Status) – twelve library
variables

112
For the MANCOVA testing the twelve variables across Highly, Primarily, And
Non-Residential schools, the original covariate was significant (Pillai’s Trace
2

F(12,325)=226.51, p<.01,

=.89). Also, the linear combination of the twelve varied

across residential groups with a large effect size (Pillai’s Trace F(24, 652)=5.25, p<.01,
2

=.16). The alternative covariate showed similar results, (Pillai’s Trace
2

F(12,318)=181.52, p<.01,

=.87), as did the linear combination of the twelve dependent

variables (Pillai’s Trace F(24,638)=6.54, p<.01,

2

=.20), with a slightly higher effect

size: 20% of the variation in the combined DVs came from group membership.
Separate univariate tests using the original covariate showed significant effects of
2

group membership on Reference F(2,336)=7.54, p < .01,
F(2,336)= 15.85, p < .01,

When using the alternative covariate, significant univariate tests revealed
statistical differences on the same variables, plus Participants in Group Presentations
F(2,336)= 10.07, p < .01,

2

=.06. Presumably because there were only three groups,

there were no issues with power of univariate tests in these models (Table 31).

For the original covariate, Non-Residential schools had the highest means for
Reference, significantly higher than Primarily Residential schools, for a geometric mean
advantage of 2,305 Reference Transactions. Highly Residential schools had the highest
means for Interlibrary Loans and Librarian / Professional FTE, significantly higher than
both Primarily and Non-Residential schools. Highly Residential schools had 2,815 more
Interlibrary Loans and 3.5 more Librarian / Professional FTE than Primarily Residential

115
schools. Primarily Residential Schools had significantly lower means than either Highly
or Non-Residential Schools for Reserves Circulations—by about 4,000 Circulations. For
both Ongoing and One-Time Expenditures, Highly Residential Schools had significantly
higher means than Primarily Residential and Non-Residential Schools. Highly
Residential Schools had $388,190 more Ongoing Expenditures than Primarily Residential
Schools, and $131,341 more One-Time Expenditures. Although there had been a
significant univariate effect on the linear combination of these variables for Staff FTE,
there were no significant mean differences.
For the alternative covariate (including part-time students), Highly Residential
schools had significantly higher means than the other two groups for Participants in
Group Presentations, Interlibrary Loans, Librarian / Professional FTE, Staff FTE, and
Ongoing and One-Time Expenditures (Figures 30 and 31). Comparing Highly Residential
schools with Primarily Residential, the advantages were 1,027 Participants in Group
Presentations, 3,645 Interlibrary Loans, 6 Librarian / Professional FTE, $617,917 in
Ongoing Expenditures, and $179,608 in One-Time Expenditures. For Reserves
Circulations, Highly Residential Schools and Non-Residential Schools had significantly
higher means than Primarily Residential Schools, 6,000 and 3,135 more Reserves
Circulations, respectively. For Ongoing Expenditures, Primarily Residential Schools also
had significantly higher means than Non-residential Schools, but the advantage was
smaller, just $167,698.

To summarize across the four MANCOVAs in this section, the multivariate effect
of Residential Status on Circulation, Full-Text Articles, and Gate Count was small after

118
controlling for either covariate. However, there were still significant group mean
differences. Highly Residential institutions had significantly higher Circulation and Gate
Count than either Primarily or Non-Residential institutions after controlling for either
covariate. Highly Residential institutions also had higher Full-Text Articles after
controlling for the covariate including part-time students.
Residential Status also affected group mean differences on Reference, Interlibrary
Loans, Reserves Circulations, Librarian / Professional FTE, Ongoing Expenditures, and
One-Time Expenditures. When the alternative covariate including part-time students was
used, groups also differed on Participants in Group Presentations. Highly Residential
schools had the highest means on all the variables mentioned except for Reference, for
which Non-Residential schools had the highest group mean.
Comparing the effects of the two covariates, it seems the proportional effect was
similar, although the magnitudes of the group means adjusted for the covariate were
greater for the alternative covariate (with part-time students). Although the group mean
differences for Reference and Participants were not directly compared between the two
covariates because each was insignificant for one covariate, the ranked order of means
was the same for both covariates.
Carnegie Classification Undergraduate Instruction Program
The Carnegie Classification for Undergraduate Instruction Program “focuses
attention on undergraduate education, regardless of the presence or extent of graduate
education” (Carnegie Foundation, 2014). The three criteria are: “the level of
undergraduate degrees awarded (Associate’s or Baccalaureate), the proportion of
Baccalaureate degree majors in the arts and sciences and in professional fields, and the

119
extent to which an institution awards graduate degrees in the same fields in which it
awards undergraduate degrees” (Carnegie Foundation, 2014). Carnegie notes that none of
the classifications denote a liberal arts education, and that they do not view the categories
as relating to value or quality.
There were sixteen categories; these were split into two sets for this study: 1) arts
& sciences vs. professions focus (“Program Balance”) and 2) degree of graduate
coexistence (“Graduate Coexistence”). Associates-dominant institutions were removed.
The resulting groups for each set are shown in Table 32.

Set 1 – Program Balance
The sample of 447 was reduced to 424 after eliminating schools with other values
for this classification (e.g., “Associates”). For the MANCOVA using the twelve

120
variables, the cases were reduced to 340 because of missing values for the Social Media
variable. Box’s M test was found to be insignificant for the MANCOVA on Circulation,
Full-Text Articles, and Gate Count, but was significant for the more complex
MANCOVA, which is a sign the covariance matrices of the DVs are not equal across
groups.
For the MANCOVA testing the three dependent variables Circulation, Full-Text
Articles, and Gate Count, the covariate showed a significant effect on the combined DVs
(Pillai’s Trace F(3, 415)=499.22, p<.01,

than each of the other groups, and significantly more Gate Counts than Professionalfocused institutions (Figure 32). The advantage of Arts-and-Science-Focused schools
over the next group, Arts-and-Sciences-Plus-Professional, was 24,025 Circulations, while
the Arts-and-Science-Focused advantage over Professional-focused institutions in terms
of Gate Count was 7,307. Arts-and-Sciences-plus-Professional-Programs institutions also
experienced significantly more Circulations than the other two “Professional” Programs
categories, and Balanced Programs experienced significantly more Circulations than
Professional-Focused institutions. No groups’ mean differences varied significantly in
terms of Full-Text Articles, however, and there were no significant differences between
groups for Gate Count other than between the Arts-and-Science-Focused and
Professional-Focused institutions.

Carnegie Classification Undergraduate Instruction Program, Program Balance –
twelve library variables
For the MANCOVA testing the twelve library variables, the covariate’s effect on
the combined DVs was significant (Pillai’s Trace F(12,322)=240.71, p<.01,

2

=0.90).

The linear combination of the twelve library variable also varied across the five Program
Balance groups (Pillai’s Trace F(60,1630)=3.56, p<.01,

2

=.12). Separate univariate

tests showed significant effects of group membership on all variables except Participants
in Group Presentations and Average Staff Salary (Table 34). For some variables, the
sample size may not have provided adequate statistical power, including Reference (.69),
Average Professional Salary (.23), Average Staff Salary (.64), and Social Media –
Purpose (.11).

Arts-and-Science-Focused institutions had significantly higher means than the
lowest three groups for all of the six variables with significant univariate test results and
adequate power (Figure 33). Arts-and-Science-Focused institutions had 6,766 more
Interlibrary Loans, 11 more Librarian / Professional FTE, 8 more Staff FTE, $1,100,639
more Ongoing Resource Expenditures, and $294,618 more One-Time Resource
Expenditures, in terms of geometric mean differences. The other groups did not
demonstrate significant differences, with a few exceptions. With respect to Interlibrary
Loans, Arts-and-Sciences-Plus-Professional had significantly higher means than the
lower three groups. With respect to Ongoing Expenditures, Arts-and-Sciences-Plus-

125
Professional had significantly higher means than the Professional-Focused groups.
Finally, with respect to One-Time Expenditures, Arts-and-Sciences-Plus-Professional had
significantly higher means than the Professional-Plus-Arts-and-Sciences group.
To summarize, Arts-and-Sciences-Focused institutions had the highest means on
all the variables with significant group mean differences, and Professional-Focused had
the lowest, although not all differences between groups were statistically significant. For
example, no groups differed significantly with respect to Full-Text Articles, and only the
two most extreme groups differed significantly with respect to Gate Count. Similarly,
while Arts-and-Sciences-Focused institutions had a significantly higher mean than the
next-highest group on One-Time Expenditures, the other groups did not differ
significantly from one another.

Set 2 – Graduate Coexistence
In the second set of MANCOVAs involving Undergraduate Instruction Program,
the focus was the coexistence of graduate programs with undergraduate programs. Box’s
M test was found to be significant for both MANCOVAs.
For the MANCOVA testing the three dependent variables Circulation, Full-Text
Articles, and Gate Count, the covariate had a significant effect on the combined DV
(Pillai’s Trace F(3,417)=289.30, p<.01, partial

2

=0.68). The combined DVs also varied

significantly across group membership (Pillai’s Trace F(9, 1257)=6.06, p<.01, partial
2

=0.04). Separate univariate tests showed significant effects of group membership on

126
Circulation F(3, 419)=7.604, p < .01, Full-Text Articles F(3, 419)= 7.165, p < .01 and
Gate Count F(3, 419)=7.558, p < .05, all with a partial

=.05 (Table 35).

34). However, No Graduate Coexistence schools ranked between these two categories.
For Gate Count, No Graduate Coexistence schools had a significantly higher mean (3,377
visitors higher) than High Graduate Coexistence schools. Other differences between
group means were not statistically significant.

Carnegie Classification Undergraduate Instruction Program, Graduate
Coexistence – twelve library variables
The covariate also had a significant effect on the twelve DVs (Pillai’s Trace
F(12,324)= 134.51, p<.01,

2

=0.83). The linear combination of the twelve library

variable also varied significantly across the eleven Graduate Instruction Program groups
(Pillai’s Trace F(36, 978=5.710, p<.01,

2

=0.17). Separate univariate tests showed

significant effects of group membership on all variables except Participants in Group
Presentation, Average Professional Salary and Average Staff Salary (Table 36). The

128
power analysis suggested sample size may not have been adequate for Reference (.69),
Average Professional Salary (.23), Average Staff Salary (.64), or Social Media – Purpose
(.11).
For Interlibrary Loan and One-Time Expenditures, schools with High Graduate
Coexistence had significantly higher means than those with Some Graduate Coexistence
(p<.05), as did schools with No Graduate Coexistence (p<.05) (Figure 35). Interlibrary
Loans at High Graduate Coexistence schools were 2,560 higher, and One-Time
Resources were $98,760 higher than at Some Graduate Coexistence schools. For
Librarian / Professional FTE and Staff FTE, Schools with High Graduate Coexistence
had significantly higher means than those with Some Graduate Coexistence (p<.01),
about 6 Librarian / Professional FTE and 5 Staff FTE in terms of geometric mean
difference, controlling for the covariate.. For Ongoing Expenditures, Schools with High
Graduate Coexistence also had significantly higher means than those with Some
Graduate Coexistence (p<.01), an advantage of $595,528, but the other group means were
not statistically different.

To summarize, Graduate Coexistence with undergraduate programs had small, but
significant effects on Circulation, Full-Text Articles, and Gate Count. High Graduate
Coexistence schools had the highest mean on Circulation and Full-Text Articles, and No
Graduate Coexistence schools had the highest mean on Gate Count.
Graduate Coexistence had significant effects on the twelve library variables
except Participants in Group Presentations, but the effect sizes varied greatly. Graduate
Coexistence had large effects on Interlibrary Loan, Librarian / Professional FTE, and
Ongoing Expenditures, but more moderate effects on Staff FTE and One-Time

131
Expenditures. Additionally, the groups did not always result in a logical order: for
example, Interlibrary Loan and One-Time Expenditures were highest for High Graduate
Coexistence Schools, but the next-highest group was No Graduate Coexistence. On the
other hand, for Librarian / Professional FTE, High Graduate Coexistence was followed
by Some, then No Graduate Coexistence.
Carnegie Classification Graduate Instruction Program
The Carnegie Classification for Graduate Instruction Program defined eighteen
categories (2014). These were collapsed into eleven categories (Table 37). The term
“Master’s” was used in this study instead of “PostBaccalaureate.” Second-level bullets
list categories that were collapsed into the parent category.
The sample of 447 was reduced to 424 after eliminating schools with other values
for this classification (e.g., “Not Applicable”). For the MANCOVA using the twelve
variables, the cases were reduced to 340 because of missing values for the Social Media –
Purpose variable. The smallest cell was 16 cases. Box’s M test was found to be
significant for both MANCOVAs.

Although the univariate tests showed an overall difference among groups, in only
a few cases did groups have statistically different means. For Circulation, Doctoral
Comprehensive Schools with a Medical school and Doctoral Comprehensive with no
Medical School had higher means than Master’s Schools, Business Dominant (p<.05),
which was the group with the lowest mean (Figure 36). Doctoral Comprehensive Schools
without a Medical school had 26,692 more Circulations than Master’s Schools, Business
Dominant, when comparing geometric means after controlling for the covariate. For FullText Articles, Doctoral Comprehensive Schools with a Medical school had a significantly
higher mean than Doctoral, Humanities and Science or Professional Dominant (p<.01),

134
for a difference of 248,335 Full-Text Articles (Figure 37). There were no significant
group mean differences between groups on Gate Count.

Carnegie Classification Graduate Instruction Program – twelve library variables
For the MANCOVA testing the twelve library variables, all four of the
multivariate tests were also significant (Table 39), meaning the linear combination of the
twelve library variable varied across the eleven Graduate Instruction Program groups
(F(132, 3586)=2.15, p<.01,

2

=0.07). Separate univariate tests showed significant effects

of group membership on Interlibrary Loans, Librarian / Professional FTE, Staff FTE,
Ongoing and One-Time Expenditures, and Library Percent of Institutional Expenditures.
Non-significant effects included Participants in Group Presentations, Reference, Reserves
Circulation, Average Librarian Salary, Average Staff Salary, and Social Media. Power
estimates for this model with less than .75 included Reference (.63), Average Librarian
Salary (.21), Average Staff Salary (.21), and Social Media (.10). Results relating to these
are therefore deemed inconclusive.

With respect to Interlibrary Loans, Doctoral Comprehensive schools with a
Medical School were significantly different from all the other groups (p<.05) except

137
Doctoral Comprehensive schools without a Medical School, Schools with a Single
Doctoral Program (Education), STEM Schools, and Master’s Comprehensive Schools.
Doctoral Comprehensive schools with a Medical School had 5,343 more Interlibrary
Loans than the next highest, but significantly different category, Doctoral, Humanities
and Science or Professional Dominant. Doctoral Comprehensive schools without a
Medical School were significantly different from Master’s, Education dominant schools
(p<.05) (Figure 38).

School were also statistically different from the other groups (p<.05) except Doctoral
Comprehensive schools with a Medical School, Doctoral Schools with Humanities,
Sciences, & Professional programs, Doctoral Schools with a Single Doctoral Program
(Education) and STEM Schools. STEM Schools were significantly different from all the
Master’s categories (p<.01), with 7 or 8 additional Librarian / Professional FTE on
average.

With respect to Ongoing Expenditures, Doctoral Comprehensive schools with a

Comprehensive schools without a Medical School and STEM Schools (Figure 41). The
difference between Doctoral Comprehensives with a Medical School and the next highest
statistically different category, Doctoral, Humanities and Science or Professional
Dominant, was impressive: $1,206,525. Doctoral Comprehensive schools without a
Medical School were also statistically different from the other groups (p<.01) except
Doctoral Comprehensive schools with a Medical School, Doctoral Schools with

140
Humanities, Sciences, & Professional programs, and STEM Schools. Doctoral Schools
with Humanities, Social Sciences, or Professional Programs were statistically different
from the Master’s programs (p<.05) except for Master’s Comprehensives. STEM Schools
were also significantly different from all the Master’s categories (p<.01). In this category,
there were basically two groups of schools: The two Doctoral Comprehensive groups and
STEM schools in one group, and everyone else in another group.

For One-Time Expenditures, Doctoral Comprehensive schools with a Medical
School were statistically different only from Master’s Comprehensive and Master’s
Education-Dominant (p<.05) (Figure 42). Doctoral Comprehensive schools without a
Medical School were statistically different from Doctoral Schools, Professional /
Humanities emphasis, Doctoral Schools with Humanities, Social Sciences, or

141
Professional Programs, Doctoral Schools with a Single Program (Education), Master’s
Comprehensive, Master’s, Business-dominant, and Master’s, Education-dominant.
Looking at the geometric mean differences between the groups with the highest and
lowest means (Doctoral Comprehensive without a Medical School and Master’s,
Education-Dominant) shows that while the magnitude of difference between One-Time
and Ongoing Expenditures is great, the proportions are about the same. The difference in
these groups’ One-Time Expenditures is $295,767, or a 70% difference, while the
difference in their Ongoing Expenditures is $1,251,300, a 75% difference.

In summary, for most variables, Graduate Instruction Program was significantly
different only for a few levels of each group. That is, the group with the highest mean
might be significantly different from the group with the lowest mean, but otherwise the
groups may not have been that much statistically different from one another. There were
some differences among Graduate Instruction Program groups with respect to Circulation
and Full-Text Articles, but none with respect to Gate Count. There were also significant
differences among groups for Interlibrary Loan, Librarian / Professional FTE and Staff

143
FTE, Ongoing and One-Time Expenditures, and the library’s percentage of the
institutional budget.
In conclusion, the MANCOVA analyses support rejecting Covariate Hypothesis
2, “After controlling for Full-Time Students Plus Faculty, there will be no meaningful
group mean differences between institutions’ Carnegie Classifications.” There were a
variety of meaningful group mean differences across Carnegie Classifications. The
MANCOVA analyses also support rejecting both MANCOVA hypotheses, which
proposed no mean differences on a multivariate combination of Circulation, Full-Text
Articles, and Gate Count between groups, and no mean differences on a multivariate
combination of twelve library service and expenditure variables. The Carnegie
Classifications do have meaningful effects on both the multivariate combinations of
variables and select univariate comparisons.
An analysis of results across all the MANCOVAs will be provided in the
Discussion.

Results—Regression
A series of sequential regressions predicted External Research Dollars from
Circulation, Full-Text Article, and Gate Count. The first step was entering the covariate
Full-Time Students Plus Faculty in the model. Step 2 was entering the primary variables
of interest, Circulation, Full-Text Article, and Gate Count, into the model. Step 3 was
where various Carnegie Classifications were entered, using dummy-coding to represent
each group. Finally, Step 4 entered interaction variables created by multiplying
Circulation, Full-Text Articles, and Gate Count with the dummy-coded Carnegie

144
Classification variables. All continuous independent variables were centered before
entering them into the models.
Carnegie Classification Basic
The first series of regressions involved Carnegie Classification – Basic (Table
40). For the 2010 merged dataset, the first step showed Full-time Students Plus Faculty
accounted for a significant amount of External Research Dollars, R2=.314, F(1,
134)=61.274, p<.01, indicating that larger schools net more External Research Dollars.
Thirty-one percent of the variance in External Research Dollars was predicted when just
Full-time Students Plus Faculty was entered. In the second step, variables were added for
the three library use variables Circulation, Full-Text Articles, and Gate Count. This step
did not significantly improve the model, R2 Change= .018, F(3,131)=1.15, p=.33. In the
third step, the dummy-coded variables representing Carnegie Classification – Basic were
entered, and the change was significant R2 Change= .126, F(2,129)=14.89, p<.01. In the
final step, the interactions (constructed by multiplying each dummy variable with each of
the other independent variables) were entered; these did not produce a significant change,
R2 Change= .028, F(6,123)=1.21, p=.31.

Table 41 shows the coefficients, with “C_” added to variable labels to signify that
they were centered before entering them into the equation, and “DC_” indicating a
dummy-coded variable. Looking at Step 3, the covariate had a significant effect on
External Research Dollars, t(139)=2.66, p<.01, sr2=.03. The difference between Doctoral
Schools and Baccalaureate schools also made a significant contribution, t(139)=3.58,
p<.01, sr2=.05. Doctoral institutions showed a .39 sd advantage over Baccalaureate in
terms of External Research Dollars, and contributed 5% of unique variance to the model.
Master’s institutions did not significantly differ from Baccalaureate. Looking at the
original group means (prior to log transformation) shows these results in more dramatic
terms: Doctoral institutions in this sample had an average of $40,185 in External
Research Dollars, Master’s averaged $6,776, and Baccalaureate averaged $5,233.Finally,
the primary variables of interest (Circulation, Full-Text Articles, and Gate Count), were
not significant predictors in the model.
For the 2012 merged dataset, results again indicated that larger schools net more
External Research Dollars, R2=.24, F(1, 195)=61.912, p<.01 (Table 42). Similarly to
2012, 31% of the variance in External Research Dollars was predicted by the covariate.
In the second step, variables were added for the three library use variables Circulation,
Full-Text Articles, and Gate Count. Unlike 2010, these variables did contribute
significantly to the model at this step, adding 12% to the prediction, R2 Change=.12, F(3,
192)=11.499, p<.01. Next, the Carnegie Classification dummy-coded variables were
added as Step 3, which increased the predictive ability of the model by 24%, R2 Change=
.24, F(2, 190)=57.33, p<.01. The addition of interactions between the library variables
and Carnegie Classifications further increased prediction, although by just 4%, R2

146
Change= .04, F(6, 184)=3.078, p<.01. Also, none of the individual interaction parameters
were statistically significant.

Looking at the coefficients in the equation for Step 4 (Table 43), Full-Text
Articles made a significant contribution to External Research Dollars t(184)=4.00, p<.01.
For each sd increase in Full-Text Articles, External Research Dollars increased by .46 sd.
The squared semi-partial correlation for Full-Text Articles is the amount of variance
associated with just that predictor in this model, 3.2%. Circulation also made a significant
contribution, t(184)=-2.26, p<.01. However, it was a negative relationship: For each sd
increase in Circulation, External Research Dollars decreased by .41 sd. The difference
between Baccalaureate and Doctoral institutions was also a predictor of External
Research Dollars, t(184)=3.25, p<.01. Doctoral schools experienced a .38 sd advantage in
External Research Dollars. The interaction coefficients were not statistically significant.
Providing the standardized coefficients allows comparison of the relative
contributions of the coefficients to the dependent variable, but unfortunately, standard
deviations on a logarithmic scale cannot be reverse-transformed to the original scale
(Bland & Altman, 1996a) in order to provide a “dollar amount” that corresponds to
increases in full-text articles.

In summary, both 2010 and 2012 datasets showed a relationship between being a
Doctoral institution (as compared to Baccalaureate) and External Research Dollars above
and beyond institution size. However, there were no significant differences between
being a Master’s institution versus being a Baccalaureate. Additionally, while the 2012
data suggests that Doctoral institutions with higher Full-Text Articles and lower
circulation counts have higher External Research Dollars, the 2010 data did not show this
relationship. Additional research would be needed to determine whether this difference is
due to sample size.
Carnegie Classification Undergraduate Instruction Program (Graduate
Coexistence)
Next, a sequential regression examined the entrance of Carnegie Classification—
Undergraduate Program Graduate Coexistence (Graduate Coexistence) into the model.
Six cases did not have this classification, bringing the sample to 130 for 2010 and 188 for
2012.
For the 2010 data, Step 1 was significant, R2=.34, F(1,128)=65.95, p<.01; 34% of
the variance in External Research Dollars was due to the covariate alone. (Table 44). Step
2, with the library use variables, was not significant, R2 Change= .02, F(3,125)= 0.71,
p=.55. With Step 3, dummy-coded variables for Some Graduate Coexistence and High
Graduate Coexistence were entered into the model, using No Graduate Coexistence as the
reference group. The addition was significant, with 13% additional variance predicted, R2
Change= .13, F(2, 123)= 16.05, p<.01. Step 4, with the interaction variables included,
was not a statistically significant improvement, R2 Change= .02, F(6,117)= 0.99, p=.43.

Looking at the coefficients for Step 3 (Table 45), there was a significant effect of
High Graduate Coexistence, which had .46 sd advantage over No Graduate Coexistence
Schools t(123)=4.04, p<.01, sr2=.07. The variable labels beginning “C_” indicate that the
variable was centered before entering it into the model and “DC_” indicates a dummycoded variable.
For the 2012 dataset, Step 1 was significant, R2= .34, F(1,186)= 96.90, p<.01. The
covariate predicted 34% of the variance on its own. Step 2, adding the library use
variables, was also significant, adding 6% additional predicted variance, R2 Change= .06,
F(3,183)= 6.40, p<.01. Step 3, adding the Graduate Coexistence dummy variables, added
15% additional prediction, R2 Change= .15, F(2, 181)= 30.60, p<.01. Step 4 was not
significant, R2 Change= .05, F(6,175)= .70, p=.65.

Looking at the coefficients for Step 3 (Table 47), Full-Text Articles had a
significant contribution to External Research Dollars, t(181)= 3.18, p<.01, sr2=.03. For
every sd increase in Full-Text Articles, External Research Dollars increased by .25 sd.
The dummy variable High Graduate Coexistence was also significant, t(181)= 3.19,
p<.01, sr2<.03. High Graduate Coexistence Schools had .48 sd advantage in External
Research Dollars over No Graduate Coexistence Schools. The variable labels beginning
“C_” indicate that the variable was centered before entering it into the model, and “DC”
indicates a dummy coded variable.
In summary, Graduate Coexistence affected External Research Dollars for both
2010 and 2012 datasets, but only between High Graduate Coexistence and No Graduate
Coexistence schools. There was no significant difference between Some Graduate
Coexistence schools and No Graduate Coexistence Schools. Although an effect of FullText Articles on External Research Dollars was observed in the 2012 dataset, it was not
observed in 2010.

Carnegie Classification Graduate Instruction Program
Next, a sequential regression examined the entrance of Carnegie Classification –
Graduate Instruction Program into the model (Table 48). Some cases did not have this
classification, bringing the sample to 117 for 2010 and 196 for 2012. At Step 1, with just
the covariate entered, R2 =.28, F(1,115)= 44.15, p<.01. With Step 2, the library use
variables did not add significantly to the model, R2 Change=.01, F(3,112)=0.49, p<.01.
With Step 3, dummy-coded variables for the four Graduate Instruction Programs were
entered into the model, using Master’s Programs as the reference group. The addition was
significant, predicting 13% additional variance in the model, R2 Change= .13, F(3, 109)=
19.56, p<.01. Step 4, with the interaction variables included, was not a statistically
significant improvement, R2 Change= .03, F(9,100)= 0.64, p=.77.

Looking at the coefficients for Step 3 (Table 49), the differences between all three
Graduate Instruction Programs and the reference group, Master’s schools, were
significant. Doctoral Schools – Other had .34 sd more External Research Dollars than
Master’s schools t(109)= 4.48, p<.01, sr2=.09; Doctoral Schools – Comprehensive, .41 sd
more than Master’s schools, t(109)= 5.48, p<.01, sr2=.16, and Doctoral Schools – STEM,
.43 sd, t(109)= 6.19, p<.01, sr2=.13.
For 2012, the Step 1 model was significant, R2 =.28, F(1,180)= 77.14, p<.01
(Table 50). The library use variables increased the prediction of External Research
Dollars by 7%, R2 Change=.07, F(3,177)= 6.70, p<.01. With the addition of Graduate
Instruction Program variables, prediction increased 28%, R2 Change =.28, F(3,174)=
45.78, p<.01. The addition of the interaction variables in Step 4 was also significant,
increasing prediction by 4%, R2 Change =.04, F(9,165)= 2.25, p<.05.

Looking at the coefficients for Step 4 (Table 51), Full-Text Articles was the only
library use variable contributing significantly to the prediction of External Research

157
Dollars, t(165)=2.15, p<.05, sr2=.01. For every sd increase in Full-Text Articles, External
Research Dollars increased by .20 sd. The dummy-coded variables for Graduate
Instruction Program were also significant: STEM schools had a .53 sd advantage over
Master’s Schools t(165)=8.43, p<.01, sr2=.14. Other Doctoral had a .22 sd advantage
over Master’s Schools t(165)= 3.75, p<.01, sr2=.03, and Doctoral-Comprehensive had a
.56 sd advantage over Master’s schools t(165)= 7.22, p<.01, sr2=.10. There were two
significant interactions. The standardized coefficient of the interaction between Doctoral
Comprehensive (compared to Master’s) and Full-Text Articles was .22 sd, t(165)=2.36,
p<.05, sr2=.01, and the standardized coefficient of the interaction of Other Doctoral and
Gate Count was -.22 sd, t(165)=-2.15, p<.05, sr2=.01. Because these effects were smaller
than the main effects of the Carnegie variables, and the squared semi-partial coefficients
were so small, these interactions were not interpreted.
In summary, Graduate Instruction Program had a significant effect on External
Research Dollars above and beyond institution size and library use, although the
differences between Graduate Instruction Programs and Master’s schools varied between
2010 and 2012. While in 2010, Other Doctoral, Comprehensive Doctoral, and STEM
Doctoral schools were .34 sd, .41 sd, and .43 sd higher than Master’s schools, in 2010,
their differences were .22 sd, .56 sd, and .53 sd, respectively. Full-Text Articles had a
significant effect above and beyond institution size and Graduate Instruction Program
only in 2012.

In conclusion, all the models showed an influence of institution size (Full-time
Students Plus Faculty) on External Research Dollars. The series of regressions provided
mixed evidence regarding the research hypotheses. Some significant effects of
Circulation, Full-Text Articles, and Gate Count were observed, supporting rejection of
Regression Hypothesis 1, “There will be no significant effect of Circulation, Full-Text
Articles, and Gate Count on External Research Dollars, after controlling for Full-Time
Students plus Faculty.” While all the 2012 models showed an effect of Full-Text Articles
on External Research Dollars, none of the 2012 models did. This difference could be due
to sample size, however, more research would be needed to form a well-supported
conclusion. None of the models showed an effect of Gate Count on External Research
Dollars. And, only one model showed a significant effect of Circulation on External
Research Dollars (Carnegie Basic, using the 2012 dataset).
Furthermore, Regression Hypothesis 2, “There will be no significant effect of
Carnegie Classification – Basic, Carnegie Classification – Undergraduate Instruction
Program, Graduate Coexistence, and Carnegie Classification – Graduate Instruction
Program on predicting External Research Dollars,” was rejected: there were significant
effects on the prediction of External Research Dollars when these classification variables
were included in the models. However, sometimes only certain groups suggested
significant differences, although the patterns were the same across both years. For
Carnegie Basic, Doctoral institutions showed advantages over Baccalaureate in terms of
External Research Dollars, but Master’s institutions were not significantly different from
Baccalaureate. For Graduate Coexistence, High Graduate Coexistence had advantages

160
over No Graduate Coexistence, but Some Graduate Coexistence schools did not differ
from No Graduate Coexistence. With respect to Graduate Instruction Program, all of the
Carnegie groups with Doctoral programs were significantly different than schools with
Master’s programs.
Finally, Regression Hypothesis 3, “There will be no significant interaction effect
between Circulation, Full-Text Articles, and Gate Count and the Carnegie Classifications
on External Research Dollars,” also had mixed results, because no interactions were
detected for Carnegie Basic and Carnegie Graduate Coexistence, but there were two
significant, if small, interaction coefficients for Graduate Instruction Program.

Chapter 5: Discussion
This section will first highlight the most pertinent results from each of the
analyses: SEM, MANCOVA, and regression, as well as consider any methodological
findings researchers should consider when conducting further statistical analysis with
these datasets. What can the current data tell us about how our expenditures and staffing
relate to services, and in turn, our services to library use? Are there systematic differences
in libraries between types of institutions? How does library use relate to External
Research Dollars?
Next, the discussion will return to the theoretical framework constructed at the
beginning of this paper to discuss the extent to which the results inform initial questions
raised:
•

Can these findings help illustrate the connections between library services, library
use, and high-impact practices?

•

Can these findings help illustrate the connections between library services, library
use, and the university’s research mission?

•

Can these findings help articulate libraries’ strategic advantages?
Finally, the paper will suggest an approach to filling the gap between what the

current data can show us about libraries’ business strategy and the picture libraries would
like to be able to present to illustrate how libraries are relevant to both high-impact
educational practices and the institution’s research mission.
Structural Equation Modeling Discussion
This study tested several measurement models using a type of SEM called
confirmatory factor analysis. The main goal of combining indicators into latent variables

162
is to think in terms of “entire systems of conceptual relationships” that can begin to
represent complex environments (MacKenzie, 2001, p. 159). Latent variables also test
whether indicators group together to make meaningful factors.
None of the measurement models – even the one-factor models – met the chosen
criteria for fit, despite the fact that the indicator variables are correlated. One reason may
be that the variables in these models were not designed to measure latent constructs, but
to gather statistical information of common interest to libraries. The researcher thought
there was logical reason for these variables to form constructs, since her library
experience suggested strong associations between groups of variables, but statistically,
they did not hold together well. The many large positive residuals observed in the
measurement models suggest the indicators are influenced by something else outside the
model. This “something else” could possibly be a covariate, such as Carnegie
Classification, or another factor of interest, but could also be unsystematic variance.
After examining the results from the MANCOVA and regressions, the researcher
proposed several additional path models to test with SEM, first focusing just on Doctoral
institutions. Libraries with more Participants in Group Presentations were predicted to
have greater Full-Text Articles and Interlibrary Loans because of greater awareness by
students and faculty of library resources and services. Ongoing Expenditures was
included as a predictor of both Full-Text Articles and Interlibrary Loans because if a
library spends sufficient dollars on its subscriptions, then patrons should be finding what
they need at their local library and not require so many Interlibrary Loans. Full-time
Students plus Faculty continued to be used as a covariate.

163
The championed model failed the S-B x2 test, but met the other criteria. Sixty-two
percent of the variance in Full-Text Articles and 50% of the variance in Interlibrary
Loans was explained by the model. While clearly there were other factors at play, these
were still large amounts of variance explained. Interestingly, while it was hypothesized
Ongoing Expenditures and Interlibrary Loans would have a negative relationship, the
path had a positive coefficient. In fact, for every sd increase in Ongoing Expenditures,
Interlibrary Loans increased by .51 sd. This relationship could suggest that these two
variables are signs of an underlying construct like “research intensity,” rather than one
“causing” the other. Ongoing Expenditures was the major driver in the entire model,
explaining more than twice the amount of variance in both Full-Text Articles and
Interlibrary Loans than Participants in Group Presentations did, which did not even have
significant coefficients for the parameters.
Because the MANCOVA tests showed differences between Doctoral institutions
and both Baccalaureate and Master’s institutions but no significant differences between
Baccalaureate and Master’s institutions, the researcher decided to test the championed
alternative path model using a sample combining Baccalaureate and Master’s institutions
(2012). It is important to remember this sample did not include smaller Baccalaureate
schools.
The championed model with the Baccalaureate and Master’s dataset again failed
to meet the S-B x2 test, but met the criteria set for the other fit indexes. About the same
amount of variance was explained in Full-Text Articles and Interlibrary Loans, but more
variance was explained for Ongoing Expenditures (57% compared with 47%). While
Ongoing Expenditures was still a primary driver in this model, it explained much less

164
variance in Full-Text Articles for Doctoral schools, with a standardized coefficient of .27
for Baccalaureate Plus Master’s compared with the standardized coefficient of .55 for the
Doctoral schools. For Baccalaureate + Master’s, therefore, something else is influencing
Full-Text Articles in place of some of the influence from Ongoing Expenditures that
Doctoral schools experience.
Participants in Group Presentations was still not a significant predictor of FullText Articles for Baccalaureate plus Master’s, but it was a significant predictor of
Interlibrary Loans: for every sd increase in Participants, Interlibrary Loans increased by
.26 sd. This is supported by Leykan (2008) who found that use of Interlibrary Loan by
academic departments varied in conjunction with liaison activity. Soria, Fransen, &
Nackerud (2013) also found statistically significant correlations between Interlibrary
Loans and database, electronic journal, electronic book usage, reference, and library
instruction classes.
Comparing the Doctoral and Baccalaureate plus Master’s datasets was hampered
by the difference in sample sizes (N=189 and N=367, respectively). It is unclear, for
example, if the fact that the parameter estimate between Participants in Group
Presentations and Interlibrary Loans was significant for the Baccalaureate plus Master’s
institutions but not Doctoral was because of a meaningful difference or because the
power of the Baccalaureate plus Master’s sample size was great enough to detect the
effect. The fact that Full-Time Students and Faculty was a stronger covariate for
Baccalaureate plus Master’s could be because there was more variance among these
schools than in the more homogenous Doctoral group. It is interesting, however, that
across both models, Ongoing Expenditures had a positive relationship with Interlibrary

165
Loans, meaning whatever is driving these two variables may be shared regardless of
institution type.
The size of the difference in coefficients between Ongoing Expenditures and FullText Articles also suggested that while Ongoing Expenditures has a large role to play in
Full-Text Article use at Doctoral Schools, it plays less of a role at Baccalaureate plus
Master’s schools. And since Participants in Group Presentations was not a significant
predictor, something was likely missing from the Baccalaureate plus Master’s model. For
the Baccalaureate and Master’s schools, there was a large standardized residual (6.40)
between Ongoing Expenditures and Participants in Group Presentations, indicating that
for Baccalaureate and Master’s schools, these two have a relationship beyond the number
of students and faculty that is unexpressed by the model.
The differences in the results from running the same model with two populations
(Doctoral and Baccalaureate plus Master’s) suggests that continuing to separate these
groups, or including Carnegie Classification in the path model in some way, is important.
The MANCOVA analyses also suggested that the differences among institution types
were significant.
Exploring more path models may be helpful for illuminating the data beyond
multiple regression. For example, some simple regressions in this study were performed
to test the importance of the covariate Full-Time Students Plus Faculty and Carnegie
Classification, Basic. These showed that the twelve library variables did influence
Circulation, Full-Text Articles, and Gate Count. When the twelve library variables were
added to regression models, predictive power on Circulation increased by 18%; for Full-

166
Text Articles, 7%, and for Gate Count, 5%. Path models provide an additional tool for
continuing to learn about these relationships.
While the ACRL and ALS data may not work well in SEM measurement models,
SEM may be used to incorporate measurement instruments such as LibQUAL+
satisfaction survey into hybrid models rather than study the ALS and ACRL survey
results alone. For example, a hybrid model could include latent variables for “library
satisfaction” based in LibQUAL+ in conjunction with observed variables from surveys
like ACRL and ALS, building off the bivariate correlation study by Hunter and Perret
(2011). At the present time, such studies would need to be conducted by ARL because
they are the only ones with access to the institutional level data and because SEM
requires a large sample size.
In summary, the SEM models did not explain how expenditures and staffing
relate to library services or how services relate to library use. The second set of path
models confirmed earlier research (Fagan, 2014a) suggesting that Ongoing Expenditures
has a strong relationship with Full-Text Articles beyond the number of students and
faculty at an institution, but without providing a logical rationale. The second set of path
models also supported the idea that there are systematic differences in libraries between
Doctoral and Baccalaureate Plus Master’s institutions.
Carnegie Classification Group Differences (MANCOVAs)
A series of MANCOVAs tested for group differences across institutions by
Carnegie Classification, controlling for Full-Time Students Plus Faculty. Reverse-logtransforming the adjusted means produced by MANCOVA produced geometric means by
which groups could be compared while maintaining the adjustment for the covariate. The

167
magnitude of these means therefore does not match the arithmetic means that would
result from the original data, both because the geometric mean is a different measure of
central tendency, and because these geometric means control for the effects of the
covariate.
Carnegie Classification—Basic
The Carnegie Basic classification influenced group mean differences with respect
to Full-Text Articles. Doctoral schools in this study had 37% higher mean for Full-Text
Articles than Master’s institutions, or about 100,000 articles, and 67% times greater than
Baccalaureate (about 150,000 articles). These differences could be explained by the
increase in research intensity as students progress from undergraduate to graduate
education, as well as the increased research activities of faculty. Doctoral schools also
had a 37% higher mean for Circulation than Master’s institutions, or about 9,800
circulations. Although the differences between Baccalaureate and Master’s schools’
Circulation were not significant, it is interesting to note that the Baccalaureate schools’
mean Circulation was higher than Master’s—that is, the pattern of means did not match
Full-Text Articles. This suggests circulation of physical items may be an indicator of
something different than Full-Text Articles.
Regarding Gate Count, Baccalaureate institutions had higher means than Master’s
or Doctoral schools, although only the difference between Baccalaureate and Master’s
was statistically significant. Baccalaureate schools had 35% higher gate count than
Master’s, or 2,734 more visits per year. This points to a meaningful difference in the use
of library buildings at Baccalaureate institutions compared to the other schools.

168
For the other twelve library variables, Doctoral schools had the highest means for
Interlibrary Loan, Librarian / Professional FTE, Staff FTE, Ongoing Expenditures, and
One-Time Expenditures, but Baccalaureate and Master’s programs did not differ
significantly from one another—remembering that the Baccalaureate schools in the
sample did not include a proportional number of small schools. It makes some sense that
Doctoral schools would have the highest means; many have noted how graduate research
is generally more specialized than undergraduate research, requiring deeper disciplinary
collections and heavy use of interlibrary loan (Du & Evans, 2011; Egan, 2005; Frank &
Bothmann, 2007; Herrera, 2003; Vezzosi, 2009). Vendors of library subscription
resources often price journal packages by institution type as well as FTE, which could
explain the higher cost of Ongoing Expenditures. However, looking at the variable
Library Budget as a Percent of Institutional Expenditures for the three groups does not
show a corresponding advantage for Doctoral schools. While Doctoral schools’ Ongoing
Expenditures were more than double that of the next highest group (Baccalaureate
institutions), and the staff they are paying is about 50% larger, Doctoral institutions’
budgets average just 1.9% of total institutional expenditures in this sample, while
Baccalaureate institutions’ budgets average 2%. Thus, Doctoral libraries are having to
shoulder greater expenditures without a proportional show of support from the institution.
It could be that these institutions have additional or larger categories of non-library
expenditures, or it could be they fund their libraries less heavily.
All together, these results suggest that studies using national library datasets
should consider that Doctoral institutions may be substantially different than
Baccalaureate and Master’s institutions. This may mean controlling for the effect of

169
doctoral schools, or studying the populations separately. It also suggests that if larger
Baccalaureate and Master’s institutions are of interest, there might not be a need to
control for differences between these populations. However, it is important to remember
that this study’s sample excluded many small schools due to missing data, so the
“Baccalaureate institutions” discussed here are not the full array of U.S. Baccalaureate
schools.
These results also begin to reveal how much more there is to learn. While the
researcher offered some conjectures to explain group mean differences, many factors are
not known. For example, Doctoral schools have 7.2 more Librarian / Professional Staff,
and 5.3 more Support Staff than Baccalaureate schools, even after controlling for the
number of students and faculty. What are these people doing? Are they doing more of the
same services as their counterparts at Baccalaureate schools? Or are they performing
additional services required only at Doctoral institutions?
Carnegie Classification—Residential
The results for MANCOVAs examining the Residential aspect of the Carnegie
Classification Size & Setting showed a medium effect of these groups on the linear
combination of Circulation, Full-Text Article Requests, and Gate Count after controlling
for either covariate (

2

=.06 for the original covariate), and a large effect size on the

linear combination of the other twelve variables (

2

=.16 for the original covariate).

Highly Residential Schools (the group with the most full-time students living on campus)
had a large advantage over Primarily Residential schools, which usually ranked higher
than Non-Residential Schools. In terms of geometric mean differences, Highly
Residential schools had 15,821 more Circulations than Primarily Residential Schools;

170
33,680 more Full-Text Article requests; and 3,529 additional visitors, all controlling for
Full-Time Students and Faculty. Overall, the positive relationship between the residential
nature of schools and library services and library use variables supports the idea that
libraries contribute to the increased engagement resulting from a greater presence on
campus. The fact that Residential status did not have a significant effect on Full-Text
Articles (which are online resources) helps to confirm that this relationship is not
spurious but relates to the library’s collocation with students.
One intriguing result was that Non-Residential schools had the highest Reference
means for a geometric mean advantage of 2,305 Reference Transactions, while for
Participants in Group Presentations (and most other variables), Highly Residential
schools had the highest means, for an advantage of 1,027 over Primarily Residential
schools. Because significant results only showed for the covariate including part-time
students, this finding would need follow-up research, but it suggests that Reference may
have an important role for libraries where there are many students living off-campus.
In summary, the differences across libraries based on Residential Status indicates
a moderate relationship between students’ on-campus presence, face-to-face library
services, and use of physical materials and buildings. Furthermore, Residential Status
does not seem to affect use of Full-Text Articles, indicating that these library services
may be as effective remotely as they are on campus.
Carnegie Classification—Undergraduate Instruction Program, Program
Balance
Schools classified as Arts-and-Sciences-Focused had a higher group mean than
the other groups in the category Program Balance for all the variables, with Professional-

171
Focused institutions usually having the lowest group means. Large effect sizes included

Circulation (

=.22), and One-Time Expenditures

=.12).
As with some of the other Carnegie Classifications, follow-up study would be

needed to try to determine why Arts-and-Science-Focused institutions have higher library
use numbers. For example, the advantage of Arts-and-Science-Focused schools over the
next group, Arts-and-Sciences-Plus-Professional, was 24,025 Circulations. These schools
also had higher means on many library services and staff variables. Is it truly this
Carnegie Classification causing these differences, or are there other factors at play? In
addition to other relationships in the data, there could be characteristics that would
directly relate to libraries, such as the degree to which assignments involving research or
other library use are given at different types of institutions. Do Arts-and-Science-Focused
institutions currently have greater implementation of high-impact educational practices?
And if so, how are these affected by library use and services?
Carnegie Classification—Undergraduate Instruction Program, Graduate
Coexistence
The Carnegie Classification Undergraduate Instruction Program, Graduate
Coexistence had small effect sizes on Circulation, Full-Text Articles, and Gate Count (all
2

=.05). Although schools with High Graduate Coexistence had the highest means for

Circulation and Full-Text Articles, schools with No Graduate Coexistence had the highest
means for Gate Count. Schools with High Graduate Coexistence had advantages of 9,516
Circulations and 105,840 Full-Text Articles, respectively, over Some Graduate

172
Coexistence schools, while No Graduate Coexistence schools had 3,377 more visitors
than High Graduate Coexistence schools. This aligns with the finding that Carnegie Basic
Baccalaureate institutions had a higher Gate Count than Master’s or Doctoral schools.
While it seems likely that Graduate Coexistence shares some covariance with Carnegie
Basic, is there something about the “coexistence” aspect that is distinct?
Graduate Coexistence had a large effect on Interlibrary Loan (
Professional FTE (

2

=.14), and Ongoing Resources (

2

2

=.16), Librarian /

=.08). Interlibrary Loans at High

Graduate Coexistence schools were 2,560 higher, and One-Time Resources were $98,760
higher than at Some Graduate Coexistence schools. It was puzzling why “Some Graduate
Coexistence” was the lowest ranked for all variables with significant mean differences,
although its mean was just statistically lowest for Interlibrary Loan and Ongoing
Resources. For most variables, High Graduate Coexistence (N=98) and No Graduate
Coexistence (N=66) showed no statistical differences. Some Graduate Coexistence
(N=251) did have a substantially larger group size, but the variances on the dependent
variables were still close to that of the other groups.
Graduate Coexistence groups’ mean differences were very similar to the Carnegie
Classification—Basic, although the results were harder to interpret and apply. For this
reason, it seems that unless the concept of Graduate Coexistence is of specific theoretical
interest, this category may not be useful for library data models.
Carnegie Classification—Graduate Instruction Program
The Carnegie Classification Graduate Instruction Program had a medium effect
size on Circulation (
Count (

2

2

=.07), and small effects on Full-Text Articles (

2

=.05) and Gate

=.05). Although the univariate tests showed an overall difference among

173
groups, in only a few cases did groups have statistically different means. Similar to
Carnegie Basic, Doctoral Comprehensive Schools (with or without a medical school) had
higher Circulation than the other categories. For Full-Text Articles, however, Doctoral
Comprehensives with a Medical School had a much higher mean (162,715 more FullText Articles) than those without a medical school. For Full-Text Articles, Doctoral
Schools with a STEM emphasis had the second highest means, with Master’s Schools,
Business emphasis a third. This suggests a relationship between the library’s provision of
Full-Text Articles and institutional types with the highest research emphases. If this
finding is reproduced in future research, it will bear mention because it suggests libraries
play a role in the fulfilling these universities’ business strategy related to research
productivity. Administrators may want to determine more specific reasons for the
advantages provided by their library relative to their institutional mission. Surely the
162,715 additional Full-Text Articles needed at a Doctoral Comprehensive with a
Medical School relate to the increased need for medical research articles, which relates to
the $517,862 additional in Ongoing Expenditures spent by libraries at Doctoral
Comprehensives with Medical Schools. This hearkens back to resource dependence
theory (Malatesta & Smith, 2014), which could provide a framework for libraries to
demonstrate value to their institutions.
A regular pattern can be seen across Graduate Instruction Programs for many of
the other library variables, with the two Doctoral Comprehensive categories and STEM
schools having the highest means for Interlibrary Loan, Staff FTE, Ongoing
Expenditures, and One-Time Expenditures, echoing findings from Smith (2011), who
also found that Library Expenditures increased from Master’s to Research universities.

174
These findings do not necessarily indicate institutional support, however, as STEM
Schools had the second lowest mean for Library Budget as a Percent of Institutional
Expenditures despite their high means for library expenditures, Staff FTE, and
Interlibrary Loan.
In summary, the Graduate Instruction Program variable also seems to emphasize
the same concepts as Carnegie Basic, although providing more granular information
related to which institution types use Full-Text Articles. This suggests Full-Text Articles
is an important indicator for Doctoral Comprehensives with a Medical School, STEM
schools, and Business schools.
Comparison across Carnegie Classifications
Looking across Carnegie Classifications, it was interesting to see which
dependent variables responded the most dramatically to group differences. Tables 52
through 55 bring together the multivariate and univariate effect sizes on the DVs across
the MANCOVAs. The effect sizes are partial eta squared (

2

), which is the proportion of

variance explained by that variable that is not explained by other variables in the model.
For Residential Status, results from using both the original covariate and the alternative
covariate are presented.
It is important to remember the covariate has controlled for a significant amount
of variance: in the models with the three dependent variables, the covariate Full-Time
Students Plus Faculty explained 60% to 77% variance in the combined DVs, and for the
models with the twelve library variables, the covariate explained between 79% to 90% of
the variance in the combined DVs. After controlling for the covariates, the amount of
variance explained by the Carnegie groups on the combined DVs Circulation, Full-Text

175
Articles, and Gate Count ranged from 4% to 7% across the models, and on the DV
composed of twelve library variables, the effects of group differences explained between
8% and 21% of the variance. This suggests there are systematic differences in library
variables among different types of institutions, but that the institutional types don’t tell
the whole story.

For the multivariate DV with three variables (Table 52), Program Balance
predicted 7% of the variance, followed by the Residential Status and Graduate Instruction
Program. The Basic and Graduate Coexistence classifications predicted just 4% of the
variance in the composite DV. For the multivariate DV with twelve library variables

176
(Table 53), the Basic Carnegie Classification predicted 21% of the variance, followed by
Residential Status and Graduate Coexistence. Program Balance predicted 13% of the
variance in the multivariate DV, and the Graduate Instruction Program predicted 8%.
Looking at the univariate effects of group membership on the variables (Tables 54
and 55) shows patterns that may suggest two dimensions composing a library’s “business
strategy” on campus. Perhaps academic libraries support a function “Research
Productivity” that relates most to groupings such as Carnegie Basic and Graduate
Instruction Program, while perhaps libraries’ support for “high-impact practices” relate
more to the observed Residential Status and Program Balance group differences. It
remains to be determined whether high-impact practices such as first-year seminars,
learning communities, service learning, and undergraduate research, and capstone
experiences (Brownell & Swaner, 2009) relate to Residential Status or Program Balance

group differences, or library services, so libraries should begin exploring these
connections. Graduate Coexistence, which is a component of Undergraduate Instruction
Program that also relates to the presence of graduate programs, may differentiate schools
that address both strategies from those that tend toward one or the other.
Looking at the variables one-by-one shows some may relate more to High-Impact
Practices, some to Research Productivity, and some to both.
•

Circulation had the most variance for Residential Status, Program Balance,
and Graduate Instruction Program. Within these groupings, Highly Residential
Schools, Arts & Sciences schools, and Doctoral Comprehensive schools had
the highest means. Thus, Circulation may be an indicator of both High-Impact
Practices and Research Productivity.

•

Full-Text Articles had some of the lowest effect sizes, suggesting that it may
be something useful to all groups; however, the rankings are still interesting.
Doctoral schools, Highly Residential schools (when part-time students were
included in the covariate), High Graduate Coexistence, and Doctoral
Comprehensive Schools with a Medical school had the highest means within
their groupings. Full-Text Articles seems like it is related to both High-Impact
Practices and Research Productivity, but perhaps in different ways; the
alternative path models tested showed that Ongoing Expenditures was more
important for predicting Full-Text Articles at Doctoral Schools than at
Baccalaureate Plus Master’s schools. Tenopir (2014) has begun to investigate
how to measure article sharing, because articles are often used without
downloading them.

179
•

Gate Count showed moderate effect sizes for Residential Status and Program
Balance. For Gate Count, Highly Residential schools and Arts & Sciencesfocused schools had the highest means. Although the effect of Carnegie—
Basic was small for Gate Count, Baccalaureate had the highest mean Gate
Count. Thus, Gate Count seems more closely related to High-Impact Practices
than Research Productivity.

•

Participants in Group Presentations showed no significant effects across
Carnegie groups except with respect to Residential Status, where the most
residential schools had the highest mean Participants. Otherwise, the number
of students instructed seems proportional to the number of full-time students
and faculty at that institution, regardless of the type of school that it is. While
theoretically group presentations seems related to High-Impact Practices,
more investigation is needed to explore this relationship.

•

Reference Transactions also varied by Residential Status, although NonResidential Schools had the highest mean. Reference Transactions may also
vary by Program Balance and Graduate Coexistence, but the power of these
tests was questionable. Again, more research could illuminate the extent to
which Reference may relate to institutional outcomes.

•

Interlibrary Loans, Librarian / Professional FTE, and Staff FTE varied
significantly across all the groups, with moderate to large effect sizes,
suggesting these variables are relevant to all strategies. Doctoral schools,
Highly Residential schools, Arts & Sciences focused schools, High Graduate
Coexistence schools, and Doctoral Comprehensive and STEM schools have

180
the highest means for these variables. Although there may be a relationship
between these variables and High-Impact Practices, their relationship with
Research Productivity seems highly likely.
•

Reserves Circulation was only significant for Residential Status, where Highly
Residential schools had greater means than Primarily Residential, but not
necessarily for Non-Residential schools. The relative non-significance of
Reserves Circulation, increase in electronic reserves, and the overall decline in
Reserves Circulations observed by Martell (2008) from 1995-2006 suggest it
may not be a meaningful indicator.

•

Ongoing Expenditures had the largest effect sizes across all groups, especially
for Basic, Program Balance, and Graduate Instruction Program. Doctoral
schools, Arts-and-Sciences-Focused schools, High Graduate Coexistence,
Doctoral Comprehensive and STEM schools had the highest means within
their groups. Thus, Ongoing Expenditures seems linked to Research
Productivity.

•

One-Time Expenditures had moderate effect sizes across all groups, with
larger effects on Residential, Program Balance, and Graduate Instruction
Program groups. Highly Residential, Arts & Sciences, and Doctoral
Comprehensive with No Medical School had the highest means within their
groups. Thus, One-Time Expenditures seems more related to High-Impact
Practices.

•

Average salary variables were not very important for differentiating among
groups.

181
•

Percent of Institutional Budget group mean differences were significant just
for Graduate Instruction Program. The group with the highest mean, Doctoral
Comprehensive without a Medical School, only showed statistical differences
from the two lowest groups, STEM schools and business-dominant Master’s
schools, business dominant. The rankings of groups on this variable suggest
that schools with expensive graduate programs do not spend as much on their
libraries. The schools that use the most Full-Text Articles find their libraries
the lowest funded.

•

The MANCOVA tests were not sufficiently powerful to detect group
differences on the Social Media variable. This variable should be the focus of
future research to determine its potential usefulness.

Figure 44 attempts to provide a visualization that summarizes the two dimensions.
Highly Residential schools tend to have higher Circulation, Gate Count, One-Time
Expenditures, Interlibrary Loans, and Participants in Group Presentations. These
variables all seem to relate to being on campus and visiting the library, perhaps to check
out items, and to attend a library instruction class. When part-time students are included
in the covariate, Full-Text Articles are also higher at Highly Residential schools. Nonresidential schools have the highest Reference Transactions, indicating a different
modality of engagement between libraries and non-resident students.

182
Figure 44. Library variables grouped in two dimensions related to Carnegie Classification
groups.

Note: Variables shown outside the diagram may not be relevant factors for these
dimensions

Compared with the other types of schools in their groups, Doctoral schools and
other categories suggesting research productivity have the highest Full-Text Articles
counts, Ongoing Expenditures, and Interlibrary Loans. Although not always statistically
significant, those with expensive graduate programs (Business, STEM) also tend to have
less-well funded libraries, with lower library budgets in proportion to total institutional
expenditures. One interpretation might be that such institutions treat libraries more
cheaply, but another might be that these schools have additional expenses or larger
expenses than those without such programs.
Many of the findings related to Carnegie Classifications raised more questions
than answers. A future study could explore alternate ways to conceptualize institutional
types that relate more to the variables underlying the Carnegie Classifications. For
example, instead of looking at Residential status as a categorical variable, the number of

183
on-campus versus off-campus, and part-time vs full-time students could be used in a
linear regression model. Instead of using the Carnegie Basic categories to differentiate
Doctoral from Master’s, numbers of programs or students could be used. Finally,
although Circulation, Full-Text Articles, Gate Count, and other library use variables were
used as dependent variables in this study, it is important to remember that they are not
outcomes. They can be valuable indicators of activity, but do not show the university the
library’s contribution to student, faculty, or institutional outcomes.
Discussion of Regressions to Predict Research Dollars
A series of regression equations attempted to predict External Research Dollars
from Circulations, Full-Text Articles, and Gate Count, controlling for Full-Time Students
Plus Faculty. Both 2010 and 2012 datasets showed adding Carnegie Classification Basic
variables to the model had a significant effect on External Research Dollars, improving
the model by 13% in 2010 and 24% in 2012. This makes sense, since Doctoral schools
logically have larger research programs than Baccalaureate or Master’s. Similarly,
Graduate Coexistence demonstrated a significant relationship with External Research
Dollars in both 2010 and 2012, contributing 13% and 15% of the variance, respectively.
When Graduate Instruction Program was entered into its model, it also increased
predictive ability, 13% in 2010, and 28% in 2012. Doctoral institutions and High
Graduate Coexistence Schools had the highest coefficients in their categories for both
years, which makes logical sense given the relationship between these institutions’
research missions and External Research Dollars. Doctoral Schools-STEM and Doctoral
Schools-Comprehensive had the highest coefficients in 2010 and 2012 compared to
Master’s schools, respectively, although there was not much difference between them.

184
The superiority of these groups in terms of External Research Dollars over Master’s
schools also makes sense, because of their expanded research missions.
The interest in performing these regressions was to examine how library use
might influence External Research Dollars. Seeing how Carnegie Classifications
influenced the model was a secondary consideration. For all classifications, only the 2012
dataset revealed a significant effect of Full-Text Articles on External Research Dollars
and no model showed a significant effect of Gate Count. The effect could therefore be
due to increased power resulting from sample size, or a change from 2010 to 2012, or a
combination of the two.
For Carnegie Classification Basic, only the 2012 data showed an effect of the
library variables on External Research Dollars in the final models. However, the
magnitude and sign of the coefficients in 2010 suggested the same pattern: Full-Text
Articles had a positive correlation with External Research Dollars, and Circulation had a
negative correlation. In 2012, with Carnegie Basic in the model, for each sd increase in
Full-Text articles, External Research Dollars increased .46 sd, and for each sd increase in
Circulations, External Research Dollars decreased by .41 sd. For the Carnegie
Classification Graduate Coexistence, in 2012 only, Full-Text Articles contributed 3%
unique variance to the Step 3 model, and for every sd increase in Full-Text Articles,
External Research Dollars increased by .25 sd. For the model with Graduate Instruction
Program included, only with 2012 did the library use variables add to the prediction of
External Research Dollars (increasing prediction by 7%). In the final model, for every sd
increase in Full-Text Articles, External Research Dollars increased by .20 sd. The only
significant interaction coefficients were in the Graduate Instruction Program model;

185
while the individual effects were not interpreted due to very small effect sizes and this
study was exploratory, future research should continue to enter interaction terms in the
model. The increase in power with 2012’s larger sample size was able to detect
significant effects of Full-Text Articles on External Research Dollars for each of the
Carnegie Classifications tested only when the Carnegie variables were also in the
equation. Increases due to Full-Text Articles ranged from .20 to .46 sd increase in
External Research Dollars for each sd increase in Full-Text Articles across the models.
In summary, the institution’s mission has a relationship with external research
funding above and beyond institution size. There is some evidence for a positive
relationship between Full-Text Articles and External Research Dollars, but more research
could confirm or further illuminate the nature of the relationship. Additionally, there was
one model showing less use of the library’s physical materials at institutions with high
external research funding. These regressions were examples of analyses connecting
library use indicators such as Circulation, Full-Text Articles, and Gate Count to
institutional outcomes such as External Research Dollars. While such connections are
worthy of exploration, External Research Dollars makes more sense as an outcome for
some schools (e.g., Doctoral) than others. Libraries need to determine the key dependent
variables for their type of institution in order to choose an appropriate strategy for having
an effect on outcomes of relevance.
Discussion of Methodological Issues
In addition to the results related to the research questions, this study illuminated
some methodological issues. First, although the idea of using two different years’ worth
of data seemed appealing for the purposes of cross-validation, the datasets had different

186
amounts of missing data, making some variables different. For example, One-Time
Expenditures for 2010 was a variable created by summing Monographs plus Other
Library Materials, and Ongoing Expenditures 2010 was a variable created by summing
Current Serials plus Miscellaneous. In 2012, One-Time Expenditures and Ongoing
Expenditures existed in their own right. This made it difficult to know whether
differences in results across the datasets were due to these differences, or the increased
power of the 2012 sample size, or due to qualities of substantive interest. For example,
only the 2012 dataset revealed a significant effect of library use variables on External
Research Dollars. Is this because something changed from 2010 to 2012 about the
relationship between libraries and research? Or in the reporting of Research Dollars? For
example, 2010 was the first year the NSF began to include non-science and engineering
fields. Perhaps greater reporting from these fields emerged in 2012. Future research will
be required to explore these questions.
A question asked early in this paper was whether there were strong correlations
among the three variables Circulation, Full-Text Articles, and Gate Count. The
hypotheses were that Circulation and Gate Count would be positively correlated,
Circulation and Full-Text Articles slightly correlated, and Gate Count and Full-Text
Articles uncorrelated. Partial bivariate correlations and the results of the MANCOVA
analyses suggest that these variables are related (Table 56). According to Hemphill’s
guidelines, the correlations between Circulation and Full-Text Articles, and Gate Count
and Full-Text Articles are small, and the correlations between Circulation and Gate
Count are medium. These make logical sense, since visiting the library building seems
logically related to checking out physical items. However, it could be interesting for

187
future research to see how this relationship may have changed over time, especially if one
is able to differentiate libraries with a campus delivery service.

With one exception, this study used the covariate Full-Time Students Plus Faculty
to control for institutional size. Previous library research has often divided some
variables, but not others, by the number of student FTE (Jones, 2007; Hunter & Perret,
2011). Throughout this study, the covariate Full-Time Students Plus Faculty had large
correlations with the other variables, and effect sizes of the covariate’s influence on
dependent variables were large. Thus, the results of this study indicate use of this type of
covariate is important, and should be used more consistently and deliberately.
While this covariate had a meaningful effect across the study, it masked
differences between part- and full-time enrollments. Full-time Students Plus Faculty also
seemed theoretically problematic for the MANCOVA involving the Carnegie
Classification Size and Setting (Residential Status). Therefore, the covariate Full-Time
and Part-Time Students Plus Faculty was tested with two MANCOVAS involving
Residential Status. Although the ranked order of groups was almost the same for both

188
covariates, the effect sizes for the group differences, and therefore the remaining mean
values, were greater after controlling for the alternative covariate. A future study could
further investigate the potential for using full and part-time students plus faculty as a
covariate. IPEDS provides a variable “Estimated full-time equivalent undergraduate
enrollment academic year” that could have been a useful way to include full and parttime undergraduates without a significant loss of data. This variable will be strongly
considered for use in future studies.
The log transformation applied to the data helped to “normalize” the data, but
even after the log transformation the covariate still had significant effects with large
effect sizes. For example, among the MANCOVAs, effect sizes of the covariate on the
multivariate DV ranged from partial

2

of .68 to .89. The log transformation of variables

required extra steps when interpreting results because results had to be reversetransformed into the original units, and some statistics, such as standard deviation, cannot
be reverse-transformed (Bland & Altman, 1996a). The reverse log transformation
produced geometric means rather than the more familiar arithmetic means. The geometric
mean is a measure of central tendency that reduces the influence of extreme observations
on the data; therefore, the geometric mean seems more useful when working with ACRL
and ALS national datasets (cf. Olivier, Johnson, & Marshall, 2008). A final thought about
methodology is that this study’s samples were significantly reduced by missing data.
Future research could explore the opportunities to impute missing data values in an
attempt to try to avoid needing to listwise delete so many cases.
This study’s explorations included a variable “Social Media” that represented the
extent to which libraries used Social Media for various purposes. The specific validity of

189
the indicator is up for debate and should be the subject of additional research. The idea
that libraries’ use of social media is a theoretical indicator that could predict library use
also requires more exploration. While at least two studies have found that promoting
digital special collections through social media increases use (Bagget & Gibbs, 2014;
Elder & Westbrook, 2012), other studies have found that students may be unaware of
social media beyond Facebook and may be unlikely to friend the library (Wu et al.,
2014). Because this variable was missing for so many cases, it was a disadvantage for a
study like this one. However, future research could examine the Social Media variables
directly in pursuit of questions focused on Social Media technology and purpose.
Limitations
This study had several limitations. First, none of the models in this study factored
in differences related to part-time or graduate students. Yet, there are probably
differences related to these groups with respect to libraries. Another limitation was the
large amount of missing data. Future studies could use data imputation methods to
mitigate this issue, or focus on fewer numbers of variables. This study used data from
2010 and 2012, but some variables in 2010 and 2012 datasets were tracked differently.
The two years’ sample sizes were also different.
In general, this study would have been better informed by a stronger theoretical
basis; however, the library field has been slow to create theories connecting the variables
in this study with outcomes, or to adapt theory from other fields. Because of the sweeping
changes in the information marketplace and in higher education, libraries need new
theories to inform their work. Because of the lack of theory, this study was largely
exploratory, meaning many models did not fit. Furthermore, there was not always a

190
theoretical explanation of results. These are disadvantages of exploratory research.
However, the findings did suggest some directions for the library profession to pursue.
Situating Findings Within the Theoretical Framework
What did the results of this research illuminate about libraries’ strategic approach
to allocating resources in a way that aligns with university strategy? In the library
context, business strategy may usefully be thought of as how an organization or unit
aligns itself with its parent organization’s strategic plan. The MANCOVA analyses which
explored differences between Carnegie Groups seem to have potential to describe the
alignment of library missions with institutional missions.
Highly Residential schools tended to have higher Circulation, Gate Count, OneTime Expenditures, Interlibrary Loans, and Participants in Group Presentations. These
variables all seem to relate to being on campus and visiting the library, perhaps to check
out items, and to attend a library instruction class. Non-Residential schools had the
highest reference transactions, indicating a different modality of engagement between
libraries and non-resident students. These relationships do not mean the result of the
relationship between the library and the on-campus environment is having any particular
student outcome, but it does at least point to a logical alignment.
In the same way, there appears to be a strategic relationship between Doctoral
schools (and other categories suggesting research productivity) with higher Full-Text
Articles counts, Ongoing Expenditures, and Interlibrary Loans. Considering the results of
the regressions on External Research Dollars, there was a demonstrated relationship
between Full-Text Articles and External Research Dollars, at least when Carnegie Basic,
Graduate Coexistence, or Graduate Instruction Program categories were included in the

191
model. There was also one model showing a negative correlation between Circulation
and External Research Dollars when controlling for Carnegie Basic classification. It
would be interesting to explore this further: do different types of graduate programs
affect Circulation differently?
The first part of this paper brought up the issue of quality and staffing: does an
increase in staffing result in any increase in library outputs? While the salary variables
seemed to have little role to play in any of the models, Librarian / Professional FTE and
Staff FTE varied according to every Carnegie class, with higher numbers of both types of
staff at Doctoral schools, Highly Residential schools, Arts & Sciences focused schools,
High Graduate Coexistence schools, and Doctoral Comprehensive and STEM schools.
This relationship is not an evaluation of quality of service, in the same way that a
Doctoral school does not in any way provide a “higher-quality” education than a
Baccalaureate—the two just have different missions. The relationship supports the idea
that more library staff are required for graduate programs and schools with more oncampus engagement. However, these findings do not explain why more staff might be
needed at these types of schools. Because none of the SEM models with staff variables
fit, they did not further illuminate these relationships.
Although the above findings provide hints and clues, ultimately the answer to
whether the ACRL and ALS surveys provide ways to connect library strategic decisions
with campus strategies, such as high-impact educational practices or attracting external
research dollars, the answers are “no” or at least, “not well.” The variables Circulation,
Full-Text Articles, and Gate Count show patterns of library activity, but not relationships
with student, faculty, or institutional outcomes. If presentations at the 2014 Library

192
Assessment Conference are any indication, modern libraries’ strategies seem focused on
two areas: high-impact educational practices and research outcomes. And while the
ACRL and ALS data may have elements to contribute to the assessment of these areas,
they are incomplete.
Riehle and Weiner (2013) found that literature about five of the high-impact
practices (capstone experiences, learning communities, service learning and communitybased learning, undergraduate research, and writing-intensive courses) included
information literacy competencies, confirming that information literacy is highly relevant
to these practices. For example, the information literacy competency “Access the needed
information effectively and efficiently” appeared in literature about all five of the
competencies they investigated. Single-institution studies have explored connections
between libraries and learning communities (Crowe, 2014), information literacy and
general education experience (Pemberton & Siefert, 2014), and participation in an
undergraduate research journal, information literacy, and student learning (Weiner,
2014).
The datasets examined in this dissertation did not contain variables intended to
measure libraries’ contribution to high-impact educational practices, but some of them
seemed like they could be more proximal than others. Participants in Group
Presentations, Interlibrary Loans, Reference Transactions, and Reserves Circulations
seemed logical as indicators of engagement between a library user and library services.
Furthermore, Circulation, Gate Count, and Full-Text Articles all provide an indication
that library users are incorporating library information into their work. Goodall and
Pattern (2011) and Soria, Fransen, and Nackerud (2013) have found positive correlations

193
between online library usage and academic achievement. The degree to which a library
uses Social Media seemed like another potential indicator of the library’s effort to engage
with patrons. Finally, the researcher hoped to draw a connection between engagement
with library services such as Participants in Group Presentations, and the library use
variables such as Circulations, Full-Text Articles, and Gate Count.
The SEM measurement models with the latent variable “Engagement with Library
Services” did not support the formation of a construct from these indicators. Path models
created to test connections between single indicators, one of which was Participants in
Group Presentations, also failed to fit. Some path models created after the rest of the
statistical analyses had been completed did fit, but while Ongoing Expenditures was a
significant predictor of Full-Text Articles, Participants in Group Presentations was not,
although it did predict Interlibrary Loans. Previous research by Fagan (2014a) had also
shown a stronger relationship between Ongoing Expenditures and Full-Text Articles than
Participants in Group Presentations or Reference Transactions and Full-Text Articles.
Therefore, the evidence for using Presentations in Group Presentations, Reference
Transactions, and other library service “counts” to predict library use indicators is not
strong.
A major issue seems to be teasing apart the idea of “providing library resources”
versus “instructing and engaging with users.” These two concepts have different goals. In
fact, current surveys of library users along these lines often split these concepts into
“student goals” and “faculty goals” (Schonfeld, Asher, & Gendron, 2014). Providing
library resources may well be measured by the relationship between Ongoing
Expenditures and Full-Text Articles, which was upheld by previous and the current

194
research. But the effects of instructing and engaging with users may not increase FullText Articles, Circulation, or Gate Count. They may instead increase the results of the
high-impact practices more directly.
What seems to be missing from the national datasets is more granular information
about resource allocation, specifically, staffing. Variation in the number of professional
and support staff existed for every Carnegie grouping—but it is unclear why Arts-andSciences-Focused institutions need more staff, or what the extra staff on Highly
Residential campuses are doing. It could be useful to know specifically, how many hours
staff spend devoted to the services that matter to the library and university mission.
Libraries keep detailed information about the types and formats of materials added to the
collection (e.g., microforms), but no information about the staff hours spent to provide
services. In the models in these studies, the only metrics available related to staffing were
number of professional staff, support staff, and student workers. Salaries are also
available. But some of the more interesting changes in libraries have been shifts in how
staff are spending their time.
Figure 45 shows one view of how library investments (solid rectangles) support
faculty and graduate student productivity (focusing more on the sciences and
technology), which could potentially be measured by the dashed rectangles. Libraries
currently measure the number of full-text articles and interlibrary loans (although they
don’t separate articles and books for Interlibrary Loans, which would be useful).
What libraries don’t measure is the work that goes into cultivating and licensing
journal collections, performing the interlibrary loans, or supporting the systems that
permit search and discovery of full-text articles and journals. Libraries now have

195
professional staff dedicated to supporting media publishing platforms, institutional
repositories, and data repositories. The time of these staff is an investment. In addition,
these skill sets are distinctive to libraries, providing a competitive advantage for libraries
in terms of the “imperfect imitability” described by Peteraf (1993).

Figure 45. Diagram showing how library investments (solid rectangles) support faculty
and graduate student productivity (STEM focus).

Without tracking the type of time spent, libraries have no way to connect
expenditures on staff with the university’s mission. Figure 46 provides a diagram of just a
few of the ways staff hours directly support library services theorized to affect research
productivity. This idea has been the subject of an exploratory study by Crumpton and
Crowe (2014), who surveyed faculty at the University of North Carolina, Greensboro to
determine specific university needs related to research data support and identify library

196
services relevant to these needs. The results of the present study suggest that learning
about this area is especially important for STEM schools and Doctoral institutions, which
have significantly greater ongoing and one-time expenditures, interlibrary loan services,
and numbers of staff per full-time student and faculty member, but are given less money
in proportion to total institutional budget than Baccalaureate and Master’s institutions.

Figure 46. Diagram showing how staff hours spent on library services support faculty and
graduate student productivity.

Libraries also play a critical role in non-STEM disciplines. A similar view, Figure
47, shows how what a library does to support access to primary sources can support
faculty and graduate student productivity in the Humanities. Although libraries do track

197
Circulation, they do not track the other solid rectangles. A similar figure to Figure 46
could be created for Figure 47 to show staff hours dedicated to providing access to digital
archives as well as the cost of the archives themselves, and the staff hours dedicated to
supporting special collections as well as the collections themselves.

Figure 47. Diagram showing how library investments (solid rectangles) support faculty
and graduate student productivity (Humanities focus).

Figure 45-47 have a heavy focus on library collections, digital scholarship, and
services related to them. Materials expenditures, systems expenditures, and staff hours in
direct support of these functions likely have a strong impact on faculty and graduate
productivity. However, this concept of providing resources is only part of a library’s
mission.
Thinking with respect to information literacy programs, faculty development and
support, and the modern library building, a model could be created where these activities

198
influence the core activities of faculty teaching and undergraduate research and
scholarship, thereby having effects on the high-impact educational practices discussed
earlier, represented here by critical thinking, research skills, and student engagement
(Figure 48). Furthermore, information literacy programs have a direct effect on research
skills and student engagement, and the library as a place has a direct effect on student
engagement. Booker, Detlor, and Serenko (2012) found that library instruction had a
positive effect on users’ intentions to use the online library in the early stages of research.
Weiner (2014) has explored relationships between information literacy and student
participation in an undergraduate research journal.

Figure 48. Diagram showing how library investments (solid rectangles) support
undergraduate research and scholarship, critical thinking, research skills, and student
engagement.

199
The idea of library as a place for collaboration, media production, and learning
commons activities is supported by Opperman and Jamison (2008, p. 571), who noted the
transformation of the physical library into a “destination dedicated to discovery and
learning,” and Yoo-Lee, Lee, and Velez (2013), who have encouraged the profession to
include the type of use of library spaces in studies of library use.
Librarians and other professional staff spend enormous numbers of hours
developing information literacy programs, teaching information literacy classes, and
providing direct support to high-impact parts of the curriculum such as first-year
seminars, research methods courses, and capstone courses. At some schools, libraries and
educational technology services are integrated, and then the “library” is also offering
faculty development and support services such as online course development, classroom
technology support, and instruction in the use of new media in the classroom. Even at
schools where libraries and educational technologies are not integrated, librarians are
beginning to examine how their services might directly contribute to teaching (FlemingMay, Mays, & Pemberton, 2014). Libraries now dedicate personnel or partner with other
units on campus to provide learning commons services, media production facilities, and
collaboration spaces within library buildings. In this environment of heterogeneous
capabilities and resources (Peteraf, 1993), libraries have the opportunity to distinguish
themselves if they can articulate their unique strengths.
Interestingly, the activities and outcomes in Figure 48 can happen without an
extensive library collection. Although one could make a case that “more” is always
better, the truth is that good undergraduate research can be supported by “some good
journals” and access to “some primary sources.” What makes a difference in the

200
outcomes in Figure 48 is the quality of the staff and spaces and the programmatic
approach. Collaborative, friendly librarians and instructional technologists building highquality relationships with faculty and students is what’s important. Thinking of Garvin’s
(1998) theories of quality, this supports the idea that investment in staff will produce
higher quality library services. Looking at just the “Information Literacy Program” piece,
for example, staff hours are spent on a variety of activities to produce a successful
instruction program (Figure 49).

Figure 49. Diagram showing how staff hours contribute to a library’s information literacy
program.

The levers in the models related to supporting research productivity, Figures 45
and 47, are theoretically more related to extensive materials collections. However, it is
still important to recognize that the cost of the staff-hours to support these collections is a
significant expense.
The figures illustrating faculty / graduate student productivity and high-impact
practices relate to one another as well. Undergraduate research could be positively or
negatively affected by a strong graduate research program, depending on the

201
programmatic implementation of the university. Libraries may have a direct influence on
such interactions: this study showed that schools with a high graduate coexistence
between undergraduate and graduate instruction programs had higher interlibrary loans,
number of professional staff, and ongoing resource expenditures. Perhaps schools with
high graduate coexistence have both strong high-impact educational practices and high
faculty/graduate productivity.
The specifics of models connecting library activities to things like high-impact
practices may vary by instructional program. This study found that Arts & Sciencesfocused schools had higher means on most library variables than Professional-focused
schools. Yet the professions (health, business, education) seem like they could benefit
equally if not more from high-impact practices that produce greater critical thinking,
problem solving, and research skills, because these are skills important to employers
(LEAP, 2013). Libraries at schools with a stronger Professional focus may be able to
make persuasive arguments for resources by exploring more closely how the practices of
libraries at Arts & Sciences focused schools are netting advantages in library use
variables and student outcomes variables.
Hearkening back to strategic management theories, these figures provide
examples of how a library might visualize its strategic advantages (Barney, 1991). They
postulate some of the specific ways that libraries’ investments of staff hours and
materials expenditures affect core activities of the university, as well as the outcomes to
which the library’s work relates. The figures are not meant to be complete or accurate for
all types of institutions. They are meant to illustrate that to explain what an academic
library does, more information is needed about the expenditures of staff hours, systems,

202
and materials in specific areas. They also illustrate the importance of hypothesizing
specific relationships. It is easy—and meaningless—to say “library services have a
positive effect on student outcomes by supporting teaching, learning, and research.” It is
better to try to explain which library services have effects on teaching, which on learning,
and which on research, and which student outcomes specifically are affected by the
presence of the library services in the overall model. Also, there is an opportunity to
demonstrate how library staff provide distinctive capabilities in the heterogeneous
campus environment (Peteraf, 1993).
This discussion underscores the critical importance of specifying organizational
strategy up front. Libraries are not clearly identifying the dependent variables on which
they intend their services to have impact. This study used Circulation, Full-Text Articles,
and Gate Count as indicators of library use because they were available. These may be
good indicators by which one could measure the effectiveness of a programmatic change
designed to increase use. But they are not measures of student learning or faculty
research productivity.
Any suggestions for new measures will encounter logistical barriers in how to
measure “services” across institutions. This is why staff hours is proposed as the unit of
measurement. Staff hours are a huge constraint in academic libraries, one that is often not
given attention as such. Reference librarians may spend hours tracking down an elusive
fact for an enthusiastic patron without pausing to think of whether those hours could be
better spent on another activity. An instruction librarian may obsess about revising her
online tutorial to be sure the screenshots are perfectly up to date rather than step back and
think about whether it will truly matter to the student’s development of information

203
literacy skills. Libraries obsess about measuring our materials and expenditures on them.
Yet we neglect to measure an equally if not more important resource: our time.
Handing stopwatches out to librarians and other staff would be met with
understandable resistance. What libraries should focus on are the logical connections, as
some are just beginning to do (Archambault, 2014; Clarke, 2014; Crowe, 2014; Nolfi,
Sasso, & Koelsch, 2014; Savage, 2014). Setting aside for the moment questions of how
we would measure staff time, libraries need to identify the meaningful dependent
variables that change, or that they want to see change, as a result of how library staff
spend their time.
First, libraries should think strategically about which student and faculty
outcomes are affected by our library services, spaces, and materials, and how and why.
Retention has often been a focus because of the availability of the metric, but is that
really where the library has the most impact? Perhaps critical thinking and research skills,
now identified as valuable to employers, are areas where libraries have more of an
opportunity to distinguish themselves because their distinctive organizational
competencies give them a competitive advantage in these areas. After identifying the
dependent variables of interest, libraries should think about which services and programs
influence those variables. In the case of critical thinking, library instruction comes to
mind, but the modern library offers many other types of events, from interdisciplinary
colloquia to hackathons.
Once libraries form more logical connections, they may see ways to measure staff
time differently. Instead of the numbers of staff, perhaps measuring the hours spent on
the activity-groups that matter most. By having clearly tied activities to strategic

204
outcomes, libraries will know exactly why they are hosting a hackathon (critical
thinking). Rather than counting just the number of hours spent on direct library
instruction, libraries could count the hours spent on activities designed to promote critical
thinking.
This general approach may also illuminate shifts in types of staff. For example, in
a 10-year longitudinal study, Regazzi (2012) found that large and doctoral institutions
have increased staff spending well above the mean for all libraries, and across all
institutions, librarian staff levels have increased by 9%, while other professional staff
(non-librarians with professional qualifications) have increased 51%. The increase in use
of “other professional staff” is most visible when looking at libraries grouped by
Carnegie Classification: “for every one staff FTE added as Librarian staff to Doctoral
research institutions, 13 other professional FTEs were added.” What seems to be
important in this context is which activities are consuming staff time and how staff skill
sets and activities relate to what Barney calls “competitive advantage.” Paraphrasing his
questions for the library context:
•

On what basis is the library seeking to distinguish itself as a provider of valued
services to student and faculty? Production efficiency? Innovation? Customer
service?

•

Where in the value chain is the greatest leverage for achieving this
differentiation?

•

Which employees or employee groups provide the greatest potential to
differentiate the library from other valued services on campus? (Barney & Wright,
1998, p. 41).

205
A library that is seeking to emphasize its role as a contributor to undergraduate
research may want to distinguish itself through an excellent information literacy
instruction program, and if educational technologies are part of the organization, through
faculty development. The expertise of liaison librarians and instructional technologists
provide high potential to differentiate the library from other units on campus. A library
that is seeking to emphasize its contribution to faculty productivity may instead wish to
distinguish itself on efficient, seamless delivery of full-text articles and rapid interlibrary
loan service. Staff who specialize in supporting article delivery systems, interlibrary loan
staff, and personalized research services for high-stakes research centers might be a
focus.
Future Research
Following from the previous discussion, a vast area for future research is to
explore connections between library services, high-impact practices, and high-impact
practices’ outcomes (e.g., Collins & Holmes, 2014; Nolfi, Sasso, and Koelsch, 2014), as
well as connections between library services and research productivity (Rawls, 2014). A
good way to start might be for a few libraries or a consortium to agree on an approach to
modeling their business strategies and which variables to measure, then to share data with
one another for the purposes of validating and improving the approach. Some variables
that appear immediately useful are:
•

Unique Journal Titles, Total Journals Expenditures, Count of Subscription
Databases, and Total Databases Expenditures, which could help clear up some
of the questions surrounding Ongoing Expenditures

•

Interlibrary Loans Borrowed—Articles and Interlibrary Loans—Books

206
•

Campus Delivery Service Circulations.

•

Staff hours spent on categories of activities (c.f., Figure 46).

The ideas discussed in this paper related to connecting the library’s work with
high-impact practices could potentially be adapted to the online learning environment.
However, the specific activities in which librarians and professional staff engage may be
quite different. In addition, the increase in enrollments in distance education programs
may affect online library use differently than physical library use. Some variables that
could be helpful would include:
•

Number of Participants in Online Library Instruction

•

Number of Online Library Instruction Classes

•

Number of Online Learning Objects

•

Number of Online Courses with Embedded Library Content.

•

Staff hours spent on categories of activities (c.f., Figure 49).

Obviously, all these variables would need to be more clearly defined, but that
would be the purpose for starting with a small group of libraries.
This study had intended to also explore the effect of an institution’s involvement
in distance learning on library services, but this was not completed due to time
constraints. Distance enrollment data can be obtained from the IPEDS Data Center
(http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/datacenter/) and merged with ACRL or other datasets using the
IPEDS identifier. Libraries were to be grouped into percentiles using number of
enrollments in at least some distance education courses, then groups were to be compared
to determine the extent to which these groups varied on all the library services,
expenditure, and use variables in this study. Enrollment in distance learning courses is

207
tracked separately for undergraduates and graduates, so these populations could be also
explored separately in conjunction with the Carnegie Classifications Undergraduate
Instructional Program and Graduate Instructional Program.
Several of the findings from comparing Carnegie groups could use further
investigation. The Carnegie Classification Undergraduate Instruction Program was split
into Program Balance and Graduate Coexistence, and the Program Balance set suggested
consistently higher levels of library service at Arts-and-Sciences-Focused institutions.
The reasons for this bear exploration. Also, studies could be designed that use this
classification without splitting it into two.
Carnegie Size and Setting was also split into two groups, to separate size from
residential status in this study. Residential status showed a relationship to library service
use—including the intriguing finding that Reference Transactions may be higher for
Non-Residential students. For this reason, studying the effects of part-time enrollment on
library use variables (not as a covariate, but as an independent variable) could be useful
for future research. Part-time students are charged with the same assignments in courses
as their full-time compatriots, so part-time students would have an influence on library
resource use, although the specific nature of that use could vary. However, they could
influence use of some types of resources and services more than others.
For any of the ideas discussed, alternative variables may be more indicative of
institutional differences than the Carnegie classes or graduate programs. With many
caveats, Bonaccorsi, Daraio, Lepori, and Slipersaeter (2007) noted PhD degrees per 100
undergraduates could be used to indicate research productivity at an institution. Other
ideas include the proportion of expenditures on instruction and research to overall

208
expenditures; proportion of expenditures on the library to overall expenditures;
proportion of faculty in various ranks; proportions of degree types granted; and the
proportion of external research dollars to a university’s budget.

209
Chapter 6: Conclusion
Libraries are not yet clearly articulating their business strategies. However, pieces
of their strategy can be observed in data patterns in the ALTS and ALS survey results. To
complete the picture, libraries would need to gather additional data. Choosing and
collecting data is expensive. Therefore libraries should first “think locally” about their
business strategies, and test ideas on their own or with a small group of libraries. Staffing
hours seem like one unit of measurement that could provide information about libraries’
investment in services that support institutional outcomes, including high-impact
practices and research productivity.
In addition to learning how to measure their services in a way that will permit
logical connections to student learning outcomes and research outcomes, libraries need to
continue to think hard about which services will contribute the most to the institution’s
mission. Some library services many no longer have a significant contribution and new
services might provide stronger support to students and faculty, even if they don’t
immediately seem like “library” services. Libraries that figure out the right
apportionment of staff hours on activities relevant to the university’s mission are going to
be stronger contributors. And if libraries figure out a way to track this sort of data
nationally, they have the potential to measure how their activities connect to university
outcomes using powerful statistical techniques. In addition to demonstrating their value
to the university’s mission, the ability to measure contribution means libraries can test
new ideas or alternative approaches in a way that will have meaningful impact on
students and faculty.
