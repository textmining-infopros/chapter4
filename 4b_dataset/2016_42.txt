This qualitative study examined the development of the Illinois School Library
Association (ISLMA). The research focused on archival documents from the ISLMA, the Illinois
Library Association (ILA), and the Illinois Association for Media in Education (IAME) Archives
and the personal files of the interviewees. In addition, interviews were conducted with
individuals associated with IAME and ISLMA. Participants were asked to recollect the
development of ISLMA and their professional roles relative to its birth. This research was
examined in relation to the development of ISLMA, school library media history and related
education, and library national standards and trends and is presented as both a narrative and an
oral history to give voice to the organization.
This case study lays the groundwork for a history of ISLMA by tracing its origins and
historical development from its birth in 1988 to its current status. What has emerged is ISLMA’s
continuous commitment to its stated purpose of advocacy – the public recognition of the
importance of school libraries and certified personnel and their professional development.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
I would like to thank the exemplary school library media specialists who took part in this
study for generously sharing their time and memories, especially Marilyn “Kay” Maynard,
ISLMA’s first president and executive secretary. Without their courage, initiative, and
leadership, the Illinois school library profession would not have developed into the dynamic
force it is today. I am grateful to Joyce Karon, my mentor in school librarianship; Pamela
Kramer, a colleague and supporter of this research; and Donald Adcock, the impetus for this
research, for their dedication and service to school librarianship both nationally and locally.
I would also like to thank the members of my committee: Dr. Rebecca Hunt, Dr. Olha
Ketsman and Dr. James Lockard, for their insights and flexibility. In particular, I would like to
express my appreciation to my committee chair, Dr. Rebecca P. Butler, for her wisdom, patience
and unwavering support for this endeavor. She is the genesis for this research study, and under
her guidance it moved from an idea to a historical record and now a dissertation.

	  

DEDICATION
This dissertation is lovingly dedicated to my husband, Randall; my children, Sarah, Katharine,
Elisabeth, and Nicholas; my siblings; and my parents, Patricia P. and Henry S. Romano, whose
support, encouragement, and constant love have sustained me throughout my life.

PREFACE
The basis for this narrative is an event that occurred March 3, 1988, at the annual
conference of the Illinois Association for Media in Education (IAME). A group of Illinois school
library media specialists, The Friends of School Libraries, banded together to break away from
IAME and to create a professional library organization focused on the needs of Illinois school
librarians. The group’s intent was to “foster and improve school library media service to the state
of Illinois and to co-operate with other library and educational organizations in meeting the
information needs” of students and teachers (March 1988 ISLMA press release, p. 1).
Its intention was to replace the Illinois Association for Media in Education (IAME), a
section of the Illinois Library Association (ILA). The ISLMA founders’ purpose was to continue
providing professional educational opportunities in conferences, workshops, and other similar
activities such as awards, scholarships, and recognition for retirees; improvement in the
certification and standards requirements for school libraries; activities to ensure intellectual
freedom; public recognition of the importance of school libraries and certified personnel; passage
of beneficial school library legislation by the state; input to the Illinois State Board of Education,
the American Association of School Libraries (AASL), and state educational organizations; and
activities to meet the professional needs of non-members (March 1988 ISLMA press release).
ISLMA was founded to “serve the specific needs of school library media professionals” (March
1988 ISLMA press release, p. 2).

xiii

Since the early 1980s, ILA had had a long history of ignoring the needs (continuing
professional development) of the IAME membership in favor of public, academic, and special
librarians. Therefore, the event in 1988 at the IAME annual conference became significant
because it represented its membership making a dramatic shift in its dealings with ILA. By
voting approval for the disbandment of IAME as a sub-section of ILA, the Friends of School
Libraries was recognizing its responsibility to determine and oversee the needs of school library
media specialists in Illinois. This simple procedural action would produce multiple ramifications
for ISLMA as the organization sought national recognition and accreditation from AASL and the
American Library Association (ALA) and the overall education of school librarians.
The research for this narrative inquiry began with the ISLMA archives at the Abraham
Lincoln Presidential Library in Springfield. The topical areas examined were the documents
from the Executive Committee, the Board of Directors, and various other committees and task
forces for the time period of 1980-1998. From archival research, prominent people emerged:
Marilyn “Kay” Maynard, Pamela Kramer, Joyce Karon, Nancy Bloomstrand, Fran Corcoran,
Loris Farrell Fisher, Jackie Plourde, Eleanor “Kek” Robien, Elaine Roth, Rebecca “Becky”
Tewartha, and Bernadette Winter. (see Appendix A for the ISLMA Board of Directors).
Maynard served in various elected capacities in IAME, but for this study her most significant
roles were as IAME’s last president and ISLMA’s first president and executive secretary.
Maynard began her term as IAME president in 1988 and became the first president of ISLMA
when all members of the IAME Board of Directors transitioned to the new organization to
become the ISLMA’s initial Board of Directors. She is the only founding ISLMA member to
offer continuous service as a Board member since its inception. Pamela Kramer also had other
positions within IAME, but her role as the first elected ISLMA president and as editor of ISLMA

xiv

newsletters and publications, such as Linking for Learning, were most significant to this study.
These two individuals became major primary sources of information for this research. In
addition, other inaugural ISLMA board members, Nancy Bloomstrand, President-elect; Joyce
Karon, Secretary; Becky Trewartha, Treasurer; and Jackie Plourde, Director, were identified
through examination of ISLMA’s archives (leadership directory, minutes, newsletters) and by
interviewees as sources of information about leadership roles within IAME and ISLMA. Nancy
Bloomstrand, Joyce Karon, and Becky Trewartha were vital voices in relating ISLMA’s
beginnings.
Next, interviews were conducted with Elaine Roth, Kek Robien, Loris Farrell Fisher,
Jackie Plourde, Sarah Long Anderson, Fran Corcoran, and Bernadette Winters, all active IAME
members at the time of ISLMA’s formation and charter members of ISLMA. These interviews
were conducted almost twenty years after the events from the 1980s occurred and, as such, are
oral histories. When necessary and available, the oral accounts were corroborated with other
interviews or ISLMA historical documents.
Additional interviews with members of the 1998 and 2008 Boards of Directors were also
conducted (see Appendix B for list of interviewees). Jane Sharka, Steven Baule, and Bonita
Slovinski provided great insight into ISLMA’s growth and direction during the 1990s and 2000s.
These interviews focused on how ISLMA evolved in relation to Information Power: Building
Partnerships for Learning and Standards for the 21st-Century Learner.
The following narrative is an attempt to tell the story of the development of the Illinois
School Library Media Association in relation to the standards and guidelines of school library
media programs and specialists. It also situates the events in the large professional movement of
the twentieth century.

	  

CHAPTER 1
HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE
“The memories of our elders are our true heritage.” -- Richard Peck
The development and growth of school libraries in Illinois has been a long and arduous
process. Beginning in the early 1800s, Illinois initiated legislation providing for a tax levy to
support school libraries (Van Oord, 1968). With erratic funding, as the levy was at the discretion
of the local community, many school libraries simply provided instructional texts for the
teaching staff. It was not until a change in the national educational climate and the publication of
standards for school library programs in 1960 that the need for certified school library
professionals, the school library media specialist, would become imperative. “School librarians
are a unique breed; unlike other types of librarians, they must serve two masters” (Kramer, 1990,
p. 548). Not only are they certified classroom teachers able to meet the instructional needs of all
students, but they are librarians trained to “collect, organize, and disseminate information,
regardless of format, as well as instruct users in the how, when, and why of its use” (p. 548). The
educational aspects of the teacher librarian role – the intermediary between information and the
user – are not clearly understood by other educators (administrators and teachers) (Pond, 1998).
School library information specialists, the designation for the profession in Illinois, are faced
with a multitude of issues as a teacher and as a librarian.
In 1988, the American Association of School Librarians (AASL) and the Association for
Educational Communications and Technology (AECT) jointly defined the role of the teacher

2

librarian and recognized their importance to the mission of the school – to develop critical
thinkers and users of information (Information Power, 1988). To achieve the goals as outlined in
this historic document, ongoing professional development and support was and is needed. Thus,
the creation of national and local professional library organizations, for example the American
Library Association (1876) and Illinois Library Association (1896), focused on the needs of
librarians occurred. Both associations were “created to provide leadership for the development,
promotion, and improvement of library and information services and the profession of
librarianship in order to enhance learning and ensure access to information for all” (ALA, 2012;
ILA, 2011c). As the concept of education began to change, school libraries began to be
recognized as an important part of the education program (Van Oord, 1968). While serving the
needs of all librarians, these organizations do not provide the specialized network of support and
training required by the teacher librarian. Subsequent organizations that shared the unique
concerns of the school library information specialist, such as the American Association of School
Librarians (1914) and the Illinois School Library Media Association (1988), were developed. An
understanding of the history of this field and the development of this profession will aid the
Illinois school library professional in determining his/her purpose and place within the field of
library history. “Historical research can help establish the context in which librarians work and it
can fulfill their functions in society. Second, the details of the history of libraries are significant
in and of themselves. History offers each librarian a direct opportunity to participate in the
cooperative research effort” (Shiflett, 1984, p. 404).
The goal of historical understanding should be to “see through the eyes of the people who
were there” (Wineburg, 2001, p. 11). Although there are nearly 100,000 school libraries in the
United States, no adequate general history exists to contextualize and document their origins to

3

the larger world of elementary and secondary education (Wiegand, 2000). This dissertation lays
the groundwork for a complete history of the Illinois School Library Media Association, tracing
its origins and historical development from its birth in 1988 to its current status. This research
study will be presented as both narrative and oral history to give voice to the organization using
archival records and the recollection of individuals who were prominent in its birth and
development.
Purpose Statement
The purpose of this study is fourfold: 1) Research the state and local history of public
school libraries in Illinois. 2) Research the development of the Illinois School Library Media
Association by highlighting specific information (oral histories) that relates its history. This will
lay out a foundation of importance for the field of library and information science and
educational technology to better understand how and why the profession came to be. 3) Employ
oral history as a tool for situating the life experiences of ISLMA’s founders within its cultural
and organizational context. And 4) research and/or demonstrate the use of historical inquiry as a
research methodology and its implications for the field of educational technology.
Research has uncovered a basic historic timeline of events and people who shaped
national, state, and local school library history through the organization of ISLMA and the
impact these events and people have had on the profession. Through oral history accounts of the
formation and activities of ISLMA, this research study brings a perspective to its history that is
lacking from the historical record. Given the lack of written accounts of ISLMA’s history, an
oral history approach suggested itself as an obvious way to augment a written record lacking in
information about this important chapter in Illinois school library professional history. The

4

Executive Board of the Illinois School Library Media Association has endorsed this study (see
Appendix C). ISLMA is now over twenty-five years old and a comprehensive study of this type
is timely and valuable.
Significance of the Research Study
The historical development of school libraries and media centers is relatively short
compared with other types of libraries. School libraries emerged as a vital part of elementary and
secondary education with the appointment of the first school librarian in 1900 (Hopkins, 1998).
The history and development of school libraries in Illinois parallels the history and development
of school libraries nationwide (Thomassen, 1968, p. 853). Furthermore, the history of school
library development has been neglected by historians (Harris, 1974, p. 7). Latrobe’s anthology,
The Emerging School Library Media Center: Historical Issues and Perspectives (1998), offers
the most comprehensive history of the field, while assorted school library administration texts
(Morris, 2010; Woolls, 2008) only give a succinct overview of school library history from 1876
to the 1990s. Additionally, no definitive study or books have been published that solely outline
the colorful history of American school libraries (Vande Haar, 2005). Several dissertations and
articles have been written that recount the development of school libraries in North Carolina
(Valentine, 2010).
Library historians have recorded some of the historical aspects of the profession of
librarianship such as the American Library Association, its subsections, and a few state library
associations such as Connecticut, Iowa and Missouri (Goedeken, 2004). But how are school
librarians able to fully serve staff and students without a clear understanding of the historical
development of their profession and the evolution of its purpose? Most school library

5

professionals lack any knowledge of the lengthy history of school libraries and the school library
professionals who work there. Harris (1974, p. 1) asserts, “Library history allows librarians to
fully understand the present and to fulfill their social responsibility more effectively.” Vande
Haar (2005, p. 4) states that librarians without a “clear historical consciousness are quite certain
at times to serve their communities badly.” A historiography of school libraries may provide the
means for solving some of the basic, recurring problems that exist (Wynar, 1971). As Powell and
Connaway (2004, p. 213) state: “A knowledge and understanding of their profession’s history
can help librarians build on the past in an efficient, effective manner to avoid reinventing the
wheel and to develop new theories and systems to advance the profession.” However, no
research has been found on the roles of school library media specialists since McCracken (2001),
Shelton (2002), and Long (2007). In “School Librarians as Technology Integration Leaders:
Enablers and Barriers to Leadership Enactment,” Johnston (2012) asserts:
The highly technological environment of 21st-century schools has significantly redefined
the role of school librarians by presenting the opportunity to assume leadership through
technology integration. Despite the abundance of literature that has suggested the need
for and the importance of school librarians to be proactive leaders in technology
integration, this role is one that has been ignored in the research arena and left undefined
for school administrators, teachers, and the school librarians themselves, leading to
uncertainty concerning how school librarians enact this role in practice. (p.1)
Several authors have encouraged more historical research into library associations
(Downs, 1964; Harris, 1974; Ross, 1988; Wiegand, 2000). Limited research into the
development of the American Association of School Librarians (Gann, 2010; Pond, 1982) and its
relationships to the National Council of Accreditation for Teacher Education (NCATE), National
Education Association (NEA), and American Library Association (ALA) has taken place (Koch,
1976). Since 1974, four dissertations have been written that relate to the school library
professional association: the study of the role of professional school library associations in Iowa

6

(Buckingham, 1978), the development of the professional association of school librarians in
Missouri (Burr, 1981; Ross, 1988), and a historical analysis of the Illinois Association of School
Librarians from 1921-1972 (Cox, 1975). Recent research on this topic has been limited to
DeFrange’s (2001) examination of the rise of the Ohio Education Library Media Association.
There is a need for an accurate understanding of the history and development of the profession of
school librarianship in Illinois through the eyes and voices of its current professional association.
The Illinois School Library Media Association (ISLMA) is a professional organization
founded in 1988 to provide leadership and support for the development, promotion, and
improvement of the school library media profession and programs in Illinois (ISLMA, 2007). No
study has described how this organization began and how it evolved. The purpose of this
qualitative study was to provide a historical overview that describes the formation, composition,
and activities of ISLMA from its inception in 1988 through 2008 and AASL’s publication of
new guidelines for the profession (Standards for the 21st-Century Learner, 2007). The major
emphasis of this study was on the contributions of ISLMA to the development of school libraries
and the profession of school librarianship in Illinois.
A case study of the history and development of the Illinois School Library Media
Association provided a context to examine the individuals and events that contributed to the
growth of school librarianship as a profession and to the field of educational technology. As
Creswell (1998, p. 4) states, “Besides dialogue and understanding, a qualitative study may fill a
void in existing literature, establish a new line of thinking, or assess an issue with an
understudied group or population.”
The explosion of technology and its usage in the educational setting has radically altered
the nature of the school librarian’s role from the guardian of the print volume to that of the

7

library information technologist as a collaborative instructional design partner and teacher
(Neuman, 2003). The creation of a primary source provides a historical record of ISLMA’s
origins for study by current and future school library information specialists and instructional
technology professionals. It also provides a context to examine oral history as a research
methodology, which may prove to be helpful to the historical study of educational technology.
Oral history’s full potential has not yet been realized in librarianship, although it offers unlimited
potentialities in relation to library historiography (McCombs & Busha, 1981, p. 90). Because
ISLMA and AECT share a similar history, this study may also prove to be a rich resource for
others in the field of educational technology to explore.
Theoretical Framework
A traditional model of research begins with a theoretical framework and then applies this
model to the studied phenomenon (Larson, 2007). Examination of this research topic in relation
to the conventional research model has led to an interdisciplinary theoretical approach: social
cognition, organizational culture theory, organizational leadership theory (transformative and
transactional leadership), and social constructivism. The theoretical framework for this research
has been developed on all of these theories as well as Burns’s (1978, 2003) and Bass’s (1985)
transformational leadership theory, and all serve as the foundation for this study.
Recent research in social cognition about the nature of culture has direct implications for
collective memory supporting the idea that “our heads are full of images, opinions, and
information, untagged as to truth value, to which we are inclined to attribute accuracy and
plausibility” (DiMaggio, 1997, p. 267). Culture is stored in memory as an indiscriminately
assembled and relatively unorganized collection of odds and ends. Collective memory is defined

8

as “the outcome of processes affecting the information to which individuals have access, the
schemata by which people understand the past, and the external symbols or messages that prime
these schemata” (p. 275). When several participants are included in a study of a particular event
or organization, it becomes a collection of perspectives or collective memory (Conley & Hall,
1999; DiMaggio, 1997; Hoffman & Hoffman, 1984).
Organizations, like families, have historical and/or collective memory that is part of an
organization’s culture. This culture is solidified through story as each member tells new
members about life within the organization. Schein (2004, p. 17) defines organizational culture
as “a pattern of shared basic assumptions that was learned by the group as it solved its problems
of external adaptation and internal integration, that has worked well enough to be considered
valid and therefore, to be taught to new members as the correct way to perceive, think and feel in
relation to those problems.” He claims that there are three levels of organizational culture:
artifacts, espoused values, and assumptions. Within the school library association environment,
artifacts provide evidence of a culture, for example, archival records such as official minutes, bylaws, newsletters, public documents, personal and professional correspondence, and conference
proceedings. Espoused values are the things that individuals claim guide their actions and are
somewhat difficult to identify, such as published mission and vision statements, standards, and
guidelines. Assumptions are derived from values (Painter, 2002). Schein’s theory of
organizational culture and leadership focuses on basic assumptions about culture that can help
define an organization (in this case a professional library association). Because culture can
impact an organization’s effectiveness, it is imperative that its leaders understand the culture and
how it works. Furthermore, leadership takes a key role in forming and changing an
organization’s culture.

9

An organization’s culture can be observed through its members’ social interactions, their
stated values, its rules, and the emotional climate. However, Schein (2004) believes that culture
is embedded deep within the culture’s basic and shared assumptions. These assumptions have
formed as a sort of survival mechanism to the culture’s external environment. Schein outlines
four phases of how to analyze an organization’s culture through systematic observation and
experiences. This entails an interview method and the assistance of motivated insiders and
interested outsiders that ensure the interviews are unbiased and provide an explanation of the
interviewer’s experiences. By providing the tools to explore the dynamics of a professional
library association’s culture, Schein’s theory has allowed this researcher to examine the ways in
which the leaders can create, manage, or destroy its culture.
Organizational culture theorists (Jepperson, 1991; Schein, 1988, 2004; Schultz, 1967)
recognize similar processes present in the development of shared meanings, belief systems, and
rules that inform and constrain organizational behavior. This recognition includes the effects of
the organizational founders and/or early leaders of ISLMA as important creators and carriers of
these shared meanings and rule systems and their influence on the historical evolution of their
organization through the embedding of cultural elements. Schein provides the most serious
treatment of early leader effects on organizations in the organization culture literature. He
advances a model of cultural embedding that postulates how founders create organizational
culture by fixing their major assumptions and predispositions into their organizations (Painter,
2002, p. 37). Schein states that organizations do not form accidentally but are usually created by
individuals who recognize that the cooperative efforts of a group will achieve greater results than
will an individual. Culture formation within these organizations begins with its birth. While each
organization’s history is unique, Schein identifies four essential steps in the formation of

10

organizations: first, an individual has an idea; second, a founding group forms on the basis of
mutual interest in the idea; third, the founding group works cooperatively to create the
organization; and fourth, others are invited to join the group, which begins to function as an
organization and to develop its own history. Usually, these founders are strong-willed individuals
with an understanding of the role their organization will play in their professional community.
The task has been to identify not only the early founders of ISLMA, the organization that
provides leadership for Illinois school library specialists, but their effect and external influences
on its creation and development. A question to posit here is: Does an organization’s past
leadership shape its present and future?
Espousing a general theory of leadership based on the themes of power, purpose,
interpersonal relationships, motives, and values, James MacGregor Burns (1978, 2003) described
and identified two types of leadership: transactional and transformational. Using Maslow’s
hierarchy of needs theory and Kohlberg’s theory of moral stages of development, Burns
attempted to differentiate leaders from managers and leaders from power holders. He explains :
I will deal with leadership as distinct from mere power-holding and as the opposite of
brute power. I will identify two basic types of leadership: the transactional and
transforming. The relations of most leaders and followers are transactional – leaders
approach followers with an eye to exchanging one thing for another: job for votes, or
subsidies for campaign contributions. Such transactions comprise the bulk of the
relationships among leaders and followers, especially in groups, legislatures, and parties.
Transforming leadership, while more complex, is more potent. The transforming leader
recognizes and exploits an existing need or demand of a potential follower. But, beyond
that, the transforming leader looks for potential motives in followers, seeks to satisfy
higher needs, and engages the full person of the follower. The result of transforming
leadership is a relationship of mutual stimulation and elevation that converts followers
into leaders and may convert leaders into moral agents.” (Burns, 1978, p. 4).
Burns’s leadership theory applies to the political, corporate, or social world involving a
relationship between the leader and follower based on common purpose and collective needs.
However, it also provides a theoretical framework for leaders in educational organizations such

11

as the Illinois School Library Media Association. The key to leadership is the discerning of key
values and motives of both the leader and follower and, in accordance to them, elevating others
to a higher sense of performance, fulfillment, autonomy, and purpose (Fairholm, 2001. p. 4).
Burns (1978) has added a dimension to leadership study, a sense of moral leadership that has
moved leadership discussion away from a focus on traits, behaviors, roles, or situations to one of
defining what it is that makes a leader different from great managers and why leadership is a
significant force in our society. Burns proposes that transformational leadership includes two
essential elements: 1) it is relational and 2) it deals with producing real change:
“Transformational leadership occurs when one or more persons engage with others in such a way
that leaders and followers raise one another to higher levels of motivation and morality” (p. 20).
Leadership for Burns was an engagement that transformed the lives, attitudes, behaviors, and
institutions to higher moral and ethical dimensions.
Based on Burns’s theory of transactional and transformational political leaders, Bass
(1985) developed and presented a formal theory of transformational leadership, including models
and measurements of the factors of leadership behavior (Bass & Avolio, 1994). This theory has
been studied and interpreted by other researchers (Bass, 1990; Bass & Avolio, 1990; Dubinsky,
Yammarino, & Jolson, 1995; House & Howell, 1992; Kuhnert & Lewis, 1987; Tichy &
Devanna, 1986; Wofford & Goodwin, 1994; Yammarino & Dubinsky, 1994; Yammarino,
Spangler, & Bass, 1993). In Leadership and Performance Beyond Expectations, Bass (1985, p.
27) states that transactional leaders “consider mostly how to marginally improve and maintain
the quantity and quality of performance, how to substitute one goal for another, how to reduce
resistance to particular actions, and how to implement decisions.” He also argues that
transformational leaders

12

attempt and succeed in raising colleagues, subordinates, followers, clients, or
constituencies to a greater awareness about the issues of consequence. This heightening
awareness requires a leader with vision, self-confidence, and inner strength to argue
successfully for what he sees is right or good, not for what is popular or is acceptable
according to the established wisdom of the time. (p.17)
Bass and Avolio (1994) further developed and tested the characteristics of
transformational leaders. Their study of 400 business, education, health care, arts, industry, and
government leaders pointed out that transformational leadership is seen when leaders
stimulate interest among colleagues and followers to view their work from new
perspectives, generate awareness of the mission or vision of the team and organization,
develop colleagues and followers to higher levels of ability and potential, and motivate
colleagues and followers to look beyond their own interests toward those that will benefit
the group. (p. 2)
Additionally, Avolio, Waldman, and Yammarino (1991) identified four behaviors of
transformational leaders: idealized influence, inspirational motivation, intellectual stimulation,
and individualized consideration. Furthermore, Bass (1990) outlines why organizations need
transformational leaders. He relates:
Problems, rapid changes, and uncertainties call for a flexible organization with a
determined leader who can inspire employees to participate enthusiastically in team
efforts and share in organizational goals. In short, charisma, attention to individualized
development, and the ability and willingness to provide intellectual stimulation are
critical to leaders whose firms are faced with demands for renewal and change. At these
organizations, fostering transformational leadership through policies of recruitment,
selection, promotion, training, and development is likely to pay off in the health, wellbeing, and effective performance of the organization. (p. 31)
In Transformational Leadership, Bass and Riggio (2006, p. 6) contend that
“transformational leaders behave in ways that allow them to serve as role models for their
followers. The leaders are admired, respected, and trusted. Followers identify with the leaders
and want to emulate them; leaders are endowed by their followers as having extraordinary
capabilities, persistence, and determination.” Foster (1989) espoused the idea of critical
transformative leadership as a way of further advancing the conventional view of transformative

13

leadership. He asserts that critical transformational leadership is not “a special or unique
occurrence, one that is found only in certain grand moments of human history. Rather, it happens
in everyday events, when commonplace leaders exert some effect on their situations” (p. 52).
Therefore, commonplace leaders must be those followers who are empowered through the
transformative process to become leaders (Foster, 1989).
Socio-cultural constructivism emphasizes how meanings and understandings grow out of
social interactions. Social dialogue is an important component of learning, and cultural tools
(beliefs, artifacts, systems) are accessed and acquire meaning in social contexts. Thus all
knowledge is constructed in social contexts. The recognition that both writers (the ISLMA
Board) and readers (the ISLMA membership) control the text and their interpretation requires
consideration of the social and cultural context in which ISLMA’s primary sources were created.
Four approaches can describe social construction: 1) the author is informed by his/her history,
background knowledge, discourse community, and current social context, and these factors
influence the resulting text; 2) the reader is informed by his/her own history, background
knowledge, and current social context as well as by his/her discourse community, which affects
the way he/she reads and interprets a written work; 3) the author shapes his/her writing for
his/her reading audience based on what he/she knows about the potential readers; and 4) the
reader’s notion of the author and his/her intentions shapes how the reader interprets the writing
(Robinson, 2001).
Lengthy reflection of the various theories (organizational culture and leadership, social
cognition, social constructivism) has led to a realization that no theory perfectly encapsulates the
framework needed for a historiography of the Illinois School Library Media Association’s
formation and development. It is obvious that an understanding of the association’s purpose, its

14

culture as espoused through written and oral sources, the reliability of its collective memory,
how its interpretive community viewed its artifacts in relation to the time period in which they
were created, and the type of formative organizational leadership is needed. This theoretical
framework will be a mélange – a true interdisciplinary approach.
Research Questions
To answer the research question, it was necessary to document the leadership
(organizational) and political (legislative) histories of ISLMA, which served as a guide for the
researcher in collecting and examining documents, records, and artifacts of the association. This
provided a framework in organizing, structuring, and crafting the narrative.
What is the history of the development of the Illinois School Library Media Association?
This central research question was expanded by two sets of sub-questions. Dynamic themes were
drawn from personal interviews with current and former ISLMA board members. These
interviews served to fill in the gaps of ISLMA’s archival records, such as official minutes, public
documents, letters, newspapers, conference proceedings, newsletters, etc. The sets of subquestions related to the oral narratives of the ISLMA leadership and served as a guide for the
researcher to use with current and former ISLMA board members in the discovery and telling of
what happened from their perspectives.
What does the leadership of ISLMA relate as important to the history of the organization?
•

What are the key events and transformative periods in the history of the association as
seen by the participants?

What were the effects and external influences of ISLMA’s leadership on its creation
and development, particularly as a change agent?

•

What elements were perceived as crucial for the association’s development?

What are some of the interpretations of past and current events from the perspectives of
ISLMA leadership?
•

How did we get to where we are today, that is, the evolution of the role of the
school librarian from print/audiovisual librarian to library media specialist to
library information specialist to instructional technology specialist?

What lessons or suggestions can be gained from their experiences?
Definitions

To assist in the exploration of this case study, the following terms were defined to clarify
their meaning within the bounds of this study.
Documents: “are prepared for personal rather than official reasons and include diaries, memos,
letters, field notes, and so on” (Hodder, 1994, p. 393).
Narrative: “connects events, actions, and experiences and moves them through time” (Kramp,
2004, p. 110).

16

Narrative inquiry: “is a way of understanding experience. It is a collaboration between researcher
and participants, over time, in a place or series of places, and in social interactions with milieu….
narrative inquiry is stories lived and told” (Clandinin & Connelly, 2000, p. 20).
Records: “prepared to attest to some formal transaction…include marriage certificates, driving
licenses, building contracts, and banking statements” (Hodder, 1994, p. 393).
School librarian: “a certified library professional, a leader, instructional partner, information
specialist, teacher, and program administrator… An information professional who plays a critical
role, teaching students how to select, use and understand information in all formats” (AASL
Toolkit, 2015).
School library information specialist: a certified professional to design, manage and provide
library and information services in school library settings.
School library media specialist: “an information specialist, a teacher, and an instructional
consultant” (AASL & AECT, Information Power, 1988).
To assist in an understanding of abbreviations mentioned throughout this study, a list of
acronyms for education and library organizations has been included in Appendix D.
Delimitations and Limitations of the Study
Merriam (1998, p. 27) “concluded that the single most defining characteristic of case
study research lies in delimiting the object of the study.” The scope of this case study was limited
by time and access and is specific to one organization. Its focus is on the development of the
Illinois School Library Media Association (ISLMA) and is guided by a timeline of significant
historical events beginning in 1988 with the founding of ISLMA and ending in 2008 with the
creation of new guidelines for the profession, Standards for the 21st-Century Learner, (AASL,

17

2007). Since this research was based on archived materials and oral histories, the researcher was
limited by what was deemed important enough by past boards and their archivists to be archived
and remembered.
A full study of archival records revealed individuals whose leadership of ISLMA is
contemporaneous to the scope of this research, which encompasses over twenty-five years of
school library history. The selected interviewees have served the Illinois School Library Media
Association at different times under different historical, social and political influences. My
intended focus was on selected ISLMA board members from each decade, that is, the founding
Board of 1988, the Board of 1998, and the Board of 2008.
The interviews provided indirect information filtered through the interviewees’ views.
There is some question as to the validity and reliability of interviewees’ memory of events,
people, and places. People are not equally articulate and perceptive (Creswell, 2002, p. 185),
which may have impacted the quality of the interview. Moss (1974, p. 38) states, “Other factors
that could affect the reliability of the interview include the possible reluctance of narrators to
discuss controversial topics for fear of misinterpretations, the narrator’s fear that divulged
information may be used inappropriately or distorted, and/or narrators’ needs to vindicate
themselves while distorting the roles of other persons.” The researcher’s presence may also have
biased the interview.
Advantages of the Study
“Historical research can contribute to the body of knowledge about librarianship; it can
increase our understanding of how, when, and why past events occurred; and it can expand our
appreciation of the significance of these events” (Busha & Harter, 1980, p. 92). Participants can

18

provide historical information unavailable to the researcher. Oral history also allows the
researcher control over the line of questioning which limits the narrator to a particular topic.
Summary
Chapter 1 introduced the study of the Illinois School Library Media Association. A
review of library and historical studies revealed that no comprehensive history exists of the
Illinois School Library Media Association. None of the stories of the original founding members
of this organization have been recorded for future scholarship. The study will contribute to
library and educational research through the presentation of an oral history of a professional
library association. Using a case study design, the research will apply qualitative methods,
including historical research of archival records, document analysis, and narrative inquiry to
develop a chronology and oral history of the Illinois School Library Media Association from
1988 to 2008.
Chapter 2 situates the study within library and educational scholarship. It also presents
methodological guidelines for creating this history record.

	  

CHAPTER 2
LITERATURE REVIEW
Historical Research: Oral History
Oral history has been defined as the systematic gathering of historically significant
personal memories, recorded mechanically, for archival preservation and use. It can reveal
perspectives that are not found in written documents (Thompson, 2000). These perspectives may
provide a greater understanding of the transformative role of school librarianship and its
historical development from those who were the founders of an organizational structure for
library and information science and educational technology.
Many historians chart the formal beginnings of oral history as a modern technique for
historical documentation to 1948. This is when Columbia University historian Allan Nevins
began recording the memoirs of persons significant in American life, the elite, such as General
George Marshall and President Harry Truman (Shopes, 2002). But what is oral history? Is it
storytelling? Is it conversation? Charles Morrissey defines it as “a recorded dialogue in which a
historically knowledgeable informant expresses historically significant memories in response to
an interviewer-historian who retains archivally for future use the recollections thus retrieved” (as
cited in K’Meyer & Morrissey, 1999, p. 102).
Multiple disciplines have employed interviewing as an acceptable qualitative research
method. Interviewing is integral to many forms of qualitative educational research; we interview
individuals for oral histories, life histories, ethnographies, and case studies. The techniques of

20

oral history are also the techniques of the qualitative researcher (Janesick, 2007). Both use
interviews, observations, and documents as evidence. Both may be used to tell an individual’s
story through remembering key events and personal experience. Both capture the individual’s
voice and ordinary language through digital voice or video recordings and print transcription.
Both use the data to explain and interpret someone’s memories of events and activities. How
they differ depends on the study’s purpose, its theoretical framework, and the researcher’s role. It
is important that researchers understand the nature of why we interview as well as the mechanics
of how to interview (methods of data collection and analysis).
Janesick (2007) explores the evolution of oral history from a traditionalist approach to a
reconceptualist approach to today’s postmodernist researcher. The traditionalist era of oral
history included the basic forms of interviewing and usually documented the remembered history
of an elite person such as a general, a famous artist or scientist, a national leader, or a noted
community figure with no interpretation of the individual’s story. A reconceptualist-era
researcher employed photography as well as audio and video tape, developed written guidelines
for participants who came from all walks of life (great or small), conducted multiple interviews
of participants, and included a theoretical frame for data analysis placing the story in its cultural
and social context, such as Holocaust survivor accounts. Today the postmodernist researcher
uses all tools available to conduct multiple interviews with the participants (audiotaping, video
filming, digital tape recording, still photography, and various documents related to the project)
and outlines his/her perspective prior to analyzing and interpreting the data. It is an interpretive
approach that includes both the interviewer and interviewee taking active roles as co-researchers
and may be centered in a political context as well as a racial, class, and gender context (Janesick,
2007). Oral history is viewed as a means to correct the historical record by including the voices

21

of previously excluded individuals or groups. Interview questions are framed by themes of
abuse, power, culture, etc. Janesick argues that a postmodernist approach offers the opportunity
to widen the repertoire of techniques, interview questions, and competing points of interpretation
and data analysis and can be extended to be understood as a postmodern social justice project.
Technology is used to enrich a story and should be used to understand as well as interpret. For
example, Steven Spielberg’s Holocaust project documents many individual survivors’
experiences, but it also provides the viewer a context for placing the violence of that time into
our present day and making more sense of our current wars. Thus, testimony is used to document
the stories of victims and their abusers (the South African system of apartheid and the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission, the Nuremburg war crimes tribunal). Testimony allows everyone to
more fully understand the political, cultural, emotional, and psychological aspects of events.
In social research, oral and written narratives can be used as data and analyzed using
content analysis or grounded theory (Langer et al., 2007). Narratives may also be analyzed
through narrative analysis, a postmodern research method using narrative as both data and a
means of data analysis. Based on the work of Padgett (1998), Langer, Lietz, and Furman (2007)
use this pedagogical model in combination with thematic analysis, allowing social work students
to learn strategies of traditional qualitative thematic coding. The analysis methods include
triangulation, peer debriefing, member check, and audit trail (a record of steps taken in the
analysis process and researcher reactions).
Heppner, Wright, and Berry (1990) relate that multiple factors have affected counseling
and development as a profession. To move beyond its documented history, the authors looked to
the oral history method as a means to understand the lives of those individuals who shaped the
field, added color to historical events, and offered a broader perspective by providing diverse

22

viewpoints concerning the field’s history. Recognizing that the pioneers were a complex and
diverse group of people with various roles within the profession (researchers, theorists,
practitioners, educators, administrators), interviews were organized into two focal types:
significant events that influenced their personal and professional development, such as early
family background, social support, mentors, motivation, the role of chance, and personal costs,
and observations and reflections about a critical professional issue like training goals and
mentoring. Themes emerged from the interviews that, when taken collectively, provided clues
about the meaning attached to working in the counseling profession, a multitude of factors
associated with career development within the profession, and the evolving nature of the
profession (Heppner et al., 1990).
Oral history and qualitative research provide a basis for a social history of education
(Altenbaugh, 1997). Not only are educational historians using diaries, letters, and written
documents, but oral histories, memos, reports of schools and school practices as well.
Altenbaugh reviews multiple studies employing oral history to document teachers’ perspectives
on the evolution of school policies, pedagogical theories and practices, student attitudes and
culture and family roles, and values and structure as well as how gender, ethnicity, class, and
race played key roles in teachers’ lives. While oral history has captured t7e emotional side of
being a teacher and school culture, educational historians must provide a conceptual framework
for this history.
Gardner (2003) and Cunningham (2006) have been documenting the professional
memories of classroom teachers spanning the last four decades (Archive of Teacher Memory,
University of Cambridge, England). Conducting more than 300 oral history interviews with
former teachers, Gardner examines a methodical issue for educational historians: the challenge

23

presented by the exercise of memory as a historical method (Gardner, 2003). Memory allows an
individual to construct and maintain his identity, but it also serves as a witness to history. One’s
personal identity, narrative, can only be experienced by that person and is dependent on the
construction of established pathways through his memory that need to be maintained by regular
retelling or repetition (Gardner, 2003). Thus interviews must constantly be directed from
narrative identity to history, from repetition (maintenance of identity through time) to
recollection (bearing witness to a specific moment in time), and from event to occurrence. This
narrative disruption places the primary responsibility for interpretation of this story on the
shoulders of the interviewer and his skill.
Many fields such as social science and education have used oral history projects to
document the origins and development of their profession. The Medical Library Association
(MLA) has established an Oral History Project to interview significant members of the
profession whose work has impacted the profession of medical librarianship. As part of this
project, Figa (1999) interviewed Jean Antes, one of the first circuit rider medical librarians to
provide library services to underserved medical practitioners in rural areas. Comparing herself to
an archaeologist, Figa used audiotapes of Antes’s oral history and artifacts of her work (road
maps of routes, notebooks, and statistical reports), transcripts, field notes, and her personal
memories to interpret the oral history process. What emerged was an interpretive study of culture
using mapping techniques to support library activities in the field during the time before
electronic information services were readily available.
For decades archivists have debated the role of oral history in archives and libraries.
Archivists cite its subjective nature, the unreliability of memory, interviewer and interviewee
biases, expense, time shortages, and requirement of training and research preparation. Swain

24

(2002) and Christian (2002) relate how with careful planning and research, oral history can fill
gaps, adding depth and dimension to existing archival collections, and have a positive impact on
academic archives. The Student Life and Culture (SLC) Archival Program at the University of
Illinois Archives developed and implemented an alumni oral history project to document all
aspects of student life – academic, social and cultural, religious, political, professional, military,
and athletic – that contributed to the total student experience at that institution during the late
1920s and 1930s. This time period was selected for its historical significance nationally and at
the University of Illinois (U of I), the lack of archival holdings concerning students in the 1930s,
and the advanced age of the participants. While this project required a time commitment and
financial support, it highlighted how oral histories provide a unique perspective.
Qualitative researchers have demonstrated a growing interest in the personal narrative as
a valid method and source of documentation. Like all research, a high degree of ethics is required
in qualitative research practice. The archiving of oral history transcripts and/or projects is an
important part of the oral history process. The archiving of oral history materials, as mentioned
previously, makes them available for future usage. This raises a question as to the influence of
archiving on participants’ willingness to be forthright in their narratives. It also raises challenges
for the researcher in preparing interviews for archival deposit and calls for greater examination
of the social and collaborative role in oral history between interviewer and interviewee.
Oral history is an excellent tool for situating life experience within a cultural context,
showing the interplay between the individual and the society in which he/she lives. The
relationship between the interviewer and interviewee must be carefully developed and clear
guidelines must be constantly used throughout the process. The researcher must consider the oral
history matrix: interplay between the method or tool, ethical considerations, and politics.

25

Shared History: School Libraries and Educational Technology
School libraries are essentially an invention of the twentieth century and are considered
young in comparison to other educational institutions. The first half of the 20th century saw the
slow but steady development of school libraries, while the latter half witnessed the creation and
formation of school library media centers as educational programs. The fields of school
librarianship and educational technology have alternately merged and separated throughout the
20th century (Ely, 1982). Few research studies have examined the similarities and overlap
between the fields of educational technology and school librarianship and their common shared
history.
Focusing on the history of each field from its earliest records until 1980, Alsworth (1980)
traced the development and changing relationship between educational technology and school
librarianship. Citing the nonexistence of any comparative history of both fields, Alsworth felt
that a study that “includes in its scope the history of the two fields and their parallel concerns
will perhaps reveal hitherto unnoticed information” (p. 4). The study’s purpose was to identify
the “events and circumstances in both fields that have contributed to the relationship between the
two fields” (p. 5). It also was undertaken to assist in “clarifying the roles of the two fields and
also point the way to more effective cooperation between the two” (p. 5). Research questions
focused on each field’s objectives, their clientele, educational requirements and/or programs for
professional certification, common elements or concerns, and differences in philosophy and best
practice. Alsworth’s examination of the theoretical and historical foundations of each field, citing
such definitive works as Saettler’s A History of Instructional Technology (1968) and Cecil and
Heap’s School Library Service in the United States: An Interpretive Survey (1940), clearly
defined how these fields are intertwined.

26

Using primary sources such as journal articles, monographs, government reports,
standards independently and jointly authored by both fields, and secondary sources, Alsworth
(1980) created a historiography, a narrative historical record based on critical analysis and
evaluation. This research method requires gathering, organizing, and verifying facts along with
assessing past events and circumstances relevant to the topic. Alsworth’s study served as an
introduction to a library historiography and clearly demonstrated how to structure and frame this
type of descriptive research. It also confirmed that this study is firmly rooted in both fields.
After studying the historical development of both fields and comparing their similarities
and differences, Alsworth (1980) concluded that misconceptions exist between both fields in
regard to their defined role, purpose, and services provided within education – in particular the
school library and/or instructional materials center. Recommendations included the continued
maintenance of two separate and distinct fields, increased publicity by both fields emphasizing
the kinds of services offered, the need for heightened awareness of each field’s unique role in
“efficient utilization of educational media in effective education” (p. 106), and an emphasis on
more effective collaboration. These findings foreshadowed and were later reflected in
Information Power: Guidelines for School Library Media Programs, a joint publication of
AASL and AECT (1988), and Information Power: Building Partnerships for Learning (AASL &
AECT, 1998).
Education in the United States has always gone through transformative periods, and
educators reassess their role in relation to current pedagogy and practices. The role of the K-12
public school library media specialist has emerged as a pivotal one in the success of the
educational process. Research indicates that, despite the positive impact of the library media
specialist, many education professionals (principals, teachers) and library media specialists

27

themselves do not have a clear understanding of the role and how it is evolving. Alsworth (1980)
confirms not only the misconceptions regarding role between the fields of educational
technology and school librarianship but the confusion that exists within each field. This
dissertation study is predicated on the researcher’s background in school librarianship and
interest in the origins and development of school libraries and the evolving role of the
library/technology specialist. Featured later in this review of literature are multiple studies
(Cleaver and Taylor, 1989; Craver, 1986; Johnson, 1993; McCracken 2001; McIntosh, 1994;
Neuman, 2004; Person, 1993; Shelton, 2002) that outlined this evolution and chronicled the
disparity between theory and practice.
National Standards and School Librarianship
The history of the national standards and guidelines for school libraries clearly details the
changing roles and responsibilities of the school library professional. To establish best practices
for school library programs, beginning early in the 20th century a series of quantitative and
qualitative standards were adopted by educational and library associations to provide the vision
and roadmap for integrating new technologies alongside traditional methodologies. These
standards provided guidelines for all aspects of library management and librarianship and are an
indication of both the technology and educational philosophy of their time. While the first three
sets of school library standards were published in 1920, 1925, and 1945 under the auspices of the
National Education Association (NEA), the American Library Association (ALA), and its subcommittee, the American Association of School Libraries (AASL), the focus of this study’s
review is the modern period (1960-1998), when the field began to emphasize an instructional
design and technology focus (Neuman, 2004). Educational philosophy and practices are noted to

28

demonstrate their influence on the growth and development of the school librarian’s role.
Educational technology is surveyed comprehensively by Saettler (2004) in The Evolution of
American Educational Technology, which traces the theoretical and methodological foundations
of the field.

The events of the 1950s, particularly the launching of Sputnik in 1957, created a broadbased interest in the need for educational reforms and a shift in focus on learning rather than
teaching (Saettler, 2004). Craver (1986, p. 4) relates that “in school library development and
education in general, the 1960s can be described as a decade of ferment,” and the curriculum
became subject to a “broad interpretation as students evidenced a growing need for all kinds of
education and aspired to greater educational achievement.” Learning was considered a continual
lifelong process. Curriculum design and implementation were to become a focal area of interest
of the school librarian. The 1960 publication of a joint revision of the 1945 standards, Standards
for School Library Programs, is significant as it recognized audiovisual materials and a variety
of teaching materials as necessary to the school library collection (identified as instructional
materials center) while emphasizing the school library program and the librarian’s instructional
responsibilities (described as materials’ specialist) (ALA, 1960). In his/her new role, the
specialist was expected to collaborate with teachers to integrate library and technological
resources with school curriculum and to incorporate educational television and documentary
films. Quantitative recommendations were developed, but the document focused on “principles
and policies that represent the qualitative standards for school library progress” as defined by
NEA’s Department of Audiovisual Instruction (DAVI) and AASL (Gann, 1998, p. 171).

29

1969 Standards
Gann (1998, p. 179) states that the fifth set of school library standards endorsed “the
unification of school library and audiovisual programs” and “signaled an important confluence of
the two major foci of the field, librarianship and educational technology” (Neuman, 2004, p.
500). In the resultant nine years since the publication of the 1960 standards, a growing conflict
had developed between book advocates and audiovisual supporters. Both fields were unified and
indelibly linked with the joint publication of Standards for School Media Programs by AASL
and DAVI (1969), which “ushered in the widespread use of the terms media and media specialist
and gave increasing emphasis to the library media specialist’s instructional role” (p. 500). This
groundbreaking document lists audiovisual materials by type and provides specific quantitative
recommendations. Promoting the library media program as “the center of instructional design
and technology activity within the school” (p. 500), the 1969 Standards advocated that every
media specialist actively participate in shaping the learning environment and design of
instruction.
1975 Standards
Craver (1986, p. 188) notes that “if the sixties were described as a time of ferment in
education, then the seventies were termed a time of action.” The transition from passive to active
learning and the development of alternative learning programs produced an environment in
which the school became increasingly regarded as “an agent of change” (p. 8). This became
evident when in 1971 two committees (the AASL and DAVI) were formed to revise the national
school library standards due to rapid changes occurring in the fields of education and technology.

30

The 1975 result was Media Programs: District and School, a joint publication of AASL and the
Association for Educational Communications and Technology (AECT), formerly known as
DAVI. This sixth set of national standards expanded the role of the school media program,
particularly at the district level, and defined its purpose as providing services to the user. The
standards identified “the media staff as critical to all media programs,” provided specific library
media personnel competencies, and defined the four roles of the media professional: curriculum
and instructional designer, instructional consultant, information specialist, and program
administrator (Gann, 1998, p. 193). The instructional design and consultant aspects changed the
media program from a supportive role to an integral part of the school educational program. The
professional literature, such as Instructional Design and the Library Media Specialist (Chisholm,
Ely & Bender, 1979) and The Teaching Role of the School Media Specialist (Vandergrift, 1979),
provided a context for the media specialist’s role in instructional design and “differentiated
between the terms teaching and instruction” (Craver, 1986, p. 9). The 1975 standards gave
responsibility to the media specialist to actively participate in the educational process by
selecting and making available the information resources best suited for teacher and student
learning needs.
1988 Guidelines
The mid-eighties found the field of education attempting to respond to major
socioeconomic changes and the impact of computer technology (Craver, 1986). As media
specialists were adjusting to their role in instructional design, the introduction of computers
forced a re-evaluation of their instructional role in relation to this new technology. Professional
literature urged the media specialist to move toward an active instructional design role that

31

integrated computers into the curriculum (Craver, 1986). The increase in digitized information
now shifted the media specialist’s objectives from teaching students how to find information to
teaching students how to use and communicate information effectively. This was reflected in
Information Power: Guidelines for School Library Media Programs, a joint publication of
AASL and AECT in 1988 that “articulated three roles for the school library media specialist:
information specialist, teacher, and instructional consultant” (Gann, 1998, p. 193) and stressed
qualitative guidelines rather than quantitative measures (standards). Also, noteworthy was
another revision in terminology in which the word “library” became part of the professional
vocabulary once again. The mission of the school library media program was “to ensure that
students and staff are effective users of ideas and information” (AASL & AECT, 1988, p. 1) by
providing appropriate resources and information access. The library media specialist was to
assume active leadership in the areas of teaching and learning, particularly “in the use of
instructional and information technology and instructional design principles” (AASL & AECT,
1988, p. 10), with a focus on critical thinking and information skills. Pickard (1993, p. 115)
defined the new role as “an instructional consultant who must have the knowledge, expertise, and
experience of a teacher combined with knowledge of the total library media collection and other
resources outside the center that relate to and enhance the curriculum.” Craver (1986, Conclusion
section, para. 1) notes that “there is a possible time lag between the practiced instructional role of
library media specialist and the one espoused in the literature.”
The 1988 guidelines were comprehensive and refocused the school library media
program to greater integration with the entire educational setting; the library media specialist
connected students, teachers, administrators, and parents with the information each of these

32

groups needed. The adoption of these guidelines was slow, and further adaptation was necessary
as school libraries leapt into the 21st century with the rapid growth of the Internet.
1998 Guidelines and Standards
Interaction and cooperation between the two fields continued into the nineties. In 1998, the
AASL and AECT jointly developed and published Information Power: Building Partnerships for
Learning, which defined the library media specialists’ role as teachers of literacy, instructional
partners, information specialists, and program administrators. It formalized the media specialists’
role as instructional consultants who collaborate with teachers to design instruction that
integrates information skills and technologies into the learner-centered curriculum. Information
Power (1998) also identified the impact of technology on the school library and its effect on the
library media specialist who “both masters sophisticated electronic resources and maintains a
constant focus on the nature, quality, and ethical use of information available in these and in
more traditional tools” (p. 11). Information Power was written to provide a roadmap for
librarians and educators to the initiation of programs that prepare students with the skills to
personally update and develop the knowledge needed in an emerging world that will require a
whole new set of living and working skills.
Standards for the 21st-Century Learner
To recognize the changing role of school library media programs now and in the future,
AASL (2007) developed new learning standards for school library media programs. Published in
fall 2007 with input from library media professionals, Standards for the 21st-Century Learner
offers a “vision for teaching and learning to both guide and beckon our profession as education

33

leaders” (AASL, 2007, p. 1) and replaces the AASL information literacy standards for students.
Focusing more on the effect of the library media specialist’s role than on its historic
collaborative nature, the new learning standards are to shape library programs and serve as a tool
for library media specialists to shape the learning of students in the school.
“These standards outline the skills students must have, ongoing beliefs and attitudes
needed for those skills to be practiced, the responsibilities or common behaviors of
students as they learn, and strategies for personal assessment of their learning. These are
not meant to be a narrowly focused curriculum guide or a list of skills ready to plug into
content curricula. Instead they are a broad set of standards for the skills that students
should have, the ethical and legal responsibilities that go with those skills, the motivation
that students have to apply those skills in the context of those responsibilities, and the
strategies for assessing their personal information use.” (Johns, 2008, p. 8)
Standards for Initial Preparation of School Librarians
The ALA/AASL Standards for Initial Preparation of School Librarians were approved by
the Specialty Areas Studies Board (SASB) of the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher
Education (NCATE) in 2010 (ALA/AASL, 2010). These standards reflect the concepts found in
AASL’s Empowering Learners: Guidelines for School Library Programs (2009) and Standards
for the 21st-Century Learner (2007). They contain five standards, each with four elements. The
five standards are Teaching for Learning, Literacy and Reading, Information and Knowledge,
Advocacy and Leadership, and Program Management and Administration. Like the Standards
for the 21st-Century Learner, the new standards were developed in isolation without the input of
other educational technology organizations such as the International Society for Technology in
Education (ISTE) and AECT. Failure to work with other professional organizations who share a
common history, an understanding of school library evolution, and the impact of change leaves
school librarians confused about their place in education, in particular the integration of digital
technology. One trend remains clear: The library media center will continue to evolve as

34

innovative technologies are made available. The new standards must enable school librarians to
maintain and enhance their position of information leadership within the school. This adjustment,
however, requires school librarians to broaden their skill sets to integrate the use of technology
as the means for effective and creative learning.
National guidelines and standards for the library media specialist (AASL & AECT, 1988,
1998) describe the exemplary roles of model school librarians. This information is considered a
description of model or best practice and is often referred to as theory (Shannon, 2002). As
previously mentioned, role conflict occurs when this ideal role is not consistent with real-world
situations (Craver, 1986, 1994; McIntosh, 1994; Neuman, 2004; Pickard, 1993). Shannon (2002)
reviews the factors that enable library media specialists to become more fully involved in the
school instructional program: time for cooperative planning between teachers and specialists,
flexible scheduling, adequate school library staffing, personal characteristics of effective/expert
instructional staff, and school culture or organizational climate characteristics of effective
schools. This review indicates that further research is needed to examine the historical evolution
of the role of the K-12 public school library media specialist in relation to information and
instructional technologies.
Role of School Librarians
The origins and development of school libraries and the evolving role of the
library/technology specialist have grown in tandem with the field of educational technology. The
history of school libraries is relatively short compared with other types of libraries. School
libraries emerged as a vital part of elementary and secondary education with the appointment of
the first school librarian in 1900 (Hopkins, 1998). Today, professional school library literature

35

emphasizes the role of the library information specialist as an integral component of curriculum
and instructional design. With an overall understanding of the core curriculum and instructional
theory, a working knowledge of technology, and the ability to integrate the two, the library
information specialist is considered the educational technology specialist who should provide
instructional design leadership and professional development/training opportunities to school
staff, particularly in the areas of information access and technology. However, research indicates
that many library specialists are reluctant to fully embrace this role (Craver, 1986, 1994;
McIntosh, 1994; Neuman, 2004; Pickard, 1993).
Both educational technology and school librarianship are products of the twentieth
century and have their foundations in education. McCracken (2001, p. 9) states, “The
introduction of technology into the school library media center, accompanied by the rapid
advances and changes in the technology since its introduction, has had a profound impact on the
library media specialist.” Technological advances are altering the instructional role of the school
library media specialist not only in regard to equipment but also to pedagogy (Craver, 1994;
Small, 1998). Neuman (2004, p. 499) relates that “the library media specialist is poised to
assume a much more active role as an instructional designer/instructional technologist than has
been possible in the past,” and in many schools, school library media specialists have become
instructional technologists (Craver, 1994). Even the occupational titles the professional school
library educator has assumed (librarian, teacher librarian, library media specialist, library
information specialist) fail to identify the importance of this shift in role perception. There has
been no research on library media specialists’ roles since McCracken (2001) and Shelton (2002).
Few research studies have examined the similarities and overlap between the fields of
educational technology and school librarianship and their common shared history. In order for

36

the school library media professional to fully assume the mantle of instructional designer and
technologist, it is important that the nature and history of school librarianship in relation to
educational technology be understood.
Citing the impact of technology on the field of school librarianship, McIntosh (1994) chose
to examine the historical evolution of the role of the K-12 public school library media specialist
using self-sampling descriptive research. The study’s purpose was to examine the present role of
the K-12 public school library media specialists (SLMs) in two Kentucky counties, the evolving
role of the SLMs, and how the current role in practice compares to how it is perceived in library
media and education literature. Based on the literature review and work sampling data, McIntosh
found that all three roles, as defined in Information Power (1988), were being practiced, with the
role of information specialist most prominent, followed by teacher and instructional consultant.
Pickard (1993) sought to determine if a lag existed between the theoretical role of
instructional design consultant, as defined in professional literature, and the role as practiced by
school library media specialists in DeKalb County, Georgia. Data were gathered using a threepage questionnaire containing eighteen statements related to the instructional role, which
respondents rated using a Likert scale. Although the majority of library media specialists
perceived their instructional role to be important, they seemed to view this role as supportive,
and fewer than 10% reported they practiced it to a great extent. The study confirmed earlier
research (Craver, 1986) that found there is a lag of at least ten years between the stated
instructional role in the literature and practice in the field.
Stating rapid advances in technology have impacted the traditional role of the school library
media specialist as described in Information Power: Guidelines for School Library Media
Programs (1988) and Information Power: Building Partnerships for Learning (1998),

37

McCracken (2001) developed a survey to examine “the role school library media specialists
perceive they should practice – and do – in relation to instructional technology” (p. 3).
Distributed to a random sample of 1,000 school library media specialists, the survey (505
responses) indicated they felt they were unable to fully implement this role in practice. The data
confirmed that library media specialists practice roles in the order of their perceived importance
– information specialist, program administrator, instructional partner, and instructional
consultant. McCracken’s study warns that if library media specialists do not develop leadership
in relation to technology, their jobs may disappear.
Shelton (2002) investigated the perceptions of library media specialists about their
changing role as teachers of literacy, instructional partners, information specialists, and program
administrators as defined by Information Power (1998) using a mixed-method design, pilot
study, survey, and interview. The findings indicate that library media specialists perceive their
defined roles as essential to impact “information era demands” (p. x). This study’s theoretical
framework used role theory, a theoretical model developed by Katz and Kahn (1978). It also
introduced new research instruments, the Information Power interview, and the Role of Library
Media Specialists (RELMS) survey.

School Librarians: Pioneers, Change Agents, and Transformative Leaders
Personal, social, and institutional identities are inevitably created in important ways by
experience through time – that is, historically (Rayward, 2004). We bring different frames of
reference and knowledge to a historical account while seeking a special insight into the events
and individuals under investigation. Library and information science (LIS) and educational

38

technology are in the midst of major transformations under the impact of new technologies.
Therefore, it is important in a period of great change to understand a field’s or organization’s
origins. The question arises – how can an organization think about the present and plan for the
future in light of its historical development? Rayward postulates that to find answers to this
question, the organization must “identify those who have been in some way important in the
development of the field either in terms of their research and theoretical writings or in terms of
institutional development of various kinds for which they were primarily responsible” (p. 673).
These identified individuals may be considered pioneers by their contemporaries, and historical
analysis will confirm this status. Pioneers are thought to be those who were present at a
particular time and/or event and “left traces of their presence behind” (p. 673). Rayward relates
that “they are the individuals who provide us with our heritage, and we celebrate them as
forbears” (p. 674). Without them, libraries and librarianship would not exist.
Examination of ISLMA archives has led to those pioneers or leaders who were influential
in its development, who produced ideas and documents, who articulated new professional
practices, who found uses for new technology, and who created and led the organization
(Rayward, 2004). They are considered pioneers not just because they were there at ISLMA’s
creation but also because they had an influence on developments important to the field of school
librarianship in Illinois. Many of these pioneers may not have been recognized as leaders in their
lifetime or even now. It is only when we assess the nature and extent of their achievements
comparatively to other achievements that we acknowledge their historical tasks. This study
examined aspects of some individuals who can be argued to have played important roles in the
development of ISLMA. Pioneers are considered to be important because they were influential in
their time in establishing a direction of development; their ideas can now be seen as adding

39

something valuable to the definition or development of the field. Their ideas are of continuing
importance in helping us understand and shape current developments, and their ideas are in need
of re-evaluation in light of current trends (Rayward, 2004, p. 679).
Summary
Chapter 2 established the rationale for a qualitative design and provided a perspective on
scholarship within a historical setting. The historiography of the Illinois School Library Media
Association was situated within existing library and historical literature. This perspective will
shape the study and guide the researcher in its design and implementation. Chapter 3 describes
the systematic process and procedures for conducting this study and the creation of a written and
oral history of the Illinois School Library Media Association.

	  

CHAPTER 3
METHODS
Case study as a research methodology can be traced back to life histories (Yin, 2003),
which has a long and vibrant tradition. Creswell (1998, p. 61) states “A case study is an
exploration of a ‘bounded system’ or a case…over time through detailed, in-depth data collection
involving multiple sources of information rich in context.” When no other cases are available,
the researcher is limited to single-case design. The selection of the case seeks to maximize what
can be learned within the constraints of time and resources available for the study (Wilson,
2007). The unit of analysis defines the case (Yin, 2003). The unit of analysis for this case study
is the Illinois School Library Media Association.
Oral history has been defined as “the interviewing of eye-witness participants in the
events of the past for the purposes of historical reconstruction” (Grele, 1991, p. 63). It is “a
method of gathering and preserving historical information through recorded interviews with
participants in past events and ways of life” (OHA, 2001, p. 4) in which the researcher and
research participants spend extended time together engaged in a process of storytelling and
listening. Usually occurring in multiple sessions, the researcher/interviewer uses an open-ended
interview to query a person about his/her life or a significant aspect of it. Oral history adds a
significant dimension to library history and to all historical research (McCombs & Busha, 1981,
p. 82). Oral sources are increasingly being used in library historical studies (Busha & Harter,
1980, p.

41

114) and “offer a means for the accurate recording and preservation of personal sources to fill the
gaps in written documents” (Moss, 1974, p. 9).
Many of the principal participants in the ISLMA history are alive and actively engaged in
the school library profession. Many, however, have retired or passed away, so their memories
and insights go undocumented. Given the lack of narrative accounts about the association’s
founding, an oral history approach suggested itself as an obvious way to augment a written
record lacking in information about its leadership, birth, and development. Through the oral
history method, it was possible to gather information that was lacking from official documents,
fill in gaps where it was missing, find new information, and gain insight into events or decisions
through the unique perspectives of its leadership (Ritchie, 2003). These oral histories helped
capture the intangible aspects of ISLMA by providing “a sense of spirit, character and beliefs of
those who envisioned, built and led it” (Gage, 2007, p. 2).
Historical data about ISLMA were gathered from its archives and oral interviews with
selected figures from its history. The method for conducting oral histories was in accordance
with the principles and standards developed by the Oral History Association (OHA) as well as
those defined by Donald A. Ritchie (2003), a past president of the OHA and associate historian
in the U.S. Senate Historical Office.
Oral history is created according to a professional code of ethics, standards, principles,
and evaluation guidelines (Ritchie, 2003). Oral histories are collected according to a clearly
defined process that includes in-depth preparation, a structured and/or unstructured interview
format, selection and usage of high-quality recording equipment, a controlled setting for the
recorded interview in which information is collected first hand, observance of established
processing techniques (transcription), knowledge and understanding of legal and ethical issues,

42

and placement of the interview materials into a repository to allow for future access (Sommer &
Quinlan, 2002). Interviews conducted for archival purposes will be accessioned, processed, and
made permanently accessible to future researchers.
“Interviews are used frequently in information and library research” (Pickard, 2007, p.
171). Multiple disciplines have employed interviewing as an acceptable qualitative research
method. After examining its usage in education (Altenbaugh, 1997; Conly & Hall, 1999;
Cunningham, 2006; Gardner, 2003), archival study (Christian, 2002; Swain, 2002), counseling
(Heppner, Wright, & Berry, 1990), social work (Langer, Lietz, & Furman, 2007), social science
(Angrosino, 1989; Jenkins & Ward, 2001; Pile, 1992), and medical librarianship (Figa, 1999), it
is clear that oral histories allow for a greater diversity of voice and encourage a personal
witnessing of history.
A detailed outline of the processes the researcher followed to conduct the study is
provided in this section. This outline includes the context of the research study, the data
gathering and analysis methods used. Figure 1 serves as a visual guide for the four phases of
research used in this study: preparation, data collection, data analysis, results, and/or
recommendations and conclusions.

44

Preparation
Background Research
The performance of preliminary research is the initial step in conducting oral history
interviews. In order to create an oral history of value to others, the interviewer must have
expertise in the subject. Extensive research of the topics and the individuals to be interviewed is
needed to develop informed and meaningful questions that will stimulate dialogue (Oral History
Association, 2001). The researcher must review existing primary sources available in archives
and libraries – for example, newspapers, letters, diaries, and government reports – relevant to the
research problem prior to conducting oral history interviews or consulting those that are part of
the archival record.
The use of preliminary informational interviews with current ISLMA board members
provided insights into the identification of interviewees and an interview guide. Sample
questions included:
1. If you were writing this history, what event would you include?
2. If you were studying ISLMA, what kind of things would you describe/include?
3. What persons stand out in your mind?
4. What changes have you seen?
5. What would you like to learn from the study?
6. What do you hope such a history would do for the Illinois school library community?
Profession?
7. Who knows a lot about the origins and development of ISLMA?
8. Whom would you interview?

45

9. Who has kept a scrapbook or file on this? Photographs?
Historical Research: Chronology
Historical research is potentially of great value in librarianship (Goldhor, 1969, p. 111). It
is concerned with data drawn from the study of the past, primarily oral and written documents.
Chronology, defined as the describing of events in the order of their occurrence, is the first step
in the process of historical research (Powell & Connaway, 2004, p. 212). The compilation of
chronological events in an historical case is consistent with the use of case study design,
especially where little research has been done, to explore the history of an education institution
(Merriam, 1998; Rousmaniere, 2004; Yin, 2003). The resulting chronicles of events provide a
structure for filling in the gaps with stories of the participants. A timeline of dates and events in
ISLMA’s formation and development was created prior to conducting oral history interviews.
The ISLMA archives (meeting minutes, conference proceedings and programs, etc.) assisted in
the development of this chronological history, as the researcher had complete access to the
ISLMA archives throughout the study. ISLMA records (1988-1998) are currently housed in the
Manuscript Division of the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum, Springfield,
Illinois. The remaining ISLMA records (1999-2008) are housed at the home of ISLMA archivist
Jeanne Lohfink, Round Lake Beach, Illinois. The latter depository (a private residence) afforded
limited access. However, Kay Maynard, ISLMA executive secretary, provided full access to her
personal records of ISLMA’s birth as well as documents that had not been deposited into either
archives.

46

Narrator Selection
The Illinois School Library Media Association was formed in 1988 when a group of
school library media specialists, known as the Friends of School Libraries, met and presented a
proposal for a formal organization (ISLMA, 2007). The elected officers of the Illinois
Association for Media in Education (IAME) continued in their offices as the ISLMA Board. The
first officers were Kay Maynard, President; Nancy Bloomstrand, President-elect; Joyce Karon,
Secretary; Becky Trewartha, Treasurer; and Dale Guthrie, Pamela Kramer, Jackie Plourde, and
Carol Morrison, Members. These individuals as well as the 1998 Board and the 2008 Board were
asked to participate in this study. A list of narrators, based on their level of appropriateness for
the method as well as the purposes and objectives of this study, was also discussed with and
approved by the dissertation advisor, Dr. Rebecca Butler, and the committee. Additionally,
individuals involved with ISLMA were consulted for their input during the selection process. As
final selections were made, potential narrators were contacted by letter, email, or telephone and
invited to participate. Interviews were scheduled with narrators who agreed to participate in faceto-face or telephone interviews (Sommers & Quinlan, 2002). As the data collection progressed, it
was determined that narrators residing outside of Illinois could complete an online interview.
Interview questions were emailed to those individuals for their perusal and completion. Not all
prospective narrators were invited at the same time.
It is important to note that many of the narrators selected are women. First, because a
higher percentage of women than men fill the ranks of the profession, it seemed appropriate to
reflect this reality when choosing witnesses for this history (Gage, 2007, p. 6). Second, despite
the fact that the inverse has been true in terms of the gender ratio of individuals peopling the

47

highest positions in librarianship, women have occupied a generous percentage of ISLMA’s
leadership positions and the selection in this study reflects that reality.
Interview Questions
Interview questions were designed to adhere to content guidelines provided by the Oral
History Association (OHA, 2001) to contribute to the fulfillment of the objectives contained in
the scope of this study and to avoid redundancy across narrators so that individual interviews
would “supplement one another in …content and focus.” In addition, questions were tailored to
contribute to historical understanding of the topic and to add new information and “fill gaps in
the record, and/or provide fresh insights and perspectives, detail, richness, and flavor to the
historical record (OHA, 2001). The semi-structured interview format employed open-ended
questions (Merriam, 1998).
An interview guide is generally considered a necessity by most oral historians (Larson,
2007, p. 116) and qualitative researchers (Merriam, 1998, p. 81). This guide can consist of a list
of basic topics or a detailed ordered list of questions. The guide contains the topics the
interviewer will pursue but does not limit the interview to those topics because the narrator will
have the freedom to suggest others (Yow, 1994, p. 36). The researcher’s interview guide is
included in Appendix E. The following focusing questions were included:
1. What are the connections between the Illinois school library community (ISLMA) and the
profession at large?
2. How has ISLMA shared in experiences common to much of the profession?
3. How is this community unique?
4. Who were/are the individuals who influenced ISLMA’s history?

48

In addition, the interview guide included follow-up questions intended to probe or clarify the
narrators’ responses.
Interviews: Ethical and Legal Guidelines
Narrators, the ISLMA interviewees, were treated respectfully and informed of the
purpose and research objectives of the study in advance and at the time of the interview. They
were asked to respond to questions freely and without stereotypical assumptions such as race,
ethnicity, gender, and class (OHA, 2001, p. 1).
Participants were fully informed of their rights, which included the right to refuse to
answer any question, terminate the interview at any time, seal parts of the interview (OHA,
2001), and copyright (Ritchie, 2003). Informed consent in writing was asked of each narrator
after being provided with information regarding the purpose of the study and his/her legal rights
(see Appendix F). Participants were also asked to sign a consent form transferring control of the
interview materials to the researcher and Illinois School Library Media Association archives.
ISLMA has agreed to provide access to the materials for scholarly use or distribution. The
interviewer also signed all consent forms. Each narrator was asked to provide biographical
information as well as any papers, photographs, or information they wished to share.
In 2003, the Oral History Association (OHA) issued a policy statement providing a
rationale for excluding oral history interviewing from institutional review board (IRB) oversight.
That said, according to university policy, this researcher submitted a request for approval for this
oral history project to Northern Illinois University’s Institutional Review Board and IRB
permission was granted.

49

Interviews
Interviews were conducted one-on-one at the narrator’s home in a selected site removed
from noise and distractions that may have bothered the narrator or impinged on the quality of the
recording. Each interview recording was clearly identified as to the interviewer’s and narrator’s
names, date, purpose of the interview, and a short biographical statement about the narrator. The
interviewer limited interview sessions to one to two hours to avoid fatigue by both parties.
Twenty narrators were interviewed either face-to-face or via telephone and/or email due to
distance (two interviewees lived outside of Illinois – in Hawaii and Florida). Member checking
occurred via a focus group face-to-face meeting or through surface mail and email.
Approximately 45 questions were asked of each narrator over a three-year period. Due to death
and health issues, four oral histories were not fully completed for this study.
Sound recordings were made digitally with a high-quality digital recorder and external
microphone. The digital files were downloaded to the researcher’s personal computer and
backed-up on an external hard drive. Copies of the digital files were used to prepare paper
transcripts of the interviews. The researcher used the digital recorder’s accompanying software,
Dragon NaturallySpeaking, to assist in transcribing the digital recordings into a Microsoft Word
document, a speech-to-text conversion process. The Microsoft Word transcriptions were backed
up on a flash-memory device until paper copies had been printed and proofread.
Data Analysis
In the qualitative design of an historical research study, the researcher “is the primary
instrument for gathering and analyzing data” (Merriam, 1998, p. 20). The determination of the
authenticity and accuracy of documents was part of the analysis process. The researcher assessed

50

the origination and intent of the source and its trustworthiness. While the data collection
occurred in sequence, data analysis began and continued concurrently with the collection period.
Historiography is concerned with analyzing and interpreting the meaning of historical
events within their contexts (Powell & Connaway, 2004, p. 212). To determine events of
importance, the researcher gathered data from a wide variety of sources: primary and secondary
documents. Primary sources are the written record of what the writer actually observed or the
firsthand expression of his or her thoughts (Powell & Connaway, 2004, p. 214). Primary sources
“are the raw materials of historical interpretation, permitting the researcher to soak up the
atmosphere of a different time, to experience the actual vocabulary, and to see for himself what
the major ideas, customs and problems seemed to be” (Bates, 1971, p. 11). Primary sources of
information contain eyewitness testimony, which enhances the validity and value of history
(Busha & Harter, 1980, p. 101). Secondary sources of information are records or accounts
prepared by someone other than the person, or persons, who participated in or observed an event
(Busha & Harter, 1980, p. 102). Secondary sources included textbooks, journal articles, histories,
and encyclopedias – everything not viewed as primary. These sources contained historical
evidence that was transmitted either consciously or unconsciously (Busha & Harter, 1980, p.
114).
Historical Document and Source Analysis
In selecting sources of data for a historical study it is critical that these data be evaluated
properly. The researcher should determine if the sources are relevant to the study, substantial
enough to be worthwhile, and competent, that is, genuine, accurate, and reasonable (Powell &
Connaway, 2004, p. 215). It was crucial that this researcher established the internal and external

51

validity of her sources. Determining competency involved external and internal criticism.
External criticism, or the gathering of external evidence, was done to determine if a source
provided authentic, primary data and involved physical, textual, and bibliographical analysis
(Powell & Connaway, 2004). External criticism used with textual criticism examined the
provenance or origin of a document. Upon certifying a document or source as genuine, the
researcher then confirmed the reliability and validity of its contents. Internal criticism was
concerned with what the source says - its meaning, accuracy, and general trustworthiness
(Powell & Connaway, 2004, p. 216). Analysis forms (archival records, documents, and
photographs) were used to determine reliability, relevance, and validity based on analysis
documents designed and developed by the Education Staff of the National Archives and Records
Administration. These forms can be found in Appendix G.
Data were collected from documents, records, and interviews to create the chronology
and narrative. “Historians rely on primary sources as the evidence that is literally closest to the
topic, although this does not necessarily mean that the source is the most accurate one”
(Rousmaniere, 2004, p. 46).
Oral History Analysis
Analysis of the data involved examining the transcripts and noting recurring themes.
Themes should emerge from the interviews themselves rather than from the interviewer’s
questions (Thompson, 2000). The themes served to provide organization and structure for the
oral history. Key themes readily appeared and centered on the origin of ISLMA, its operational
structure, its role in professional development, social aspects, key memories, and the future of

52

ISLMA. The interviews were then evaluated in three ways: as texts, as types of content, and as
evidence (p. 272).
Follow-Up Interviews
Additional follow-up interviews were required of some narrators. These interviews were to
clarify certain facts or details elucidated in previous interviews, to allow unasked questions to be
considered, or to provide the interviewer with the opportunity to conduct additional research in
preparation for subsequent interviews.
Processing
Processing the interviews was a multi-phase process that converted the oral narrative to written
form. Interview transcripts were only edited to make the interview understandable to the reader. As
Ritchie states (2003), “Editing and rearranging interviews for clarification and cutting away tangential
material are appropriate so long as the original meaning is retained. The goal is to sharpen the focus
without putting words in the interviewee’s mouth or altering the essence of what was said (pp. 128129).
Once a transcript was drafted, it was edited for accuracy and then submitted to the
narrator for his/her edits. Upon receipt of edited transcripts, the interviewer reviewed the
comments and included them in the final document. Final copies of transcripts and the
commented transcripts will be given to the ISLMA archives. Member checking was employed to
determine the narrators’ credibility and to validate their responses as well as the collective
memory of the group. Guba and Lincoln (1985) advise that “member checks are the most crucial
technique for establishing credibility” (p. 314). The researcher chose to follow the
recommendations of Creswell and Miller (2000) regarding member checking as outlined here:

53

With the lens focused on participants, the researchers systematically check the data and
the narrative account. Several procedures facilitate this process. A popular strategy is to
convene a focus group of participants to review the findings. Alternatively, researchers
may have participants view the raw data (e.g., transcriptions or observational field notes)
and comment on their accuracy. Throughout this process, the researchers ask participants
if the themes or categories make sense, whether they are developed with sufficient
evidence, and whether the overall account is realistic and accurate. In turn, researchers
incorporate participants’ comments into the final narrative. In this way, the participants
add credibility to the qualitative study by having a chance to react to both the data and the
final narrative. (p. 127)
Member checking for this study occurred via a focus group face-to-face meeting or through
surface mail and email.
Follow-Up with Narrators
Copies of the dissertation, the audio recordings of their interviews, and any other items of
interest loaned to the interviewer were returned to the narrators. Narrators were queried as to their
decision about whether to allow their interviews to be accessible to other researchers during their
lifetime. If narrators choose to deny access due to legal or ethical concerns, then a form stipulating
their concerns was completed and signed.
The interviewer maintained an interview log that detailed information about each
interview: the name of the narrator, length of interview session, date, time, and notes and release
forms. Files were kept for each interview and included all correspondence with the narrators,
release forms, biographical information, research notes, and source materials. According to
recommended practice, all interview recordings and interview materials will be deposited with
the ISLMA archives (Ritchie, 2003). Deposited materials will comply with ISLMA requirements
and be accessible to researchers and ISLMA membership.

Summary
Chapter 3 described the systematic process and specific procedures used in this study to
produce a reliable and valid history of ISLMA. The approach to methods, role of the researcher,
data collection, analysis, and interpretation of procedures were discussed. Methods of
verification and standards of quality were outlined.
Chapter 4 outlines the development of school libraries, school librarianship, and state
library associations to provide an understanding of the study’s context and place in school library
history. This overview provides a historical perspective of school libraries and professional
school library organizations in Illinois. This serves to anchor the study’s examination of the
Illinois School Library Media Association and it antecedents.

	  

CHAPTER 4
DEVELOPMENT OF SCHOOL LIBRARIES, SCHOOL LIBRARIANSHIP,
AND STATE LIBRARY ASSOCIATIONS
The purpose of this chapter is not to provide a comprehensive history of school libraries,
school librarians, and library associations in Illinois between 1850 and 2000 but rather to provide
an overview of the period to serve as a background for the new professional association that will
emerge.
Early Development of School Libraries: 1700-1800
The origins and development of school libraries in America was a slow process in
comparison to that of public libraries. While Benjamin Franklin’s Junto Library, formed in 1732,
is considered the first public library, academic libraries at such colleges as Harvard (1638), Yale
(1700), and William and Mary (1705) were established prior to this event. As early as 1740,
Franklin suggested that schools (K-12) should contain a library, and he included one in his own
plans for a classical academy (Baule, 2002; Morris, 2010). However, the true beginning of the
school library movement did not occur until a century later in New York State. In 1826, New
York Governor DeWitt Clinton began his advocacy in his address to the legislature asking that
“small and suitable collections of books and maps be attached to our common schools” (Jeffus,
2002, p. 9). The earliest attempt to create and maintain school libraries occurred in 1835 when
the New York state legislature passed a law permitting school districts to use a limited amount of
their tax monies for this purpose (Morris, 2010; Rubin, 2010). “When only a few districts

56

decided to use their funds for this purpose, a second act was passed in 1839 to spur further
action; it set aside a sum of $55,000 annually to be given on a matching fund basis for the
establishment of school district libraries” (Morris, 2010, p. 1). This funding initiative provided
the national impetus. Ohio followed suit in 1836, recommending that the state grant authority for
the establishment of school libraries (Stone, 1977, p. 124).
In 1837, chiefly through the efforts of Horace Mann, a pioneer educator, Massachusetts
enacted its first school district library law to enable school districts to raise funds for
libraries. This law was liberalized in 1842 to give $15 per year from state funds to each
school district that could supply a similar amount for library purposes (Morris, 2010, p.
2).
In addition, the state of Michigan passed legislation guaranteeing that districts that raised a
minimum tax of $15 per year for libraries would be reimbursed a portion of this from fines
collected from “disturbing the peace” laws (Morris, 2010, p. 2). Subsequently, “by 1839, the
state legislature of Connecticut created the first common-school library contingent upon the
construction of new school buildings” (Stone, 1977, p. 125) and Rhode Island followed suit in
1840. By 1879, twenty states had passed similar legislation designed to promote public school
libraries (Knight & Nourse, 1969; Morris, 2010; Rubin, 2010, p. 52).
However, the movement in the early 1800s to build school district libraries lost its
momentum. The limited availability of quality children’s materials, poor school library facilities,
and the growth of public libraries were key causes (Gann, 2010, p. 14). Library collections
consisted mainly of adult books and textbooks for instructional use rather than high-quality
literary works written for children. Inconsistent shelving and/or housing of library materials led
to a high loss rate that resulted in school district monies being allocated for supplies, equipment,
and salaries rather than libraries. “Evidence of the decline of this movement is that New York
state school district libraries contained twice as many books in 1853 as they did in 1890”

57

(Morris, 2010, p. 3). Important to its gradual demise through the 1800s was the lack of
organization of the libraries and of trained librarians to supervise them (Alsworth, 1980, p. 54).
Legislators and educators sought ways to supply library service to the community at large rather
than a small segment of its population – elementary and secondary students. In 1850,
Massachusetts led the way with its repeal of school library legislation, which was replaced with a
law funding the creation and maintenance of public libraries. The school library had taken a back
seat to the public community library. The school district library movement while not successful
still demonstrated that school libraries were of educational value and established a precedent for
how they could be funded through public funds (Morris, 2010, p. 3).
Development of School Libraries: The 1850s to 1900s
It has been acknowledged that 1876 is the birth year of the modern American library
movement (Morris, 2010, p. 3; Van Oord, 1968, p. 855). Librarians attending a national library
meeting at the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia established the American Library
Association (ALA) led by Melvil Dewey and followed its birth with the publication of the first
issue of Library Journal. Its early purpose was "to enable librarians to do their present work
more easily and at less expense” (Holley, 1976, p. 3).1
While the first issue of a professional journal for librarians, Library Journal, appeared in
1876, a government report issued by the U.S. Bureau of Education, Public Libraries in the
United States of America: Their History, Condition and Management, reported that there were
only 826 secondary school libraries in the nation containing a grand total of a million volumes
(Morris, 2010, p. 3; Stone, 1977, p. 124). “Now there is hardly a school of any kind, seminary,
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  
1	  Currently,

ALA’s mission is “to provide leadership for the development, promotion, and improvement of library

58

normal school, commercial school, or other higher school, public or private, without its library.
Although some high school libraries received public aid, most of them depended on gifts from
individuals” (Stone, 1977, p. 125).
While the report included information on other types of libraries, no elementary or
grammar school libraries were mentioned. The report section on school libraries cited a
multitude of reasons for the dismal number of school libraries: “first, defects and frequent
changes in legislation; second, incompetence and indifference in the administration of the law”
(Stone, 1977, p. 125). The defects of the legislation in general were considered to be an
improper balance of state aid and local tax money, lack of supervision over selection of books,
and failure to hold trustees and school officers responsible for their actions.
Not surprisingly,
between 1880 and 1920, as public library children’s services were beginning to develop,
public libraries began to initiate direct book loans to teachers’ classrooms and to form
“school departments” within the public libraries. Also during this early development
period, teacher rooms were established in some public libraries, some attention was given
to reference service to high school students, and there were reports of school and public
library cooperative reading projects, such as book week celebrations. (Fitzgibbons, 1989,
p. 58)
William H. Brett of the Cleveland Public Library and Samuel S. Green of the Worcester,
Massachusetts Free Library began furnishing book collections to schools in these cities to be
used in classroom libraries. Their example was soon followed by libraries in Providence,
Buffalo, Detroit, Milwaukee, and New York (Ross, 1988, p. 29; Stone, 1977, p. 125).
On May 18, 1892, at the annual ALA Conference, consideration was given to cooperation
between public libraries and schools. Green reported that one of the most interesting movements
had recently been tried in Wisconsin in which a state officer was appointed to go into all the
normal schools and, while nominally attending to cataloging the collections of books, really

59

attempted to teach the members of those schools how to successfully use books within their
public schools. Green (1893), one of the founders of ALA, commented:
If you can get all the teachers interested in the work of finding out how books may be
used by themselves and by their pupils to their advantage and the advantages of the
community, you are doing an immense work. Each one of these teachers…. is a library
missionary.
Appalled at the state of school libraries in New York State and the widespread inability
of local school districts to address these conditions, Melvil Dewey, then director of the State
Library of New York and secretary of the Board of Regents, and Andrew Draper, Superintendent
of Public Instruction, generated new legislation in 1892. Considered landmark legislation for the
development of school libraries (Jeffus, 2002), it developed a model for all states and outlined a
plan to foster school library growth in New York State through a matching-fund plan. Like the
1830 school district library law, a single school district could receive no more than $500 per year
for the acquisition of library books. Eventually a formula based on student enrollment size
became the norm for school library funding, and “only books approved by the Department of
Public Instruction could be purchased with state funds” (Morris, 2010, p. 3; Rubin, 2010, p. 52).
Approved materials consisted of “reference books, supplementary reading books, books related
to the curriculum, and pedagogical books for use by teachers” (Gillespie & Spirt, 1983, p. 3).
These recommended lists were issued periodically, and to assist in maintaining the school
library’s collection integrity, the materials were occasionally allowed to circulate (Morris, 2010,
p. 3; Rubin, 2010, p. 52). This law detailed not only how a library collection would be funded,
selected and acquired, but it stipulated that a classroom teacher would be appointed school
librarian to manage and maintain the collection. An annual report would be submitted by the
school librarian to the state superintendent of public instruction. Given these strict guidelines,

60

many schools were intimidated and did not apply for state funds. Modifications to these
regulations were eventually developed and other states gradually crafted similar legislation
(Morris, 2010, p. 3).
New York State continued to take the lead in library development, and in 1892 formed a
School Libraries Division within the Department of Public Instruction (Morris, 2010, p. 3).
Concerned with the development of school libraries, the department issued a report in 1900 that
delineated a tentative standard for elementary school libraries (Morris, 2010) and emphasized its
indispensable role to students and staff. Other developments in the field of education indicated
growing support for school libraries, particularly professional education groups, that is “the
National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE), the National Education Association (NEA),
and ALA” (Rubin, 2010, p. 52).
In 1896, John Cotton Dana, along with Melvil Dewey, recognized the importance of the
library within the school and urged librarians and educators to form a school library section
within the National Education Association (Pond, 1998). “Several state teachers’ associations
began developing sections for school librarians. In 1910 New York state once more led the way,
this time by creating the High School Library Section within the New York States Teachers
Association” (Morris, 2010, p. 4). However, it was not until after 1900 that school libraries
became an accepted part of American schools. The funding of school libraries had been hindered
by local taxpayers’ unwillingness to support both public libraries and school libraries. Some
communities chose to locate the public library in close proximity to its schools for ease of
student access, loan books to schools to create classroom collections, or in some cases locate the
public library within the school to serve the needs of all. Nevertheless, none of these plans was
successful (Gillespie & Spirt, 1983, p. 3).

61

While it has been suggested that these “early efforts to create and maintain public school
libraries established the idea that public funds were an appropriate means to support school
libraries and that school libraries could play a useful role in public school education” (Gillespie
& Spirt, 1983, p. 3), the result in many states was poorly developed and poorly maintained
libraries that were seldom used (Cecil & Heaps, 1940; Knight & Nourse, 1969). It was not
surprising that in those areas other library services for children models appeared during this
period. These attempted to meld public and school library service. Morris (2010) states the four
most important methods were:
1) In rural and remote areas without even public libraries, the state library agency
provided traveling libraries to schools. 2) In urban areas, students used the public library
resources exclusively, and liaison between the school and public library was maintained
by such strategies as visits to the schools. 3) A branch of the public library was created in
the school to supply library service for both the children and adults in the community. 4)
A system of joint control was established by which a public library branch to be used
exclusively by students and teachers was placed in the school but organized and
administered by the staff of the public library. (p. 5)
The Report of the Commissioner of Education for the Year 1899–1900 (The City and Popular
Education, 1901) also described this emerging movement, which had begun in New England, of
great city public libraries providing library services to public schools. The Providence Free
Library of Rhode Island created collections of clippings and reading lists for teachers and
students. The Public Library of Worcester, Massachusetts, organized class visits to the public
library, under the supervision of the teacher. In Newark, New Jersey, there was a proposal to
establish a “library station,” consisting of 50 volumes, in each of the city schools (Michie &
Holton, 2005, p. 2).
Development of School Libraries: The 1900s – 1920s

62

By 1913, “90 percent of the schools in America, which constituted more than 10,000
schools, had developed a school library” (Brodie, 1998, p. 59). However, the American Library
Association did not form a school library section until 1914. A petition was approved at the 1914
ALA annual conference to create a school library division later known as the American
Association of School Librarians (AASL) (Pond, 1998). By creating school library divisions
within the NEA and ALA, both librarians and educators finally recognized the importance of
libraries within schools and supported the role of the school librarian in education (Gann, 2010).

Development of Library Standards
In 1915 the NEA’s Committee on Library Organization and Equipment and the North
Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools published the Certain Report, which
outlined the services and equipment needed in secondary schools. The Certain Report, named for
the committee chair Charles C. Certain, had a profound impact on school library development.
While school libraries were becoming a more common occurrence by 1915, they still were to be
found exclusively in secondary schools. Consequently, “the first graduates of library schools to
become school librarians were placed in high schools” (Gann, 1998, p. 167). Many educators
felt that the elementary level did not require informational texts, as reading was purely
recreational. Therefore, elementary library budgets were hard to justify.
In 1920, the American Library Association (ALA) and North Central Association (NCA)
adopted the NEA standards, Standard Library Organization and Equipment for Secondary
Schools of Different Size (ALA, NCA, and NEA), also known as the Certain Standards. The
school library was addressed as a separate entity that should “serve as the center and
coordinating agency for all material used in the school for visual instruction…. Such material

63

should be regularly accessioned and cataloged, and its movements recorded, and directed from
the library” (Committee on Library Organization & Equipment, 1920, p. 17). The school library
collection should also meet the reading interests of the school’s students. The Certain Standards
provided “the first yardstick to evaluate local libraries and also created a framework from which
other accrediting agencies – library departments, regional, state, and local – could develop other
sets of standards” (Morris, 2010, p. 6). Gann (1998) relates how the Certain Standards are
considered “historic not only for being the first comprehensive set of quantitative school library
standards but also for establishing many of the basic ideas about the school library, the
professional requirements for the school librarian, and the role of school librarian within the
school” (p. 18). It defined the role of the school librarian as both a professional librarian and a
certified teacher. “The Certain [Report] (1920) was the first attempt in the U.S. to set standards
for public school libraries and for school librarians' education, skills, and responsibilities”
(Butler, 1999, p. 36). These are the first ALA standards for school libraries, and the NEA report
served as a model for future standards.
The push to create elementary school libraries was advanced with the endorsement and
publication by both ALA and NEA of the Report of the Joint Committee on Elementary School
Library Standards (1925), a second report by Charles C. Certain. This new second set of
standards for school libraries emphasized the role of audiovisual materials in school library
collections, the instructional role of the school librarian in library use and print materials, and
information access for students at the time of need and included a description of a district-level
library supervisor. These standards provided little impact, as there were few elementary school
libraries at this time.

64

Koos’s study of the state role in school library development also published standards for
school library practices in the early 1920s. Koos conducted a survey of state support of library
services and the data were reported in State Participation in Public School Library Service (Cecil
& Heaps, 1940, p. 2; Koos, 1927). NCA required members to evaluate their high school libraries
using the Score Card for School Libraries. Much of the impetus in the direction of better school
library service has come from educational organizations. The North Central Association of
Colleges and Secondary Schools Special Committee on Libraries published its report entitled
High School Library Study (1928) based on findings obtained through the use of a score card
prepared by Martha Wilson (Fargo, 1947, p. 391). Wilson, a graduate of the University of Illinois
School of Library Science, championed school libraries as centers for instructional media and
was a pioneer in the development of school libraries nationally and locally in Illinois (Miller,
2003, p. 98).
While the Certain Reports (1920, 1925, supplement 1932) were significant, they did not
lead to “the quick development of centralized, modern school libraries” (Rubin, 2010, p. 53).
“During the 1920s, high school libraries were developed, and as early as the 1930s, schoolhoused public libraries (usually as branches of a public library) were established as one model of
service” (Fitzgibbons, 1989, p. 4). In the 1920s, Mildred Batchelder, ALA’s future school library
specialist (1936), served as a school librarian at Haven Middle School in Evanston, Illinois,
where the library functioned as a school library during the day and a public library in the
evenings and on weekends (Anderson, 1977). “The necessary conditions for the growth of
elementary school libraries did not exist by the end of the period 1920 -1932” (Vande Haar,
2005, p. 98). The onset of the Great Depression impacted all aspects of American life, but
particularly education as school budgets were slashed and elementary school library growth

65

slowed. As the Great Depression continued, everyone – schools, businesses, professional
organizations, municipal governments – were forced to alter how they operated. The library
community found that support for public and school partnerships changed. “Public libraries were
increasingly unable to support school library programs; however, both the NEA and ALA
continued to partner in support of each other’s school library programs and program standards”
(Vande Harr, 2005, p. 98). The NEA, ALA, and NCTE continued to offer their support enforcing
the idea that “school libraries are resources to both students and teachers for high quality reading
materials and pleasure reading materials” (Vande Haar, 2005, p. 99). Nevertheless, “the money
crisis of the decade limited the growth of most libraries – public school, public, and academic,
but there was no retreat in the determination to maintain these important resources” (Vande
Haar, 2005, p. 99).
Development of School Libraries: The 1930s to 1940s
The 1920s were considered an era of reform in public education and resulted in a “more
varied school curriculum requiring access to a much wider range of materials” (Rubin, 2010, p.
54) The response to the progressive education movement and new educational theories “could
only increase the importance of a school library” (Rubin, 2010, p. 54) and its staffing by a
professional trained school librarian capable of developing a quality collection. Nonetheless,
“despite the 1920 Certain [Report] and those that followed - Elementary School Library
Standards (1925) and Summaries of Elementary and Secondary School Library Standards (1932)
– local educational authorities were still often seen by state governments as lacking knowledge in
selecting books for their own school libraries” (Butler, 1999, p. 36). Although selection of

66

materials appropriate for young readers could be part of a librarian’s duties, most materials were
chosen from a book list prepared by the state education office.
Consequently, in 1933, the Cooperative Study of Secondary School Standards under
W.E. Eells initiated a new project that developed a tool to evaluate secondary schools and their
school libraries (Long, 2007, p. 158). By 1934, when library service to schools in rural areas had
become available, it was provided by the extension service of the state library agency or by state
universities (Lathrop, 1934). Books, magazines, and newspaper clippings were lent to schools for
periods ranging from six weeks to a school year. These traveling libraries could consist of up to
500 books on general topics. Package libraries were compiled of books, pamphlets, and
newspaper clippings on a specific subject matter on request. Some state libraries also sent
reproductions of paintings, stereographs, and other visual aids to schools (Michie & Holton,
2005).
The 1940s heralded significant changes in school libraries. “The war years 1941-1945
saw school libraries remain as an important segment of the curriculum and fully participating in
the war effort” (Vande Haar, 2005, p. 115). Subsequently, a 1941 report of a joint committee of
the National Education Association and ALA “gave the responsibility of school library services
to boards of education but still emphasized the importance of school and public library
cooperation” (Joint Committee, 1941, p. 3). The committee’s report clearly indicated the need
for libraries at both elementary and high schools. It stated that all schools should have libraries
“to carry out their educational responsibilities to their pupils” (Fitzgibbons, 1989, p 4).
Classroom materials collections were deemed insufficient means to provide adequate library
services (Fitzgibbons, 1989; Morris, 2010).
In that report, the Committee members included the findings of a 1938 study indicating
that some school libraries were being administered jointly by the public library and the

67

schools. There was evidence that schools and public libraries were working together to
improve services in at least ten communities. (Fitzgibbons, p. 4)
Subsequently, the ALA post-war standards were revised and published as School
Libraries for Today and Tomorrow (1945), the first set of national school library standards
prepared solely by an American Library Association (ALA) committee (Committee on Post-War
Planning) and an American Association of School Libraries (AASL) sub-committee. These
historic standards recognized the school library as a separate, centrally located, and accessible
facility in all school buildings and an essential element of the school program. “In particular, it
called on school librarians to provide instruction in the use of the library and library materials in
addition to reading guidance” (Thomas, 2004, p. 19) and reaffirmed the librarian’s multiple roles
as a professional librarian, certified teacher, and program administrator.
The 1945 standards established the precedent for modern school library media programs
by differentiating between the duties of the school librarian and those of the public
librarian as well as defining the scope of the different services that the school library and
the public library provided to schools. (Kester & Jones, 2004, p. 2)
Quantitative recommendations were made for the school library collection with the
emphasis on print materials through selection criteria for audiovisuals (16mm films, filmstrips,
slides, museum objects, radio programs, recordings and transcriptions, flat pictures, and maps)
(Gann, 1998). Film and its multiple formats were accepted as legitimate forms of instructional
technology. These standards broadened definitions of the school library “as an active service
agency integrated with the learning program of the school, not as an adjunct to it” (Douglas,
1945, p. 15). Students were encouraged to become discriminating users of print and audiovisual
materials. However, no implementation ideas were provided. School Libraries for Today and
Tomorrow: Functions and Standards (1945), the second set of national standards for K-12,
paved the way for school library media centers of today (Bobinski, 2007).

68

To help school librarians implement the 1945 school library standards, Frances Henne, an
AASL board member; Ruth Ersted, the Minnesota state school library supervisor; and Alice
Lohrer, an assistant professor at the University of Illinois Library School, wrote A Planning
Guide for the High School Library Program (1951), “an evaluative guide for school library
programs” (Kester & Jones, 2004, p. 3). “The Planning Guide provided a pattern for developing
school library evaluation materials including those used for self-studies for regional accreditation
of schools, that continued to be influential in the future” (Kester & Jones, 2004, p. 3).
Recommending that “planning should be an integral part of the school library evaluation
process” (Kester & Jones, 2004, p. 4), Henne, Ersted, and Lohrer also stated that school
librarians should not only identify services for students and teachers but provide them as well.
Henne, Ersted, and Lohrer recognized the need for updating and addressing standards
periodically in response to changes in educational philosophy and technology. They “emphasized
the need for extensive collection analysis…. and the need for statistics, facts, and charts to justify
budget requests” (Kester & Jones, 2004, p. 4). Budget rationales were imperative if school
libraries wanted to share in not only building-level budgets but in state and local education
funding (Henne, Ersted, & Lohrer, 1951; Kester & Jones, 2004).
As requirements for certification of school librarians improved, school librarians were
made responsible for curriculum enrichment and fulfilling educational objectives (Long, 2007, p.
158). Leaders like Frances Henne and Mary Peacock Douglas, both members of the AASL
standards committee (1945), “advocated collaborating with classroom teachers to include library
skills education in the context of subject-based learning” (Kester & Jones, 2004, p. 2). Henne
(1956) recommended that the school librarian should hold two certifications: as a teacher and as
a librarian.

69

Development of School Libraries: The 1950s to 1960s
By the middle of the 20th century, the school library was gaining prominence and the use
of classroom collections (a group of library books permanently housed in a single classroom and
not administered from a central location) in lieu of a library was diminishing. A dramatic change
had occurred in school libraries in the post-war years. “They grew in numbers from about 14,000
in 1948 to over 98,000 in 2004” (Bobinski, 2007, p. 36). It all began with ALA’s publication of
School Libraries for Today and Tomorrow (1945), but the real change occurred after the Soviet
Union launched the first satellite, Sputnik, into orbit. Fearful that the Soviets had “passed the
United States in the space race” (Bobinski, 2007, p. 37), it was at this stage in the evolutionary
process that the federal government began to fund school libraries. Elementary school libraries
became more common in the 1950s, and “public libraries served more of a complementary role,
rather than providing direct service to schools. Many public libraries continued to provide bulk
book collections to schools, especially in large cities and in school systems without elementary
libraries” (Fitzgibbons, 1989, p. 4). Even today, some public libraries continue these practices in
areas of inadequately funded and staffed school library media centers (Fitzgibbons, 1989).

Federal Role in Support of School Libraries and Media Centers
Many changes occurred in the United States post-World War II: the interstate highway
system was created and American war veterans were returning, starting families, seeking jobs, or
going to school with federal assistance (funded by the G.I. Bill). Federal aid to education and to
libraries was an important development in the late 1950s and early 1960s through a series of
legislative acts: the National Defense Education Act (1958), the Elementary and Secondary

70

Education Act (1965), and the Library Services Act (1956), which later became known as the
Library Services and Construction Act (LSCA). The Library Services Act (LSA) “authorized a
maximum of $7.5 million a year in federal funds to enable states and territories to extend and
improve public library services in areas with less than 10,000 population” (Frantz & Cohen,
1966, p. 2). Federal funding for school libraries first became available through the National
Defense Education Act (NDEA) of 1958, which was passed by Congress in response to the
launch of Sputnik by the Soviet Union during the previous year (Mathews, 1998). The purpose
of the legislation was to improve U.S. education, especially in the areas of science, mathematics,
and foreign languages to produce a better trained workforce to meet the defense needs of the
country (Michie & Holton, 2005, p. 2). NDEA came at a time of rapid growth in the school
population due to the post-World War II baby boom. As a result, some districts focused their
attention on the construction of new schools and finding qualified new teachers and were able to
give only secondary consideration to the provision of instructional equipment and materials
(Michie & Holton, 2005, p. 2).
Title III of NDEA funded audiovisual materials and equipment, laboratory equipment,
printed materials other than textbooks, and minor remodeling (Hopkins & Butler, 1991, p. 5).
Funds were distributed to states using a formula that considered not only the size of the schoolage population but also the relative income per school-age child within the state. States could
allocate the funds to assist in financing local projects but were required to “match the federal
money on a dollar-for-dollar basis with state and/or local funds” (Michie & Holton, 2005, p. 2).
However, there were restrictions on the housing of materials rather than the selection and
acquisition of materials. NDEA funds could be used to purchase books and other instructional
materials in science, mathematics, and modern foreign languages, but libraries were not

71

specifically mentioned in the legislation. As a result, three major issues arose with regard to the
implementation of NDEA Title III from the perspective of school librarians (Mathews 1998).
First, some school districts did not recognize that the books or materials purchased with NDEA
funds were intended for school libraries and did not house the materials there. Second, some
educators, both school administrators and librarians, saw the school library as having a
supportive role for staff rather than a primary instructional one. Finally, materials selection was
handled inconsistently in some areas, resulting in poor quality. “These issues were later
addressed through program guidelines (U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare,
1967a) as well as a booklet published by the Office of Education (Mahar & Remer, 1965) that
described the ways that school library personnel could assist the Title III program” (Michie &
Holton, 2005, p. 3).
A number of changes were made to NDEA over the years. The 1964 amendments
expanded the content areas in which support could be provided to include history, civics,
geography, English, and reading (Hopkins & Butler, 1991, p. 5). They also contained a provision
for the acquisition of specialized equipment for audiovisual libraries and “the establishment of a
new Title XI for training institutes …to include school library personnel and educational media
specialists” (Hopkins & Butler, 1991, p. 5).
Beginning in 1964, federal support for public libraries was provided through the Library
Services and Construction Act (LSCA). The LSCA promoted interlibrary cooperation and
resource sharing among all types of libraries (Hopkins & Butler, 1991). Similarly, the 1966
amendments to ESEA Title II called for the coordination of Title II programs with those
conducted under LSCA at both the state and local levels (Michie & Holton, 2005, p. 14).

72

All of this funding led to “better stocked book collections in school libraries and major
building projects of public library facilities” (Fitzgibbons, 1989, p. 4). “Cooperation was
mandated in LSCA’s Title III, which provided funding for interlibrary cooperation”
(Fitzgibbons, 1989, p. 4). LSCA’s focus on interlibrary cooperation and resource sharing among
all types of libraries (Michie & Holton, 2005, p. 14) led to the eventual development of library
systems in Illinois. “In many states, regional library networks were established with cooperative
services including book (and other materials) lending and reference services as a result of this
federal legislation and funding” (Fitzgibbons, 1989, p. 4). The LSCA helped establish multi-type
library systems and public library systems and aided in the movement toward regional and
statewide library networks (Farrell, 2012).
The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) of 1965 was part of President
Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society program to improve the quality of life for all Americans, and
libraries were identified and included (Michie & Holton, 2005, p. 3). For the first time, direct
federal assistance for school library resources, textbooks and other instructional materials was
provided by Title II (U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, 1967b). “This
landmark legislation had a broad scope” (Hopkins & Butler, 1991, p. 6). Title II clearly defined
what library resources were: books, periodicals, documents, and audiovisual materials. The
formula to determine this assistance was based on student enrollment numbers in both public and
private schools. Each state seeking funding was required to submit a plan to the U.S. Office of
Education for approval. The state plan was to include the development and revision of standards
relating to defined library resources as well as textbooks, and other printed and published
materials. “Amendments to the legislation in 1966 permitted states to use 5 percent of their
grants, or $50,000, whichever was greater, to finance the administration of the program” (Michie

73

& Holton, p. 3). Many states coordinated their ESEA Title II programs with their NDEA Title III
programs in addition to other federal programs. Louise Sutherland (1970, p. 192), a school
library program specialist at the U.S. Office of Education, described the importance of Title II:
When the monumental Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) was
passed in April 1965, it seemed that the school library would at last have its day
in the sun. Long the stepchild of the library profession, and regarded by some
school administrators as an appendage to the educational process rather than an
integral part, the existence of the school library was formally recognized by the
wording of Title II of the act which made possible a program for making grants
for the acquisition of school library resources, textbooks and other printed and
published instructional materials for the use of children and teachers in public
and private elementary and secondary schools.
During the first three years of ESEA Title II, 12 % of all public schools (11,680 schools)
established a school library (U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, 1971).
Approximately 5.6 million students received school library services in these new centers (Michie
& Holton, 2005). A 1968 survey (U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, 1972)
estimated that ESEA Title II funding had a substantial effect on the establishment and growth of
school libraries. “The survey found that the number of schools with library media centers had
increased dramatically from 52 percent to 85 percent during the period of ESEA Title II funding”
(Hopkins & Butler, 1991, p. 7). ESEA was “credited with having a major impact on the
development of school library media centers throughout the United States” (Hopkins & Butler,
1991, p. 7).
According to the Survey of School Media Standards (Jones, 1977), ESEA Title II also
provided the momentum and the funding for states to develop or revise their standards for school
libraries. Title II administrative funds could additionally be used to fund staff salaries at state
departments of education for those individuals who provided guidance and leadership in the
development of standards (conducting workshops and conferences to inform and interpret the

74

standards). Quantitative standards were reviewed as school media collections grew and school
and district media staffs were added (Jones, 1977). In addition, school district and school media
staff gained new responsibilities as a result of Title II and were expected to serve in leadership
roles in selecting, acquiring, organizing, and using instructional materials (U.S. Department of
Health, Education, and Welfare 1972).
Development of School Libraries: The 1970s to 1980s:
Emergence of the School Library Media Center
The role of the library, public and school, became a hot topic of debate during this
decade. Broderick (1967) relates that “the question of responsibility for library service to
children was raised in the early 1970s after a report submitted by a committee of the New York
State’s Commissioner of Education recommended that all school-aged children be served solely
by school libraries” (as cited in Fitzgibbons, 2000, p. 5). The negative response, as a result of this
statement, in the professional literature and by professional organizations delayed further action
for a time. Fitzgibbons (1989, p. 5) relates that in 1975 the National Commission on Libraries
and Information Science (NCLIS) issued Toward a National Program for Library and
Information Services, which included the following statement: “Despite its fundamental role in
educating the child and in shaping his future information habits, the school library is deficient in
many ways” (NCLIS, 1975, xii).
Although libraries were forming networks in many states between 1970 and the late
1980s, school libraries were often excluded from these partnerships (Fitzgibbons, 1989).
Recognizing this situation, the NCLIS created a task force on school library media centers to
explore why this was occurring. “Its 1978 report, The Role of the School Library Media Program
in Networking, recommended the inclusion of school libraries in statewide networks”

75

(Fitzgibbons, 1989, p. 5). Concurrently, the 1970s Public Library Mission Statement emphasized
cooperation with its school counterparts.
Funding uncertainties presented implementation challenges for school libraries during the
1970s as each state formulated its own goals for dispersal of federal funds, taking into account
minimum standards, quantity and quality of materials and equipment, the need to improve
instruction in the academic subject areas, and the need to support special and experimental
programs (U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, 1975).
Many public libraries began to use a planning and evaluation process rather than either
quantitative or qualitative standards. The Survey of School Media Standards (Jones, 1977) found
that between 1965 and 1974, all 50 states and the District of Columbia had either developed or
revised standards for school library resources in elementary and secondary schools or used the
standards of a professional organization. These standards had to be frequently evaluated and
revised to address the changing needs and use of media. It should be noted that some states had
developed minimum-level as well as advanced-level standards. According to Jones (1977),
ESEA Title II had a major effect on the introduction of a variety of audiovisual and other media
into the classrooms. She suggests that Title II was a factor in the development of standards for
these media. In addition, some states added criteria for selecting materials, such as currency of
information, quality of content, and relevance to the instructional program and educational level
(Michie & Hinton, 2005).
In the Education Amendments of 1974, aid to school libraries was provided under Title
IV, Part B, Libraries and Learning Resources, which combined the former ESEA Title II, school
library resources; the former NDEA, educational equipment; and the former ESEA Title III,
guidance, counseling, and testing (Hopkins & Butler, 1991). In 1978, Title IV, Part B, was

76

renamed Instructional Materials and School Library Resources, and funds under this program
could no longer be used for guidance, counseling, testing, and remodeling. ESEA Title IV, Part
B, funds were distributed on a formula basis.
From the late 1950s up to the 1980s, ESEA had directly funded school libraries. In the
mid-1980s, block grants were used for funding, which generated competition for monies at state
and local levels. Chapter 2 of the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act (ECIA) of 1981
consolidated 32 former categorical programs into a block of funds that could be used for any of
the purposes designated in the prior programs (Michie & Holton, 2005). One of the programs
consolidated into the Chapter 2 block grant was School Library Resources, ESEA, Title IV, Part
B. In the year prior to the implementation of Chapter 2, school library resources represented onethird of the total funding provided through all the programs consolidated into the block grant.
The main goals of Chapter 2 were to improve education, reduce the administrative burden at the
local level, enhance local discretion, provide for the participation of parents and school staff in
the allocation of funds and the development of programs, and ensure the equitable participation
of private school students (Michie & Holton, 2005). Chapter 2 funds were distributed to states on
a formula basis in proportion to their school-age population. States were required to distribute at
least 80 % of their grants to all the districts in the state. Each state was to develop its own
allocation formula based on total district enrollment and the number of students whose education
was more costly than average, such as students from low-income families and students living in
sparsely populated areas. Districts could choose to use their Chapter 2 grants for many purposes,
including library resources. In a study of the implementation of Chapter 2 at the local level
(Michie & Holton, 2005), it was found that in 1984–85 the most common use of Chapter 2 funds
was for computer applications, followed by support for libraries. In addition, in 1984–85, 29 %

77

of the local block grant funds were being used for library/media center support (Michie &
Holton, 2005). From the enactment of ESEA in 1965 until the adoption of ECIA in 1981, federal
categorical programs provided assistance specifically to school libraries. After the enactment of
the Chapter 2 block grant, there were no federal programs that provided assistance specifically to
school libraries. Chapter 2 allowed districts to use the federal money for school libraries but did
not require it (Riddle 1987). According to Hopkins and Butler (1991, p. 34):
When education programs were consolidated, school library media programs became
competitors for funding at the local and state levels with many other programs. Although
many school library media programs received funding in the consolidated laws, the
consolidation of education programs ended the consistent growth of library media
programs throughout the nation. What has resulted is a “haves” and “have-nots”
existence of programs.
The Hawkins-Stafford Elementary and Secondary School Improvement Amendments of 1988
repealed ECIA Chapter 2 and replaced it with Chapter 2 of Title I. In the 1988 legislation, one
area in which assistance could be targeted was the acquisition and use of instructional and
educational materials, including library books, reference materials, computer software and
hardware for instructional use, and other curricular materials. As educational technology evolved
and computers emerged as a driving force in libraries at the end of the 1980s, the need for
information literacy became a major issue for schools. “For example, NCLIS, in cooperation
with the American Association of School Libraries (ASSL), sponsored a conference in 1989 on
the importance of teaching information skills in schools” (Fitzgibbons, 1989, p. 6).

Development of School Libraries: The 1990s to 2000s

78

National and statewide reform efforts during the 1990s centered on educational change.
“There were several national efforts that affected library services: surveys on public and school
libraries (staffing, services, resources) conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics,
a White House Conference on Libraries and Information Services, and a series of forums
sponsored by NCLIS that focused on the federal role for library services for youth” (Fitzgibbons,
1989, p. 6).
Federal support to libraries changed in 1996, when the Library Services and Technology
Act (LSTA) replaced LSCA. Michie and Holton (2005) relate the purposes of LSTA were 1) to
consolidate federal library service programs; 2) to stimulate excellence and promote access to
learning and information resources in all types of libraries for individuals of all ages; 3) to
promote library services that provide all users access to information through State, regional,
national, and international electronic networks; 4) to provide linkages among and between
libraries; and 5) to promote targeted services to people of diverse geographic, cultural, and
socioeconomic backgrounds, to individuals with disabilities, and to people with limited
functional literacy or information skills (P.L. 104-208, Section 212).
LSTA funding is provided to State Library Agencies through a population-based formula.
State Library Agencies may use their appropriations for statewide initiatives and services.
In addition, they may distribute the funds to public, school, academic, research, and
special libraries through competitive sub-grants or cooperative agreements. Funding
priorities are activities that use technology for information sharing and programs that
make library resources more accessible to urban, rural, or low-income residents, and
others who have difficulty using library services. (Michie & Holton, 2005, p. 6)
In February 2001, U.S. Senator Jack Reed, along with Senator Thad Cochran, sponsored
legislation that would provide funding to improve school libraries. This bill recognized the
damage the block grants had on libraries and provided “$500 million for new books and
advanced technology for local school libraries nation-wide, training for librarians and supports

79

that would enable the libraries to stay open for more hours” (Michie & Holton, 2005, p. 21).
Senator Reed expressed the need for this legislation as follows:
Too many books on school library shelves across the country contain harmful stereotypes
and inaccurate material. The reason for this horrible state of affairs is the loss of targeted
national funding for libraries—20 years ago dedicated school library funding was rolled
into a block grant. By block granting funds to the states we abandoned a national
commitment to improving school libraries. (Reed, 2001)
The Reed-Cochran bill, known as the Improving Literacy through School Libraries (LSL)
Program, became part of the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) of 2001 as one of the reading
skills improvement grants. “Local school districts in which at least 20 percent of the students
served are from families with incomes below the poverty line are eligible to apply for grants
under this program” (Michie & Holton, 2005, p. 21). This program helps schools “improve
reading achievement by providing students with increased access to up-to-date school library
materials; well-equipped, technologically advanced school library media centers; and
professionally certified school library media specialists” (U.S. Dept. of Education, 2010).
The last half of the 20th century has seen not only a significant change in the role of the
school library but an evolution in philosophy, standards, and resources.
Since the early 1950s, almost 30,000 new school libraries have been established, and
thousands of federally funded development and collection expansion projects have
enhanced existing libraries in public elementary and secondary schools. At the same time,
school libraries have evolved from having a primary focus on books to providing the rich
array of resources found in the information centers of today. (Michie & Holton, 2005, p.
v)

80

Development of Public School Libraries: Illinois
The development of school libraries in Illinois paralleled that of other states in the early
1800s (Van Oord, 1968). Illinois was admitted to statehood in 1818 and by 1823 had passed an
act to encourage public libraries. “Under this act from 1823 to 1872 individual library
associations were incorporated by act of legislation” (Sharp, 1906, p. 27). The public libraries
referred to were not the free public library of today but rather a corporation or subscription
library.
Reports of the Illinois Superintendent of Common Schools indicate that by 1845 “there
were 21 libraries in 57 counties, due to local effort” (Sharp, 1906, p. 24). The number rapidly
increased and legislation was enacted to allow for the levying of local taxes to support the
creation of libraries within their respective school districts. “Illinois initiated legislation in 1855
and 1857 which provided that local communities could levy a tax to support school libraries if
they wished” (Van Oord, 1968, p. 855). “Most other states had state aid for district libraries but
Illinois adopted the voluntary plan because the State was burdened with debt and because it was
thought better to enlist personal interest” (Sharp, 1906, p. 24). The result of this voluntary
approach was an imbalance in public school libraries throughout Illinois. This inconsistency in
funding continued as the Illinois school law in the late 1800s read in part, “They [the school
board or school directors] may appropriate for the purchase of libraries and apparatus any school
funds remaining after all necessary school expenses are paid” (Sharp, 1906, p. 26). During this
time, tax funds were used to provide equipment rather than library collections. Most Illinois
school libraries received local funding support through fund-raising activities such as box
socials, literary and musical entertainments, and the “proceeds of commencement exercises”
(Sharp, 1906, p. 26; Van Oord, 1968). In 1894, twice the amount of money was spent on

81

apparatus (equipment) as on library books due to increasing science requirements for college
enrollment (Sharp, 1906, p. 26). However, this laissez-faire approach to funding began to change
during the early part of the twentieth century as school curriculum and instructional methodology
required more instructional materials for students beyond the textbooks. School libraries were
beginning to be recognized as an important component in a public school education program as
evidenced by the NEA Library Section (1896), the hiring of the first professionally trained
librarian at a public school, the American Library Association’s formation of a School Library
Section (AASL), and the publication of the Certain Report (Knight & Nourse, 1969; Morris,
2010; Rubin, 2010)
The first library in the city of Chicago was in the first Sunday school organized August
19, 1832, by Luther Childs, Mrs. Seth Johnson, Mrs. Charles Taylor, and the Misses Noble and
Philo Carpenter (Sharp, 1906, p. 35). As the library contained 20 volumes, each of its 13 pupils
and the teacher could “have a book…The poverty of the library was observed by Charles Butler
and Arthur Bronson of New York when visiting Chicago and on their return they sent 200
volumes as a gift” (p. 35). There was no public library in Chicago before the Great Fire of 1871,
although important library collections had been established through private institutions such as
the Chicago Lyceum (1835), Chicago Library Association (1841), Chicago Historical Society
(1856), the YMCA Library (1865), and the Union Catholic Library Association (1868) (Sharp,
1906). It is estimated that when the fire roared through the city in October 1871 between
2,000,000 and 3,000,000 books were burned (Sharp, 1906, p. 36). The loss in school libraries
was placed at $297,800 (p. 36). “From the ashes rose the Illinois Library law of March 7, 1872,
and the Chicago Public Library, founded by gifts from friends in England” (p. 36).

82

Growth was slow for elementary school libraries in Illinois in the early 1920s. However,
a committee of the Illinois Library Association (ILA), chaired by Martha Wilson, adopted the
first state policy for school libraries, A State School Policy for Illinois (1921). The first school
library association was created in 1921 with ILA’s establishment of the Illinois High School
Library Section. The publication in 1925 of Elementary School Library Standards (ALA &
NEA) emphasized the importance of and need for elementary school libraries. This new second
set of standards for school libraries emphasized the role of audiovisual materials in school library
collections, the instructional role of the school librarian in library use and print materials, and
information access for students at the time of need and included a description of a district-level
library supervisor. The standards provided little impact, as there were few elementary school
libraries at this time. However, the late 1920s and early 1930s found a greater interest in
developing school libraries in Illinois as research studies were conducted within the state. Arthur
W. Clevenger and Charles W. Odell are credited with a 1931 study that documented “the larger
the school the greater the likelihood that there was a centralized, catalogued, well-selected
library staffed by at least one professional librarian” (Clevenger & Odell, 1931, p. 18). Little is
known about school libraries in Illinois during the Depression years as no articles appear to have
been published then.
The 1940s were seminal years for school libraries nationally and within Illinois. The
Department of Public Instruction and the Illinois State Library attempted to gather statistical
information concerning school libraries within the state, but the response was too small to
determine any patterns (Van Oord, 1968). A questionnaire from the Illinois Library Association
Junior Members Directory Committee in 1940 surveyed 300 elementary schools outside of
Chicago about library type and staffing (Van Oord, 1968). The publication of national standards,

83

School Libraries for Today and Tomorrow (ALA, 1945), served as the framework for Illinois
school library programs for the next fifteen years. In Illinois, the General Assembly passed the
County Survey Law (1945), which provided for the establishment of the community unit school
district, equal appropriation, and theoretically equal educational opportunity for all school
children (Van Oord, 1968, p. 857). Those districts that could not meet the required minimum
assessment would receive state funding for the difference. No significant studies took place
during this period that indicate the status of elementary and secondary school libraries in Illinois.
“It would seem that consolidation has brought about the improvement of services in such areas
as centralized processing and ordering, the presence of trained librarians and a more equitable
distribution of the available materials” (Van Oord, 1968, p. 858).
Growth in Illinois public school libraries continued throughout the latter half of the 20th
century. Not only did public schools increase from 2,800 in 1953-1954 to 4,000 in 1999-2000,
but the number of students attending schools with library media centers jumped from 68 percent
in 1953-1954 to 98 % in 1999-2000 (Michie & Holton, 2005). Another dramatic increase was the
presence of a librarian in public schools – 56 % of public schools had a librarian in 1953-1954;
in 1999-2000, 85 % of public schools had a librarian (Michie & Holton, 2005). However, in the
late 1950s, Illinois had no state laws or regulations regarding school library materials, service, or
appropriations. “The state employed one full-time professional school library supervisor in the
state department of education. In 1962, Illinois had school library standards that had been
prepared by the state department of education and were a part of the general standards for
schools” (Michie & Holton, 2005, p.66).
Illinois reported that school boards and communities developed a stronger awareness of
the value of formal, organized school library resources as a result of ESEA Title II. In 1966, 91

84

% of eligible public school students participated in ESEA Title II, and 98 % of the acquisitions
money was used for school library resources (Michie & Holton, 2005). Michie and Holton also
state that in 1967 and 1968, 628 new elementary and 99 new secondary public school libraries
were established, while 9,857 public school library collection expansion projects were
undertaken. In 1972, 76 % of the districts in Illinois participated in NDEA; these districts
contained 72 % of the students in the state. By 1974, 5,229 public schools in Illinois participated
in the program, and all of the acquisitions money was used for school library resources, while 86
% of the schools in the state had a school library (Michie & Holton, 2005, p. 66). Between 1996
and 2000, the Illinois State Library, a part of the Department of State, reported offering services
to school library media centers. This assistance has continued in the form of grants (student per
capita), online access, continuing education, resource sharing, and literacy programs (Illinois
State Library, 2014).
Development of State Library Associations: Illinois Library Association
Within the last quarter of the nineteenth century the American Library Association was
organized; “state library associations had been founded, beginning with the New York State
Library Association in 1890 and followed shortly thereafter by the Iowa, Indiana, and Michigan
Library Associations, and schools of library science at universities and colleges had been
established” (Vande Haar, 2005, p. 69). There were also regional organizations and local library
clubs. “But the most effective bodies formed were the state library associations” (Erbes, 1996, p.
5).
Consequently, the first meeting of what was to become the Illinois Library Association
was held November 22-23, 1881 (Sharp, 1906, p. 76). Originally called the Western Library

85

Association (WLA), it met twice in 1881 and again in 1884, both times in Illinois. “William
Frederick Poole, librarian of the Chicago Public Library, was its first president, and the WLA’s
purpose was to promote cooperative purchasing and cataloging. The WLA ceased to exist in
1885, as there are no public records to indicate further meetings” (Illinois Library Association,
2011b, p. 4).
In 1894, Katharine L. Sharp, the Director of the Armour Institute Library School, tried to
interest some library trustees in Chicago in preparing a bill creating a library commission. As
there was no state library association to advocate for this proposal, it was difficult to focus
legislators on its passage. This lack of a voice was noted and proved that an organized
petitioning body was necessary. “Members of the Chicago Library Club recognized that library
organization in other states was enhancing library service, and they began to develop a vision of
what organization could do for the libraries of Illinois” (Erbes, 1996, p. 6). Among these
individuals were Katharine L. Sharp, Director of the Armour Institute Library School; Anderson
H. Hopkins, Librarian at the John Crerar Library; Percy F. Bicknell, Librarian at the University
of Illinois Library; and Dr. G.E. Wire of the Newberry Library. Together, this group prepared a
flier calling for a meeting in Springfield on January 23, 1896. The purpose of the meeting was to
form a state library association. Thirty to forty people interested in library work responded to the
invitation and attended the meeting. At this first meeting it was decided to draft a bill for a
library commission, which resulted in the introduction of House Bill No. 582 on March 1, 1899
(Sharp, 1906). This bill and subsequent legislation were defeated as the legislators were opposed
to more commissions. However, the Information Bureau, a cooperative information service, was
proposed and approved. Headed by Katherine Sharp, it functioned in lieu of a library

86

commission (Erbes, 1996, p. 6). Its purpose was to advise Illinois librarians on library problems
and provide lectures and courses in library curriculum.
Ultimately, the Illinois Library Association was organized in 1896 to promote library
interests throughout the state, and its objectives were threefold: 1) social – the furthering of
general acquaintance among librarians, trustees, teachers, and other persons interested in the
advancement of library influence; (2) educational – the dissemination of practical instruction in
modern library methods and administration; and (3) missionary – the awakening and extension
of general interest in the library and its work and the necessity of aggressive work in its interest
(Erbes, 1996, p. 6). “The idea of state supervision of libraries as an educational institution was
born in Illinois with the foundation of the Association” (Erbes, 1996, p. 7).
A second meeting of the Illinois Library Association was held on November 27, 1896.
“The primary purposes of the meeting were to form a state library commission and to make plans
for a library section of the state teachers association” (Erbes, 1996, p. 7). A meeting was planned
for January 20, 1897, in Springfield to offer the state legislature some type of plan for library
supervision in Illinois. However, few librarians responded, and those who did appeared to have
had little impact on the legislature. In the spring of 1897, approximately one hundred persons
attended a meeting of the Illinois Library Association at the new public library building in
Peoria. This meeting laid plans for a liaison officer to the American Library Association, and a
committee was appointed to act with the Information Bureau, a quasi-state library commission,
to secure statistical data from libraries in the state (Erbes, 1996, p. 8).
Furthering the ILA’s objectives, it was decided that annual conferences and meetings
should be held. Due to the growing size of the association, conference sites were limited and
hosted throughout the state. The Fourth Annual Meeting of the Illinois Library Association was

87

held in Champaign at the new state library building on February 21-22, 1899. Hosting the event
was Katharine Sharp, who had left the Armour Institute Library School to become the director of
the Illinois Library School (today the University of Illinois), and her staff. The ILA meetings of
the early 1900s focused on the technical aspects of librarianship, but a theme of community
assessment and involvement was emerging, particularly a focus on the development of library
service in the State of Illinois. In the May 1902 meeting, the Illinois Library Association
membership voted to incorporate the association under the laws of the state and to seek
endowment to enable the association to do the work of a commission. “Its first directors were
Anderson H. Hopkins of Chicago, Anna E. Felt of Galena, and Katherine L. Sharp of Urbana”
(Sharp, 1906, p. 59).
Throughout its early years, the ILA worked to establish its presence throughout the state.
On July 1, 1909, the Illinois General Assembly passed a bill establishing the Illinois Library
Extension Commission. Its membership consisted of the Secretary of State as the chairman and
two people appointed by the governor, secretary of state, and the superintendent of public
instruction. The purpose of the commission was to “interest cities and communities in
establishing new libraries, to give advice and aid in developing libraries already in existence, and
to establish and oversee a system of traveling libraries” (Erbes, 1996, p. 15). Prior to its creation,
there were 148 free public libraries and 34 subscription libraries in Illinois. During the
commission’s first four years, 27 new libraries were built, three more communities voted in a
library tax, and three subscription libraries opened (Erbes, 1996, p. 15). In subsequent years the
Library Extension Commission cooperated with ILA in securing an increase in the tax levy for
libraries.

88

The 1920s saw an increase in advocacy for all types of libraries by ILA. In 1920 school
libraries were allowed a special session at the annual ILA conference. During that meeting,
school and public librarians discussed cooperation, budgeting, charging systems, and working
with teachers. The group also discussed the formation of a high school library section of the ILA,
but it was decided that no formal organization would be made. In 1921, the ILA voted affiliation
with ALA as a chapter, the General Assembly increased the library tax levy, and the Library
Extension Commission became the Library Extension Division of the Illinois State Library.
The 1922 ILA Conference finally devoted a general session to school libraries. ILA
President J.S. Cleavinger stated that the “state of Illinois was behind some of her sister states in
the matter of school libraries” (Erbes, 1996, p. 25). The Education Committee of the American
Library Association had requested all state associations to gather information on school libraries
and to foster their development. An ILA committee was formed to collect data on Illinois school
libraries and to encourage their further growth. Accordingly, the committee recommended the
establishment of a superintendent of public instruction (1922). The ILA adopted this
recommendation as a resolution mandating an Office of Supervisor of School Libraries. The
following annual ILA Conference (1923) was devoted to the issue of certification, but the
previously requested legislation died in committee. The ILA meetings and conferences
throughout the last half of the decade focused on library legislation (pensions, certification, a
school library supervisor, a county library law, and library funding for adequate resources,
construction, and maintenance) (Erbes, 1996, p. 26).
Over the next fifty years ILA’s mission was funding, advocacy (legislation), and library
administration for all libraries. The needs of public school libraries and librarians were handled
through the Illinois Association of School Librarians (IASL). In 1977, The IASL voted to change

89

the organization’s name to reflect the evolution in school library certification, standards, and
programs (print and audiovisual) and became the Illinois Association for Media in Education
(IAME). ILA’s mission evolved to one of advocacy for public interest, promotion of excellence
and innovation, and flexible management of its resources (all library types). Dissatisfaction with
ILA’s fiscal policies by IAME’s members continued throughout this period and 1981 saw
a continuation and intensification of school librarians’ thoughts that they would be better
served through separation and independence from ILA. A major complaint of the group
was that as long as ILA had its annual conference in the Fall (a long-standing tradition),
school librarians would be denied participation in the Association’s major membership
event. (Erbes, 1996, p. 66)
Beginning in 1984, ILA embarked on an intensive restructuring effort that would make
major philosophical changes in the structure and operation of the Association. “The restructuring
came about as a result of a growing apathy in voting and in selecting candidates, and a sense
among the membership that becoming involved in the organization was virtually impossible”
(Erbes, 1996, p. 71). Concerned that ILA’s new structure and fiscal policies would result in a
loss of autonomy, the members of the Illinois Association for Media Education voted to
withdraw from the Illinois Library Association and to create its own organization devoted solely
to the needs and interests of school librarians and libraries.
Today, the Illinois Library Association serves all librarians throughout the state.
“Reorganized under a new structure in 1989, ILA addresses the overall interests, issues, and
activities of librarians in all types of libraries, which make up the Illinois library community.
Under the new structure, three major association components interact to improve library service
in Illinois: forums, strategies, and functions” (Schultz, 1990, p. 544). The Illinois Library
Association continues as a nonprofit organization serving as the “voice for the interests of
libraries located in Illinois. It provides leadership for the development, promotion, and

90

improvement of library services” (Illinois Library Association, 2011c, p. 4) through a structure
of forums (formerly known as sections) and committees and task forces. All units in the ILA
structure are responsible to the Executive Board that determines policies. The Board’s actions,
however, may be changed by a 2/3 vote of the membership (Illinois Library Association, 2011a,
p. 26). The Executive Board is a governing board, appointing an executive director who is in
charge of the day-to-day running of the association (p. 26). While a school library forum no
longer exists, a representative of the Illinois School Library Media Association serves as a
director-at-large on ILA’s Executive Board. Currently, Becky Robinson, ISLMA’s executive
secretary, is the liaison for the Librarians for Social Responsibility Forum (LSRF). This forum’s
purpose is to promote social responsibility by providing an opportunity for the discussion of the
responsibilities of libraries in relation to the important problems of social change, which faces
libraries and library workers (ILA, 1988b). However, there are no programs or services offered
specifically for school librarians.
Birth of School Library Associations: Illinois High School Council
Regional accreditation associations began to play a major role in school improvements
throughout the United States at the turn of the 20th century. Their activities focused on new
methods of instruction; curricula planning; improving teacher preparation; the selection,
acquisition, and cataloging of instructional materials; and the development of professional
organizations for content-area teachers (English, science, and mathematics) and school
librarians. These changes also occurred in Illinois, which has been a part of the North Central
Association (NCA) since its inception in 1895.

91

The University of Illinois (1896) created a staff position known as the High School
Visitor, who became an official representative of the NCA.
The purpose of the Office was visiting, inspecting, and recommending high schools for
accreditation by the University. Other duties included advising high school personnel
concerning school problems, publishing an annual report and other materials of education
interest, and organizing and conducting the High School Conference. In 1923 the
Superintendent of Public Instruction and the High School Visitor inaugurated a
cooperative program for the recognition and accreditation of Illinois secondary schools.
This cooperation remained in effect until the Office of the High School Visitor was
abolished in 1948. (Cox, 1975, p. vi)
“In 1903 this official urged the president of the University to establish, on a cooperative basis
with the high schools of the state, ways to coordinate, unify, and improve the teaching in subject
matter areas”(Lohrer, 1968, p. 875). This led to the first High School Conference in 1905, which
was held at the University of Illinois. In 1906, University President James appointed the High
School Visitor to head a committee to establish closer relationships between the university and
state high schools. The High School Conferences continued to be held annually at the university
until 1942. With the onset of World War II the conferences were halted, but the office of the
High School Visitor was continued until 1948 (Lohrer, 1968). The Proceedings and Programs of
the conferences, published from 1906 to 1942, included statistical information on attendance,
lists of committees, annual reports of the High School Visitor, curricula, and sectional meetings
reports (Lohrer, 1968).
Seventy-five English and science teachers attended the first High School Conference in
1905. Annual conference attendance continued to expand in subsequent years to include all
secondary subject areas and school libraries and provided the opportunity for articulation
between university and secondary teachers. Eventually sectional groups, such as the Illinois
Association of English Teachers (1908), formed permanent organizations. However, the High
School Library Section was not formed until 1921 under the guidance of Phineas L. Windsor.

92

The new High School Library Section of the High School Conference met for the first time in
November 1922 (Cox, 1975, p. 14). This section adopted a resolution calling for the creation of a
state library supervisor who would be responsible for gathering data related to school library
conditions and to make recommendations on improving and standardizing school libraries
throughout Illinois. The Library Section compiled a book list and published Guide to the
Organization of High School Libraries (1924), which was intended to provide guidance in
developing balanced collections of instructional materials for high school curricula (Cox, 1975,
p. 15). During the 1924 conference, the Library Section also appointed a committee to
investigate the forming of a permanent organization. In 1925, the committee recommended that
the High School Library Section organize as the Illinois Association of High School Librarians
but continue to function as part of the High School Conference (Cox, 1975, p. 15).
Early Development of School Library Associations: Illinois Association for
High School Librarians (IAHSL)
The Illinois Association of High School Librarians was established with annual
membership dues of fifty cents and a membership of twenty. It was also decided that the new
organization should issue some type of publication. Committees were formed to “consider ways
of strengthening the now permanent organization” and to investigate how to “include librarians
in the Illinois state teachers’ pension fund” (Cox, 1975, p. 16) since they were certified teachers
as well as librarians. The association’s first elected officers were Mildred Warren, Mary
Spangler, and Hazel Henderson (Cox, 1975, p. 16).
Conditions in high school libraries continued to be a topic at the association’s annual
meetings throughout the 1920s. Membership increased and the IASHL sought a closer
relationship with the Illinois Library Association (ILA) by appointing a representative to ILA.

93

Phineas L. Windsor, now president of ILA, sought cooperation from the IASHL in 1934
regarding ILA’s plans for certification. The IASHL responded by appointing a legislative
committee to work with ILA’s committee as well as a committee to investigate affiliation with
ILA (Cox, 1975, p. 24). Throughout the 1930s, the IASHL continued to “cooperate with ILA in
the matter of certification” and to revive the pension committee to award school librarians the
same benefits as those other content area teachers received (Cox, 1975, p. 25). By 1939,
legislation by the General Assembly placed school library supervision under the domain of the
State Library (creation of a staff position entitled Field Visitor for School Libraries) and
provided pensions for school librarians. Again cooperation with ILA’s Planning Board
Committee on Library Service to Schools and support for ALA’s proposed school library
publication were urged on the IASHL membership (Cox, 1975, p. 28).
By 1942 IAHSL membership had grown to 97, and the last library meeting associated
with the High School Conference was held, as the Conference was to be discontinued (Cox,
1975). The High School Conference had provided professional development and articulation for
all Illinois teachers. The theme of the association’s program for its last meeting was audiovisual
education and the methods of maintaining audiovisual materials. With the start of World War II
and travel restrictions, IASHL meetings were halted indefinitely. However, during this time
information on legislation, new publications of interest to school librarians, advisory services to
the American Association of School Administrators, and committee work was disseminated
through IASHL’s newsletter School Library Bulletin. IASHL’s meetings resumed in 1947, and
the organization continued to function, becoming a chapter of the American Library Association
in 1951. Its primary focus during this period was its work with the School Library Clinics,
sponsored by the IAHSL, the ILA, and the Illinois State Library. These workshops “were

94

designed to help the teacher-librarian with little or no training and to provide an exchange of
ideas for other librarians” (Cox, 1975, p. 31). Alma Lundeen, the Field Visitor for the Illinois
State Library, reported in a 1947 article in Illinois Libraries that school library service in Illinois
varied “from the best to be found anywhere to practically no service at all” (Cox, 1975, p. 31).
Lundeen noted what had been confirmed in earlier state studies: better facilities and services and
more professionally trained librarians were found in the larger schools. Schools located in the
southern half of the state used the library as a study hall and, particularly those in rural areas,
supplemented their book collections through interlibrary loans from the State Library.
The IAHSL held its first conference after the war in 1947 and again the theme of the
program was audiovisual education, the operation and maintenance of equipment (projectors),
and creation of instructional materials (slides). The latter part of the 1940s saw more attention
given to elementary school libraries, and in 1948, a joint meeting with the Illinois Library
Association resulted in a name change to the Illinois Association of School Librarians (IASL).
With this name change, elementary librarians were invited to join the association (Cox, 1975, p.
33), and IASL became an affiliate of the Illinois Education Association.
Development of School Library Associations: Illinois Association for School Librarians (IASL)
A flurry of activity occurred during the early 1950s. A state school library supervisor was
finally appointed in 1950. “Mildred Nickel was the first Director of School Libraries in the
Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction” (Cox, 1975, p. 34). Active in both the Illinois
Library Association and the Illinois Association of School Librarians, Nickel was a trained and
experienced school librarian. In 1951, a joint conference for the Illinois Library Association and
the Illinois Association of School Librarians took place. ILA’s Executive Board presented a

95

proposal for the affiliation of IASL as a section of ILA. Conference activities focused on
discussion of IASL’s future status. “By a vote of 129 to 93, the Association became a section of
the Illinois Library Association” (Cox, 1975, p. 35). At this time the Illinois Association of
School Librarians changed its “constitution and made plans for two types of conferences – a
spring conference of two to three days for school librarians, and a joint meeting with ILA at the
fall conference” (Lohrer, 1968, p. 881). The first spring conference in April 1952 concentrated
on national and state trends in school library service. By December 1952, the IASL released its
first issue of News for You, a newsletter intended to “inform all school librarians in Illinois of
recent events in the profession” (IASL, December 1952, p. 2). Membership in the IASL had
increased to 570, and Illinois led all other states for membership in the American Association of
School Librarians (AASL) (Cox, 1975, p. 37).
In 1958, Nickel resigned, and the Executive Board of IASL, concerned that her
replacement might be a political appointee rather than a professional librarian, advocated for the
establishment of qualifications for the position. A committee was selected to meet with the
Superintendent of Public Instruction to make recommendations and discuss specific job
requirements.
In 1960, the American Library Association published Standards for School Library
Programs, and the IASL “instituted a program of workshops, consultant services, and speeches
to inform citizens and educators on how to improve school libraries and instructional materials
centers” (Cox, 1975, p. 38). As a result of the new ALA standards, the Association’s Standards
Committee drafted standards for Illinois, which were published as Standards for School Library
Programs in Illinois: A Plan for Implementation in Three Phases (1960).

96

By 1961, relations between the Illinois Library Association (ILA) and the Illinois
Association of School Libraries Section (IASL) were strained. Two areas of difficulty had
developed: finances and the ILA conference program. The IASL found it difficult to live within
the financial constraints imposed on it through its ILA affiliation and found it necessary to
request a special allotment (which was granted). The IASL also was concerned that the ILA had
violated a gentleman’s agreement to reserve the Saturday morning of the annual conference open
for IASL meetings and programs. Margaret Nicholsen moved that the IASL investigate the
advantages and disadvantages of remaining a section of the ILA. The motion carried. Later in the
year, however, when members were asked to vote on remaining a section of ILA, only 21 ballots
of a possible 700 were returned and the Executive Board decided that ILA affiliation would
continue (Erbes, 1996, p. 55).
Besides disseminating the Standards during this time, other board activities included
exploring ways to improve the relationship between the Association and the Illinois AudioVisual Association (IAVA) as well as the approval of a joint compilation of a basic book list by
IASL and the Illinois Reading Service. “The Illinois Reading Service was organized as the
Illinois Pupils’ Reading Circle in 1889 under the auspices of the Illinois State Teachers
Association, which later became the Illinois Education Association, for the purpose of selecting
and making available juvenile books to meet the needs of small rural schools” (Cox, 1975, p.
163). At the IASL section meeting during the ILA conference in October 1966, it was announced
that the superintendent would create an Advisory Committee on Instructional Materials
Certification to “review all aspects of the certification in library science, audiovisual, and
instructional materials” (Cox, 1989, p. 264). Representatives from both the Illinois Association
of School Librarians and Illinois Audio-Visual Association were appointed to the Committee on

97

Instructional Materials Certification. After reviewing and discussing the preparation for the
Standard Special Certificate, the committee recommended a single endorsement in instructional
materials for that certificate. This meant that the Standard Special Certificate would not be
granted to those with only a specialization in library or audiovisual. The IASL Executive Board
endorsed the single instructional materials endorsement. This was in keeping with the current
trend and in the work being done by the American Association of School Librarians (AASL) and
the Department of Audiovisual Instruction (DAVI) in preparing joint standards. However, a
group of IAVA members submitted a request for an audiovisual endorsement for the Standard
Special Certificate, and when the Certification Board met, it approved two endorsements for the
Standard Special Certificate: one for audiovisual and one for instructional materials. Surprised
by the Certificate Board’s decision, the IASL Board then formulated and presented a proposal
for a library science endorsement for the Standard Special Certificate. The IASL request was
tabled, and not until April 1968 did the Certification Board approve the Standard Special
Certificate for School Library Specialist. The IASL continued to support the unified concept of a
single endorsement in instructional materials and in 1977 appeared before the Certification
Board to again present its recommendation for unified certification. The Certification Board
adopted a single endorsement in media (instructional materials) for the Standard Special
Certificate, which became effective on September 1, 1978 (Cox, 1989, p. 264).
The Executive Board of IASL also endorsed a status study of Illinois school libraries,
which was announced at the 1967 conference. “Preparation for a 1970 joint conference with the
Illinois Audio Visual Association and the Illinois Association for Supervision and Curriculum
Development was a frequent item on the agenda for the business meetings of the Executive

98

Board of IASL in 1968” (Cox, 1975, p. 42). Both the IASL and IAVA boards agreed to send
representatives to these meetings.
The ISLA and IAVA continued to work together and in 1969 established a joint
committee to work on a program for implementation of the Standards for School Media
Programs (1969), which had been jointly prepared and published by the American Association
of School Librarians (AASL) and the Department of Audiovisual Instruction (DAVI). Further
collaboration occurred within the state when three associations – the Illinois Association of
School Librarians (ASL), the Illinois Association of Supervision and Curriculum Development
(IASCD), and the Illinois Audio-Visual Association (IAVA) – participated in an April 1970 joint
conference. This conference became known as the Triple I (Cox, 1975, p. 43). A second Triple I
Conference was held in April 1972, and the final draft of the new, jointly developed Standards
for Educational Media Equipment, Materials, and Personnel was presented and approved by
both the Illinois Audio-Visual Association and the Illinois Association of School Librarians.
Valerie Downes, Director of Media and Library Services of the Office of the Superintendent of
Public Instruction, announced that her office would publish and mail the newly developed
standards publication with Title II Applications (Cox, 1975, p. 45). The standards were later
published under the title Standards for Educational Media Programs in Illinois (Illinois State
Superintendent of Public Instruction, 1972). Throughout 1972, the IASL Standards Committee
conducted statewide workshops on the implementation of the standards (Cox, 1989, p. 263).

Illinois Association for Media Education (IAME)
Through its executive board, regional structure, publications, conferences, and liaisons
with other associations and organizations, the Illinois Association of School Librarians promoted

99

the concept of the school library media program as an educational force (Cox, 1989, p. 263). In
1977 the IASL changed its name to the Illinois Association for Media in Education (IAME) to
reflect the evolution of the library to the library media center, combining both print and non-print
resources (Cox, 1989, p. 263). Standards for Library Media Programs in Illinois (Illinois State
Board of Education), based on the national Media Programs: District and School, were also
issued in 1976. Additionally, the Illinois State Board of Education published Recommended
Standards for Educational Library Media Programs in Illinois (1983) based on the 1976
standards and input from IAME and Illinois Association for Educational Communications and
Educational Technology (IAECT), formerly IAVA. These standards were reprinted in 1986 with
minor changes.
Subsequently in 1976, the Superintendent of Education implemented an advisory
committee called the Media Library Advisory Council. Its purpose was to discuss and make
recommendations in such areas as standards, certification, and federal funding. The council
prepared a job description for library media specialists in 1986 and announced future projects
such as library information skills, learning assessment plans, and marketing strategies for library
media programs.
As noted earlier, while the Illinois Library Association and the Illinois Association for
Media in Education worked cooperatively on conference meetings, workshops, projects, library
legislation, and library funding, administrative relations between the organizations had often
been strained. Soon after affiliation in 1952, two sensitive areas in IAME-ILA relations
appeared: dues allotment and the ILA conference programs, particularly reserving Saturday for
school librarians (Cox, 1989, p. 269).

Another contentious issue between the two organizations was the proposal for an ILA
secretariat in 1971. The IASL Board at that time recommended that the proposal not be accepted
but that ISAL would continue as a section of ILA. ILA membership voted to accept the
secretariat proposal.
The ILA dues structure continued to be an ongoing issue, which created discord between
the former IASL and the new IAME. The lack of IAME representation in the leadership of ILA
added fuel to the fire. All of these issues were frequently discussed at IAME board and
membership meetings. The discussions were heated, the relationship with ILA was questioned,
and it was suggested that IAME withdraw from ILA, as it was not responsive to IAME’s needs.
The idea of forming an independent organization was considered.
Relations were further strained in 1983 when the ILA Executive Board again made
changes in the fiscal policies, requiring all workshop and conference registrations be made
directly with ILA, all sections to turn over all their funds to ILA for management, and all section
expenditures be subject to a ten percent surcharge (Cox, 1989, p. 269). The IAME Board
discussed the new fiscal policies and expressed concern over IAME’s loss of financial autonomy.
A survey of IAME members indicated opposition to giving full control of IAME funds to ILA.
Again it was suggested (IAME president and members) that IAME withdraw from ILA and form
a new association (Cox, 1989, p. 269). However, not all of the IAME Board agreed with this
suggestion. Don Adcock, IAME President-elect, tried to clarify the areas of concern to the IAME
membership in the newsletter News For You. He stated:
Even though searches of the archives of IAME and ILA were unable to locate an
agreement related to IASL becoming a section of ILA, I do believe that such an
agreement was reached. At that time according to the ILA Record, IASL would receive
seventy-five cents of the $2.00 ILA annual dues for each of its members and would be
able to maintain its own treasury. (Adcock, 1983, p. 8)

101

He related that ILA was mandating IAME to deposit its funds in ILA accounts to comply with
federal law related to ILA’s and IAME’s tax exempt status. Compliance did not jeopardize
IAME’s access to its funds because “according to current ILA Board policy, no expenditures
may be made from IAME accounts without the approval of the IAME president or treasurer”
(Adcock, 1983, p. 8). In his opinion IAME would “still maintain its own treasury even though it
no longer maintained its own bank accounts” (Adcock, 1983, p. 8).
Discussion of the new fiscal policies continued into the fall of 1983. While stating it was
not in IAME’s best interests to comply, the board reaffirmed the decision of its members to
affiliate with ILA and felt the two associations could continue to work together to promote the
cause of libraries and librarianship. Adcock (1983) advocated:
I feel that the leaders of IAME must make clear that we are a voluntary organization
dedicated to the improvement of school library media programs and one which offers
opportunities for professional development and continuing education. Although the
function of our organization is different than IEA [Illinois Education Association] and
IFT [Illinois Federation of Teachers], it is important to the profession and is deserving of
the support of school library media specialists….The development of a third association,
I feel, is not a viable solution. To establish a new association would fragment the
leadership of the profession and insert a divisive element into the profession, which
would inhibit the improvement of school library media services in the state. (p. 8)
In 1987 ILA again presented its restructuring plan, which would replace the present sections with
forums. “Each forum would have only one elected officer, a coordinator, who would have full
responsibility for getting things done” (Cox, 1989, p. 269).
Concerned that substituting forums for sections would “eliminate the opportunity for
leadership development that occurs at the section level” and limit services to members, IAME
board members again discussed withdrawing from ILA. ILA membership initially voted against
the restructuring plan at the May 1988 annual membership meeting, but ILA leadership
resubmitted the plan in a mail vote and it was approved.

102

Aware that the future of IAME was in limbo, in 1987 a group of IAME members formed
a new association, the Illinois School Library Media Association (ISLMA), designed to solely
serve the needs of the school library profession in Illinois. The history of this organization will
be fully chronicled in Chapter 5.
Birth of the Audio-Visual Association: Illinois Audio-Visual Association
A group of audiovisual directors concerned with using audiovisual materials in education
formed the Illinois Audio-Visual Association (IAVA) in 1949. The membership included
educators working in audiovisual programs in educational systems as well as those involved in
commercial audiovisual work in Illinois. During the early years of the association, the late forties
and early fifties, the association’s founders were concerned with defining the profession by
establishing certification standards for the fledgling audiovisual field (Elwell, 1990, p. 546).
Sputnik’s launch in 1957 sparked a major change in education with the passage of the National
Defense Education Act. These were exciting times for the audiovisual field as the use of
audiovisual equipment and materials gained acceptance within the teaching profession. Societal
changes throughout the 1960s fueled IAVA’s growth and sphere of influence.
With the advent of the seventies, IAVA’s focus shifted again to identifying, recruiting,
and training leaders from its membership (Elwell, 1990, p. 546). For this purpose, the IAVA
conducted its first statewide leadership conference at Northern Illinois University’s Lorado Taft
Field Campus in Oregon, Illinois. Subsequently, the 1980s brought even greater change in
education with the birth of the microcomputer. Once again IAVA found itself adapting to an
ever-changing field. Reflecting the fast-paced and constantly evolving field of educational
technology, IAVA decided on a new identity to reflect its new role and became the Illinois

103

Association of Educational Communications and Technology (IAECT) in 1979. This name
change reflected IAECT’s affiliation (1979) with the national organization, Association for
Educational Communications and Technology (AECT), formerly the Department of Audiovisual
Instruction (DAVI) and a section of the National Education Association (NEA).
Development of an Educational Technology Association: Illinois Association of Educational
Communication and Technology (IAECT)
The Illinois Association for Educational Communications and Technology (IAECT) has a
long history of providing leadership and service to the media profession in the state of Illinois
(Elwell, 1990, p. 546). IAECT is dedicated to the improvement of teaching and learning through
the effective use of media, technology, and telecommunications. Started in 1949 as the Illinois
Audio Visual Association, the IAECT is continuing to provide members with information on
advances in the media and technology field and it provides a venue for professional development
and a voice for its membership (AECT, 2013). The association is continually challenged to keep
its membership current with media and technology changes. (IAECT, 2014).
As related earlier, IAECT is an affiliate of the Association for Educational
Communications and Technology (AECT). AECT is an academic and professional association
dedicated to the effective use of technology to improve learning (AECT, 2013). Members
provide leadership in the field by promoting scholarship and best practices in instructional
technology. AECT publishes two bi-monthly journals: Tech Trends (for practitioners in teaching
and learning) and Educational Technology Research and Development (a scholarly research
publication) as well as three online journals: International Journal of Designs for Learning, The
Journal of Applied Instructional Design, and The Journal of Formative Design in Learning.

104

AECT also sponsors the International Student Media Festival (ISMF) and an annual academic
conference.
Similar to IAECT, AECT's membership has dropped considerably, from over 12,000 in
the mid-1980s to about 2,000 today. Like many nonprofit academic and professional
associations, AECT's membership has suffered through tough economic times and competition
from newer organizations and technology conferences. The organization has its origins in
traditional audiovisual design and development. AECT and its related academic fields place the
emphasis on theory rather than on physical technology. This was symbolized with the removal of
the production division of AECT in the 1990s; the division was previously home to anyone who
would produce or develop the actual technology used in application of theory. The organization
has since reinstated this division, which is currently named the MultiMedia Production Division
(AECT, 2013).
This chapter summarized the birth and development of school libraries, professional
standards, and library and audiovisual associations both nationally and locally. These
developments helped shape not only school libraries in Illinois but also the first professional
library organization in the state dedicated solely to school librarianship, the Illinois School
Library Media Association (ISLMA). ISLMA was formed to foster and improve school library
media service in Illinois and to cooperate with other library and educational organizations to
meet their information needs. ISLMA eventually replaced the Illinois Association for Media in
Education (IAME), a section of the Illinois Library Association (ILA), which became a forum
with greatly reduced independence when ILA restructured in 1988. Chapter 5 will examine
ISLMA’s development over the last twenty-five years through the eyes and voices of its founders
and leaders.

	  

CHAPTER 5
DEVELOPMENT OF THE ILLINOIS SCHOOL LIBRARY MEDIA ASSOCIATION
We want ISLMA to be the vehicle for advancing the school library media profession in
the state of Illinois and we believe that you must be involved in fueling that vehicle.
(Maynard, ISLMA News, October 1988, p. 1)
At the 1988 Illinois Association for Media in Education’s (IAME) annual conference, the
decision was made to form a new Illinois school library association. This was significant because
it represented the IAME membership making a dramatic shift in its dealings with the Illinois
Library Association (ILA).2 By approving the disbandment of IAME as a sub-section of ILA, the
Friends of School Libraries, a group of concerned IAME members, were recognizing their
responsibility for determining and overseeing the needs of school library media specialists in
Illinois. This simple procedural action would produce multiple ramifications for ISLMA as it
sought national recognition and accreditation from the American Association of School
Librarians (AASL), the American Library Association (ALA), and the overall education of
school librarians. This chapter will explore the first 25 years of ISLMA’s organization leadership, initiatives, funding, and advocacy.

New Beginnings: The Friendly Librarians - Friends of School Libraries 1987-1988
The Executive Board of the Illinois Association for Media Education (IAME) met at the
Library Book Selection Service in Bloomington, Illinois, on November 21, 1987, for its quarterly
meeting chaired by President Fran Corcoran. Present at this meeting were the following voting
members: Kay Maynard, President-elect; Elaine Roth, Past President and Long Range Planning
Committee Chair; Pamela Kramer, Secretary; Carol Morrison and Jackie Plourde, Members-atLarge. Non-voting members who attended included Esther Baker, Revisionist; Nancy
Bloomstrand, Parliamentarian; Carol Fox, Rebecca Caudill Award Chair; Meg Gibb,
Membership Co-Chair; Larry Johnson, IAECT President-elect (guest); Charles Rusiewski, Editor
News for You; Marie Sivak, Illinois State Board of Education representative; Becky Trewartha,
Regional Co-Coordinator; and Joyce Kelly, Guest.
At this November 21, 1987, meeting, Larry Johnson, President-elect of IAECT, indicated
that his Board was interested in joint activities with IAME, which could include participation in
joint conferences. Johnson shared that IAECT had appointed a committee of its members to
consider joint activities with IAME and he hoped that IAME would consider a similar action.
Marie Sivak, Illinois State Board of Education (ISBE) representative, presented the objectives
for the Illinois Certification test in library media. After July 1, 1988, anyone seeking library
media certification in Illinois would need to take this test (IAME Minutes, 1987, p. 3).
IAME Past President Elaine Roth shared her report on the ILA leadership retreat held at
Pheasant Run, St. Charles, Illinois, on October 22-24, 1987. Included in the retreat were
meetings of the ILA Board committees, a strategic planning session with consultant Michael
Rippey, an executive session of the 1987 Board, and a day and a half long meeting of the 1987
Board (Roth, IAME Minutes, 1987, p. 1). As IAME’s representative to ILA, Roth related

107

consultant Michael Rippey’s restructuring draft plan for ILA, which was “similar to, but not
exactly the same as, the one sent to the IAME Board by President Fran Corcoran” (Roth, 1987,
p. 2). She cited ILA’s reasons for restructuring:
•
•
•
•
•
•

ILA is currently in good financial condition.
ILA structure is unviable due to the proliferation of units.
ILA has been an “institutions” rather than a “librarians” association.
ILA wants to be proactive.
ILA wants to retain the units but maintain the association’s commonality.
ILA wants to promote understanding among the various parts of the library
community. (p. 2)

Roth, who also served as IAME’s Long Range Planning Chair, related, “Currently, ILA
must support each unit’s structure, its accounts, registrations, by-laws, etc. According to Mr.
Rippey, the current structure is more like a multi-million dollar corporation than a professional
association” (Roth, 1987, p. 3). Roth continued to outline the draft proposal provisions for board
leadership, transition from sections and round-tables to a forums structure, and funding and
noted, “There was little discussion of how the activities would be put in place. Conversations
with members and officers of many sections and round-tables indicate that there are many
questions and considerable dissatisfaction with the draft proposal” (p. 4). Roth recommended, in
her role as Long Range Planning Chair, that a meeting of past IAME leaders (Leadership Forum)
be held in December 1987 to review the IAME membership survey results and discuss their
implications for future planning (p. 3).3
The Leadership Forum met on December 29, 1987, at the Cultural Center (Chicago
Public Library) in Chicago to discuss the rationale for the development of the ILA restructuring
survey for the IAME membership. Ranging from president of the organization to committee
chairs, IAME President-elect Kay Maynard invited the following to participate in this Forum
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	   	  
3	  Earlier

in 1987, IAME’s Long Range Planning Committee had circulated a survey about the ILA restructuring
proposal to its membership.	  

108

based on their leadership roles in IAME during the past four years: Don Adcock, Jerry Wicks,
Ann Montgomery Tuggles, Bernadette Winter, Fran Corcoran (IAME President), Elaine Roth
(IAME Past President), Carol Fox, Dolores Deitrick, Esther Baker, Joyce Karon (IAME
Secretary), Helen White, Flo Lattimer, Ray Bouma, Pamela Kramer (IAME Board Member),
Kek Robien, Carol Morrison, Mary Downing, Kathy Shannon, Marian Engel, Nancy Klinka,
Thelma Griffin, Doris Masek, Sara Ellen Long, and Nancy Bloomstrand (IAME Minutes,
December 29, 1987, p. 1). Corcoran and Roth clarified ILA’s restructuring proposal in regard to
IAME’s move from a section to a forum. ILA stipulated that the forums would not collect dues,
maintain their finances, elect officers or develop by-laws, or have any political activities in ILA.
Each forum would elect a chairman, there would be a 17-member Board of Directors elected
from the membership at large, and the Board might elect its own officers or the officers might be
elected by the membership at large. “The ILA Board of Directors would set the direction of the
organization” (IAME, 1987, p. 2).
Survey data (IAME Minutes, December 29, 1987, p. 3) were shared and the issues
identified by the membership regarding IAME’s relationship to ILA were presented:
•

Strengths in ILA membership
Legislative power through strength in numbers
Communication with all types of libraries and librarians
Networking with the larger, library community
Seat on the ILA Board
Appearance of unified library opinion

•

Concerns about ILA membership
Special needs of school library media professionals
Lack of respect for IAME, the largest ILA unit
Proposed new structure
Loss of financial control and autonomy
Financing and levying of 10% surcharge on dues structure
Restructuring limitations on leadership growth and grass root support
Handling of ILA funds – control and distribution

109

Lack of conference programming for school librarians
Impact of excessive ILA dues on IAME membership
Lack of communication between organizations
Fragmented special interest groups
Lack of trust with ILA office
•

Better relationships could be established by:
Identifying ILA and IAME are equal partners
Recognizing that IAME is a vitally important part of ILA
Less controls – more IAME autonomy
IAME control of organization’s finances
Separating from ILA and forming a new association
Recognizing that each section has needs, strengths, and differences
Capitalizing on the differences for a strong ILA

•

Alternatives:
Dissolve the affiliation with ILA
Form a strong, independent organization
Affiliate with AASL, IAECT or other ILA sections
Communicate IAME concerns to ILA and work for a sensible structure
Remain part of ILA and compromise
Remain part of ILA and reject the proposed forums structure
Determine appropriate organizational structure to meet IAME needs

The discussion of the survey was lengthy and comprehensive. IAME was, according to
the membership of that group, the only organization that was not a separate unit from the state
library association. The minutes state, “The question is not what to do about ILA, but how to
improve IAME for the school librarians so they may better serve the school children” (IAME
Minutes, December 29, 1987, p. 4). President-elect Kay Maynard advised the Leadership Forum
of the appointment of an ad-hoc task force as directed by the Executive Board. The task force
was to meet with a tax consultant, an attorney, and management consultant to gather information
about possible withdrawal from ILA. The information collected would be part of the basis for
any decision on the future structure of the school librarian organization (IAME, December 29,
1987, p. 4).

110

In the subsequent discussion of a new structure, the consensus of the Leadership Forum
was that the “needs of the membership have been identified by the survey, and the structure of
the organization must focus on providing for those needs, whether within the framework of ILA
or in the creation of a separate organization” (IAME Minutes, December 29, 1987, p. 4). If those
needs would be better served by an organization not affiliated with ILA, it “was the consensus of
the Forum to proceed in establishing a separate organization. However, the rationale of this
position should be carefully delineated and presented to the entire membership of IAME”
(IAME, December 29, 1987, p. 4). Sara Long Anderson relates:
I remember sitting at the Chicago Cultural Center on December 29, 1987 – meeting to
explore the direction of the existing organization and its relationship to the Illinois
Library Association. We had been talking about this for three years - the idea of forming
a separate organization was being batted around on a regular basis. Historically, ILA has
been predominantly an organization with a focus towards public libraries and school
librarians were becoming frustrated with that. I met a friend after the meeting and I said,
‘do I look any different, I’ve been a rebel rouser of the highest level because we took a
vote.’ Now, we took a vote that we were going to recommend that we become a separate
organization and do that at the IAME spring conference held March 3-5. (Anderson,
interview 2012)
The IAME Executive Board discussed the recommendations of the Leadership Forum at
the January 23, 1988, meeting. Nancy Bloomstrand, President-elect, presented a written report
from the ad hoc Committee of Consultants and made the recommendation “that the ad hoc
committee meet with all three firms” to gather answers to the survey’s developed questions
(IAME Minutes, 1988, p. 7). The Board discussed the possibility of holding a special meeting at
the Triple I Conference, a bi-annual joint conference sponsored by the Illinois Association of
Media Education (IAME), the Illinois Association of Supervision and Curriculum Development
(IASCD), and the Illinois Audio-Visual Association (IAVA) to discuss the committee’s findings.
Pamela Kramer moved “that the IAME Voting Board hold a special board meeting, Thursday,

111

March 3, from 1:00-4:00 p.m. for the purpose of discussing the Long Range Planning Committee
information” (IAME, 1988, p. 7).
As stated above, three organizations – the Illinois Association of Media Education
(IAME, formerly the Illinois Association of School Librarians), the Illinois Association of
Supervision and Curriculum Development (IASCD), and the Illinois Audio Visual Association
(IAVA) – participated in a bi-annual joint conference, which became known as the Triple I. The
IAME Executive Board held a special meeting on March 3, 1988, at the Triple I Conference at
Oak Brook Hills Conference Center in Oak Brook, Illinois. The purpose of the meeting was to
discuss the findings of the Long Range Planning Committee. This meeting was held at 1:15 p.m.
prior to the regularly scheduled Executive Board meeting at 4:30 p.m. Typically each
organization participating in the conference held a business meeting during the event. IAME
President Kay Maynard called the meeting to order by reminding the members present that the
purpose of the meeting was to hear a final report from the Ad-Hoc Long Range Planning
Committee and the Ad-Hoc Committee on Consultants. Any other items of business would be
postponed until the regular meeting at 4:30 p.m.
Elaine Roth, Long Range Planning Committee Chair, reviewed the committee’s task and
activities to date. She stated that the committee would meet on March 4 (the following day) to
formulate a recommendation. “This recommendation will be based on the results of the IAME
membership survey and the December Leadership Forum” (IAME Special Meeting Minutes,
1988, p. 1). President-elect Nancy Bloomstrand reported that the Committee on Consultants had
met with two of the three consultants on February 26, 1988. Both consultants’ findings (p. 2)
were similar:
•

The organization could incorporate under a different name.

112

•
•
•
•
•
•

The not-for-profit status (501c and 501c6) would depend on the stated purpose of the
organization.
The current organizational structure was acceptable.
The current (IAME) funds belonged to ILA.
The process of incorporation was a fairly simple process.
The obtaining of not-for-profit status might require specialized help.
IAME did not exist as a legal entity because it was never incorporated.

After hearing the report from the committee, discussion ensued about ILA’s request that
IAME “develop a significant program for the next year. The programs should be defined enough
to identify seed money necessary to continue planning and development; and some dates and
times of programs to be held” (IAME Special Meeting Minutes, March 3, 1988, p. 2). Board
members questioned the time allotted for the development of such a plan. The Board discussed at
length the role of the IAME Board after the ILA restructuring, and it was “generally felt that the
IAME Board will cease to function if the restructuring passes” (IAME Special Meeting Minutes,
1988, p. 2). The Board also questioned the financial situation of IAME if the restructuring were
to pass and whether it was appropriate to approve a transitional plan. The Board decided that
“until the restructuring plan passes, the business of the Association should continue” (p. 3). Due
to the uncertainty of the situation and numerous unanswered questions, the Board did not take
any action.
Twenty minutes after the adjournment of IAME’s Special Executive Board meeting,
interested school librarians, invited by word of mouth, gathered to discuss a future professional
school library organization. This group of concerned school librarians referred to themselves as
“The Friends of School Libraries.” Becky Trewartha, IAME Treasurer, remembers:
We needed to keep the integrity of the group and the reputation, the name of the group;
we needed to keep it clean. We needed to make sure everything was above board, that no
one could ever question whether we had done anything illegally. I remember very, very
specifically that when we dissolved [IAME Special Executive Meeting], when we broke
up, we purposefully broke off the meeting of the IAME Board and then stopped, walked

113

across to the other side of the room, literally, and got together as a group of people
interested in the future of school librarianship in Illinois and said, “okay, let’s get
together and form this new group.” So I mean we didn’t even stay at the same tables as I
recall. (Trewartha, interview 2010)
The Friends of School Libraries meeting was called to order at 3:05 p.m. by Kay
Maynard, acting chair. The following proposal was presented:
•

•
•
•
•
•

•
•
•

That charter members of the new school library organization file for incorporation
under the name Illinois School Library Media Association (ISLMA) by March 15,
1988.
The purpose of the association was to be stated in the present organization by-laws.
The charter dues structure was outlined.
The elected officers of IAME would continue in their present offices as the ISLMA
Board.
The elected IAME Board would resign en masse as officers of IAME before July 15,
1988.
Kay Maynard, the current president of IAME, would be the new president of ISLMA
and would receive a platinum charter membership and serve as ISLMA’s
representative to AASL.
The ISLMA charter board would serve until July 1, 1989.
ISLMA charter members would hold membership until July 1, 1989.
Current IAME members who chose to join ISLMA would have their charter
membership dues reduced.

Elaine Roth moved that “this group of friendly librarians accept the proposal as presented and
become, as of March 3, 1988 at 3:15 p.m., the Illinois School Library Media Association”
(Friends of School Libraries Meeting Minutes, 1988, p. 2). The motion was unanimously
approved. As Roth recalls,
I remember that meeting of the “friendly librarians” so named in order to make it clear
that IAME was not a rebel group but that we were creating an entirely new organization.
We went over all the old, familiar stuff, and then Elaine Knight, a young librarian, whom
none of us old-timers knew, got up and gave us just the pep talk we needed. She let us
know that librarians we’d never heard from did recognize and understand the difficulties
and problems we had encountered and continued to face. And, as they say, the die was
cast. (ISLMA News, October 1997, p. 3)
Immediately, motions were presented and carried creating the new organization’s
committee structure, applying for AASL affiliate status, scheduling a fall conference, drafting a

114

letter of explanation concerning the new organization (ISLMA) for IAME membership, and
directing the treasurer to establish the necessary banking account to transact association business
(Friends of School Libraries Meeting Minutes, 1988, p. 2). The meeting lasted a total of 70
minutes and adjourned so all could attend the IAME business meeting at 4:30 p.m. As Kay
Maynard relates, “It was frightening and exciting and encouraging all at the same time because it
was a group effort” (Maynard, interview 2012). It was decided that the ISLMA Executive Board
would meet the following day, March 4, to discuss the new organization’s structure.
Thus, on March 3, 1988, the Friends of School Libraries, a group of Illinois school
library media specialists, established the Illinois School Library Media Association (ISLMA) to
“foster and improve school library media service to the state of Illinois, to interpret the value of
this service, and to cooperate with other library and educational organizations in meeting
information needs” (ISLMA Press Release, March 1988, p. 1). Its intention was to replace the
Illinois Association for Media in Education (IAME), a section of the Illinois Library Association.
The ISLMA founders’ purpose was to continue providing professional educational opportunities
in conferences and workshops as well as other similar activities such as awards, scholarships,
and recognition for retirees; improvements in certification and standards requirements for school
libraries; activities to ensure intellectual freedom; public recognition of the importance of school
libraries and certified personnel; passage of beneficial school library legislation by the state;
input to the Illinois State Board of Education, to the American Association of School Libraries
(AASL), and to state educational organizations; and activities to meet the professional needs of
non-members (ISLMA Press Release, March 1988). ISLMA was founded to “serve the specific
needs of school library media professionals” (ISLMA Press Release, 1988, p. 2). The elected

115

officers of the Illinois Association of Media in Education (IAME) would continue in their offices
as the ISLMA Board of Directors for eighteen months.
The Friends of School Libraries, the founding members of ISLMA, were Esther Baker
(now deceased), Nancy Bloomstrand, Christa Even, Lois Farrell Fisher, Dale Guthrie, Ken
Hawley, Barb Inbody, Joyce Karon, Joyce Kelly (now deceased), Pamela Kramer, Floy Latimer
(now deceased), Lee Logan, Sara Ellen Long (Anderson), Kay Maynard, Carol Morrison, Kek
Robien, Joan Roeder, Elaine Roth, Charles Rusiewski, Becky Trewartha (now deceased), Pat
Wandling, Roma Weir, Helen White, Jerry Wicks (now deceased), and Bernadette Winter.
Pamela Kramer relates that the decision was not made lightly. As she remembers,
We [IAME members] wanted to do a conference and ILA took so much off the top for
conference registration, we felt we couldn’t raise any money. School librarians weren’t
getting any support. I just remember this extreme level of frustration. But I also
remember when we sat in that room for our IAME meeting at the Triple I Conference; it
was an extremely scary moment when we took that vote to break off. I felt it in the pit of
my stomach. What are we doing? And it wasn’t that I felt it about the profession, but
you’re jumping off a cliff here, your name’s on this, what’s going to happen. And yet it
was absolutely the right thing to do. (Kramer, interview 2010)
When asked who influenced ISLMA history – all interviewees responded “Elaine Roth.”
IAME/ISLMA President-elect Kay Maynard related:
Elaine Roth had been the treasurer of ILA and was a past president of IAME [1986] and
had our best interests at heart. But she was very upset at what was happening at ILA and
what would happen to us. So at Triple I she proposed that we make this move. It was a
very tense situation – after much discussion. Had Elaine not stepped forward at that
conference and said we must do something and we must do something now I don’t think
it would have happened. She was instrumental in moving it forward. (Maynard, interview
2011)
The IAME Executive Board met on March 3, 1988, at 4:30 p.m. President Kay Maynard
called the annual meeting to order and agenda items were presented. The meeting minutes note
the creation of a Transitional Forum Team. Carol Morrison volunteered to serve on it with “the
understanding that it is a liaison position” (IAME Minutes, March 3, 1988, p. 6). The proposal

116

from Larry Johnson, President-elect of IAECT, to consider the development of joint activities
between IAME and IAECT was reviewed. Though IAECT had already appointed a committee to
pursue these activities, it was moved that “any discussion of this matter be tabled” (ISLMA, p.
6). In a letter to Pat Wandling, IAME/ISLMA President Kay Maynard wrote, “The IAME Board
voted to move toward formal dissolution of IAME. The process will include a vote of the IAME
membership, a formal request to the ILA Board, and a vote of the ILA membership which should
occur at the ILA Conference in April 1989” (Maynard, 1988, p.1). It was determined that both
organizations would continue until that vote. Lois Farrell Fisher relates,
I remember the meeting of “friendly librarians” that included laughter and tears, fear, and
excitement. We had had one foot in the air for some time, but at that meeting, we lifted
the other foot and came down on solid, but unfamiliar ground, confident that we were
doing the right thing. I remember Joyce Karon trying to take notes for two organizations
at the same time, with all of us grouped around a big, square table. I remember running
around the hotel to get champagne and glasses to toast our new organization and our
future. (ISLMA News, October 1997, p. 2)
Bernadette Winter, former IAME president (1984) and ILA Executive Board member
(1984-1985), was asked to present the motion for withdrawal from ILA to the IAME
membership. As she remembers,
A small group met at an IAME conference and decided it was time that we became an
independent group and I was kind of the grand old lady at that point and was asked to
present this proposal at the IAME Membership Meeting…I had notes, handwritten on
hotel stationery and it’s odd, but I even remember what I wore, but that’s insignificant.
That was a significant day for me and for the profession. It was only about a ten-minute
presentation and the group unanimously, almost unanimously, approved it. So that was
our beginning. (Winter, interview 2010)
Kek Robien, IAME Board member, relates:
I recall we were all unsettled, afraid, apprehensive, uncertain but undaunted – that we had
done the right thing. My most vivid recollection is of Kay Maynard being totally amazed
at what had transpired but being confident as we forged ahead to new challenges. I often
wonder if the conference hadn’t been Triple I [educators’ conference] if we would have
had the nerve to break away even though there was great motivation to do so. (Robien,
interview 2010)

117

On March 4, 1988, the Executive Board of the Illinois School Library Media Association
met at the Oak Brook Hill Conference Center in Oak Brook, Illinois. Present at this meeting were
voting members: Kay Maynard, President; Nancy Bloomstrand, President-elect; Joyce Karon,
Secretary; Becky Trewartha, Treasurer; Pamela Kramer, Member-at-Large; Fran Corcoran, Past
President, and non-voting members: Christa Even, Conference Chair; Esther Baker, Revisionist;
Elaine G. Roth, Member; Bernadette Winter, Member. The purpose of the meeting was “to
organize the tasks to be accomplished to establish the Association” (ISLMA Executive Board
Meeting Minutes, March 4, 1988, p. 1). Members suggested the following items to be addressed:
the filing of articles of incorporation, the development of the organization’s purpose, the
collection of officers’ signatures for the incorporation papers, conferring with consultants on the
new organization’s 501c3 status, the drafting of a notification to other ILA sections, and the
determination of the association’s structure (p. 1).
Not only were the mundane tasks of incorporating a new organization reviewed, but the
group also discussed its short-term and long-term goals. The establishment of ISLMA’s goals
included:
•
•
•

Providing continuing education through workshops and conferences
Strengthening certification requirements and standards for school library media
programs
Promoting and recognizing the importance of school library media staff and facilities.
(ISLMA News, October 1988)

Therefore, on June 18, 1988, the Illinois School Library Media Association (ISLMA), an
educational organization, applied for incorporation under the General Not-for-Profit Corporation
Act of 1986 “to foster and improve school library media service in the state of Illinois, to
interpret the value of this service, and to cooperate with other library and educational
organizations in meeting information needs” (ISLMA Application for Incorporation, March 22,

118

1988, p. 1). The ISLMA Bylaws and articles of incorporation, accepted on June 18, 1988,
created a board of directors (voting and non-voting members), officers (President, Presidentelect, Past President, Treasurer, Secretary), standing committees (Awards, Budget and Finance,
Certification and Standards, Conference, Conference Site, Intellectual Freedom, Leadership
Development, Long-Range Development, Membership, Nominations and Elections,
Publications, Public Affairs, Public Relations and Recruitment, Rebecca Caudill Young Readers’
Book Award Committee), and single-member committees (Archivist, Revisionist,
Parliamentarian, Newsletter Editor, AASL Delegates). In August 1998, ISLMA applied for and
received 501c3 exemption status (ISLMA News, October 1988).
The Illinois School Library Media Association (ISLMA) sought to provide Illinois school
library media specialists continuing education through local and statewide activities (workshops,
conferences, etc.); a liaison with the Illinois State Board of Education, Library Book Selection
Service, AASL Affiliate Assembly, and state educational organizations; activities designed to
meet non-member needs; professional recognition through awards and scholarships;
improvements in certification and standard requirements for school library media centers;
intellectual freedom activities; and support for the importance of school library media
professionals and facilities (ISLMA News, May 1989).
ISLMA also established goals to provide continuing professional education through
workshops and conferences, to strengthen certification requirements and standards for school
library media programs, and to promote and recognize the importance of school library media
staff and facilities. By June of 1988, the ILSMA Board had set training dates to promote
Information Power (ALA & AECT, 1988) workshops throughout the state. The Board paid
attention to IAME members’ concerns about continuing education locations. Even ISLMA board

119

meetings would rotate around the state cognizant of, as IAME Past President Fran Corcoran says,
“The population division – State Route I-80 seemed to be the dividing line between the bigger
population areas and rural areas. Having meetings in locations that would be a comfortable drive
for interested parties was a real consideration” (Corcoran, interview 2012). IAME/ISLMA
President Kay Maynard asked the ISLMA Board to approve the development of new state
standards, which would reflect the national standards (Information Power, 1988), and the Board
agreed.
All future conference sites were to rotate every other year. “One conference would be in
the north, one conference would be in the south” (Roth, interview 2010). In October 1988,
ISLMA hosted its first conference, Beginnings (ISLMA News, October 1988), and fulfilled its
charter to provide professional development opportunities for the Illinois school library media
specialists. Joyce Karon, IAME/ISLMA Secretary, relates:
One vivid memory is that ISLMA was founded in the spring and we held a conference in
the fall. That was an act of faith on our part. ISLMA filled the need of the school
librarians throughout the state to have a network of individuals in similar positions and
situations. The solo librarian was no longer solo. (ISLMA News, October 1997, p. 3)
The first annual conference was held at the Hyatt Regency Woodfield, Schaumburg,
Illinois, on October 28 and 29, 1988. Christa Even, ISLMA Conference Chair, reported, “Total
attendance was 411, and 48 exhibitors contracted for space. The statistics reflect a monetary
profit of approximately $12,700” (ISLMA Minutes, November 12, 1988, p. 1). Evaluations
indicated that participants were satisfied with conference programming. Favorable programs
included honoring Lynne Reid Banks as the winner of the first Rebecca Caudill Young Readers’
Book Award for Indian in the Cupboard, offering assistance to solo librarians, and addressing
the needs of those Illinois school librarians who were automating, looking for funding,

120

concerning themselves with copyright issues, seeking to evaluate their library media programs,
dealing with selection and censorship, and a variety of other issues.
The Conference Committee also selected the Holiday Inn Conference Resort in Decatur,
Illinois, for the 1989 ISLMA fall conference, entitled On the Road. “Selection of a site centrally
located in the state in alternating years reflects the position that ISLMA is a statewide
organization and is attempting to accommodate those members who live in the large geographic
area south of I-80” (ISLMA Minutes, November 12, 1988).
However, Becky Trewartha, IAME/ISLMA Treasurer, felt that while leadership and
continuing education were crucial for the new organization’s development, so was funding:
Because we were starting out with no money, we were not taking any money from
IAME, which you just could not do that, that’s why we knew we had to have a
conference right away and it needed to be a conference that would put money into the
treasury and our way of doing that was by keeping the cost to attend as low as possible,
the cost to join as low as possible. (Trewartha, interview 2010)
The dues structure was carefully crafted to reflect the economic plight of many potential ISLMA
members who were solo librarians and received no financial assistance from their district for
professional development. Several present at the historic vote relate that they “passed the hat” to
get the “kitty” started so the new organization could function (Interviews: Fisher, 2011; Karon,
2011; Kramer, 2010; Robien, 2011; Roth, 2010; Trewartha, 2010).
One of ISLMA’s challenges was re-establishing relations with the Illinois library
community. At the November 4, 1988, ILA board meeting a request was read from ISLMA “to
have a liaison from ILA to their Board. After a discussion centering on changes in both
organizations the [ILA] Board decided to shelve the question until a settling in period elapsed.
The request was tabled for a year” (ILA Minutes, 1988, p. 2). As ISLMA President-elect Nancy
Bloomstrand remembers:

121

One of our challenges was re-establishing relations with ILA and we really
had to do that, wanted to do that, it was important to us to do that. And we
did. We still disagreed with ILA and some of the things that they were doing,
but we, we agreed with most of everything. I mean we wanted to have a good working
relationship with them and we were able to do that. (Interview 2010)
On May 6, 1988, Bridget L. Lamont, the Director of the Illinois State Library, formally
acknowledged the establishment of the Illinois School Library Media Association in a letter to
President Kay Maynard. Lamont writes,
I appreciated receiving the information about this new association and, on behalf of the
Illinois State Library, let me assure you that we look forward to working with you in
order to foster and improve school library media service. As the agency responsible for
statewide library development in a multi-type library network, we believe that
collaboration with other groups concerned about the improvement of library services is
important. (Lamont, letter, May 6, 1988)
Thus, by December 1988 over 500 school library media specialists had become ISLMA
charter members and there were several first events: first conference organized and executed,
first election of officers held, first leadership conference held, first newsletter created, and the
ISLMA logo selected (ISLMA News, October 1997).
New Beginnings: Development of the Illinois School Library Media Association
“We are still a young organization and yet we have accomplished a great deal
to be proud of in so short a time” (Bloomstrand, ISLMA News, October 1997, p. 6).
Leadership
After much debate the ISLMA Executive Board agreed to create the position of executive
secretary. It was defined as a service position, which provides support for the membership and
elected and appointed leadership of the association (ISLMA News, May 1989). As stated earlier
in this chapter, ISLMA’s first president, Kay Maynard, was also appointed as its first executive

122

secretary. Maynard continued in this position until her retirement in July 2014 and is the only
person to hold a continuous position on ISLMA’s Executive Board for its first 25 years.
Beginning July 1, 2013, Becky Robinson was appointed as interim executive secretary to assist
Maynard with this transition. Effective July 1, 2014, Robinson assumed the full responsibilities
of the executive secretary, and the interim executive secretary position was dissolved (ISLMA
Minutes, June 7, 2014).
Guidelines were established for the position of executive secretary, which is “intended to
be service oriented leaving policy decisions entirely with the Board” (ISLMA Minutes, April
1989, p. 12). The position was to provide a legal address for the association and services, which
would aid in a smooth operation. The services included maintenance of a master calendar, of a
safety deposit box for important papers, and of equipment owned by the association as well as
assisting the treasurer with budget preparation, the annual audit, and other financial matters;
providing mailing labels; handling bulk mail service; preparing an annual membership directory;
maintaining a master roster of members; and various other assigned services. The position was
subject to an annual evaluation (ISLMA Minutes, April 1989, p. 12).
Additionally, the Leadership Development Committee was charged with developing a
plan that would benefit the association and its leaders and could be submitted to AASL and
ABC-CLIO for grant consideration in their Leadership Development Award program (ISLMA
Minutes, April 1989): “While the grant attempt was not successful, the Board decided to
implement the plan with association funds. The Allerton House at Monticello became the site for
the first annual leadership conference” (p. 10). Participants included current leaders and others
who expressed an interest in acquiring leadership skills. Programming was designed to offer
information about the association and its goals as well as to offer advice concerning leadership

123

skills that would be useful in any setting. “The conference was very positively received by the
participants and planning is currently underway for a second conference to be held during the
summer of 1990” (ISLMA, April 1989, p. 10). This annual leadership conference to develop and
mentor new leadership has continued throughout ISLMA’s history and was still active in 2015.
Legislative Actions
On September 2, 1989, Illinois House Bill 650 – Per Pupil Grant for School Library
Programs, enabling a per pupil grant for school library programs, was signed into law by
Governor James Thompson (ISLMA News, October 1989). Joyce Karon, IAME/ISLMA
secretary, remembers:
I served on the Illinois State Library Advisory Board for eight or nine years and Bridget
Lamont [Illinois State Library] was always saying school librarians are important and we
need to support them with a per capita grant. Pam Kramer, Pat Norris, Don Atkinson
from the University of Illinois, Bridget, and me sat and beat out that school library per
capita grant and we said okay, but now how are we going to support it. Bridget said,
“We’ll do anything we can to support it,” and I think that Pam and I both said then the
criteria has to be that [grant applicants] have system membership. The system
membership offered the solo librarian support – organized collection, a director, and then
Edgar [Jim Edgar, Illinois Secretary of State/State Librarian] was good enough to say,
“I’ll pass the bill, you can’t have any money now, but the first chance we get we’ll give it
twenty-five cents.” (Karon, interview 2010)
Five years of effort culminated in the establishment and funding of the School Library
Per Pupil Grant program. The effort was begun in 1985 by the Illinois Library Association and
had continued to be pursued vigorously by that organization. After the formation of ISLMA, its
focus was to support the ILA effort and to ensure that the membership would perform as
grassroots lobbyists.
The authorization legislation was enacted in September 1989; the appropriation bill to
support it was successfully approved and signed within the following year. The obvious

124

coordination in effort of the library community (the regional systems, the Illinois Library
Association, the Illinois School Library Media Association, the Illinois State Board of Education,
and particularly the leadership of the director of the State Library and the Secretary of State/State
Librarian) registered positively with Illinois legislators (ISLMA annual report, 1989, p. 6).
The Illinois School Library Media Association (ISLMA) also sought additional support
and was awarded a grant of $10,250 from the Library Services and Construction Act (LSCA,
1964) Title II fund by the Illinois State Library designed to “develop viable options for providing
all Illinois libraries with bibliographic access to school library resources in Illinois” (ISLMA
News, October 1989, p. 1). The project attempted to determine the current status of schools in
regard to automation with the intent of offering suggestions for linking schools into the statewide
network for resource sharing. A reduction in anticipated funding forced the committee to scale
back the original plan to include only public schools and to anticipate additional future projects
to complete the process (ISLMA News, October 1989, p. 1). As a result, a survey, developed by
the University of Illinois Research Center working with the ISLMA committee, was to be
conducted in mid-October 1989 to determine the current status of library automation in Illinois
public schools.
President Ronald Reagan signed House Joint Resolution 90, now Public Law 100-381, on
August 8, 1988. This law authorized a second White House Conference on Libraries to be held
between 1989 and 1991.The Illinois State Library hosted Literacy, Productivity, and Democracy
– Setting the Illinois Information Agenda for the Twenty-First Century, the first state White
House Conference on Libraries and Information Services, which preceded the nationwide
conference in July 1991. Joyce Karon, ISLMA secretary, and other ISLMA members worked

125

with the Illinois White House Conference Steering Committee and at local White House
Conference events.
The ISLMA Certification and Standards Committee, in cooperation with ILA, ISBE, and
IAECT, began to review and revise Recommended Standards for Educational Library Media
Programs (1977, revised in 1981 and 1984) in Spring 1990 and align them with Information
Power. “The Illinois standards need[ed] to reflect this new approach to evaluating our school
library collections, programs, and educational goal” (ISLMA News, March 1990).
At the same time, Mary Ellyn (Meg) Gibbs was selected by the Illinois State Board of
Education to represent ISLMA on the Illinois State Library Media Advisory Council for a threeyear term. The council established a committee, which included ISLMA members, Mary Biblo
and Charles Rusiewski, who also represented the School Library Media Forum of the Illinois
Library Association (ILA). ISLMA continued to maintain ties with ILA’s School Library Media
Forum, the new school library unit in ILA. The committee met a number of times and worked to
complete development of the document, Roles of the School Library Media Specialist in the
Instructional Program (ISLMA Minutes, June 3, 1989, p. 13).
In addition, Elaine Roth, IAME past president, was appointed to the position of Liaison
to the Illinois Curriculum Council She received information about the two meetings of the
organization after they had occurred; therefore, she was unable to participate in any activities.
She recommended “investigating possibilities for greater involvement” (ISLMA Minutes, June 3,
1989, p. 13).
	  

126

Membership and Finance
The main tasks of the Membership Committee were to compile a membership database,
prepare and distribute informational brochures and membership cards, and conduct the first
annual membership renewal campaign. Membership had increased to 734 members (ISLMA
News, January 1990). A successful membership campaign and the 1988 conference income made
it possible to meet all expenditures, which were approved in advance by the Board of Directors.
Records reflecting the “initial year expense (both in kind and direct) [made] it possible to
construct a reasonably accurate budget” for subsequent fiscal years (ISLMA Minutes, June 3
1989, p. 9).
Awards
The Awards Committee established the Polestar Award and selected the first recipient.
The award is presented to “an individual who is an active, participating member of ISLMA,
plays a leadership role in the organization, and/or makes a positive contribution to the school
library media field” (Bloomstrand, ISLMA News, January 1990, p. 1). Kay Maynard,
IAME/ISLMA president, received the first Polestar Award as outstanding librarian of 1989.
In 1990, the Awards Committee and the ISLMA Board decided to present the
aforementioned special award for administrators. The first ISLMA Crystal Honor Award was
presented to then Illinois State Librarian and Secretary of State Jim Edgar for raising “awareness
of the vital importance of libraries throughout the state” (Bloomstrand, ISLMA News, January
1990, p. 1). According to ISLMA President Nancy Bloomstrand, “He has encouraged and
supported library legislation at all levels and his help on HB 650 legislation was invaluable”

127

(Bloomstrand, 1990, p. 1). Scholarships were also considered by the ISLMA Awards Committee
but postponed to a future date.
ISLMA leadership continued to seek other ways to honor not only service and support to
libraries but also literacy development. Bonita Slovinski (2013), current Rebecca Caudill Young
Readers’ Book Award Committee Chair, recounts the following:
As ISLMA’s founding members decided to launch their association, there was a group of
ISLMA members who felt that Illinois should have a children’s choice book award. This
group began investigating the possibility of creating and maintaining such an award. The
initial inquiry of the formulation of the new award proved to be very favorable and a
presentation was made to the ISLMA Board. (Interview 2013)
Board interest was extremely high, but there was a concern about the financial
requirements that ISLMA, as a fledgling organization, would have in order to establish and
maintain the award. The award investigation committee was directed to talk with other Illinois
educational organizations that would be willing to share funding to create and support this
award. Two organizations, the Illinois Reading Council (IRC) and the Illinois Association of
Teachers of English (IATE), both agreed to provide seed money and representation on the book
award steering committee. In light of these commitments, ISLMA’s board agreed that they, too,
would be able to provide financial and steering committee support. With this shared sponsorship
agreement in place, the work for the creation of the first Illinois children’s book award began in
1986.
Representatives from the three organizations, along with a faculty member from Northern
Illinois University and the Illinois Library System, wrote guidelines that govern the operation of
the award. This group became the first Steering Committee. Members were Carol Fox, Jackie
Plourde, Marge Hauge (ISLMA), Paula Schoenfelder, Taimi Ranta (IRC), Carl Tomlinson
(NIU), and Lois Schultz (Illinois Library Systems). As the award needed a name, they chose to

128

honor Rebecca Caudill, an Illinois children’s author who had just recently passed away, as the
award’s namesake. In 1987, the Rebecca Caudill Young Readers’ Book Award was launched. A
list of nominees was disseminated and voting occurred in February 1988. The first award winner
was Lynn Reid Banks for her book The Indian in the Cupboard in 1988.
The Rebecca Caudill Young Readers’ Book Award (RCYRBA) Committee was unique
in that it was jointly sponsored with other Illinois organizations and still continues to function as
an independent entity with the support and consent of the sponsoring groups today. Over the
years some changes have been made to the Steering Committee, according to Bonita Slovinski,
the current RCYRBA Steering Committee chair:
Hoping to clarify for public libraries that they too were welcome to participate in the
Caudill Award, a Youth Services public librarian was invited to the Steering Committee,
and that group continues to have a committee seat. The Steering Committee sought and
gained nonprofit status and trademarking for the RCYRBA logo. Its website provides
information about the award and is where participating members are directed for their
membership materials, as well as where nominations and vote reporting is done.
(Interview 2013)
However, ISLMA members who were strong proponents of this award related that this multisponsorship made it seem like “ISLMA’s stepchild” (Plourde, interview 2010). Several research
study interviewees mentioned their disappointment that ISLMA initially required multiorganization sponsorship and chose not to solely support the Caudill Award. As Jackie Plourde,
one of the Caudill founders, remarked, “There’s been a lot of conscious and unconscious
friction” regarding the Illinois Young Reader Awards (interview 2010).
The Rebecca Caudill Young Readers’ Book Award was designed as an annual award
given to the author of the book voted most outstanding by students in grades four through eight
in participating Illinois schools (ISLMA News, May 1989). The Rebecca Caudill Young
Readers’ Award website states:

129

Its purposes are to encourage children and young adults to read for personal satisfaction;
to develop a statewide awareness of outstanding literature for children and young people
and to promote a desire for literacy; as well as encourage cooperation among Illinois
agencies providing educational and library service to young people. (Rebecca Caudill
Young Readers’ Book Award, 2015).
The presentation of the first award took place at the first ISLMA conference (1988) and this
tradition continues today.

Communication
The first ISLMA Membership Directory was produced and distributed during ISLMA’s
inaugural year. The ISLMA Board also determined that “we publish a newsletter” and six issues
were released during that initial year with the first two being pre-conference promotionals
(ISLMA Minutes, November 1988, p. 5). All issues were mailed first class in an attempt to keep
the membership informed of association activities. The editors experimented with form, size,
and method of duplication while establishing regular features, including the president’s message,
continuing education opportunities, and vendor biographies. Committee chairs were encouraged
to write articles, and students and member volunteers were enlisted to help complete the
mailings. The board minutes (ISLMA Minutes, April 1989, p. 10) relate the following
discussion:
While policies now specify the number of issues (six) and the method of mailing (first
class), the format, method of duplication and content should probably remain somewhat
flexible to maintain timeliness, which is the key to keeping the membership informed. An
informed membership is crucial to the success of the organization, and a timely
newsletter appears to be the best vehicle for achieving that goal.
Seeking to publicize ISLMA’s advocacy mission, the Public Affairs Committee’s chief
project was to inform educators and legislators about the need for passage of school grant
legislation, which had been initiated by the ILA. Committee members prepared informational

130

letters and newsletter articles, attended legislative receptions, and traveled to Springfield to sign
in and/or testify at committee hearings on the legislation. The effort, supported by the activities
of many additional ISLMA members, was rewarded with legislation being signed into law by
Governor Thompson – the per capita grant. “An effort to secure funding through a companion
bill was not successful; therefore, efforts are currently being pursued to secure alternative
sources of funding” (ISLMA Minutes, April 1989, p. 11). It was decided that ISLMA would
continue to explore and support all “mutually beneficial legislative attempts” with the Illinois
Library Association, the Illinois State Library, and the state’s library systems.
In addition, the Public Relations and Recruitment Committee recommended the
development of projects “to publicize our association, profession, and libraries and librarians as
an integral part of the school instructional and curricular program” (ISLMA Minutes, April 1989,
p. 11). The initial activity of the committee was to prepare and distribute promotional material to
support the Illinois State Library’s Illinois School Library Day (1990). This included mailing
copies of a proclamation from Governor Thompson establishing School Library Day in Illinois
(currently called Illinois Day, an annual event allowing multi-type Illinois librarians to meet with
state legislators and advocate for their library) along with other promotional materials to all
ISLMA members. The committee also prepared a brochure used to recruit individuals to the
profession.
Knowing the membership’s need to promote library programs, the Publications
Committee developed a graphics packet offering clip art, templates for library applications, and a
bibliography of helpful sources. The committee presented a three-hour pre-conference workshop
showing how to utilize the packet, which was available for sale at the conference. Additional
packets of materials, a journal of practical ideas, and a single-sheet insert into the ISLMA

131

Newsletter were considered for future use. Lastly the committee was charged with “oversight of
all other publications except the newsletter” (ISLMA Minutes, April 1989, p. 11).
Intellectual Freedom
The Intellectual Freedom Committee was charged with “all matters of interest to the
corporation relative to assuring freedom of inquiry…in relation to school library media centers in
the state” (ISLMA Bylaws, 1989, p. 9). The committee began to plan long-range projects,
including collecting model library selection policies, maintaining records of attempted or
successful efforts to censor materials, suggesting possible sources of assistance in censorship
attempts, and planning workshops to be held in different areas of the state (ISLMA Bylaws,
1989).
Policies and Procedures
The Policies and Procedures Manual, developed under the guidance of Esther Baker,
chair of the Revisions Committee – also referred to as the Revisionist, was accepted by the
ISLMA Board at a special meeting (ISLMA Minutes, June 20, 1989). Some additional areas of
the manual were constructed as needed. Finally, Baker examined the initial ISLMA Bylaws and
made suggestions for adjustment (ISLMA Minutes, November 18, 1989). In addition to serving
as president of the Illinois Association of Media in Education (IAME), Baker was a member of
its Executive Board, served as treasurer for the association and for eighteen years chaired its
Policy and Bylaws Committee. Along with the other IAME Executive Board members who
became the first ISLMA Executive Board members, Baker continued as ISLMA’s revisionist
throughout the organization’s first two decades. Every interviewee for this research study, the

132

ISLMA friendly librarians and founders, referenced Baker’s influence on ISLMA’s
organizational development and unswerving commitment to Illinois librarianship (Interviews:
Anderson, 2011; Bloomstrand, 2010; Corcoran, 2012; Fisher, 2010; Karon, 2010; Kramer, 2010;
Maynard, 2011; Robien, 2010; Roth, 2010; Sharka, 2010; Trewartha, 2010; Winter, 2010).
Future Leadership
The Nominations and Elections Committee was asked to plan and conduct the first
election of ISLMA board members and officers of ISLMA. The committee met at the 1988
conference and selected a slate of candidates. These candidates were presented to the association
through pictures, biographical sketches, and statements of concern in an issue of the newsletter
(ISLMA News, 1989). Following this introduction, each member was mailed a ballot and offered
the opportunity to vote. Ballots were received and counted, and the results were presented to the
board for verification (ISLMA Minutes, April 1989, p. 11). The election placed the following
individuals in office: Pamela Kramer, President-Elect; Barbara Inbody, Secretary; Jim Skrine,
Treasurer; Joyce Kelly, Board Member; Carol Fox, Board Member; and Elaine Knight,
appointed to serve in the position vacated by Pamela Kramer (ISLMA News, May 1989).
Early meetings of the ISLMA Board were used to accomplish the organizational tasks
necessary to structure the new association, including defining each leadership position and its
responsibilities. Bylaws were carefully examined by the board and by a consultant employed to
offer advice concerning gaining 501c3 tax status with the federal government. The bylaws finally
won acceptance after a number of revisions. Other tasks included selecting a logo; establishing
publication of a newsletter; initiating a membership campaign; and gaining recognition from
personnel at the Illinois State Board of Education, Illinois State Library, and American

133

Association of School Librarians as well as from the various professional organizations operating
within the state, such as the Illinois Library Association, the Illinois Association for Educational
Communication and Technology, etc. (ISLMA News, May 1989, p. 4).
After the organizational tasks were accomplished, or at least well under way, the board
turned to other matters. “The organization depends heavily upon committees to assume the tasks
of assessment and planning for effecting changes which will improve the school library media
profession in Illinois” (ISLMA News, May 1989, p. 1). The various committee report summaries
appearing here reflect many of the activities and accomplishments of the organization and should
be considered to gain a total picture of the forward movement, which occurred during the initial
period of operation. Some of the accomplishments that should be recognized include the
following:
•

•

•
•
•

Successful completion of the majority of organizational tasks including incorporation
as a nonprofit organization within the State of Illinois, gaining 501(c)3 tax status
under the rules and regulations of the IRS, and completion of a successful audit.
(ISLMA News, May 1989, p. 4)
Acceptance by the school library media community in Illinois. At this time, ISLMA
had approximately 700 members representing public and nonpublic schools, library
systems, public libraries, academic libraries, and a number of commercial vendors.
(ISLMA News, May 1989, p. 4)
Production of a conference that was assessed as successful in both program offerings
and financial profits.
Establishment and production of a successful newsletter as a vehicle for
communication with the membership.
Active involvement in projects designed to produce improvement for the school
library media community, that is, legislation to provide grants to schools, assessment
and planning for automation, efforts to improve leadership abilities, and long-range
planning for continued influence. (ISLMA News, May 1989, p. 4)

Many of the interviewees for this research – the ISLMA friendly librarians and founders
– all refer to the different issues that school librarians faced because of the duality of being a
teacher and a librarian. ILA may have provided support for the librarian but not for the teacher.

134

IAME, as a section of ILA, was not able to focus totally on teaching needs. As Christa Even,
ILSMA/IAME Conference Committee chair, wrote:
As school budgets continued to be reduced, I found myself in the 1980s as the only
certified librarian in a K-12 school district [DeKalb, Illinois] of 4000 students. A strong,
practical and effective school library association was vital to me. It was my lifeline. One of
its best aspects was networking – not just delivery/information systems – the people
network. When I needed help, I could pick up the telephone and call school librarians
throughout the state that I had met through workshops, conferences, the Board, etc. “Keep
up the good work!” It worked. As often happens with school librarians, we were neither
“fish nor fowl” within a larger structure [ILA] which didn’t share our educational base.
Because we were teachers as well as librarians, we needed to provide an association, which
could address both these crucial components. This need in the mother organization (ILA)
hadn’t been recognized, wasn’t being recognized, and, all indications pointed towards a
future, which wouldn’t recognize the special school needs. Really, when one looked at it
objectively, there was no choice except the one we finally made. Of course, it was terribly
difficult because we wanted our needs to be met by ILA so we could remain as an integral
part of this library organization. But the time had come to face reality and finally we did.
(Letter, 1997)
In summary, the organization had a productive and successful start. President Kay Maynard
related, “That success is largely due to the many individuals who willingly spent countless hours
at great personal expense to bring this success to fruition. They deserve recognition and thanks
from all of us” (ISLMA News, May 1989, p. 4).
Illinois School Library Media Association 1990-1999
In its three short years of existence, 1988-1991, ISLMA had grown to a membership of
850 (ISLMA News, June 1991, p. 3), and new issues arose with this growth. Consequently, a
review of the ISLMA Board of Directors Meeting Minutes and ISLMA News during the 1990s
indicated a shift in the association’s concerns. In the beginning the board was concerned with
organizing and everyday operations. As time passed and the association matured, the emphasis
shifted to service to the members. The concentration was on conferences, workshops, and
strengthening partnerships with the State Library, Illinois State Board of Education (ISBE), and

135

other associations and agencies. While the association continued those efforts, it also began to
look at issues that affected the library profession. board meeting agendas featured a discussion of
some philosophical issues, for example, ISLMA’s role in consulting, drafting guidelines for
school library media programs, etc. It became clear that “ISLMA has become the voice of
professionalism for school librarians in the state of Illinois” (Campbell, ISLMA News, 1991, p.
2).
Leadership
Cognizant of those issues affecting the school library media specialist, “ISLMA offer[ed]
a position paper on the preparation of school librarians and affirm[ed] a flexible scheduling
statement,” which was endorsed by the AASL Board of Directors and submitted in response to a
query by the National Education Association and Illinois Education Association (Kramer, ISLMA
News, June 1991). The American Association of School Librarians (AASL), the American
Electronics Association, and six other educational groups commissioned the first comprehensive
study of the education community’s attitudes regarding the role of technology and the
information superhighway in schools. The survey was titled Building the National Information
Infrastructure (NII) in K-12 Education: A Comprehensive Survey of Attitudes Toward Linking
Both Sides of the Desk. “It asks school library media specialists, teachers, administrators, school
board members, and other educators about the effects the information superhighway will have on
the U.S. education system, including teaching and student learning” (ISLMA News, March 1995,
p. 10).
ISLMA board minutes and newsletters during this decade reflected this awareness of
technology and its impact on the role of the school librarian and Illinois school libraries.
Conscious of forthcoming issues (library automation and declining budgets), the ISLMA Board

136

agreed to participate in a multi-type library survey. The results of the School Library Partners in
Illinet survey were published and recommendations were made to ISLMA. It was noted that
Illinois libraries must continue to promote resource sharing and Serials of Illinois Libraries
Online (SILO), develop awareness of telecommunications technology, utilize the research
material and statistical data collected by the survey, encourage development of statewide
guidelines for school automation, and explore additional possibilities for grant-funded projects
(ISLMA News, October 1990).
During its first decade (1988-1998), ISLMA sought to keep its membership abreast of
current research within the field of school librarianship. Not content to only rely on national
library research initiatives, ISLMA chose to conduct its own research on Illinois school libraries
and librarianship. For example, the board approved the creation of a special research unit, the
ISLMA Task Force (1993), to articulate visionary solutions to major issues and challenges to the
school library media profession in Illinois. The ISLMA Research and Development Committee
also reported that it was eager to sponsor research on the value of school libraries. “Studies are
needed which relate various aspects of school library service (collection, programming, staff,
budget, and services) to student achievement. Projects could involve one or more schools at any
grade level. Sponsorship might include some financial or in kind assistance” (ISLMA News,
September 1991, p. 8).
Subsequently, the ISLMA Board approved the plan of the Research and Development
Committee to sponsor a brief survey of the membership’s science and mathematics collection to
gather initial data to be used to develop a more thorough collection assessment as related to the
Illinois State Goals for Learning (ISLMA News, March 1993).

137

In the wake of a series of natural disasters impacting the Midwest, such as the Great
Flood of 1993, the ISLMA Board appointed an ad hoc committee to provide assistance to school
libraries experiencing disasters (ISLMA News, December 1993). Responsive to membership
needs, the ISLMA Board additionally established the ISLMA – Plainfield School Library Relief
Fund to provide financial assistance to re-establish school library services after three Plainfield
schools were damaged or destroyed by a tornado. The committee also developed a model
disaster plan for schools, available upon request (ISLMA News, March 1994).
Legislative Action
ISLMA’s legislation function’s duties are to “monitor state and federal legislative
activities that may impact school library media programs; inform corporation members of their
significance; and recommend actions that the corporation may legally take or which individual
members may choose to take” (ISLMA website, 2015). For example, Lou Ann Jacobs has
handled the role of ISLMA’s legislative advocate since ISLMA’s inception. This position has
focused on advocating nationally and at the state level regarding the impact of school library
media programs on student achievement and the school librarian’s role in student achievement as
well as in garnering support for school library media programs. Her mission has been to educate
legislators and educational leaders about the important role that school libraries and librarians
play in achieving excellence in teaching and learning. This research study could not detail every
activity or piece of legislation that ISLMA has been involved in. Instead its focus was on pivotal
issues regarding support for ISLMA’s mission (funding, professional development, standards,
and program guidelines). These topics were identified as common themes throughout interviews

138

with ISLMA Executive Board members and are key matters in creating an oral history of
ISLMA.
As previously mentioned, the Illinois school per capita grant program began with a
designated amount of 23 cents per student (1989). Governor Jim Edgar, the former Illinois
Secretary of State and State Librarian, signed the Live and Learn Legislation to help fully fund
the school per capita grant program. The Illinois school library per capita grant program, the first
of its kind in the nation, was and is still authorized to provide up to $.75 per student for each
qualifying school as the funding becomes available. This legislation provides Illinois libraries
with a stable source of funding through the use of vehicle title transfer fees and license fees. For
schools, the per capita grant as of 2015 was to be funded at the fully legislated amount of $.75
(ISLMA News, March 2015).
The Integrating Resources and Personnel into the School Improvement Process: Science
Learning Area Conference, jointly sponsored by the Illinois State Board of Education, the
Illinois State Library with additional support from the ISLMA, IAECT, and ILA/School Forum
(formerly ILA’s school section that the friendly librarians refused to join), was the kick-off
activity for a grant program designed to “increase student achievement in science by integrating
library resources and personnel into the school improvement process” (ISLMA News, May 1993).
The twenty schools to receive grants from this program sent a team consisting of a school library
media specialist, a science teacher, an administrator, and a public librarian to the conference.
Grants were designed for planning activities involving library and classroom personnel in
analyzing student and teacher needs in science and in developing school improvement activities
and strategies, including resource access and management; acquisition of computer equipment,

139

software and/or a FAX machine and modem for accessing information; or for purchasing science
equipment, books, and materials (ISLMA News, May 1993).
Liaisons and Partnerships
Aware that a network of support would be needed to promote its mission and goals,
ISLMA established the Liaisons and Partnerships Committee (1989) “to maintain [liaison
relationships] with a number of agencies and other professional organizations that are interested
in the school library media profession” (ISLMA website, 2015). Formal partnerships have been
instituted and maintained with the following organizations:
•

American Library Association (ALA) – affiliate membership

•

American Association of School Librarians (AASL) – affiliate membership

•

Rebecca Caudill Award

•

Illinois Computing Educators (ICE)

•

Illinois Library Association (ILA) – Board membership

•

Illinois Library Association (ILA) – Public Policy Committee membership

•

Illinois State Board of Education (ISBE)

•

Illinois State Library Advisory Committee (ISLAC)

•

Illinois Reading Council

Interestingly, Joyce Karon, ISLMA’s first secretary, became the first school librarian to
serve on the Illinois State Board of Education (2003-2009) and continued to bring ISLMA’s
message to the Illinois state legislature and educational community. After serving under four
governors, Karon was designated to serve on the Illinois P-20 Council, a 30-member council,
appointed by the governor, which includes business leaders, teachers, union leaders, faculty,

140

school board members, parents, and representatives of private colleges, universities, community
colleges, foundations, and state education and workforce agencies (P-20 website, 2015). Its
mission is to “deliberate and make recommendations to the Governor, Illinois General Assembly,
and state agencies for developing a seamless and sustainable statewide system of quality
education and support, from birth through adulthood, to maximize students’ educational
attainment, opportunities for success in the workforce, and contributions to their local
communities” (P-20 website, 2015). The Illinois P-20 Council has supported the efforts of the
Partnership for 21st Century Learning, P21, “the leading organization uniting business,
education, and government leaders to advance meaningful teaching and learning for all students”
(P21 website, 2015). P21 has pushed for the adoption and implementation of the Common Core
State Standards (CCSS), “college and career ready standards that embody the knowledge and
skills students require to succeed after graduation” (P21, 2015).
Karon has continued to take an active part in educating school librarians and exhorting
them
to take the leadership role in their schools and districts and show that what they do is
embedded in the CCSS and they can provide information, connections, and instruction to
make the interdisciplinary aspects of learning meaningful for students. The days of the
school librarian being an “isolationist” are over. It’s time for school librarians to stop
whining about being left out and step up to the new plate and hit a homerun. (Kramer,
2011, p. 2)
David Loertscher and Elizabeth “Betty” Marcoux also shared the impact of the CCSS on the
school librarian’s role:
The expectation of these standards is to create a focused and coherent set of standards
that will cross all state boundaries in the United States and be a set of rigorous
expectations that a student will be able to find at any school he or she attends. It is for this
reason that the CCSS will always take precedence over any other set of standards known
presently. This does not mean the other sets of standards are not important. What matters
is to figure out how they fit together. Teacher-Library Media Specialists are the most well
equipped to do just this. (Loertscher & Marcoux, 2010, p. 9)

141

Between 1996 and 2000, the Illinois State Library, a part of the Department of State,
reported offering services to school library media centers. Services included Library Services
Construction Act (LSCA) or Library Services and Technology Act (LSTA) grants, state aid,
standards or guidelines, and staff development (ISLMA News, November/December 2000). The
ISLMA actively sought liaisons and partnerships with other state and national organizations:
•

Students, Learning and Libraries: Aligning Resources with School Improvement
Conference, sponsored by the Illinois State Board of Education and the Illinois State
Library in collaboration with ISLMA, ILA, and IAECT, was held for teams
comprised of one school librarian, one public librarian, and one administrator
(Kramer, ISLMA News, February 1992).

•

Sharing the Vision: Educators Working Together for Curriculum Reform Conference,
an invitational event sponsored by ISLMA in collaboration with ILA and IAECT,
was offered. It was designed to bring together representatives from statewide
educational organizations, including ISLMA, to discuss educational change (Kramer,
ISLMA News, February 1992). This first-of-its-kind event in Illinois sought to begin a
dialog on how the participants might work together to improve teaching and learning
for Illinois students.

•

A coalition of state organizations, including ISLMA, helped defeat proposed
obscenity legislation that would have allowed each of the state’s 102 counties to
create its own definition of obscenity instead of requiring prosecutors to rely on a
statewide standard. Robert Doyle, executive director of ILA, “was very pleased and
grateful for ISLMA’s input into the testimony and our assistance in contacting
legislators regarding SB 1036, the County Obscenity Standards Bill.” (ISLMA News,
February 1997, p. 2)

Membership and Finance
The ISLMA website defines the Membership Committee’s functions as follows:
“promote the achievements of members; work to obtain new members; ensure renewal of current
memberships; and encourage those whose memberships have lapsed to become members again”
(ISLMA website, 2015). The committee is also responsible for providing funding for the revision
of the Illinois School Library Media Guidelines.

142

By the end of the decade (1999), ISLMA membership exceeded 1,000, and ISLMA
conducted a telephone survey of the 2,000 non-member school librarians in Illinois. The
campaign focused on learning more about certification, facilities, scheduling, automation and
other technologies (ISLMA News, February 1997). While this survey promoted ISLMA’s
membership services, its mission was to gather data on Illinois school libraries and their staff.

Professional Development and Continuing Education
ISLMA’s mission to provide for the “continuous growth and leadership development of
members through educational activities, research initiatives, and recruitment” is still in the
forefront of its mission (ISLMA website, 2015). The ISLMA Board appointed a new committee,
the Ad Hoc Committee on Continuing Education, that presented workshops for the solo librarian.
“As a result of the School Library Partners in Illinet survey and the series of ‘solo’ librarian
workshops, the ISLMA Continuing Education Committee identified ‘automation’ as a focus for
its continued activities” (ISLMA News, December 1990, p. 5).
As a direct result of the ISLMA School Library Partners in ILLINET and YASD/YOYA
automation surveys, the ISLMA Continuing Education Committee developed a workshop
entitled, “First Steps: Three Easy, Cheaper Ways to Begin to Automate.” Presented in eight
different locations throughout the state, each session offered a broad overview of library
automation and simple suggestions to begin automation using the computer, the fax machine,
and the modem. The focus was on what each of these forms of technology can do for a library,
the impact on students, how to choose equipment and software, start-up costs, and how to
approach the administration for funding (ISLMA News, February 1991).

143

Seeking to “spread ISLMA’s message,” a series of three one-day regional conferences for
school librarians and administrators were held and developed by the cooperative efforts of the
Illinois State Board of Education, the Illinois State Library, ISLMA, the ILA/School Library
Forum, the Cumberland Trail Library System, the Illinois Valley Library System, the Mid-Illini
Educational Service Center #2, and the DuPage Library System. Titled “Improving the Teaching
and Learning Process Through School Library Resources, Personnel, and Networks,” the aim
was to
provide models establishing the role of the school library media center staff and resources
in the school improvement process. Models will show how school librarians and
resources can impact the educational objectives in the context of the total school. Models
will include: computer assisted integration, literature-based reading programs, and other
thematic projects. (ISLMA News, February 1991, p. 1)
Seeking new formats for professional development, the ISLMA Continuing Education
Committee produced a video, Growing Towards Excellence a Step at a Time: Illinois School
Library Media Program Guidelines, designed to help school library media specialists use and
implement the new school library guidelines (ISLMA News, December 1993).
The ISLMA Continuing Education Committee and the ISLMA Intellectual Freedom
Committee also collaborated to develop a workshop that addressed the needs of school library
media specialists for up-dated selection and challenge policies. The workshops focused on the
development of selection guidelines that could support the curriculum and were to be used in a
positive manner to answer challenges to materials in the school library media collection (ISLMA
News, March 1994).
Furthermore, ILSMA’s Continuing Education Committee presented a series of “Boot Up
Your Reading Skills: Using Technology to Encourage Purposeful Reading” workshops. This
initiative was the result of membership demand for “support and ideas in the areas of both

144

technology and increasing reading for pleasure and information” (ISLMA News, February 1997,
p. 2). These workshops as well as the various Conference 1996 presentations were considered an
aid in this endeavor.
Conference
“ISLMA’s annual conference continues to provide Illinois librarians with ‘the best bang
for your buck’ for professional development opportunities” (Robinson, personal communication,
July 9, 2015). The conference “represents an integral part of corporation activities by providing
continuing education and professional growth; networking among members; social interaction;
and operating revenue” (ISLMA website, 2015). In November 1990, ISLMA hosted its third
annual conference, More Power to You! As Jane Sharka stated, the conference’s “mission
statement was threefold: to provide professional growth, to provide informal opportunities for
idea exchange, and to earn money for ISLMA” (ISLMA News, December 1990). From its first
conference in 1988 through 2014, ISLMA has continued to host an annual conference with its
mission in the forefront of planning. Conference sites for the following conferences alternated
between the Chicago metropolitan area (Lincolnshire, Arlington Heights) and central Illinois
(Springfield, Decatur):
•

October 1991 - Fourth annual conference: Charting the Cs: Caring, Coping,
Cooperating, and Communicating.

•

October 1992 - Fifth annual conference: Quantum Leap into the 21st Century.

•

November 1993 - Sixth annual conference: Libraries at the Crossroads, with a goal to
provide practical solutions and theoretical challenges to the issues facing school
library media specialists.

145

•

November 1994 – Seventh annual conference: Our World of Interaction.

•

October 1995 – Eighth annual conference: Star Search.

•

October 1996 – Ninth annual conference: Transforming Dreams of the Future into
Reality Today.

•

October 1997 - Tenth annual conference: Celebrate! A Decade of Change, focused on
celebrating ISLMA’s tenth birthday and a decade of leadership, collaboration,
information, books, and technology (ISLMA News, February 1997).

•

November 1998 - Eleventh annual conference: Linking for Learning.
Awards and Grants

During the decade from 1990 to 1999, ISLMA leadership and members recognized those
charter members who had played a pivotal role in its formation with awards and grants. Awarded
at the annual ISLMA conference dinner, “the Polestar [Award] is given in recognition of
outstanding service and leadership to the profession and to the Association” (ISLMA News,
January 1993). The award represents “a guiding light in the school library media field” (ISLMA
News, December 1991, p. 1). The following recipients of this prestigious award were recognized
as the outstanding librarian for that year:
•

1990 - Joyce Karon, a founding member of ISLMA; its first Secretary; founder and
co-editor of the first ISLMA newsletter; publicity chair for ISLMA’s first conference;
member of the Illinois State Library Advisory Council and the Illinois White House
Conference Steering Committee (ISLMA News, December 1990, p. 1).

•

1991 - Carol Fox, Youth Services consultant at the Illinois State Library, former
ISLMA board member, and one of the creators of the Rebecca Caudill Young
Readers’ book Award (ISLMA News, December 1991, p. 1).

•

1992 - Pamela Kramer, a founding member of ISLMA; its first elected President; coeditor of the first ISLMA newsletter; current editor of the ISLMA News; ISLMA

146

board member, Conference Steering committee member; chair of the ISLMA Long
Range Planning and Leadership Development committees, and author of Linking for
Learning (ISLMA News, January 1993, p. 1).
•

1992 - James Skrine, ISLMA financial secretary, former ISLMA treasurer, and
charter member (ISLMA News, December 1993, p. 1).

•

1994 - Caroline Campbell, former ISLMA president, former ISLMA Conferences
chair;, and ISLMA committee member (ISLMA News, December 1994, p. 1).

•

1995 - Mary Ellen “Meg” Gibbs, ISLMA charter member, conference planner, and
mentor (ISLMA News, December 1995, p. 1).

•

1996 - Carol Morrison, an ISLMA founder and charter member, conference planner,
and as a committee chair guided studies on school library automation and school
library science resources (ISLMA News, December 1996, p. 1).

•

1997 - Sondra Miller, a former ISLMA president, president-elect, and treasurer and
creator of ISLMANET-L, “an electronic discussion listserv for anyone interested in
school library media programs and who has an e-mail address for sending and
receiving electronic mail” (ISLMA News, December 1997, p. 1).

•

1998 - Joanne Grewell, former ISLMA president, treasurer and conference chair
(ISLMA News, December 1998, p. 1).

•

1999 - Esther M. Baker, former IAME president, treasurer, and chair of its policies
and Bylaws Committee, described “as ‘The Mother’ of both the IAME and ISLMA
‘tome’ of bylaws, policies, and procedures that has shaped and guided the
organizational operations of these two associations”; considered the steady, guiding
force which helped write and implement the original bylaws and policy manual, she
led ISLMA through an annual “re-examination and revision of its policies and
procedures” and was fondly referred to as the ‘Revisionist’ (ISLMA News, December
1999, p. 1).

Recognizing the support of non-librarians to the burgeoning association, the ISLMA
Board developed an Honor Award for educational administrators and a Special Award for
state legislators in recognition of exemplary assistance to school libraries in Illinois. Both
awards were given when an individual made a dramatic impact on school libraries in Illinois.
The following educators and legislators were recognized during this same decade as those
above:

147

•

The first ISLMA Crystal Honor Award (1990) was presented to Bridget L. Lamont,
Director of the Illinois State Library, “in recognition of her continuing commitment to
quality library service for all the residents of the state, especially the young people”
(ISLMA News, December 1990)

•

Illinois Secretary of State and State Librarian George H. Ryan received an ISLMA
Special Award for his ongoing support for libraries in Illinois and especially for his
Live and Learn program, which raised the student per capita grant from twenty cents
to seventy-five cents. “Ryan developed the Live and Learn program to provide a
steady and stable source of revenue for Illinois public and school libraries” (ISLMA
News, December 1993, p. 1).

•

Dr. Larry Werner, principal consultant in instructional technology at the Illinois State
Board of Education, was the recipient of the ISLMA Special Recognition Award for
his “outstanding abilities in developing teams and building consensus ….his belief in
collaboration and his commitment to quality education for the young people of
Illinois…. and [assisting] Illinois school library media professionals to better align
resources with the goals of school improvement” (ISLMA News, December 1994, p.
1).

•

U.S. Senator Paul Simon (Illinois), one of the chief sponsors of the Elementary and
Secondary School Library Media Resources Program (Title III-F of the Improving
America’s School Act), was the recipient of one of two ISLMA Special Honor
Awards in 1995. Receiving the second ISLMA Honor Award was U.S. Senator Carol
Mosely Braun (Illinois). As part of the U.S. Senate Finance Committee she
championed schools and libraries. “Along with Senator Simon she was instrumental
in having a recent study prepared which shows the disparity among schools in
facilities and infrastructure to support the new technologies” (ISLMA News, August
1995).

The ISLMA Professional Development Grant, designed to provide financial assistance to
ISLMA members who wish to participate in professional workshops, conferences and
coursework related to the school library media profession, was renamed the Lauretta McCusker,
O.P., D.L.S., Professional Development Grant in 1998. The new title sought to honor Sister
Lauretta McCusker, the longtime ISLMA Awards chair and former dean of the Graduate School
of Library and Information Science at Dominican University, formerly Rosary College (ISLMA
News, December 1998).

148

Additionally ISLMA’s Ad Hoc Secondary Book Award Committee began surveying
librarians and teachers to gather data on current participation in the Rebecca Caudill Young
Reader Award program and the level of interest in similar primary and secondary book awards
(ISLMA News, May 1995).
Communication
The Communications Standing Committee (1989) was formed to “foster the
dissemination and exchange of ideas and information among members and to others by
promoting networking; advocating the corporation and its activities to the global community; and
encouraging and supporting the free exchange of ideas” (ISLMA website, 2015b). Its chief
means of communication to its membership continued to be ISLMA News (ISLMA’s newsletter)
published quarterly and mailed to all members. The newsletter provided an outlet for the ISLMA
Board, its committees, and membership to advocate for school libraries in Illinois.
Seeking other avenues of communication for its membership, the ISLMA Board of
Directors unanimously voted at the May 18, 1994, board meeting to authorize the establishment
of the ISLMANET-L listserv to facilitate Internet discussions among members. Launched in
1994, this electronic discussion list for anyone interested in Illinois school library media
programs continues to thrive today by averaging thirty to forty posts per day (as cited by
Giarritano, 2011). Co-owned by ISLMA and the Early Childhood and Parenting Collaborative
(ECPC) at the University of Illinois, ISLMANET-L provides a forum for Illinois school library
media specialists to share ideas, resources, problems, and solutions. The purpose of the listserv,
to discuss topics relevant to school library media specialists in Illinois and/or topics relating to
ISLMA activities (ISLMA News, July-August 1994), has been met as ISLMANET continues to

149

be a heavily utilized social outlet accessible 24 hours a day, seven days a week (ISLMA website,
2015h).
ISLMA further communicated its message as a force in Illinois school libraries when Kay
Maynard, ISLMA executive secretary, was selected as the guest editor for the October 1990
Illinois Libraries, a publication of the Illinois State Library (ISL). Several ISLMA members
contributed articles under Maynard’s helm, and throughout the next 20 years, ISLMA members
were asked to contribute to the publication.
Subsequently, Caroline Campbell, ISLMA’s president (1992), related how the ISLMA
Public Relations Committee presented a series of public service announcements to air on Illinois
television stations in fall 1992 that promoted school library professionals as vital, energetic, and
multitalented (Campbell, ISLMA News, February 1992, p. 2).
Policies and Procedures
ISLMA membership adopted bylaw changes in the organization’s purpose that reflected
its mission (1988): “The purpose of this corporation is to provide leadership and support for the
development, promotion, and improvement of school library media programs and the school
library media profession in Illinois” (Baker, ISLMA News, February 1992, p. 5).
The ISLMA Board additionally endorsed a technology policy statement and components
for a strategic plan to provide school library media specialists with continuing education
opportunities to further their development of technology integration and instruction. The
statement read: “ISLMA supports the educational movement in Illinois toward the integration of
technology in teaching and learning and begins to take actions that would assist school library

media specialists in learning more about technology in the education process” (ISLMA News,
May 1995). Among the suggested strategies are:
•
•
•
•

development of regional workshops focused on the design of teaching and learning
that includes technology and information resources
identification of technology leaders who are ISLMA members to highlight them and
their schools in ISLMA News
presentations at conferences in Decatur
inclusion of technology integration concepts in the Administrator’s Academy module
currently under development by ISLMA’s Research & Development Committee.
(ISLMA News, May 1995)

In addition, Illinois Superintendent Joseph Spagnolo issued QSI, The Illinois Quality
Schools Initiative: “Building the Foundation for Change” – A Concept Paper (1995), a proposal
that was “to be viewed as a long range vision to continuously improve Illinois’ public education
system” (ISLMA News, September 1995). In response to QSI, the ISLMA Board established a
statewide “Agenda for Action” and organized focus groups throughout the state to gather input
from its membership about the five points detailed in QSI.
Standards Development
True to ISLMA’s mission, the Standards Development Committee’s function is to
“promote the importance of state and national school library standards and guidelines in
relationship to state and national content standards; and participates in the ongoing development,
implementation, and evaluation of standards for school library programs and for the certification
of school library media professionals” (ISLMA website, 2015p).
Adhering to this goal, Primary Competencies of School Library Media Specialists in
Illinois: A Position Paper was approved by the ISLMA Board and published in June 1991. It
defined the educational role school library media specialists play through cooperative
partnerships with staff and administrators, the management position school library media

151

specialists assume and their administrative responsibilities, and the part they perform in
developing instructional materials collections by providing access and privacy. It also defined
information and instructional services as well as materials and technology (ISLMA News,
December 1991). An ISLMA News article (December 1991) indicates that the ISLMA Board
hoped the competencies document would be widely distributed and used in “providing others in
the field of education an understanding of the roles that school library media specialists should
be expected to fulfill as they become an integral part of the instructional program of the total
school” (ISLMA News, December 1991, p. 4).
Throughout its first decade (1988-1998), ISLMA continued to take an active role in
informing its membership of national and local research impacting school libraries. In 1994,
Public School Library Media Centers in 12 States: Report of the NCLIS/ALA Survey was issued
by the U.S. National Commission on Libraries and Information science (NCLIS). This survey
was undertaken in 12 states, including Illinois, to highlight the commission’s concern for school
libraries to provide resources and support to reconnect young people to learning (ISLMA News,
September 1994).
Accordingly, the ISLMA Board adopted the Information Standards for Illinois Students,
seven standards outlining how Illinois students will “use information to gain and share
knowledge accurately, efficiently, responsibly, and ethically throughout their lives” (ISLMA
News, May 1996, p. 10). These standards formally acknowledged the school library media
specialists responsibility to instruct students in information literacy.
ISLMA also prepared a response to the Preliminary Draft Illinois Academic Standards
and saw positive changes in the final document, Illinois Learning Standards. The Illinois State
Board of Education (ISBE) adopted the Illinois Learning Standards, stating that this document

152

“builds on the Illinois Goals for Learning” and identifying learning areas, goals, learning
standards, and benchmarks (ISLMA News, August 1997).
Nationally, Information Power: Building Partnerships for Learning (1998) was jointly
published by the American Association of School Librarians (AASL) and the Association for
Educational Communication and Technology (AECT). M. F. M. Long stated in her timeline of school
library standards:
The mission statement developed for the 1988 standards remains the same but the
American Association of School Librarians and the Association for Educational
Communications and Technology develop information literacy standards plus principles
on creating effective library programs under the leadership of the school librarian (Long,
2007, p. 159)
Information Power (1998) reaffirmed AASL’s 1988 mission; emphasized information literacy as
an essential skill; defined standards; expanded the roles of the library media person: teacher,
instructional partner, information specialist, program administrator; and affirmed the importance
of a school library program throughout the curriculum. However, the new edition did not include
quantitative standards.
Accordingly, the responsibility for setting the guidelines for school library media
programs in Illinois was transferred from the Illinois Library Association to ISLMA (ISLMA
News, September/October 1999). For the first time ISLMA was solely responsible for this
endeavor and appointed a task force to determine what an Illinois school library media program
should look like “in order to impact student achievement” (ISLMA News, September/October
1999, p. 1). Noting that Information Power: Building Partnerships for Learning (AASL &
AECT, 1998) identified nine information literacy standards for student learning, including
indicators and levels of proficiency, the ISLMA Task Force reviewed each and its impact on
student learning statement and how it was to be implemented (ISLMA News, September/October

153

1999). Members of the task force included Dr. Barbara Herrin, Dominican University; Theria M.
Jackson, Martin Luther King Middle School, East St. Louis; Sondra Miller, Pleasant Plains
Middle/Senior High School; Karen Muskopf, Illinois State Library; Katherine Oberhardt,
University High School; Maggie Schmude, New Trier High School; Lois Schultz, Suburban
Library System; Dr. Ann C. Weekes, Chicago Public Schools. Ex officio members included
Donna Lutkehaus, ISLMA President, 1998-1999; Ken Hawley, ISLMA President, 1999-2000;
and Barbara Lund, ISLMA President-elect, 1999-2000. Additional input and support was
provided by Randy Burge, Illinois State Board of Education; Jane Yoder, AASL Information
Power Implementation Coordinator; and Pamela Kramer, ISLMA Past President and Task Force
Chair. The work of the task force was “facilitated through the generous support of the Illinois
State Library and Dominican University who arranged for all of the meetings to be conducted
using V-Tel technology” (ISLMA News, September/October 1999, p. 1). The draft document was
entitled Linking for Learning.
Pamela Kramer, Linking for Learning Task Force chair, recounted, “I had it [Linking for
Learning, ISLMA, 1999] proofread by Betty Marcoux, who was the chair of the national
committee. Dave Loerschter and Blanche Wools also proofread it. I don't like to take that much
credit for it, but it was really, I think that was a big breakthrough for us [ISLMA]” (Kramer,
interview 2010) and was heralded as a “landmark document” by the ISLMA Board (ISLMA
News, September/October 1999, p. 1). Linking for Learning, published in 1999 and introduced at
the fall 1999 annual conference, was devoted to the “implementation documents” (ISLMA News,
September/October 1999, p. 1). It included:
•
•

positive rubrics describing a continuum of improvement for each component
model job descriptions for the school library media specialist, for clerical, and for
technical support persons

154

•
•
•

program planning guidelines identifying key stakeholders and questions to be
addressed during continuous planning for program development and improvement
introduction to the use of output measures
facilities planning guide for new school library construction and/or renovation. (p. 1)
Publications

ISLMA not only published Linking for Learning at this time (1999); in the wake of
Illinois natural disasters, ISLMA developed and published The School Library Media Center
Disaster Response Plan Handbook (ISLMA News, May 1995). In addition, Student-Focused
School Library Media Centers Help Create Life-long Learners (1996) was adopted and
published by the ISLMA Board. This document outlined the services a quality school library
media center, under the guidance of a school library media professional, provides to its users by
leading the way in information technology; improving student achievement; delivering
information through resource sharing; ensuring equity of access to resources and
information; integrating multiple resources into curriculum; working as an integral part of
the teaching team; including information literacy in teaching and learning; reaching
beyond the walls of the school to develop a community of learners; and helping to create
life-long learners. (ISLMA News, March 1996, p. 3)
Seeking to be on the forefront of local issues, the ISLMA Board also authorized the
preparation and publication of a bibliography for children and young adults on organ donors and
transplantation (ISLMA News, July 1993) to help Jesse White, Illinois Secretary of State and
Illinois State Librarian, in his organ donor campaign tied to Illinois driver licensing.

Future Leadership
Reviewing ISLMA’s inaugural decade of 1988 to 1998, Carol Morrison, a former
ISLMA board member, commented on its birth. Recounting how the IAME board meeting,

155

which led to the final decision to form the Illinois School Library Media Association, was
preceded by much talk, many phone calls and a lot of soul searching, Morrison relates,
I personally lobbied against the idea of forming a separate organization. In my position as
the “multi-type person” at DuPage Library System, I had worked long and hard for
cooperation among different types of libraries. I firmly believed that libraries are so
threatened by outside forces that they simply must work together. I still believe this, but I
was wrong in assuming that formation of a separate organization would lead to less
cooperation from school librarians. The opposite has proven to be true. (Morrison,
ISLMA News, 1997, p. 3)
Since ISLMA was organized, school librarians have been much more involved in
cooperative projects with other librarians than they ever were as part of the larger library
organization, the Illinois Library Association. Upon reviewing ISLMA board minutes and
newsletters, it is apparent that legislative activities, statewide automation projects, continuing
education, and resource sharing are some examples of this greater involvement. Similar to
Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, perhaps ISLMA has met the needs of school librarians – to have
their own board of directors, their own programs and workshops, their own special awards, their
own finances and by-aws. As these needs were met, the organization grew stronger, and as it
grew stronger, it began to “self-actualize” – to take a more active role in statewide library
concerns. Good leaders appeared to accept the challenges, and soon school librarians were more
involved in cooperative activities. Based on my review of ISLMA archival documents, ISLMA
is a much stronger force for multi-type library cooperation than IAME was.

Illinois School Library Media Association 2000-2013
As ISLMA entered the 21st century, it was reported that 92% of all U.S. public schools
have a school library (Haycock, 2005). The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) reauthorized the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), setting high standards for all

156

students and holding schools accountable. The law further stated there should be highly qualified
teachers in every classroom (school librarians were not mentioned) and included $12 million for
literature in K-4 classrooms (excluding school library collections). The pillars of NCLB focused
on accountability for results, budgeting for programs, choices for parents, and data-driven
education methods. Student achievement was to be determined by standardized test scores. The
exclusion of school libraries and librarians from NCLB set the stage for massive budget cuts in
school library funding, leading to the elimination of school libraries or their being staffed by a
state-licensed school librarian (ALA website, 2015).
Subsequent lobbying by national library organizations (the American Library Association
and the American Association of School Librarians) sought to change this lack of federal support
for school libraries by NCLB (ESEA). The American Library Association advocated for the
inclusion of the following provisions:
•
•

•

maintain dedicated federal funding for school libraries
include provision under Title I state and local plans and the Race to the Top funding
to establish a state goal of having a school library staffed by a state-certified or
licensed school librarian in each public school
allow state and local professional development funds to be used to recruit and train
school librarians

In December 2015, Senate Bill 1177, the Every Child Succeeds Act (ESSA, was passed
and moved to President Obama to sign into law (ALA website, 2015). Reauthorizing the
Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA), this bill is the first piece of federal legislation
in more than fifty years that allows federal funding to create effective school library programs
(ALA website, 2015). Before passage, the U.S. Senate amended ESEA to include the ReedCochran Amendment, which will help save and expand school libraries in every state in the

157

nation by explicitly authorizing school districts to use federal funds to develop and foster
effective school library programs (ALA website, 2015).
In February 2015, U.S. Senators Jack Reed and Thad Cochran introduced the SKILLS
Act (S.312). This library amendment to ESEA supports ALA’s stance on school library funding
and addresses staffing by state-licensed school librarians and the authorization of funding to
promote school librarianship. It also
•
•
•

expands the scope of professional development to include digital literacy, reading,
and writing instruction across all grade levels
focuses on coordination and shared planning time between teachers and librarians
ensures that appropriate books and materials are available for students with special
learning needs, including English language learners. (ALA, April 2015, p. 19)
Membership and Finance

The Illinois School Library Media Association celebrated its 25th birthday at its fall
conference in 2013. The organization boasted a membership of over 1,100 and chose to honor
such luminaries as Esther Baker, Joyce Karon, and Kay Maynard with lifetime ISLMA
memberships (ISLMA News, November December January 2012). ISLMA also launched its
website, which hosted a wiki and a blog for ISLMA members. Eventually, a members-only
section of the site was created that published the membership directory, grant/scholarship
applications, membership/conference registration, election ballot/voting, and organizational
documents. In such ways, ISLMA has moved into the online world of the 21st century.
Awards: Illinois Readers’ Choice Awards
With the birth of the Rebecca Caudill Young Readers Award for fourth through eighth
graders in 1986 and its subsequent popularity, school librarians serving primary grade students

158

expressed interest in an award for students in grades kindergarten through third. In summer 2002,
Carol Fox, Jan Yoder, and Pam Storm, all ISLMA past presidents, met and developed a
preliminary proposal outlining the award guidelines (modeled after the Caudill Award), Steering
Committee membership, and financial support. This proposal was presented and approved by the
ISLMA Board in April 2003. The committee decided to name the new award the Monarch
Award. Aware that K-3 children in Illinois would be familiar with the Monarch butterfly (the
state insect), the Steering Committee “loved the name and the comparisons it invoked between
the Monarch butterfly’s metamorphosis and the emergence of the new reader” (Storm, 2006, p.
47). The Monarch Award “symbolizes the growth, change and freedom that becoming a reader
brings” (ISLMA website, 2015) and was “designed to encourage children to read critically and
become familiar with children’s books, authors and illustrators.” The program is intended for all
K-3 age children in Illinois. Initially “over 670 schools and libraries registered, over 95,000
children voted” (Storm, 2006, p. 47), and the award’s popularity has continued to grow. The
first Monarch Award winner (2005) was David Gets in Trouble by David Shannon.
As the Illinois Readers’ Choice Awards flourished, middle school and high school
librarians expressed their desire for a secondary-level literacy award. Eager to develop a student
choice award for high school students, ISLMA launched a statewide survey of school librarians
to determine the level of interest. The survey results “showed that many high school librarians
were very enthusiastic about the idea” (Shannon, 2006, p. 48). ISLMA President Kathy
Oberhardt and the board supported the push for a 9-12 book award and approved the necessary
funding (2003). School librarians Kathy Shannon and Jane Lenser and public librarian Kathleen
Traci began work on the award guidelines. An effort was made to align these procedures with the
Rebecca Caudill Award and the new Monarch Award, which was established concurrently.

159

Named the Abraham Lincoln Illinois High School Book Award, fondly called “The Abe
Award,” the committee moved quickly to present the award in fall 2005. Kathy Shannon related:
With a dedicated band of twelve adult readers from around the state, and nominations of
more than two hundred titles from librarians, teachers, and students, the committee
produced a Master List of 22 titles for the 2005 Abe Award. Students in more than 200
school and public libraries read and voted during the 2004-2005 school year, and the first
award was presented at the 2005 Fall ISLMA conference. (Shannon, 2006, p. 48)
According to Shannon (2006, p. 48), nearly 1,400 high school students voted, while many others
read the nominated titles but chose not to vote “for various reasons.”
In the spring of 2008, the ISLMA approved establishment of a new committee to
investigate the creation of another readers' choice book award for intermediate readers – students
in grades third through fifth. A group of librarians met; developed guidelines based on the
Rebecca Caudill, Monarch, and Abraham Lincoln awards; and circulated a survey to determine
interest. The committee presented the results to the ISLMA Board, and 92% of elementary
school librarians respondents were in favor of an intermediate level award. The ISLMA Board
approved the new award in October 2008. Named in honor of the bluestem, the Illinois prairie
grass, the award is designed for intermediate readers who are ready for “for longer titles than
found on the Monarch list, but not quite ready for the sophistication of some of the Rebecca
Caudill titles” (ISLMA website, 2015). The Bluestem Award reading list may include classic and
current titles as well books that have been included on the Monarch and Caudill lists. Hachiko
Waits by Leslea Newman was the first winner of the Bluestem Award in 2011.
As the four Illinois Readers’ Choice Awards (the Monarch, the Bluestem, the Rebecca
Caudill, and the Abraham Lincoln) have grown in popularity and become established, more
libraries and their patrons are participating in these literacy development programs. These

160

student choice reading programs for all Illinois students, K-12, foster a love of literature as
children are growing up reading and voting for book awards.
Furthermore, ISLMA continued to honor its shining stars at the annual conference with
the Polestar Award. The following members were recognized for their contributions to school
librarianship and school library programs:
•

2000 - Lois Schultz, Youth Services Coordinator at Suburban Library System,
active member of ISLMA, serving on a variety of committees, co-chairing
conference committees, presenting at conference and serving as ISLMA secretary.
A member of the committee who wrote Linking for Learning, the Illinois School
Library Media Standards, Schultz received the Polestar Award for her ability “to
keep school libraries’ concerns and issues before the larger library community.”
(ISLMA News, Nov/Dec 2000, p. 1)

•

2001 – Lou Ann Jacobs, ISLMA past President, and Legislative Advocate. Citing
her active presence and representation of ISLMA at state and national lobby days,
Lou Ann Jacobs’s “contribution to ISLMA…is her passion, commitment and

162

Grants
Cognizant of nonexistent or reduced library budgets, the ISLMA Board investigated ways
to provide monetary or material support to its membership. ILSMA board minutes during this
period reflect the board’s discussion of an endowment fund, but the board members were unable
to determine how to fund such an endeavor. For many years, as noted earlier in Chapter 2, the
Library Book Selection Service (LBSS) provided quality literature to Illinois school libraries.
Many school and public librarians used LBSS resources to select and/or acquire materials and
books for their collections. An inaugural member of ISLMA, LLBS was also one of its sponsors
and vendors for the annual conferences. However, as the U.S. economy declined during this
decade, in 2007 the LBSS decided to close its doors. The following resulted:
The ISLMA/LBSS Endowment Fund was created using funds donated by the Board of
the Library Book Selection Service from its dissolution. The funds have been invested,
with income from the investments being used to give grants of book sets to school and
libraries…. The goal of the Fund is to promote reading by providing quality literature to
Illinois children and teens. (ISLMA website, 2015i)
This unique program, the ISLMA/LBSS Endowment Fund, offers two grants (spring and
fall) in support of Illinois libraries. The first grant, the Readers' Choice Award grant, is open to
any school or public library. The librarian applicant must be an ISLMA member, be registered
for at least one of the Illinois Readers’ Choice Award programs – the Monarch, Bluestem,
Rebecca Caudill, or Abraham Lincoln Award – and may apply for a complete set of book titles at
the appropriate level. A second grant opportunity, Read for Information, which was started in
2012, provides nonfiction materials. The grant is intended to help in meeting the CCSS, the new
academic learning standards for English language arts/literacy and mathematics. The CCSS
emphasize the importance of literary nonfiction, which places an expectation on Illinois school

163

libraries to provide current and relevant resources. “As priorities change in building our
collections, this means we’ll need to buy more information texts” (ISLMA website, 2015). The
fund trustees, appointed by the ISLMA Board, are dedicated to carrying on the tradition and
spirit of LBSS, which was to “provide the very best books to youth in Illinois” (ISLMA website,
2015).

Publications
The Illinois School Library Media Association sponsored a research study on the impact
of school libraries on student achievement, The Illinois Study: Powerful Libraries Make
Powerful Learners (Lance et al. 2005a). In the fall of 2003, 657 Illinois schools representing all
grade levels, enrollment ranges, and regions of the state participated in a voluntary survey of
their school libraries. “The survey gathered data on hours of operation, staff and their activities,
the library's collection and educational technology, total library expenditures, and several types
of library usage” (ISLMA website, 2015). This study was funded by the Illinois School Library
Media Association with additional funding from a 2004 Library Services and Technology Act
(LSTA) grant from the Illinois State Library, a division of the Secretary of State’s Office. The
21st Century Information Fluency project of the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy,
funded by the U.S. Department of Education, also provided financial support. The 21st CIF
project’s mission was to research and develop training in the “new” field of online information
literacy (Information Fluency, 2015). The Illinois State Board of Education endorsed The Illinois
Study: Powerful Libraries Make Powerful Learners (2005a). The evidence produced by this
study indicated that Illinois school libraries

164

contribute measurably to the academic achievement of students, as reflected by their test
scores. At all grade levels, test scores tend to be higher where access to school libraries is
more flexibly scheduled, where school libraries are staffed more fully, where school
librarians spend more time collaborating with classroom teachers, where larger
collections are available, where educational technology is more widely available to
augment the local collection and, generally, to extend access to online resources into the
classroom, where school libraries are better funded, and where students use school
libraries, both individually and in groups, to learn and practice the information literacy
skills they will need to excel on tests and as lifelong learners. (Lance et al., Illinois Study
Executive Summary, 2005b, p. 122)
In February 2006, the Illinois School Library Media Association (ISLMA) released the
results in The Illinois Study: Powerful Libraries Make Powerful Learners. The findings were
positive – school library media programs with professional staff do impact student achievement
(Jacobs, 2006). The data showed that these links between high-quality school library programs
and academic achievement cannot be
explained away as mere artifacts of community socio-economic factors (i.e., household
income, race/ethnicity) or certain key school conditions (per pupil spending, teacherpupil ratio). In short, the findings of this study and its predecessors support the belief that
powerful libraries – and librarians – do, indeed, make powerful learners. (ISLMA, Illinois
Study Fact Sheet, 2005).
Intellectual Freedom
ISLMA conducted a survey of school library media specialists in Illinois to determine the
state of intellectual freedom in Illinois schools in 2006. The ISLMA study results were consistent
with an American Association of School Administrators study (as cited by Reichman, 1993, p.
17) and found a relationship between a school library having a selection policy and whether the
school had a material challenge (Fiehn, 2006). The ISLMA Intellectual Freedom Committee,
concerned that “some school librarians may need an introduction to or a refresher course on
intellectual freedom issues such as denial of access to existing resources because of policy,
procedure, age/grade/ability” (Fiehn, 2006, p. 18), created an Intellectual Freedom Toolkit for its

165

membership. Featured on its webpage, the Toolkit continues to provide resources on how to
handle a challenge as well as craft a selection policy (ISLMA website, 2015f).
The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA) and the Children’s Internet
Protection Act of 2000 (CIPA) raised issues related to intellectual freedom in U.S. public schools.
Children’s privacy and online safety can be protected by impinging on their rights to freedom of
speech and self-expression; filtering software can block access to legitimate sites but is open to
circumvention by computer-savvy children. With increased technology use by children at both home
and school, the Illinois General Assembly passed Public Act 095-0869 SB2512 Section 5 School
Code (2209), which states:
Sec. 27-13.3. Internet safety education curriculum. a) The purpose of this Section is to inform
and protect students from inappropriate or illegal communications and solicitation and to
encourage school districts to provide education about Internet threats and risks, including
without limitation child predators, fraud, and other dangers.
The law states:
Beginning with the 2009-2010 school year, a school district must incorporate into the school
curriculum a component on Internet safety to be taught at least once each school year to
students in grade 3 or above…. The intent of the law is to ensure that topics of Internet Safety
are incorporated into the school curriculum at least once each academic year and that the
related component(s) are taught to all students in grades 3 through grade 12. Legal phrase “or
above” implies all students in grades 3 and beyond through grade 12. (Illinois State Board of
Education, 2015)
The implications of this law for Illinois school librarians were clear. Internet safety, also known as
digital citizenship, must become an integral part of every Illinois school library media program and
the librarian’s information literacy instruction. Reviewing ISLMA’s annual conference offerings and
workshops, this topic has become a focus for ISLMA’s professional development and continuing
education initiatives for its members, particularly for school librarians whose districts may be
embarking on one-to-one laptop/tablet initiatives.

166

Professional Development and Continuing Education
ISLMA board minutes during this time period indicated a concern that its membership was
unable to get away from their schools to attend face-to-face professional development events and
activities. Looking to provide alternatives, ISLMA created a Webinar Committee (2004) to research
the feasibility of providing electronic continuing education activities on current issues and concerns.
Initially ISLMA offered these online opportunities using Web-Junction, a state-sponsored program
through the Illinois library systems. However by 2011, the “WELL Webinar Series, a monthly series
of webinars that are provided to support the professional needs of school librarians in Illinois” was
launched by ISLMA using Blackboard (ISLMA, 2015o).
Additionally, ISLMA partnered with the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy
(ISMA) to support the IMSA 21st Century Information Fluency project (21CIF) that prepares
school librarians, teachers, and students to locate, evaluate, and integrate Internet information
resources productively (ISLMA News, January 2004, p. 1). Acknowledging that teacher librarians
should be at the forefront of this initiative, ISLMA in partnership with 21CIF offered a digital
information fluency workshop at the annual ISLMA conference (2005) and a series of webinars
(2005-2006).
Conference
ISLMA had continuously hosted an annual conference since its birth in 1987. During
this past decade (2005-2015), ISLMA board minutes included lengthy discussions of whether to
collaboratively sponsor its annual conference with its liaison and partner organizations. Dr. Gail
Bush, ISLMA Polestar Award winner and ILA board member, had continuously sought to
achieve this goal of a cooperative venture. With Bush’s assumption of the ILA presidency (2010-

167

2011), discussion between ILA and ISLMA focused on making the event occur. With this in
mind, fall 2015 witnessed a unique conference experience for the ISLMA membership. For the
first time in ISLMA’s history, the 2015 All for One Conference: A Library State of Mind
brought together
library organizations in Illinois for a chance to connect, network, and learn together.
Academic, public, school, and special libraries will come together for the first combined
annual conference of the Illinois Library Association and Illinois School Library Media
Association, in collaboration with the Illinois Association of College and Research
Libraries (IACR) and the Special Libraries Association (SLA) Illinois Chapter. (ISLMA
website, 2015c)
The Illinois Library Association extended a reduced membership rate to ISLMA members
throughout 2015. ILA also handled all registrations for this aforementioned joint conference.

Standards
The American Association of School Librarians (AASL), with input from library media
professionals nationwide, published the Standards for the 21st-Century Learner in fall 2007.
Standards for the 21st-Century Learner offered a “vision for teaching and learning to both guide
and beckon our profession as education leaders” (AASL, 2007, p. 1). It replaced the AASL
Information Literacy 1998 standards for students, as detailed in Information Power: Building
Partnerships for Learning (AASL & AECT, 1998). Focusing more on the effect of the library
media specialist’s role than on its historic collaborative nature, the new learning standards were
to shape the school library program nationwide and serve as a tool for library media specialists to
use to foster the learning of students in the school. These learning standards were developed
without input from other organizations such as AECT or ISTE but continued to reaffirm AASL’s
mission as outlined in Information Power (AASL & AECT, 1998). “In the 2007 AASL

168

Standards for the 21st- Century Learner, school librarians set forth a solid foundation of
standards for critical thinking skills and understanding complex text, which result in higher
student achievement” (Bradley, 2013, p. 1). In January 2010, the AASL formally changed the
professional title of the school library media specialist to school librarian. In light of the new
standards, ISLMA revised and published a second edition of Linking for Learning reflecting the
changes in the AASL standards and guidelines.
Following the publication of Standards for the 21st-Century Learner, ISLMA began to
not only promote the new standards but to explore how to integrate them into existing curriculum
– in essence to align them with the Illinois Learning Standards.
Annually, the Alliance Library System consulting staff (now part of RAILS-Reaching
Across Illinois Library System) conducted site visits at each of its member libraries. In
2007, the staff noticed a need for an information literacy or library skills curriculum
aligned with the Illinois Learning Standards and the new American Association for
School Librarians (AASL) standards. In January 2008, a focus group researched sample
curricula and drafted the format of the final tool. In August 2008, the Alliance Library
System staff, with the help of member librarians, published the first version in CD format
and as an online wiki. In October 2008, the framework was presented to the Illinois
School Library Media Association (ISLMA) for adoption as a statewide model. (ISLMA,
2015e, p. 3)
“The Alliance Library System began the process of creating a curriculum and tying the Illinois
Learning Standards along with the AASL Standards to benchmarks and objectives” (ISLMA
News, November December January 2009, p. 4). Becky Robinson and Angie Green (Alliance
Library System) spearheaded the project and, after review by ISLMA’s Standards Committee,
presented a draft of the I-SAIL framework at the fall 2008 conference.
The Illinois Standards Aligned Instruction for Libraries (ISLMA, 2015e), also referred to
by the acronym I-SAIL, is a set of library standards and benchmarks organized by grade levels
that includes lesson plan objectives and selected Illinois and AASL Learning Standards. I-SAIL
was originally comprised of four main standards that defined what a student should be able to do

169

by the time they graduate. “The purpose of the Illinois Standards Aligned Instruction for
Libraries (I-SAIL) document is to empower, educate, and encourage school library information
specialists to plan strategically with other teachers to incorporate information literacy skills in
lessons and thereby provide college and career readiness for students” (ISLMA, 2009). To sum
them up in their simplest form, students should be able to access information, evaluate
information, use information, and appreciate it. I-SAIL will support this initiative. The ISLMA
Board adopted the Illinois Standards Aligned Instruction for Libraries in January 2009. The
documents available in Word or PDF format were published on ISLMA’s website and wiki.
“The 2011 revision occurred as a response to the adoption of the Illinois Common Core
Standards in English and math, and in 2015 another revision occurred in response to the Next
Generation Science Standards. The I-SAIL document will continue to be revised as needed to
maintain its currency and usefulness” (ISLMA, 2015e, p. 3). Guided by NETS-S (National
Educational Technology Standards for Students), the revised I-SAIL framework included a fifth
standard that addressed the need for Internet safety instruction as required by Illinois state law.
Illinois school librarians are encouraged to use I-SAIL to create administrator awareness
of the librarian’s role as a teacher and instructional designer, emphasize the teacher aspects of
school librarianship (job security), focus on the library as a teaching space, highlight the
librarian’s collaborative role in student achievement (job justification), implement the new
AASL/CCSS standards crosswalk,4 and provide school librarians with an ISLMA adopted
curriculum.

Future of the Illinois School Library Association – 2013 and Beyond
The Illinois School Library Media Association said good-bye to some of its founders
with the passing of Esther Baker (2012) and Becky Trewartha (2013) as well as the retirement of
Kay Maynard, the first ISLMA president and executive secretary (2014). Seeking to honor their
contributions, the ISLMA Board created scholarships in their names to “encourage students who
wish to gain certification to work in Illinois schools as a school librarian” (ISLMA News, January
2014, p. 2). The ISLMA Highsmith Award, given annually to recognize “a school library media
center’s achievement in planning and implementing an innovative or creative event or service,
which has made a measurable positive impact on it users” (ISLMA, 2015p), received a name
change – now called the ISLMA/Upstart Award.
Planning for the Future
Recognizing the importance of planning, the association created a task force (2007) to
develop a long-range plan driven by trends gathered from a membership survey. As ISLMA
achieved its silver anniversary, the board decided to implement a Strategic Plan Revision Task
Force to review its existing plan and prepare a “framework for developing activities and
initiatives during the next five years” (ISLMA, 2013, p. 1). The Strategic Plan Revision Task
Force developed five goals:
•
•
•
•

Increase awareness of the importance of school library information specialists
(Illinois’ classification for school librarians) in the education process
Increase active membership in ISLMA
Enhance avenues of communication
Provide responsive professional development for a diverse membership

171

•

Promote collaboration and provide leadership in learning standards implementation.
(ISLMA, 2013, p. 2)

Objectives and action for each goal were generated, and action steps detailing activities to
implement each goal were outlined:
•

To increase awareness of the importance of school librarians in the education process,
the Task Force recommended the production of public relations and marketing
documents identifying ISLMA opportunities and programs; generating, distributing
and explaining key documents and guidelines (I-SAIL, Linking for Learning, etc.);
strengthening liaison relationships with educational organizations and agencies;
promoting legislative advocacy at the local, state, and national levels; facilitating and
promoting participation in Readers’ Choice Awards; and supporting and defending
intellectual freedom issues (ISLMA, 2013, p. 2).

•

To increase active membership in ISLMA, the Task Force recommended planning
leadership activities; utilizing the ISLMA website to facilitate membership renewals
and new member referrals (electronic newsletters); and reaching out to
college/certification programs to recruit student members (ISLMA, 2013, p. 3).

•

To enhance avenues of communication, the Task Force suggested creating a more
welcoming atmosphere for new and/or existing members; promoting and enhancing
the ISLMA web site (membership-only section, online voting); taking advantage of
newer technologies to communicate (Facebook, Twitter); and promoting volunteer
opportunities for the membership (ISLMA, 2013, p. 4).

•

To provide responsive professional development for a diverse membership, the Task
Force recommended offering multiple opportunities for training, including statewide
conferences, regional workshops and online planning (ILA joint conference, regional
“mini” conferences/workshops); partnering with other library organizations and
building relationships with professional groups and associations to provide
networking and training opportunities around the state; promoting existing online
training tools (Web-Junction); using available technologies to advertise events well in
advance; and surveying the membership for their professional development needs
(ISLMA, 2013, p. 7).

•

To promote collaboration and provide leadership in learning standards, the Task
Force recommended seeking avenues for “partnerships among professional library
organizations, higher education and associations; encouraging members to present at
professional conferences; and encourage members to work and collaborate with other
librarians” (ISLMA, 2013, p. 8).

172

Summary
Reflecting a rapidly changing educational landscape requires constant evolution. The
Illinois School Library Media Association has continued to evolve since its inception. Its
strategic planning clearly indicates its continued mission to help Illinois school librarians align
their understanding of the needs of 21st-century learners with the major changes rapidly
occurring in the educational environment (standards, inquiry-based learning, digital literacy and
resources, and facilities design). ISLMA has made advocacy a priority, heralding the message
that libraries are essential to 21st-century education. As Kay Maynard, retiring ISLMA executive
secretary, shared:
We succeeded in establishing a new professional organization because we were
determined that we were not going to be relegated to the role of a Forum and because we
worked as a team. ISLMA has come a long way in the 26 years of our existence. There
have been ups and downs with plenty of bumps along the way, but I have no doubt that
what we began on March 3, 1988, has helped the growth and improvement of the
profession. It’s been quite a ride, but well worth the effort! (ISLMA News, January 2014,
p. 2)

	  

CHAPTER 6
VIEW FROM WITHIN IN ILLINOIS: FUTURE OF THE ILLINOIS SCHOOL
LIBRARY MEDIA ASSOCIATION
None of us can work very effectively in isolation for any long period of time. We cannot
do an effective job if we try to do that job alone. I’m convinced that being actively
associated with a group of “like believers” is a source of strength that each of us needs.
(Sondra Miller, ISLMA President 1994 -1995, ISLMA News, 1997, p. 16)
The enthusiastic willingness of librarians to organize into professional associations has
been much discussed by library historians. In her examination of library associations, noted
library educator Peggy Sullivan, a former ALA president and executive director, stated:
A kind of tension drives individuals or institutions to form cooperative groups, and
aspects of that tension can cause fragmentation, change of course or identity, and
progress….For the individual member, the tensions of being affiliated with an association
may be seen in a somewhat different way. In general terms he seeks association
membership in order to establish his own identity as a member of the library profession
or, given the wide latitude most library associations offer, to indicate his interest in
librarianship and improvement. His choices of membership and of activity are obviously
tied to what he has to offer of his own time and competence and also to what membership
advantages he seeks. (Sullivan, 1976, p. 136)
Sullivan espoused that librarians maintain “love-hate relationships with associations to which
they feel some loyalty and by their willingness to form new associations or to reform old ones”
(Sullivan, 1976, p. 135). ISLMA’s founders exemplified this duality between remaining part of
the Illinois Library Association, which did not meet their specialized needs, and their willingness
to create a new association. Yet 27 years later, in October 2015, both organizations sponsored a
joint conference for their memberships. Even Melvil Dewey, the founder of the American
Library Association, believed “as evidenced in his writing and in his action…. that there should

174

be state associations working actively in library development” (Sullivan, 1976, p. 136). Dewey
helped form other national and state library associations (National Association of State Libraries,
the American Library Institute, and the New York Library Association), asserting that librarians
should not be limited to working with just one organization. However, Mark Keith Lea (2013)
cites that the number of degrees: bachelor’s, master’s, and doctoral levels, have sharply declined
in library science while the number granted in computer and information science has shown
remarkable growth (Lea, 2013, p. 5). With this decline “additional evidence of the changing
nature of the school library media specialist can be found in professional organization affiliation”
(p. 9). Examining Wisconsin’s professional organizations, Lea notes that membership in the
Wisconsin Library Association and/or the Wisconsin Association of School Librarians has
declined while membership in the Wisconsin Educational Media Association has grown. As
school libraries have been transformed by recent technological changes, Lea proposes that school
librarians’ role perceptions (how school librarians perceive their roles) have been impacted by
the influx of information technology.
Furthermore, professional library associations have played an integral role in the
development of library leadership by providing continuing education opportunities for their
membership, particularly in light of the constant changes in technology, budget shortfalls, and a
shrinking job market for the library professional (Glendenning & Gordon, 1997, p. 258). Over
the past 25 years, libraries – particularly school libraries – have faced numerous challenges, for
example, new technologies that have changed the administration, circulation, and development
of collections and created the need for continuing education; declining school and library
budgets but an increasing demand for digital resources. “Professionals must assess their personal
strengths, develop leadership skills, understand how library users learn and foster creativity in

175

their staffs” (Glendenning & Gordon, 1997, p. 259). “In light of today’s world of turbulent and
unstable economic conditions, it can be argued that there exists an increased need for and
understanding of strategic leadership” (Golm, 2009, p. 1). With an increasingly complex and
ever-changing globalized environment in which organizations must now compete, it has become
clear that an organization’s capacity to change and innovate and to be highly adaptive,
responsive, and creative is essential to its long-term survival (Dess & Picken, 2000; Graen &
Graen, 2008; Hogan, Curphy, & Hogan, 1994; Yukl, 1998). Therefore, school library leaders
must be strategic thinkers and planners and must offer transformative leadership (Glendenning &
Gordon, 1997).
Riggs and Sabine (1988) examined the role played by professional associations in
fostering leadership development. They suggested that organizational membership assists in
establishing valuable contacts and provides opportunities to collaborate and work in groups,
including chairing meetings, participating in workshops, and demonstrating responsibility by
volunteering for committee work, etc. Gregor (1989, p. 188) supports this role of professional
associations:
Through membership in organizations and associations, library leaders can be developed
and practice leadership skills by virtue of holding office. Natural or recognized leaders
appreciate and utilize appropriate, and sometimes overlapping, organizational arenas to
exert influence. Service on boards, committees or task forces, as well as participation in
ground breaking invitational conferences, can promote leadership potential, enhance
influence and strength.
Many ISLMA interviewees (Anderson, 2011; Bloomstrand, 2010; Fisher, 2010; Karon,
2010; Kramer, 2010; Plourde, 2010; Robien, 2010; Roth, 2010; Sharka, 2011; Trewartha, 2010;
Winter, 2010) cited their experiences in association committee work, conference chairmanship,
church youth groups, even Girl Scouts, as aiding in the development not only of their leadership
skills but also for forming a network of support.

176

While all agree that technology is changing the nature of libraries and librarians’ roles,
professional associations exert a profound influence on the profession. The American Library
Association has produced ten separate publications whose primary focus is the definition or
delineation of appropriate roles for the school library media professional (Lea, 2013, p. 36). Its
latest document, Empowering Learners: Guidelines for School Library Programs (AASL, 2009),
defines five roles of the school librarian: teacher, instructional partner, information specialist,
program administrator, and leader. According to the American Association of School Librarians:
Leadership is integral to developing a successful school library program. As information
literacy and technology skills become central to learning, the school librarian must lead
the way in building 21st-century skills throughout the school environment. Doing so
involves a willingness to serve as a teacher and a learner who listens to and acts upon
good ideas from peers, teachers, and students. Leadership also requires increased
professional commitment and thorough knowledge of the challenges and opportunities
facing the profession. By becoming an active member of the local and global learning
community, the school librarian can build relationships with organizations and
stakeholders to develop an effective school library program and advocate for student
learning. (American Association of School Librarians, 2009, pp. 16-17)
Thus, the American Association of School Librarians (AASL) and the American Library
Association (ALA), professional library associations, support the development of this additional
role of leadership. In addition, my case study details the Illinois School Library Media
Association’s beginnings and efforts to develop and support this new role.

Overview
The development and growth of school libraries has been a long and arduous process
with little available documentation of its history. It was not until a change in the national
educational climate and the publication of standards for school library programs in the 1960s that
the need for certified school library professionals became explicit (Neuman, 2003).

177

In 1988, the American Association of School Librarians (AASL) and the Association for
Educational Communications and Technology (AECT) in their seminal work, Information
Power: Guidelines for School Library Media Programs, jointly defined the role of teacher
librarians and recognized their importance to the mission of the school – to develop critical
thinkers and users of information. To achieve the goals as outlined in this historic document,
ongoing professional development and support was and is needed. Thus, the creation of national
and local professional library organizations such as the American Library Association (ALA)
and Illinois Library Association (ILA) occurred. However, these organizations did not provide
the specialized network of support and training required by teacher librarians. Subsequent
organizations, for example the American Association of School Librarians (AASL) and the
Illinois Association for Media in Education (IAME), were developed that shared the unique
concerns of the school library media specialist.
The basis for my case study was an event that occurred on March 3, 1988, at the annual
Illinois Association for Media in Education (IAME) conference. A group of Illinois school
library media specialists, calling themselves The Friends of School Libraries, banded together to
break away from IAME, a section of the Illinois Library Association (ILA), and to create a
professional library organization focused solely on the needs of Illinois school librarians. Their
intent was to form an association designed, in their words, “to foster and improve school library
media service to the state of Illinois and to co-operate with other library and educational
organizations in meeting the information needs” of students and teachers (March 1988 ISLMA
Press Release, p. 1). Members said they took this step because they believed that IAME would
become a “forum” with “greatly reduced independence” under ILA’s proposed restructuring
plan. They felt that services and activities specifically designed to meet the needs of school

178

library media specialists would be eliminated or severely curtailed under the new structure. The
Friends of the School Libraries’ purpose was to continue providing professional educational
opportunities through conferences, workshops, and other similar activities such as awards,
scholarships, and recognition for retirees; improvements in certification and standards
requirements for school libraries; activities to ensure intellectual freedom; public recognition of
the importance of school libraries and certified personnel; passage of beneficial school library
legislation by the state; input to the Illinois State Board of Education, to AASL, and to state
educational organizations; and activities to meet the professional needs of non-members (March
1988 ISLMA Press Release). Thus, the Illinois School Library Media Association (ISLMA) was
founded to “serve the specific needs of school library media professionals” (1988 ISLMA Press
Release, p.2).
Since the early 1980s, the Illinois Library Association (ILA) has had a long history of
ignoring the needs of the IAME membership in favor of public, academic, and special librarians.
Therefore, the event in 1988 at the IAME annual conference became significant because it
represented the ILA’s membership making a dramatic shift in its dealings with ILA. By
approving the disbandment of IAME, the Friends of School Libraries recognized their
responsibility to determine and oversee the needs of school library media specialists in Illinois.
This case study lays the groundwork for a history of ISLMA, tracing its origins and
historical development from its birth in 1988 to its current status and is presented as both
narrative and oral history to give voice to the organization using archival records and the
recollection of individuals who were prominent in its birth and growth. What has emerged is
ISLMA’s continuous commitment to its stated purpose of advocacy – the public recognition of
the importance of school libraries and of certified personnel and of the personnel’s professional

179

development. ISLMA’s achievements have included the creation of a statewide literacy program,
the Illinois Young Readers’ Choice Awards; disaster aid and collection assistance to all school
libraries (state and national); grants to improve Illinois school library collections; and support of
research initiatives (The Illinois Study: Powerful Libraries Make Powerful Learners) as well as
professional and learning standards as outlined in Linking for Learning (1998, 2004, 2010) and
the Illinois Standards Aligned Instruction for Libraries, a state library media curriculum also
referred to as I-SAIL (ISLMA, 2008; 2011; 2015). ISLMA has grown from a membership of 500
in 1989 to over 1,100 today. Even during the recent economic downturn (the Great Recession
was a general global economic decline occurring in 2007-2009), it has continued to increase its
membership as many solo librarians seek professional support from this statewide network.
This study sought to document the rationale and events that resulted in the inception of a
new state school library organization—the Illinois School Library Media Association (ISLMA).
The research focused on archival documents from the Illinois School Library Association, the
Illinois Library Association (ILA), and the Illinois Association for Media in Education (IAME)
Archives at the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library in Springfield, Illinois. Additional archival
documents were located and examined at the ISLMA offices in Canton, Illinois, and the personal
files of interviewees (Adcock, Anderson, Bloomstrand, Corcoran, Fisher, Karon, Kramer,
Maynard, Plourde, Robien, Roth, Sharka, Slovinski, Trewartha, Winter). The archival research
targeted documents from the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000-2015 from the executive committees and
boards of directors from each organization. The people and events integral to the inception of
ISLMA emerged from this document analysis. This identification of key people, events, and
dates aided in the creation of a timeline of its history. In addition, interviews were conducted
with individuals associated with IAME and ISLMA. Using open-ended questions, the

180

participants were asked to recall the birth of ISLMA and their role in its development. Examined
in relation to the evolution of ISLMA, school library media history and related education and
library national standards and trends, this research is presented as a narrative.
To answer the research question, it was necessary to document the leadership
(organizational) and political (legislative) histories of ISLMA, which served as a guide for the
researcher in collecting and examining documents, records, and artifacts of the association. This
provided a framework for organizing, structuring, and crafting the narrative. The central research
question – what is the history of the Illinois School Library Media Association – was expanded
by two sets of sub-questions:
•

What does the leadership of ISLMA relate as important to the history of the
organization?

•

What are some of the interpretations of past and current events from the perspectives
of ISLMA leadership?

Topical themes emerged from the oral histories and focused on ISLMA’s advocacy, leadership,
communication, national and state political issues, teaching and learning standards, funding, and
literacy.
Topical histories are often used for focused studies of particular events, eras or
organizations ….An oral history project can foster appreciation for little-known or
rapidly vanishing ways of life... and recover and preserve important aspects of a human
experience that would otherwise go undocumented …. The true value of an oral history
interview is that it preserves a part of the past. It is, in itself, a piece of history. (Texas
Historical Commission, 2004, p. 3)
Wineburg (2001, p. 11) states that we “should see through the eyes of the people who
were there.” Given the lack of narrative accounts of the association’s founding, an oral history
approach suggested itself as an obvious way to augment a written record lacking in information
about its leadership, birth, and evolution. Initial interviews with the founders, the Friends of

181

School Libraries, and the inaugural 1988 Board of Directors were the starting point to chronicle
ISLMA’s birth followed by interviews with members of the 1998 and 2008 board of directors
and committee chairs. These interviews provided great insights into ISLMA’s growth and
direction during the 1990s and 2000s and focused on how ISLMA evolved in relation to AASL
and AECT’s (2008) joint publication, Information Power: Building Partnerships for Learning
(1998) and AASL’s (2009) release of Empowering Learners: Guidelines for School Library
Programs and Standards for the 21st-Century Learner (2007). This research was then examined in
relation to the maturation of ISLMA, school library media history and related education, and
library national standards and trends.

Implications of Findings
The review of national school library history and the resultant professional library
associations reiterated and confirmed several commonalities among Illinois school librarians. For
example, interviews with individuals integral to the Illinois School Library Media Association’s
foundation and development highlighted the following common themes: continuing education,
standards and guidelines, publications, awards, certification of school librarians, liaisons and
partnerships, community and communication, research, and advocacy (legislation and influence).
Advocacy
In an article exploring how to build advocacy for school libraries before a crisis arises,
Everhart and Mardis (2014, p. 27) shared why a lack of knowledge or concern is important:
More than 60 studies have shown that strong school library programs led by certified
school librarians are linked with higher student achievement levels. However, that
research has rarely been well disseminated beyond the profession. When it has,

182

administrators, policymakers, parents, and the general public have often ignored or
dismissed the results.
The chief mandate of the school library program is to craft a vision that will impact the
intellectual, social, and emotional development of every student. Barbara Stripling, immediate
past president of the American Library Association and an assistant professor in the School of
Information Studies at Syracuse University, states that this vision is to
enable all students to become independent readers and learners – in other words, to
develop into individuals who love to read; critically evaluate ideas as they read and view;
form their own opinions based on evidence; collaborate with their classmates to build
new understandings together; create products to share their ideas through multiple
formats; and develop attitudes of success like self-confidence and perseverance.
(Stripling, 2014, p. 5)
Charged with this mission, school librarians are leaders who make all stakeholders – students,
teachers, administrators, and parents – more effective. The school librarian must be an essential
partner, especially for all teachers, providing print and digital materials that meet diverse needs
and collaborating to deepen student learning (Young, Fiels, Grief, & Norton, 2014, p. 3).
The Illinois School Library Media Association identified the importance of advocacy for
school librarians and school libraries from its beginning. Its mission clearly outlined true
advocacy – standing up and speaking out for its members, their programs, and all Illinois
libraries – by creating standing committees and liaisons to work collaboratively with other
professional association, the state legislature, and the Illinois State Board of Education. ISLMA
espouses the belief that the voices of school librarians are most effective when joined with others
to advocate for students and student learning (Everhart & Mardis, 2014). Its long-range plan has
provided an “organized, purposeful way…to garner support for school libraries and school
librarians” (Everhart & Mardis, 2014, p. 29). ISLMA, through its endorsement and

183

implementation of standards, guidelines, and research studies, has continuously informed its
stakeholders about the profession when funding has been stable and/or in crisis mode.
Community and Communication
The library community is diverse and connected through a variety of means, particularly
its professional associations – the American Library Association (ALA), the American
Association of School Librarians (AASL), the Illinois Library Association (ILA), and the Illinois
School Library Media Association (ISLMA). All of these organizations represent their
membership and are governed by bylaws and policies. Each association’s membership elects
four officers (president, president-elect, past president, and treasurer) and a board of directors.
William Fisher (1997, p. 1) states that “membership organizations thrive on the input of
their members.”
Indeed, members can be the lifeblood of an organization. This imbues a challenge to
professional associations to constantly and assiduously communicate and inspire its
values to its constituents. This will keep the members active and supportive, and will
propel an association’s movement towards its goals and objectives. (Yap & Alejo, 2015,
p. 9)
Cognizant of its mission to its community, Illinois school librarians, ISLMA has sought its
members’ input through open meetings, leadership institutes, surveys, and other communication
tools. ISLMA’s communication methods have evolved from the paper newsletters of the 1980s
and 1990s to 21st-century email blasts and electronic newsletters. ISLMA maintains a website
that provides access to all executive functions: its membership directory, forms, Executive Board
meeting minutes, links to standing committees, the Illinois Young Readers’ Choice Awards,
conference/workshop registration, and ISLMANET-L, a nationally recognized electronic
listserv/blog (ISLMA website, 2015). Cognizant of the need to continually keep abreast of new

184

communication technologies, ISLMA announced the launching of ISLMA-Share, a replacement
for ISLMANET-L, which will be hosted through RAILS, one of the state’s multi-type library
systems (ISLMA News, March April May 2016). Aware of its commitment to meet the needs of
all Illinois school libraries, ISLMA continues to schedule its meetings and events throughout the
state. To avoid the hours lost in traveling to and from a central location for Executive Board
Meetings, ISLMA has even implemented virtual/online meetings to ensure that all may attend.
Jane Sharka, ISLMA past president, executive board director, and committee and
conference chair, shared the importance of maintaining open ties of communication with other
organizations such as the Illinois Library Association, the State Board of Education, etc.:
I’ve seen more unity between the public, school, and academic librarians, than any of the
years prior to this [2010], part of it is the financial issue that’s forcing us to work
together, part of it is a broader understanding in the library community of how
interdependent we are and the publics and the academics have finally realized that all of
us are doing the same thing and by working together we accomplish more. They finally
reached the point where inter-communication shows that we really aren’t that different. I
went to a forum that the state library hosted probably fifteen years ago in Mundelein.
They had librarians, academic, public, special and school there. They had posted big
sheets [of paper] around the room and asked [each group] to write down [on their sheet]
the history that you remember, what are the battles you fought, so forth. Well, it was
really fun to watch these public and academic librarians realize we’ve all been doing the
same thing. We have the same problems. You’re not so different from us. That was a
huge, huge gap to fill for them intellectually, emotionally. And ever since that point, I’ve
seen a lot more communication…Lou Ann Jacobs, our legislative liaison, has
communicated to both sides very well and the Illinois Library Association has huge
respect for her and a lot of legislators do too. (Interview 2010)

Continuing Education
With the importance of professional development in mind (as both a revenue producer
and as a response to member needs), associations should keep their professional development
activities fairly prominent. This has always been at the forefront of ISLMA’s mission and longrange planning. However, ISLMA has always been open to partnerships that will support Illinois
libraries, particularly school library media centers. Through the advocacy efforts of ISLMA
leadership and the Illinois Library Association, multi-type library systems were proposed. The
Illinois General Assembly, aware of its fiscal responsibility to the public schools in Illinois and
“because the public library is a vital agency serving all levels of the educational process,” passed
legislation to assist public libraries and promote the sharing of library resources among all types
of Illinois libraries (Illinois Library Systems Act, 1965). Funding was approved in the form of
grants to “establish, develop and operate a network of library systems covering the entire state”
(Illinois Library Systems Act, 1965). This multi-type library system provided services such as
interlibrary loan delivery, technology support for shared online catalogs, talking book services
(materials for persons with visual or physical disabilities who cannot read conventional print),
and continuing education. The membership of the library systems included academic, public,
school, and special libraries. However, in 2011 with Illinois impacted by the economic recession,
the library system funding was drastically reduced and systems were forced to close their doors
and merge into two multi-type regional library systems – the Reaching Across Illinois Library
System (RAILS) and the Illinois Heartland System. The Chicago Public Library is considered a
separate library system. Funding for Illinois library systems is provided through the Illinois State
Library and the Secretary of State, with funds appropriated by the Illinois General Assembly.

186

As of this writing (2015), professional development opportunities previously sponsored
by the systems for school librarians are virtually nonexistent. Continuing education workshops
are offered both in person and via video conferencing or webinar but school-library-related
topics are few. Jane Sharka relates:
I can’t talk about school librarianship without telling my colleagues about the things
we’ve done in Illinois. We fought hard alongside the public librarians to get a multi-type
library system in this state and I think the rest of the country kind of envies us for that.
We may lose parts of it because of the current financial crisis but they’re all in worse
shape because they never had it. (Interview 2010)
As a result of this decrease in systems, ISLMA has now become the leading provider in the state
for continuing education for school librarians. As mentioned before, ISLMA partnered with the
Illinois Library Association (ALA) to host a joint conference in fall 2015, making this the largest
recent professional event for Illinois librarians. However, Illinois Computing Educators (ICE), an
organizational affiliate of the International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE), claims it
is the leader in supporting and promoting innovative education for all (ICE website, 2015). The
mission of Illinois Computing Educators is to lead the educational community in enhancing
learning through technology. ICE’s development occurred simultaneously with that of the
Illinois School Library Media Association and mirrors its growth. In 1986, a group of
approximately 30 educators met to discuss the possibility of forming a statewide organization for
computer-using educators. Since its inception, ICE has steadily grown. The organization has
continually expanded its membership and has shown leadership in encouraging the development,
growth, and use of technology in all facets of the educational process. ICE has come a long way
in a short time. It continues to grow and change based on the needs of its members. Its
membership is comprised of teachers, school librarians, administrators, and specialists. Their
goals are to “support and provide professional development opportunities in educational

187

technology through collaborative communities” and “build relationships with other organizations
by being the premier education technology visionary and voice for Illinois” (ICE website, 2015).
The annual conference, webinars, and workshops offered by the organization and its nine
regional chapters aim to “share ideas and explore new instructional technology resources” (ICE,
2015). Both ISLMA’s and Illinois Computing Educators’ birth and development coincide with
AASL’s and AECT’s groundbreaking standards Information Power: Guidelines for School
Library Media Programs (1988) and the demise of the Illinois Association for Media in
Education (IAME). It is fair to say that the explosion of information technologies over the past
30 years has brought profound change to our classrooms and library media centers.
In today’s schools a host of learning specialists have joined classroom teachers in
working with students. These specialists provide instruction for students, and, frequently,
training for teachers. They range from library media specialists and reading resource teachers to
technology coordinators and math coaches (Zmuda & Harada, 2008, p. 42). However, school
librarians are charged “to play a leading role in weaving such skills [skills and knowledge they
need to succeed in the technological society of the 21st century] throughout the curriculum so
that all members of the school community are effective users of ideas and information” (AASL,
2009, p. 46). The integration of technology into the curricular areas is where school librarians
can serve as leaders and valuable assets to their learning communities.

188

Leadership: Evolution of Role of School Librarian
Technology is an integral part of the 21st-century teacher librarian's professional life.
From the circulation system to professional communications, technology provides the tools
needed in today's information-rich world. The teacher librarian uses technology for information,
instruction, administration, collaboration, and communication (Lamb & Johnson, 2013).
Historically, the teacher librarian is “a primary leader in the school’s use of all kinds of
technologies – both instructional and information to enhance learning (AASL & AECT, 1998, p.
54). This means “today’s effective teacher librarian should serve a key role in the selection of,
the instruction about, and utilization of electronic resources and technology tools” (Lamb &
Johnson, 2013). Teacher librarians should not only model the “effective application of
instructional software and technology tools in their planning documents, presentations and
lessons, and professional communications” but “continually look for ways to effectively partner
with students, teachers, administrators, and other support personnel in the effective use of
technology tools” (Lamb & Johnson, 2013). As school districts move to 1:1 technology
initiatives (one computing device per student), teachers and students are immersed in
technology-rich environments that require guidance and support. The International Society for
Technology in Education (ISTE) has developed standards for technology coaches, those
specifically charged with “helping teachers develop their confidence and effectiveness in
designing and supporting technology-rich environments that maximize student learning” (ISTE,
2015, p. 1). California school districts have noted an increase in instructional coaches to assist
with the demands of implementing the Common Core State Standards (Williams, 2015).
Williams raises the question of whether this has occurred because of the Common Core State

189

Standards or as a direct result of many California school districts’ elimination of school
librarians.
In a Knowledge Quest article entitled “School Librarian + Technology Specialist:
Partnership for Effective Technology Integration,” Johnston (2013b, p. 71) stressed the
“importance of the school librarian and technology coach working collaboratively, when both
positions are present.” Citing that “school librarians were once the sole person responsible for
technology in schools,” Johnston states, “But now the increased presence of instructional
technologists has resulted in school librarians who may no longer be seen as the technology
integration expert in the school” (p. 71). An instruction technologist is defined as “a buildinglevel person who works with teachers to provide effective technology integration within specific
lessons and serves as an instructional expert by providing advice on when and how to
incorporate appropriate technology into a lesson” (Sugar & Holloman, 2009, p. 66).
The influx of technology integrationists labeled as technology specialists, technology
coaches, and digital-age learning coaches has led to a demand for further definition of the role of
school librarians in technology integration. In 2010 the International Society for Technology in
Education (ISTE) issued an advocacy statement, “The Role of School Librarians in Promoting
the Use of Educational Technologies,” that attempts to define and describe the relationship
between the school librarian and instructional technology (Johnston, 2013b, p. 71). Research on
the complex relationship between the school librarian and the instructional technologist has
found that “to collaborate, it is important for these professionals to develop an understanding of
both roles and in what areas they overlap” (p. 73). “The relationship was found to serve as an
enabler when the relationship is collaborative and as a barrier when the relationship is
competitive” (p. 72).

190

"The mission of the American Association of School Librarians (AASL) is to advocate
excellence, facilitate change, and develop leaders in the school library field" (AASL, 2012). The
guidelines that guide the profession call for school librarians to become leaders within their
schools, and technology integration provides an area in which leadership opportunities exist for
school librarians. Yet, many school librarians experience difficulty enacting this role in practice
due to the confusion and ambiguity surrounding school librarians' role in technology integration
(Everhart, Mardis, & Johnston, 2011; Johnston, 2012; McCracken, 2001; Shannon, 2002). As
the profession looks for ways to cultivate and develop leaders, especially in the area of
technology integration, mentoring through professional organizations has emerged as an
important factor in enabling leadership (Johnston, 2012).

Leadership: Transformative vs. Transactional
The theoretical framework of this study included an examination of leadership theory
(transactional and transformative) based on the work of Bass and Avolio (1994), Bass (1997a,
1997b), Burns (1978, 2003), and Bass and Riggio (2006). Transformational leadership – the
ability to perceive opportunities, to engage emotionally with individuals in pursuit of higher
goals, to inspire groups of followers, and to develop and articulate a vision – has been associated
with the ability to enact organizational change (Gabriel, 2008, p. 1). Although there are variances
in how transformational leadership is defined, it is essentially understood as leadership and/or
leaders who can facilitate and guide organizations through sometimes revolutionary change; who
are able to develop and gain commitment to organizational visions; who connect to followers,
encouraging them to perform beyond expectations; and who possess important behaviors and
characteristics that support organizational transformation (p. 1). “In contrast, transactional

191

leaders are thought of as maintainers of the status quo and stability. Their interactions with
followers involve motivating their performance in exchange for valued goods or meeting the
follower’s material and psychological needs” (Golm, 2009, p. 2). Furthermore, there is an
“implicit assumption in the literature that transformational leaders are agents of organizational
change” (p. 2).
Interviewees of this research study were queried about their leadership vision – would
they consider themselves to be a transactional or transformational leader – and whether they
considered the ISLMA founders to be change agents. In referencing this leadership type, Jane
Sharka related:
You spend hours and hours on the road traveling to meetings; you spend hours and hours
working on documents and revising and organizing and planning. You have a blast with
the friends you make if that’s the transaction, that’s it. But nobody else cares about all the
work you did and all the hours you spent. They don’t see them, they don’t know about
them, and you don’t care about them because that’s just what has to be done to do this. It
needs to be done. But I think that holds true in a lot of ways for the profession. People
who go into this don’t go into it for the fame and the money. There isn’t any. You do it
because you care. (Interview 2010)
Joyce Karon, ISLMA’s first secretary, shared her definition of change agent:
It depends on how you define change agent. A change agent can be a superintendent; a
school board can hire a superintendent to be a change agent who will make radical
changes. But it depends on your definition of change agent. If you see a change agent as
somebody who builds confidence and slowly puts things in place and has a plan that, over
a period of time, implements change, then yes, I would say I was a change agent ….I
think that when we became ISLMA, we ceased being just a group of librarians that got
together and had conferences. We became leaders in the field. ISLMA was a much more
proactive organization than IAME ever had been….ISLMA’s birth was not structured or
planned; it was the need of what needed to be done. We saw what needed to be done and
we did it. (Interview 2010)
Lois Farrell Fisher stated that librarians are in the “right place” to be considered change agents:
I think that school librarians are as uniquely positioned to be change agents because we
are more likely to have a broader view. We are connected with all the departments. We’re
connected and I think ISLMA is a big part of that because this is where we go to
conferences, we’re in touch with each other, we learn from each other, and we’re not

192

focused on a narrow area. We’re more inclined to be big picture people and I think the
more we are involved in what goes on in our schools, the more likely we are to be able to
participate in change in our schools and to help bring it about. (Interview 2010).
Eleanor “Kek” Robien seconded Fisher’s view:
You have to have a vision. You have to be a little step ahead of everybody. A change
agent is always looking at something ahead of him. That’s what we are uniquely qualified
to do. … We accepted the position of leaders as well I think by just having done this
unconventional thing. The changes from being, it changed us into leaders, at least for me
it did. (Interview 2010).
Several interviewees additionally expressed concern for the future of ISLMA’s leadership
as its active leaders retire. Others mentioned a leadership clique – key officer positions filled by
the same individuals rather than seeking out new members. However, ISLMA Past President
Jane Sharka related how this is changing:
I think we’ve broken the back on cliques controlling the leadership. I used to complain
about the same people who were always officers and nobody else ever got the chance and
when I came back on the board as president-elect [2008], I said to Caroline Campbell,
ISLMA executive treasurer, “You know we’re them now.” And I just laughed because,
yes, I am back [in a leadership role]. But they [the board] recognized that it wasn’t “I’m
here in this position because I like control.” Those same people were there because
nobody else was there to do the job and it needed to be done….People are afraid to step
into leadership roles. With an organization like ISLMA, they shouldn’t be afraid of it
because we’re all in the same boat and if you have a chance to be there to encourage the
others, get in the boat and let’s go forward and row together, that’s a good thing. I am
thrilled to see new members [taking a leadership role] because while they’re my
contemporaries in some ways, they’re the next generation coming up. They look at things
differently, which is a good thing. They look at it from that generation’s point of view.
I’m retired. I can walk, step away, I can find another career and I don’t have to worry
about that [ISLMA]. It’s in good hands…I trust them. Just hope there are more coming
up behind them to fill in the holes because someday Kay [Maynard, ISLMA first
president and executive secretary] and Caroline [Campbell, ISLMA past president and
financial secretary] are going to quit and people have to be there who are open-minded
enough to take their places without holding on to it and saying “It’s mine and I’m going
to be the one that’s going to control it.” And we’ve had some people like that in the past.
They wanted the job because it’s an ego trip. They may not recognize it that way, but it
is…But sometimes if you’re wise as a leader, you look to the future by trying to bring
people in and mentoring them in or just say, you are going to do this job. If you don’t, [as
an organization] you die. If parents quit having children, there’s nobody to leave the
world to.

193

Pam Kramer discussed what prepared a person for a leadership role:
I was always pretty bossy, you know, and I think somehow that comes out but then you
get older, you mellow and you have to build a level of trust and it is a trust issue when
you are in a leadership role. I think you set a vision, you have a goal to reach, and then
you let everybody contribute because [you realize] you don’t have all the right answers,
there’s no way I do, and there’s no way I could do a conference by myself. I need all
these other people to take on all these other little minutiae pieces. But I know enough to
say to someone, I trust you, we’ll get this done, and, you know, generally I have not been
disappointed.
Kramer also shared how ISLMA leadership has been transforming:
I suppose when I was younger, it was all about being important because you want to be
recognized and want people to know you’re there and then you reach a point and say it
doesn’t matter whether I am recognized or not, this is something I am going to do. In the
end it’s not about getting credit for me. It’s about making the experience or the
conference or the job not just better for the librarians; the bottom line is for the kids in all
of this. It’s not, it cannot be, about us as individuals. It’s not about me. It’s about how
you make the experience better in the end for the kids. It’s got to be. And if we aren’t in
that for the kids, then why are we doing it. ... All I can remember [IAME vote to separate
from Illinois Library Association] is that really scared feeling in the pit of my stomach
because I’m stepping on a cliff and was it something, did I have enough courage to do
that because I didn’t ever consider myself a very courageous person. I was always, you
know, kind of don’t have that much nerve to go off and do that. It was amazing. It was a
transformation for me to realize that we could do this. And then I think, you know, some
of my best friends are people that I have met through ISLMA and people that, you know,
that I would never have met any other way. And that’s kind of the way it was with AASL
too. There are people that I have met like David Loerstcher and Betty Marcoux; all of
these people and I would never have had these opportunities and I’m never going to be
like them. We made a difference for libraries and school librarians in Illinois.
Transformational leadership as defined by ISLMA’s founders is a leadership approach
that causes change in individuals and the organization. It creates valuable and positive change in
its membership through mentorship, with the end goal of developing followers into leaders. This
leadership vision works to connect school librarians through a shared identity and a common
mission by providing role models and mentors for others, understanding their members’
strengths and weaknesses, and being able to identify tasks to which they are suited. ISLMA still

194

sponsors a leadership development institute each summer to identify, recruit, and mentor new
leaders for the future from its membership (ISLMA Long Range Strategic Plan, 2013, p. 4).

Leadership: Mentorship and Professional Organizations
Mentoring has been recognized as a critical component in leadership development, and effective
mentoring is essential to the growth and success of librarianship of all types (Freedman, 2009).
Mentoring, the “process whereby a more experienced individual provides counsel, guidance, and
assistance to another person, serves an essential function in helping younger or newer employees
to develop leadership skills and advance within the organization” (Lanna-Lipton, 2009).
Professional organizations have made the development of new leaders a top priority and
recognized that mentoring is a critical component of leadership development (Davidson &
Middleton, 2007; Zabel, 2008). Mentoring is also a critical component of sustaining the
leadership of the organization and the profession. Not only are professional organizations
mentoring individuals to assume leadership responsibilities within the organization, but by
extension are developing leaders for the profession. “It is the role of current leaders in an
organization to cultivate future leaders, and mentoring can be used as a strategy for growing
leaders” (Davidson & Middleton, 2007, p. 350). Through both formal programs and informal
opportunities, professional organizations can help members of the profession connect with more
experienced professionals who can offer practical advice and career guidance (Johnston, 2012).
This study’s interviewees identified that a mentoring and supportive relationship from
respected colleagues, particularly those based on their shared profession of school librarianship,
was a strong resource for validation and guidance. Too often there is only one school librarian
within a building, thus “the importance of professional organizations as a means of developing

195

and maintaining relationships with other school librarians who share the same interests, can act
as mentors, and can provide support to facilitate school librarians’ involvement in technology
integration leadership” takes on greater significance (Johnston, 2012, p. 37). The interviewees
repeatedly mentioned the isolation of being the sole library professional in their school buildings
and the support that ISLMA provided though publications (newsletters, listserv, and guidelines)
and professional growth opportunities (conferences, workshops).
Literacy: Illinois Young Readers’ Choice Awards
The annual Illinois Young Readers’ Choice Awards were considered by several study
interviewees (Plourde, Slovinski, Trewartha) to be ISLMA’s lasting legacy. The Illinois School
Library Media Association supports three awards voted on by Illinois student readers, the
Abraham Lincoln Award (high school grades 9-12), the Bluestem Award (intermediate grades 35), and the Monarch Award (primary grades K-3). ISLMA also supports the Rebecca Caudill
Young Readers’ Book Award (intermediate, middle, and junior high grades 4-8), a separate
entity sponsored by the Illinois Council of Teachers of English (ICTE) and the Illinois Reading
Council (IRC) as well as the Illinois School Library Media Association (ISLMA).
The first step in the Illinois Young Readers’ Choice Awards process requires students,
and even adults, to make book recommendations to each award’s steering committee. Just as
with nominations of candidates to political office, students nominate favorite titles for
consideration. The next step requires the students of Illinois to read each of the nominees.
ISLMA and the Rebecca Caudill Steering Committee provide a variety of resources for
educators and librarians to promote the nominated books prior to student voting. Any Illinois
school, public or private, may participate. A registration fee gives each organization access to

196

resources and to submit their ballot totals online. The purpose of each award is to encourage
children and young adults to read for personal satisfaction; to develop a statewide awareness of
outstanding literature for children and young adults; to promote a desire for literacy; and to
encourage cooperation among Illinois agencies providing educational and library service to
young people. However, at times there is an appearance of disunity between the awards
sponsors. There is no consistency in how the award committees operate, although each has
guidelines detailing its operation. The Rebecca Caudill Award winning title is announced at
Northern Illinois University’s annual children’s literature conference, while the ISLMA award
winners (Monarch, Bluestem, and Abraham Lincoln) are announced at school libraries
throughout the state. Any school that has the capability of doing a live Internet stream is eligible
to apply for the honor (ISLMA News, November December 2013, January 2014). The release of
the nominated book titles varies among the awards committees. However, over one thousand
Illinois schools participate, according to Becky Robinson, ISLMA executive secretary. The
Readers’ Choice Awards and the Caudill not only promote reading but “reaffirm that, yes, there
is reading going on. People say kids don’t read anymore but they do. It might not be like we read
– for some it might be e-reading – but it’s reading” (cited in Cary, 2014).

Recommendations
Through the past thirty years many outstanding school library media programs (Robert E.
Clow Elementary School, Downers Grove South High School, New Trier Township High
School, Maine Township High School West) have been developed in Illinois, but it must also be
stated that there are still many schools without adequate library facilities or budgets or not
staffed with licensed school library professionals. It is apparent that ISLMA still needs to

197

continue its mission and long-range plan of action for the support and extension of library media
services in Illinois schools, particularly elementary schools in the fiscally challenged Chicago
Public Schools.
The reorganization of multi-type library systems (a network comprised of any academic,
public, school or special library located within a specified service area) in Illinois has spurred
ISLMA’s continual commitment to provide continuing education and professional development
for its school librarians. Its focus could include the areas of technology integration and
collaboration in the instructional design process as well as the selection of appropriate
instructional materials and resources (print and/or digital). Easy access to information sources
gives teachers and students an almost limitless supply of resource materials. Hence it is
important that school librarians continue to develop their selection skills to include new
resources and technologies. Recent research (Everhart & Mardis, 2014; Johnston, 2013b;
Stripling, 2014) validates ISLMA’s commitment to supporting Illinois school librarians. Thus,
the development of a more formal mentorship program by ISLMA that would foster school
librarians’ collaborative and leadership role as a technology integration specialist and
professional development leader is imperative. Opportunities for research and sharing of
practical experiences in this arena will help school librarians identify strategies to develop
collaborative relationships with their technology counterparts. A local research study (a survey
of Illinois librarians’ role and relationship with technology and professional development and
other specialists) and/or workshops focused on technology integration will be beneficial. These
types of activities will aid in the fostering of communication and advocacy and assist in the
avoidance of territorial battles over technology resources, access, and professional leadership.

198

ISLMA must continue to take the lead in demonstrating how to create a strong school
library program. One component of a strong program is a librarian. In this current age of
accountability in which all staff members must be effective contributors to student success, the
importance of school librarians collecting solid evidence of the impact of their teaching must be
a priority. “School librarians who follow trends and research in librarianship will note three
interrelated initiatives that can help build effective school library programs: the learning
commons (LC) mode, evidence-based practice (EFP), and co-teaching” (Moreillon, 2016, p. 8).
Moreillon (2016, p. 8) characterizes the learning commons as a “school-wide approach to
envisioning, organizing, and facilitating learning in the library’s physical and virtual spaces. It
involves engaging students, faculty, administrators, families, and community in using library
resources and prioritizing the work of the school librarian.” The transition from a library to a
learning commons is more than a facilities redesign. David Loertscher and Carol Koechlin
(2014) define it as the following:
The learning commons serves school curriculum but also is known as a place for
experimenting, playing, making, doing, thinking, collaborating, and growing. For
example, it may be the only place in the school where the networks are open; it may be
the place where clients are experimenting with the latest 3-D printer; it may be the virtual
hub of school activities. Although the learning commons will look and feel different in
every school, it must be the center of inquiry, digital citizenship, project-based learning,
collaborative intelligence, advanced literacy, as well as the center of creating,
performing, and sharing. It will sometimes take on a role as “third space,” neither home
nor school. It is the place young people love—their space. (p. E3)
With all students, educators, and administrators involved, the learning commons becomes the
site for authentic, participatory learning experiences for students and adults (Moreillon, 2016).
As a hub of learning, school improvement efforts will be focused on the new library in which
educators are designing instruction and students are creating new knowledge. School librarians
must be involved in this philosophical redesign of their classroom but also take the lead. They

199

must embrace another leadership opportunity by helping schools develop policies and practices
for BYOD (bring your own mobile device to school) and/or 1:1 computing device initiatives.
The Common Core State Standards specify the development of content-specific, gradelevel student learning objectives (SLOs) that are measurable, focused on growth in student
learning, and aligned to curriculum standards. As a measure of teachers’ impact on student
learning, these instructional goals’ primary purpose is to improve student learning at the
classroom level and provide evidence of each teacher’s instructional impact on student learning,
including the school librarian. Thus, the instructional role of the school librarian will be assessed
just as any other K-12 teacher and/or specialist. In my professional experience as an educator,
this assessment is to inform ongoing instruction but is also considered part of a teacher’s
professional evaluation by building and/or school district administrators.
ISLMA has taken the lead in assisting Illinois school librarians with the development of
SLOs for K-12 library programs.
With guidance from the State Board of Education, the SLO ISLMA Task Force has
completed three sample SLOs and rubrics for use in school libraries: one for elementary,
one for junior high, and one for high school. Each SLO focuses on a research skill that
supports the importance of our jobs. Hopefully, school librarians in Illinois will use these
exemplars to strive towards these student objectives and assessments. (ISLMA website,
2015r)
Seeking input from ISLMA membership throughout 2014, the task force presented the SLO
templates (sample measurable units of study) at workshops, webinars, and at the annual
conference. ISLMA must stay ahead of educational trends and shifts in educational pedagogy
and practice.
In my opinion, ISLMA will continue to be forward thinking as the school library
profession awaits the release of the new standards in 2017. Linking for Learning (ISLMA, 2010)
is “an accessible, current, working tool that connects school library media programs to

200

information literacy and the Illinois Learning Standards. Linking for Learning focuses on the
integration of information and technology into learning. It provides an implementation
framework that emphasizes planning and assessment” (ISLMA website, 2015l). ISLMA will
revise this tool in 2017 with the release of AASL’s program guidelines (Green, personal
communication, 2015).
Passage of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA, 2015) enhances the authority of states
and school districts beyond its predecessor, the No Child Left Behind Act (Klein, 2016). This
new lawa uthorizes, but does not require, school districts to develop plans describing how
effective school library programs will provide students an opportunity to develop digital literacy
skills and improve academic achievement. Illinois school librarians have already integrated
digital literacy into their curriculum framework, the Illinois Standards Aligned Instruction for
Libraries (ISLMA, 2015e), guided by the ISTE standards. The I-SAIL document is to “empower,
educate, and encourage school library information specialists to plan strategically with other
teachers to incorporate information literacy skills in lessons and thereby provide college and
career readiness for students” (ISLMA, 2015e). However, ESSA does not define an effective
school library program or mandate school librarian staffing. Angie Green, ISLMA president, has
requested the ISLMA Board of Directors to establish a task force or committee to “begin
working on the next steps for Illinois School Libraries” in light of ESSA (Green, 2016, p. 1). As
ISLMA looks toward the future the implications for the field of educational technology should
be considered.

201

Implications for the Field of Librarianship and Educational/Instructional Technology
An understanding of the history of this field and the development of this profession aid
the Illinois school library professional in determining his/her purpose and place within the field
of library history. As Powell and Connaway (2004, p. 213) state, “A knowledge and
understanding of their profession’s history can help librarians build on the past in an efficient,
effective manner to avoid reinventing the wheel and to develop new theories and systems to
advance the profession.” Additionally, Shiflett (1984, p. 387) examined the role of historical
research in library and information science and determined that “history at least as much and
perhaps more than other research methods, provides librarians with a context. It is only through
history that we can begin to make sense of the environment in which we work.” This study
provides a context to examine the individuals and events that have contributed to the growth of
school librarianship as a profession and to the field of educational technology.
The explosion of technology and its use in the educational setting has radically altered the
nature of the school librarian’s role from the guardian of the print volume to that of the library
information technologist (Neuman, 2004). This case study provides a historical record of
ISLMA’s origins for study by current and future school library media specialists and
instructional technology professionals. It also provides a context to examine oral history as a
research methodology, which may prove to be helpful to the historical study of educational
technology. Oral history’s full potential has not yet been realized in librarianship (McCombs &
Busha, 1981, p. 90). Because ISLMA and AECT share a similar history, this study may also
prove to be a rich resource for others in the field of educational technology to explore.

202

Interviews with ISLMA’s leadership indicated that biography should be a major
emphasis within library and educational technology research. Graduate programs in library and
information science no longer require future librarians to study the history of their field. This
lack of knowledge of who are the individuals who have helped shape the library profession may
lead to misunderstanding between the multi-generations of librarians currently employed within
the field.
A substantial body of work on important, and even lesser known, figures can add
substantially to our knowledge of “how generations of librarians viewed, performed and realized
what they considered their professional role in society” (Shiflett, 1984, p. 391). A major role
aspect of librarianship is that of keeping records of others, whether in print or media. The
availability of primary sources and, in many cases, that of secondary sources for biographical
studies of leaders in both library science and educational technology is problematic. Thus, a
coordinated oral history project among these fields and professional associations is necessary to
capture the knowledge of those who made their professional contributions in the first half of the
twentieth century. While access to early leaders has been lost, an oral history project represents a
potential resource of tremendous value for future librarians, technologists, and historians. “Used
in conjunction with archival materials, printed primary and secondary sources, and other oral
history interviews, these promise a new horizon in resources for library and educational
technology history” (Shiflett, 1984, p. 392).
It is important to note that all but two of this study’s narrators are women. First, because
a higher percentage of women than men fill the ranks of the school library profession, it seemed
appropriate to reflect this reality when choosing witnesses for this history (Gage, 2007, p. 6).
Second, despite the fact that the inverse has been true in terms of the gender ratio of individuals

203

peopling the highest position in librarianship, women have occupied a generous percentage of
ISLMA’s leadership positions, and the selection in this study reflects that reality. This research
study can “help establish the context in which librarians work and it can fulfill their functions in
society” (Gage, 2007, p. 6), particularly that of the status of women in librarianship.
Viability of Libraries and Professional Associations
As stated earlier in the discussion of leadership, many interviewees expressed their
concern for ISLMA’s future and that of school librarianship (Baule, 2012; Karon, 2010; Kramer,
2010; Plourde, 2012; Roth, 2010). Barron (1993, p. 49) states, “We are without a doubt at a
crossroads in education, which will impact our jobs as library and information professionals.
This could be the hour of decision about whether our part of the profession continues to exist.”
The Great Recession (2007-2009), as defined by the National Bureau of Economic Research,
forced the elimination of school librarian positions, funding cuts to school library programs, and
reorganization of Illinois’s multi-type library systems. “All associations serve some purpose and
provide some kind of value when they are first organized. However, if that purpose and value
cannot be sustained over time, the association loses its support and goes out of business” (W.
Fisher, 1997, p. 1). ISLMA has also felt the effects of the economic downturn in its membership
numbers, conference/workshop attendance, and educational outreach activities (ISLMA
Minutes).
Thus, the viability of all libraries has come into question with the lack of funding, the
transition to digital resources and virtual libraries, and the evolution in facilities’ design from the
quiet repository of books to a learning commons. It would behoove the Illinois School Library
Media Association to work with its sister organizations – the Illinois Library Association (School

204

Library Forum) and the Illinois Association of Educational Communication and Technology
(Division of School Media and Technology) – as well as the Illinois Computing Educators (ICE)
to promote and improve communication among its members. These associations share a common
history, mission, and vision (Alsworth, 1980). They are also vying for the same membership –
professionals with educational technology expertise and instructional experience.
Viability and Funding
The passage and signing of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) in December 2015 is
a milestone for school libraries in the United States. This major reauthorization bill replaces No
Child Left Behind (NCLB) and is an overhaul of K-12 education policy. It is a significant and
important reset of national education policy and funding options for school library programs.
AASL President Leslie Preddy said, “For school-age students, ESSA represents an historic new
chapter in federal support of education, one that will ensure effective school library programs are
there to help them learn how to use new technology tools, develop critical thinking, and the
reading and research skills essential to achievement in science, math and all other ‘STEM’
fields” (ALA District Dispatch, 2015). In addition, ALA President Sari Feldman stated, “School
libraries and school librarians are really recognized as critical education partners in this bill” and
“it will also strengthen state mandates around libraries” (ALA District Dispatch, 2015).
The ESSA Act also authorizes the education secretary to “award grants, contracts, or
cooperative agreements, on a competitive basis” to promote literacy programs in low-income
areas, including “developing and enhancing effective school library programs” (ESSA, 2015).
Those funds can go toward library resources and providing professional development for school
librarians. States and districts can also use Title II funds for “supporting the instructional services

205

provided by effective school library programs” (ESSA, 2015). The bill additionally encourages
local education agencies to assist schools in developing effective school library programs, in part
to help students gain digital skills. This will move the focus of library advocacy efforts to the
local level. Thus, it is essential that ISLMA continue to advocate for Illinois school library
programs and school librarians. It is imperative that school librarians have a visible and active
presence as local authorities (Illinois legislature and school district administrations) determine
funding for Illinois libraries and technology. ISLMA must continue to educate and communicate
this message to its membership.
Summary
The objective of this case study was to document the birth and development of an Illinois
professional association, the Illinois School Library Media Association, and detail this process
through the participants’ eyes. My interviews and research have led me to conclude that ISLMA
has reached professional maturity. It has worked toward building an organization based on the
needs of its membership – Illinois school librarians – and continues to provide leadership and
support within this field, thereby validating the importance of school libraries and school
librarians in Illinois. Furthermore, even with new federal legislation such as ESSA, the Illinois
library community as a whole must work with ISLMA and state education officials to educate
legislators on how effective school library programs led by licensed school librarians can
improve their students’ academic achievement and enhance the performance of schools that offer
these programs. Additionally, as the core of ISLMA leadership has or is now retiring from the
profession, this organization is opening its doors to allow new trailblazers to emerge.

206

As with all histories, there is much more to be shared than was related in this case study.
Some interviewees seemed reluctant to fully relate their experiences, whether through memory
loss, fear of “disrespecting” others, or because they felt it should not be stated or part of this
record. Future historians may be able to re-examine these oral histories without such
constrictions. Sadly, others who could have lent a balanced voice are now deceased – the
interviewees are an aging group. Thus, this case study reflects the common memory rather than
all memories. ISLMA’s mission crafted in 1988 is still vital, its foundation is still strong, and its
leadership will, I believe, continue to persevere as it embarks on its next thirty years.
