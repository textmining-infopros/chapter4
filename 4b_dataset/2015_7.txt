Priyanto, Ida F. Readiness of Indonesian Academic Libraries for Open Access and Open
Access Repositories Implementation: A Study on Indonesian Open Access Repositories
Registered in OpenDOAR. Doctor of Philosophy (Information Science), August 2015, 194 pp.,
38 tables, 24 figures and 105 references.
Scholarly and scientific communication has a long history, while the Open Access (OA)
movement began to take part in this communication with the emergence of Internet in the late
1960s and the web that emerged in mid-1990s. OA is beneficial for sharing knowledge because
the OA movement demands scholarly literature freely available on the internet and it is free of
most licensing restriction copyright. OA will close the barrier of access to knowledge.
The OA movement in Indonesia may be considered slow. So far, only 33 academic
libraries have registered their repositories with OpenDOAR, which is still small compared to the
total number of HE institutions in Indonesia. Those 33 OARs vary in the stages of development.
Some have already had large size of contents, while others are still developing.
Using Weiner’s theory of organizational readiness for change, this mixed method
investigates the readiness of academic librarians for Open Access Repository implementation.
The results show that academic librarians in Indonesia are somewhat familiar with OA and OAR.
However, their understanding of OA is still limited to the technical nature of it. They also know
the benefits of OA in relation to scholarly communication and are ready to implement OAR, but
the implementation was mostly based on the goal of achieving a specific rank in the world-class
university ranking and Webometrics. They implemented Open Access Repositories with limited
technological infrastructure, skills, and limited knowledge of OA.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION TO THE RESEARCH
Introduction
This chapter introduces the background and development of scholarly and scientific
communication in relation to the open access (OA) movement that is the focus the study. It deals
with the historical aspects of the communication and the emergence of the Internet and World
Wide Web that has played an important part in the development of OA. In addition to describing
the development of OA in Indonesia, the chapter also presents the problem statement and
purpose of the study, states the significance of the study, proposes research questions, and
relevant limitations.
The Rise and Change in Scholarly Communication
Two issues, scholarly and scientific communication and OA movement, are discussed in
this chapter. Scholarly and scientific communication has a long history, while the OA movement
began to take part in this communication with the emergence of Internet in the late 1960s and the
web that emerged in mid-1990s.
Scholarly and Scientific Communication
Information has been considered as an important part of life in the 21st century. It is even
viewed as the key element to achieve social welfare (Civallero & Plaza, 2008). Information plays
an important role in various inter-related aspects of life, including those in the academic area in
which scholarly and scientific communication helps us learn and understand the phenomena of
life that in the long run will lead to social welfare.
Scholarly and scientific communication is a system that produces knowledge through
discovery and collaboration. Once a scholarly paper is created from research, it then goes to a

1

publisher that will review and disseminate it to scholars and other readers and to institutions,
such as libraries, that will further disseminate and preserve it for future use. Later, other scholars
can create new scholarly papers based on these published works. In other words, scholarly and
scientific communication is a system that creates, evaluates, disseminates, preserves, and
reshapes new knowledge (Academic and Research Libraries (ARL), 2007; Cullen and Chawner,
2011; Kumar, Singh, and Karissidappa, 2011; and Sawant, 2012). This continuous process has
allowed knowledge to grow and expand both within and across disciplines. Figure 1.1 shows
how the publication lifecycle goes as part of scholarly and scientific communication.

Prior to the emergence of digital publications, printed materials were the main mode of
distribution for scholarly communication. The era is often viewed as the “papyrocentric” model
of scholarly communication (Conley and Wooders, 2009, p. 71). It was in this era that the
commercial publishers of printed journals were the key players of knowledge dissemination

2

among scholars. The shift from papyrocentric to electronic era happened in the 20th century after
World War II and especially when the Internet, and later the Web, became available for scholarly
communication among scholars.
The awareness of the problem of increased scientific publications and the need of fast
distribution of scholarly and scientific communication emerged in the 20th century (Steyaert,
2011). Bush (1945) expressed the issue in his article entitled ‘As we may think.’ He saw the
growing number of research publications and this impacted on the inadequacy of distribution and
readership. Bush foresaw this problem in the middle of the 20th century and that marked the
awareness of the need to develop media for scholarly and scientific communication. He also
stated that “one needs not only to make and store a record but also be able to consult it” (p. 182).
In addition, copies of research publications could be made available in large quantities and more
quickly using new technology.
The emergence of Internet and information technology in general brought new
development in the production of research publications during the 20th century, especially after
World War II. While microform publications were growing, publishers also began using
computers for some of the publication process. Speaking about the use of information technology
for publications, Kuney (1968) described the use of computers in the 1960s as follows:
In composition of scientific information, computers are being used increasingly for
setting abstracts, bibliographies, and directories, but the use for journals is still
negligible. (p. 43)
Swan (2006) viewed 1970s as an important decade in the development of scholarly and
scientific communication as scholars could start using computers to communicate with each
other. She stated that:

3

Now it became possible for scientists to communicate by permitting access to
their own files from remote computers and by accessing those of others in turn.
The age of digital communication was born (p. 5).
Besides the increasing use of computers for the publication process and limited
communication, some trials for digital publishing were also conducted in 1980s. However, the
development was not without barriers. Fjällbrant (1997) stated that the problems of electronic
publishing in the 1980s included standardization, user resistance to change, network access,
copyright, and risk for plagiarism. A decade later, with the emergence of web, digital publishing
began to appear.
Apart from the advancement of technology, publishers have always been viewed as the
most important and credible in the scholarly and scientific communication lifecycle and
therefore, they keep playing a role in scholarly communication until now. It is the publishers
who can manage the key element of knowledge-making process.
However, besides facilitating the scholarly and scientific communication, publishers can
also be barriers for the communication among scholars. While the publishers charge the readers
and libraries for the subscription, they also have to ensure that those who does not subscribe to
their publications, do not have access to the publications. This include people who are not
affiliated with an institution that subscribes to their databases. Even if the libraries subscribe to
databases of publications, the publishers still control the users’ access. The library users are not
allowed to download all publications that the libraries subscribe to by using any media crawlers.
Publishers usually pass an agreement to libraries that users may only download manually.
In addition, in order to secure higher profits, publishers bundle the journals into databases
containing journals that are both needed and not needed by libraries. Therefore, the subscription
price increases. Indeed, economically, it is the publishers who get benefits from scholarly and

4

scientific communication rather than the scholars. While the authors have to fund, or get funding
for their research and submit their research papers to the publishers for free; both the readers and
libraries pay for the publications in order for them to read. In other words, the burden of the
scholarly and scientific communication, “has always fallen on the academy and its direct
supporters” (Conley and Wooders, 2009, p. 75). Association of College and Research Libraries
(2013) stated the issue as follows:
Most scientific, scholarly, or artistic work done within the academic setting is not
undertaken primarily for direct economic profit. Nevertheless, publishers profit
from scholarship, and have incentives to limit access, while scholars are more
concerned with their work being discovered and valued. (p. 7)
Meanwhile publishers may also increase the prices of publication databases which often
results in libraries’ subscription cancellation. A study by the Library and Information Statistics
Unit (LISU) at Loughborough University in the UK showed that the subscription price increase
between 2000 to 2004 was “between 27% (Cambridge University Press) and 94% (Sage)”
(Swan, 2006, p. 9).
This problem may cause a wider information gap between scholars in the developed
countries and those in the developing and underdeveloped countries. The well-funded scholars
can research and publish their findings and enjoy the publications by subscribing to the journals.
On the other hand, the less-funded researchers may not be able to publish and read other
scholars’ works at all. Scholars from developing and underdeveloped countries suffer from this
scholarly and scientific communication problem. This crisis in scholarly communication lead to
“a consequent loss in scientific productivity, progress and impact” (Bosc and Harnad, 2005, p.
95).
The scholarly and scientific communication crisis exists not only because of the
increasing price of journal subscriptions and decreasing library budgets, but also because of other

5

issues such as an increasing control by the publishers, use of materials under contract law instead
of copyright, and the fact that libraries only pay for access instead of ownership of scholarly
publications (Sawant, 2012). This problem was disturbing because in the first decade of webbased publications, only the developed countries had good access to the web, while scholars
from developing and underdeveloped countries did not have access to it due to technical issues
of infrastructure and high cost. As a result, the lifecycle of digital scholarly and scientific
communication did not exist in the countries with slow or no Internet access or subscription
capability.
Scholarly works in the digital formats have been made available and accessible
worldwide with the availability of web. Publishers continue playing a big role in this lifecycle
and other scholarly and scientific communication players surrender to publishers who have
control, technology, skills, and knowledge. Indeed, up to now, the scholarly publications are still
“almost entirely a publishing monoculture” (Steele, 2014, p. 256). Scholars in the developed
countries can get access to the scholarly literature while those from the developing or
underdeveloped countries find it hard to get digital resources due to the high price of
subscription or purchase. This problem of access divide has raised an issue of the need of easy
and cheap scholarly literature distribution and resulted in the idea of providing free online
publications and declarations of an open access (OA) movement.
Open Access (OA) Movement
The OA movement is a world-wide effort to ensure the availability of free access to
“updated information sources, especially academic ones” (Civallero and Plaza, 2008, p. 78). It is
seen as beneficial for scholarly and scientific communication because knowledge lifecycle can
be more efficiently and effectively with minimum barriers. Removing barriers of access to

6

literature will definitely accelerate research production and enrich education because scholars
will be able to discover the new findings more easily. OA scholarship can be the power to reach
“a broad spectrum of potentially interested publics” (Fitzpatrick, 2012, p. 353) as it enables
scholars to share knowledge. In addition, OA can also be viewed as the answer to the access
divide (Sawant, 2012). From the perspective of users of scholarly publications, OA is beneficial
for sharing knowledge. This is because the OA movement demands scholarly literature freely
available on the internet (Shafi & Bhat, 2008) and it is “free of most copyright and licensing
restrictions.” (Suber, 2012, p. 4). OA will close the barrier of access to knowledge and will
surely lead to the brighter future of “making the scholarly content free of cost available to
everyone” (Gul, Wani & Majeed, 2008, p. 13) and thereby enable scholars to better learn the
development of knowledge (Velterop, 2005). By sharing research findings, knowledge lifecycles
will grow faster and better, and this enables scholarly and scientific communication to be more
efficiently distributed. Meanwhile the League of European Research Universities (LERU) (2011)
considered OA beneficial because the freely available documents will enable researchers to aid
other researchers in different parts of the world and thus may get benefit from sharing resources.
With worldwide Open Access, researchers would spend less time looking for and
accessing research information for their reading, writing and peer reviewing
activities (p. 6).
By disseminating the research findings freely accessible through OA, both scholars and
their institutions will be more visible and thus more recognized by other scholars. Accessible
research findings will attract more scholars and in the long run enable faster and wider scientific
discovery both within the disciplines and across disciplines. Budapest Open Access Initiative
(2012) stated that OA movement can:
accelerate research, enrich education, share the learning of the rich with the poor
and the poor with the rich, make this literature as useful as it can be, and lay the

7

foundation for uniting humanity in a common intellectual conversation and quest
for knowledge (para 3).
A study by Antelman (2004) showed that OA articles have more impact compared to
those of non-open access ones; while Poynder (2011) believed that OA has triggered publishing
system transformation that had not changed in 350 years.
There are two types of OA, namely, OA journals and OA repositories (OARs). OA
journals are freely accessible online journals that are currently managed by societies and
institutions. Due to the strong OA movement, some publishers do provide free access to several
of their own journals. OA journals are expected to change the future of scholarly and scientific
communication because literature that is openly disseminated will increase impact (Fitzpatrick,
2012). Of course, OA does not intend to replace academic journals and the quality mechanism of
peer-review. Rather, it is about free access to publications so that quality scholarly literature and
research findings are available for readers without any charge (Steyaert, 2011). Meanwhile, the
term OAR is defined as a server that stores the institution’s digital products of knowledge and
offer them online for free (Parker, 2007).
Open access repositories (OARs) are managed by individual institutions or crossinstitutions. While OA journals mainly contain articles, OARs can have a variety of content,
such as pre-print articles, theses and dissertations, unpublished papers, research papers, etc. The
number of OARs is growing but it is unevenly distributed. In fact, OARs are established because
of several reasons and one of them is the concern of plagiarism (Zainab, 2010). In addition, the
willingness of libraries to provide resources freely is also appreciated. However, changing their
services from closed to open access requires readiness of the librarians to change their views.

Indonesia and Open Access Movement
This research was conducted in Indonesia, the fourth biggest country in the world in terms
of its population. The country is located in Southeast Asia and consists of more than 17,000
islands with Sumatra, Borneo, Sulawesi, and West Papua as the biggest islands. The population
currently consists of more than 250,000,000 people. There are approximately 3,000 higher
education institutions of which most are private institutions, and are mostly located in Java, an
island about one third of the size of Sumatra island.
Indonesia and Its Academic Libraries
Indonesia is one of the many developing countries in Southeast Asia. It proclaimed its
independence on August 17, 1945. It was formerly colonized by the Dutch for about 350 years
and by Japanese for 3.5 years. Although it was colonized for a long time, some of its kingdoms
survived, one of which became a province of Yogyakarta whose sultan is appointed as governor.
Sultan Hamengkubuwono IX, who had been the sultan of Yogyakarta kingdom prior to the
Indonesian independence, backed the country and declared that Yogyakarta would become one
of the provinces of Indonesia. He also supported education and, together with the first president,
established the Universitas Gadjah Mada as the first institution of higher education on December
19, 1949.
In the early days of independence, Indonesia had a very high illiteracy rate. In fact, the
illiteracy rate reached about 90% in the early 1950s (Sulistyo-Basuki, 1999). The colonization by
Dutch and Japanese for 353.5 years consecutively did not help to familiarize Indonesians with
libraries and reading because most of Indonesians did not go to schools. Rather, most people did
apprenticeship for work. This situation continued into the first two decades after the
independence as there were few educational institutions.

9

Education was rare during the colonization and it was even harder during the Japanese
occupation of Indonesia. The unavailability of libraries for many generations during the
colonization resulted in lack of appreciation of the role that libraries could play in developing the
nation. It is only in the last three decades that people have become aware of the importance of a
library in the community. Some policy makers have raised the issue of library development. For
example, the current governor of Yogyakarta, Sultan Hamengkubowono X, established the
Library Council of Yogyakarta and a networked digital library called the Jogja Library for All. In
Surabaya, the mayor and Yayasan Pengembangan Perpustakaan Indonesia (YPPI), an
independent library development agency, are currently initiating a city-wide literacy effort.
As the fourth largest population in the world, Indonesia currently has about 3,000 mostly
privately run higher education (HE) institutions, leaving only 375 public HE institutions. Most of
the academic libraries in these institutions are at the stage of developing library automation while
others are developing digital libraries.
OA Movement in Indonesia
The OA movement in Indonesia may be seen as developing slowly. So far, only 33
academic libraries have registered their repositories with OpenDOAR, the international directory
of open access repositories. The number is still small compared to the total number of HE
institutions in Indonesia. There have been a few seminars, discussions, and publications that have
addressed OA but there has been no follow-up. Although the Internet is widely used in
Indonesia, many academic libraries still keep their repositories inaccessible to the Web and some
are even restricted for use.
It is also interesting to note that journals published by universities are usually managed
by departments without any involvement by the university management. Copies of the journal

10

are usually sent to other universities, with one copy going to the library within the institution
itself. The library may scan the articles or make the printed copies available for use in the library.
This limited dissemination is the main problem with print-based academic journals in Indonesia.
Similarly, access to journals published by societies and government is also limited.
In terms of repositories, the academic libraries usually keep copies of students’ theses and
dissertations but their use is very restricted. Both digital and printed versions are for use only
within the libraries. Many academic libraries still keep their repositories offline and available
only within the libraries, but they have also started to make their metadata used in the
repositories available online through the library websites.
In addition, some libraries have started requesting that their students submit the digital
formats of their dissertations, theses, and term-papers, accompanied by the printed versions;
while other institutions still only require students to submit the printed copies of theses and
dissertations. Students are allowed to photocopy some parts of the dissertations and theses but
not the document as a whole.
In 2010, the Ministry of Education and Culture, Republic of Indonesia issued regulation
Number 17 (2010) to fight against plagiarism. The regulation states that higher education
institutions are required to upload the works by faculty, students, and other academic staff to
their university library websites. However, this regulation does not mention OA journals and OA
repositories explicitly.
Open Access Journals in Indonesia
OA journals began to appear about a decade ago in Indonesia. Currently, there are 111
journals from Indonesia listed in the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ). These 111

11

journals are published by universities (72 journals), societies (9 journals), publishers (3 journals),
government (5 journals), and other institutions (22 journals).
The OA journal movement in Indonesia is still emerging. According to DOAJ, the first
four OA journals from Indonesia were registered in 2009. This was followed by the registration
of 11 journals in 2010, 14 in 2011, 16 in 2012 and 68 in 2013 (see Figure 1.2).

Based on the authoritative list of DOAJ, the OA journals from Indonesia cover a variety
of subjects. As shown in Fig. 1.3, there are 14 journals in the field of medicine, public health
and pharmacy, 37 journals in engineering, information technology (IT), and computer science,
seven journals in language, literature, arts, and architecture, 10 journals in Life science, 15
journals in math, basic sciences, and environmental science, 17 journals in the fields of social
science, psychology, education, and business, law, religion, nine journals in Agriculture, animal
science, food science, and three journals in the interdisciplinary sciences. The data show that
engineering, IT, and computer science have the greatest number of journals.

OA Repositories in Indonesia
OA repositories in Indonesia have emerged slowly in the last few years. This movement
was initiated by a few academic libraries and the Indonesian Science Agency (Lembaga Ilmu
Pengetahuan Indonesia) that developed an OA national repository system containing mostly
articles from journals published in Indonesia. This national repository system database is now
managed by Directorate of Higher Education (DIKTI) and the development seems promising.
Currently, out of approximately 3,000 academic libraries, there are 33 libraries that have
OARs registered in OpenDOAR. These academic libraries are leading the way towards more
open scholarly and scientific communication in Indonesia. These repositories are managed by
academic libraries because the libraries are considered better developed when compared to other
types of libraries.

Figure 1.4. Repository contents
Based on the OpenDOAR, the institutional repositories in Indonesia contain mostly
articles from local journals, theses, dissertations, books, learning objects, conference papers,
unpublished papers, multimedia, references, a few conference proceedings, patents, and
dissertations as seen in Fig. 1.4. In addition to journal articles, the most collected materials in
these repositories are theses while some also have dissertations. It is believed that the OARs are
used by an increasing number of users who can freely read or download the resources. The
OARs have also been used to report any incidents of plagiarism. Tjiek (2007) commented that
OARs “increased visibility for all parties involved” (p. 280). Therefore, users may benefit from
reading and using the resources; they may discover research conducted in any field. They may
also find any similar work that have already been published. In addition, the libraries’ visibility
increases as more users use the OARs.

Free open source software is enjoyed in Indonesia. The chart in Figure 1.6 shows that
EPrint is the most used followed by DSpace. In addition to locally produced software, other
open source software has been used in academic and school libraries, especially for managing
the metadata of the collection holdings.
It can be said that those 33 OARs vary in the stages of development. Some have already
had large size of contents, while others are still developing. This study will deal with those 33
academic libraries as they can be seen as pioneers of OARs in Indonesia.
Conceptual Framework
Implementation is a set of activities with certain dimensions designed to put into practice
(Fixsen, Blasé, Friedman, and Wallace, 2005). Implementing a policy, program, or activity in
general will be successful if the organization is ready. Being ready is defined as being “prepared
to do something” or “properly prepared or finished and available for use,” and “almost about to
do something” (Merriam-Webster, 2014). Readiness is also defined as a condition in which the
individuals within an organization is “psychologically and behaviorally prepared” (Weiner,
16

2009, p.2). He further stated that readiness is considered “a critical precursor to the successful
implementation” (Weiner, 2009, p. 2). In other words, readiness is a key element in
implementing a new activity, program or policy. When every member of an organization is
ready, the implementation will be easier (Susanto, 2008, p. 58).
Weiner’s theory of organizational readiness for change (TORC) is considered appropriate
for this study. Taken from the field of management, this theory can be applied in various fields
such as healthcare, information system, and library and information science (LIS). The theory
proposes that readiness requires shared vision and actions among individuals from different
levels within the organization.
Organizational readiness is formed by both commitment and efficacy of the individuals
within an organization. Collective commitment will either support or reject change. The
commitment will emerge when the individuals value the change (valence). Meanwhile efficacy is
established from the informational assessment in which the organizational members know the
task demand, perceive the resources positively, and the situation enables them to implement.
Susanto (2008) views that organizational readiness is measurable from staffs’ “beliefs, attitudes,
and intentions” (p. 50) towards change.
Weiner’s theory shows that valence and informational assessment are based on the
contextual factors which include organizational culture, policies and procedures, past
experiences, organizational resources, and organizational structure.
This theory provides a foundation to identify the factors that affect Indonesian academic
librarians’ readiness for OA implementation in Indonesia. By investigating the perceptions and
factors influencing readiness of academic libraries for OAR implementation, this study can
hopefully identify factors that lead to the success of OAR implementation in Indonesia. To

17

implement an OAR successfully, a library needs to investigate the organizational readiness.
There are some issues related to the organization when an institution implements an OAR. These
issues include organizational resources, structure and culture.
There is an overall lack of research on factors of readiness in the implementation of an
OARs in academic libraries and there is no research on readiness of OAR implementation in
Indonesia. Therefore, it is valuable to study the 33 academic libraries in Indonesia that have
moved from closed to open access as most Indonesian academic libraries still have their
repositories inaccessible due to their belief that opening the access to their repositories will
enable users to plagiarize. Implementing OAR in academic libraries depends on the readiness of
the libraries and the librarians to change.
Problem Statement
The OA movement in Indonesia is still emerging. The opening of Garuda—the OA
national repository system database of archived academic journals—marked a new and important
OA development. This repository system is managed by Higher Education Agency and
supported by academic libraries. Academic libraries upload their archived journal articles from
their institutions to this portal and make them freely available online. Currently, it has more than
15,000 journal articles available online. This national repository collects only archived journals
published in Indonesia.
Besides the OA national repository system, OARs are also emerging in Indonesia, and 33
academic libraries and the Indonesian Science Agency have registered their OARs in the
Directory of Open Access Repository (OpenDOAR) in the last few years. These OARs are
leading because many academic libraries have not been able to provide repositories that are
freely accessible online.

18

The emergence of OARs signifies a positive change and enlightenment for scholarly
communication in Indonesia as the Ministry of Research, Technology, and Higher Education
(HE) would like to boost the research outputs from HE institutions. Previously it was difficult to
ascertain what the HE institutions were doing due to the inaccessibility of research outputs. This
problem of access to institutional products of knowledge may cause duplication of research and
undetected practice of plagiarism. The OARs will enable scholars to collaborate and conduct
further research and therefore will increase the power of scholarly and scientific communication.
The OA movement is closely related to institutional repositories. Jacso (2006) stated that
the main providers of OA scholarly full-text documents are repositories maintained by various
institutions such as government agencies, scholarly associations, professional groups, publishers
and universities. In other words, OARs are institutional repositories that are full-text and
available online for free.
Institutional repositories have been maintained by academic libraries for many years.
However, in the past, academic libraries collected only grey literature. Academic libraries
usually build their institutional repositories of their institutions and make them available for their
users. With the OA movement, the institutional repositories have now become OARs and made
available in the Internet and freely accessible. Drake (2004) stated that an OAR in an academic
library may include
preprints and post-prints of journal articles, technical reports, white papers,
research data, theses, dissertation, work in progress, important print and image
collections, teaching and learning materials, and materials documenting the
history of the institution (p. 42).
Shifting an institutional repository in an academic library to an OAR requires readiness.
In this case the readiness of the individual librarians as well as the library as an organization.
However, the literature shows lack of research of the readiness of academic libraries to

19

implement OARs and what factors influence this implementation in academic libraries,
especially in Indonesia. This is important as Indonesia is a developing country that has its own
language and with native-speaking scholars often do not speak and write in a foreign language.
The problem of international language capability is often a barrier among Indonesian scholars.
This is also why the number of research output is low. In addition, most academic libraries do
not have sufficient money to subscribe to databases and e-journals. Therefore, supporting the
scholarly and scientific communication through OARs will enable the scholars to discover
resources to support their research and to eliminate research duplication.
The change from closed access to OA likely relates to several issues, including cultural
issues. Exploring the academic librarians’ readiness for change will include identifying the
perception of OA among librarians as well as other factors that have made them ready for
change. This is helpful for other academic libraries to understand before they develop their own
OARs.
Measuring the perception of OA among academic librarians in Indonesia is useful. In this
case, it can help to identify the factors influencing their readiness for OAR implementation.
Therefore this study will identify the perceptions of OA and factors influencing the readiness of
OAR implementation by Indonesian academic librarians.
Research Questions
Based on the above description, it is beneficial to investigate the readiness of academic
libraries in Indonesia for OAR implementation. This emerging issue of changing from closed to
Open Access to the repositories raises the research question: What has made them ready to build
open access repositories?
The research questions for this study therefore are:

20

Q1: What are Indonesian academic librarians’ perception of open access
repositories?
Q2: What factors contribute to readiness to implement open access repositories in
academic libraries in Indonesia?
Q3: Why do these factors exist in the implementation of OARs in Indonesia?
Q4: How does the theory of organizational readiness for change (TORC) help to
explain the readiness of open access repository implementation in Indonesia?
Purpose of Research
This study will investigate the readiness of OARs implementation in Indonesia. This includes
the perception of academic librarians about OA and the contributing factors of readiness to
implement OARs in the academic libraries.
The results are expected to show what consideration academic libraries should take when
implementing an OAR. In Indonesia, especially in the island of Java, there is a proverb, “Ing
ngarsa sung tulada, Ing madya mangun karsa, tut wuri handyani.” This proverb means those who
lead show good examples to follow, those who are in the middle, work hard and learn from those
who lead, and those who are at the back must learn from both those who lead and those who are
in the middle. This proverb has been used not only in Java, but also in Indonesia including, in the
Department of Education throughout the country. It is expected that those who have not
implemented OAR will learn from those who are in the middle of implementation and those who
have implemented OAR. In addition, it is also expected that this study will be able to provide an
understanding about the implementation of OARs in academic libraries in a developing country
and help academic libraries to prepare for developing OARs.

21

Significance of the Research
In general, studies on readiness for implementation have not been discussed much in the
field of library and information science (LIS), or in the literature on OAR implementation in
particular. Therefore it is valuable for librarians to become more aware of readiness and
challenges when planning to establish a new program, activity, or system.
This study contributes to the body of knowledge about readiness for change in the field of
LIS and the challenges and factors that libraries in developing countries should consider when
they implement OARs.
Limitations of the Study
OAR has several stakeholders, namely the institutions, researchers, authors, publishers,
librarians, and users. This study, however, has a limitation as it deals with only the librarians and
the process of managing repositories. Many librarians consider the institutional repositories as
the most valuable products of the institutions and therefore, they think that the repositories
should be preserved and kept for their own use. Changing the way they think and practice in
preserving the institutional repositories requires readiness. It is this point that is dealt with in this
study.
This study has limitation as the number of population is only 33 Indonesian academic
libraries that have registered their OA repositories in OpenDOAR, therefore this study cannot
reflect the academic libraries in general. In addition, the readiness condition of each academic
library in Indonesia may also vary and may affect the validity and reliability of the instruments.
There will be a translation involved in the questions of interview and questionnaires. The
original scales for the interview are adopted from a study on readiness of Open Access among
researchers and stakeholders in one institution in Kuwait and were translated into English and in

22

this study, the scales are modified for librarians and translated into Bahasa Indonesia as the
participants are all Indonesian librarians. This issue may create a limitation in terms of
measurement. However, a translation process will be performed to minimize such potential threat
in the validity.
In addition, the original scale was used to measure the readiness of OA policy
implementation in one institution with participants who were mostly researchers. This study,
however, dealt with the implementation of OA repository and the participants were mostly
librarians except the directors, who were not always librarians. Meanwhile, the questionnaire
was designed based the research questions, problem statement, literature review, and the
questions for interview.

CHAPTER 2
LITERATURE REVIEW
Introduction
This chapter presents an overview of open access (OA) that contains definition,
development, types and advantages, and challenges of OA. The chapter also addresses the
readiness and the theory of organizational readiness for change (TORC) and factors that
influence readiness of OA implementation.
Open Access (OA)
The discussion on OA addresses the definition and the development of OA from its
beginning to present time. The development of OA began with its experiments in 1980s and is
currently implemented in many places world-wide. This chapter discusses several different
definitions of OA as well as the follow-up to the definition.
Definition of Open Access (OA)
Access to scholarly and scientific information has been primarily controlled by many of
the publishers. They could, in fact, be viewed as the most powerful authority on scholarly and
scientific communication, especially in terms of the economy. This control has also been viewed
as barrier to scholars’ access to information. With the emergence of Internet and the World Wide
Web, a movement toward barrier-free access to scholarly and scientific information has begun.
This movement is called open access (OA).
OA movement is a relatively new and began only in the last decade of 20th and the early
part of the 21st century. OA has been defined, declared, and reaffirmed by several initiatives and
declarations (the Budapest Open Access Initiative, February 14, 2002, the Bethesda Declaration
of Open Access, June 20, 2003), and the Berlin Declaration of Open Access, October 22, 2003).

25

The Budapest Open Access Initiative (2002) defines OA as
The free availability of articles on the public Internet, permitting any users to
read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of these
articles, crawl them for indexing, pass them as data to software, or use them for
any other lawful purpose, without financial, legal, or technical barriers other than
those inseparable from gaining access to the internet itself (para 3).

The Bethesda Declaration of Open Access (2003) emphasizes the definition by proposing two
conditions of OA publications as follows:
1. The author(s) and copyright holder(s) grant(s) to all users a free, irrevocable,
worldwide, perpetual right of access to, and a license to copy, use, distribute,
transmit and display the work publicly and to make and distribute derivative
works, in any digital medium for any responsible purpose, subject to proper
attribution of authorship (para 5).
2. A complete version of the work and all supplemental materials, including a
copy of the permission as stated above, in a suitable standard electronic format is
deposited immediately upon initial publication in at least one online repository
(para 6).

Meanwhile, the Berlin Declaration of Open Access (2003) supported the Bethesda
declaration by stating that it encourages researchers and grants recipients to publish their
research findings “according to the principles of open access paradigm“ (para 10). OA was later
reconfirmed in 2012 as:
Free availability on the public Internet, permitting any users to read, download, copy,
distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of these articles, crawl them for indexing,
pass them as data to software, or use them for any other lawful purpose, without
financial, legal, or technical barriers other than those inseparable from gaining access to
the internet itself (Budapest Open Access Initiative, 2012, para 9).

Some scholars and organizations also define OA similarly (e.g., Association of Research
Libraries, 2008; Lynch, 2006; Suber, 2003; Suber, 2012). OA publications are considered as
valid if they fulfill the three requirements: “free accessibility, further distribution, and proper
archiving” (Velterop, 2005, p. 6). In short, OA publications are defined as those that are freely

26

accessible online and that allow people to copy, download, and distribute them for lawful
purposes.
An Overview of the OA Development
The OA movement did not happen in overnight. The emergence of OA was initiated by
scholars and librarians who expect freely available publications that use new and untraditional
tools and platforms (Little, 2013). Although OA movement was declared only in 2002 and 2003,
the actual development began in 1990s with “the launch of several databases and free online peer
reviewed journals” (Pappalardo, Fitzgerald, Fitzgerald, Kiel-Chisholm, O'Brien, and Auston,
2007, p. 1). The launching of digital publications in the early 1990s marked a new agenda of
digitally distributed publications. In fact, earlier experiments in launching digital publications
had taken place in the 1980s but were unsuccessful (Parang and Sanders, 1994). After the 1990s
the number of online publications increased almost exponentially (Solomon, 2013, p. 25).
Prior to the Budapest, Bethesda, and Berlin OA declarations, there had been statements
concerning OA, such as the Bermuda Principle in 1996 and the Tempe Principle in 2000. The
Bermuda Principle declared the need for free and publicly available of data on the Internet. The
declaration was initiated by a team of international scientists who were engaged in the
international human genome project and who wanted the information freely and publicly
available on the Internet. Meanwhile a statement on Principles for Emerging Systems of
Scholarly Publishing, or the Temple Principles, was launched by the Association of American
Universities, Association of Research Libraries, and the Merrill Advanced Studies Center. The
principle emphasized the importance of ease of search, interoperability, and legal use of digital
media resources. These two principles were then followed by the Declaration of Havana towards
Equitable Access to Health Information that emphasized the need for equitability of access to

27

quality health information. This declaration voiced an expectation that quality health information
would be publicly available as a basic social right.
After Budapest, Bethesda, and Berlin declarations, more statements on the need of OA
scholarly resources were declared, for example International Federation of Library Association
(IFLA) Statement on Open Access to Scholarly Literature and Research Documentation in 2004,
the Principles for Free Access to Science from a number of American scholarly and not-forprofit publishers in 2004, the Vienna Declaration: 10 Theses on Freedom of Information in May
2005, the Organization for Economic and Co-operative Development (OECD) Principles and
Guidelines for Access to Research Data from Public Funding in 2007, the U.S. National Institute
of Health Public Access Policy in 2008, the British Open Knowledge Foundation’s Panton
Principles for Open Data in Science in 2010, the Alhambra Declaration on Open Access for
South European countries in 2010, the Rome Declaration on Current Research Information
Systems (CRIS) and Open Access Repositories (OAR) in 2011, The Scholarly Publishing and
Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC) Europe Statement on Open Access Public Hearing on
Access to and Preservation of Scientific Information in 2011, the League of European Research
Universities (LERU) Roadmap towards Open Access in 2011, the Australian National Health
and Medical Research Council OA institutional repository policy in 2012, and the Open Access
publication policy from Research Council, Wellcome Trust, Higher Education Funding Council
for England, and UK department for business innovation and skills in 2012. As evidenced by the
numerous declarations around the globe, the first decade of 21st century has definitely shown
rapid development of OA.
However, the traditional scholarly communication that is controlled by commercial
publishers is still leading and is now supported by the advancement of digital technology. The

28

commercial publishing establishment has played, and is still playing, an important key role in the
academic life cycle of scholarly communication. Due to their long history and experience, many
scholars still believe that commercial publishers are the most important element in the scholarly
lifecycle. The OA movement, on the other hand, is relatively young, having just begun in the
mid-1990s when the Web started to become popular. In fact, the emergence of OA movement
has been triggered by two important aspects, namely, online distribution channels and the low
cost of setting up online publications (Bjork and Solomon, 2012). These enabled anyone in the
scholarly and scientific field to easily publish research findings and other publications online.
OA Types
There are two types of OA, journals and repositories, each with different perspectives.
The OA journals are online journals and do not require subscription payment, while OA
repositories allow institutions to publish freely such things as pre-prints and post-prints of
journal publications (Parker, 2007).
OA Journals
As stated earlier the actual development of OA did not start with the Budapest, Bethesda,
and Berlin declarations, but rather by the launching of free databases and journals on the Web in
the 1990s. Five OA journals were launched and made freely available on the Internet in 1992
(Rufai, Gul, and Shah, 2011) and by the mid-1990s more and more online journals began to
appear that were freely accessible. The OA movement grew even faster especially after the
declarations of OA in Budapest, Bethesda, and Berlin (Parker, 2007). The number of OA
journals increased to 1200 in 2004 (Falk, 2004) and according to the Directory of Open Access
Journals (2014) there are now 10,032 journals consisting of 1,748,387 articles from 135

29

countries at the end of 2014. OA publishers such as PLoS, BioMed Central, PubMed Central,
SPARC and other institutions have also contributed to the development of OA journals.
According to Gul, Wani, and Majeed (2008) Europe is the biggest contributors of OA
publications with 385 journals, followed by contributions from North America (257), Asia (205),
South America (182), Australia (22), and Africa (9). Fig. 2.1 shows the increase of OA
publications in the last two decades.

Figure 2.1. Number of OA journals
The actual difference between traditionally published journals and OA journals is
actually the model of business. Publishers have to pay for the cost of publication process and
marketing, therefore have to charge the readers. One interesting contradiction is that while
subscription costs grow higher and higher, and is sometimes simply unaffordable, the cost of
publications is actually lower due to the advancement of digital technology. Cirasella (2014)
states that scholarly journals, as the main mode of dissemination of scholarly communication,
have been the focus of OA movement because the subscription price of commercial journals has
been too expensive and is “out of proportion with the costs of publishing” (p. 12). OA journals

30

are expected to help scholarly and scientific communication among scholars become easier as
there is no cost of access incurred.
There are two types of OA journals: Gold OA journals and green OA journals. From the
users’ perspective, gold OA journals are beneficial as they are freely accessible directly online
without any embargo and readers do not need to pay for the subscription cost. In fact, the OA
journals are financially supported by the authors, the author’s institutions, research funders, or
other sources of funding (Harris, 2012).
The number of gold OA is increasing fast. Non-profit organizations and scholarly
societies increasingly offer OA publications. The OA journal publications have also affected the
commercial publishers. They have also participated by providing their open access publications
in addition to the subscription-based journals. It is believed that the number of gold OA journals
will increase. For example, it is predicted that 50% of scholarly journal articles will be freely
accessible online by 2021 and may increase to 90% by 2025 (Lewis, 2012).
Green OA are journal articles are “made freely available somewhere on the web” (Bjork,
Laakso, Welling, and Paetau, 2014, p. 237). This can be in the form of preprint or postprint.
While preprint is the paper that has not been peer-reviewed, post-print is “the version of the
paper after peer-review, with revisions having been made” (Sherpa, 2006). However, it is also
common for publishers to “impose embargo periods and particular conditions on publication”
(Harris, 2012, p. 5). Unlike the gold OA journals, green OA journal articles do not affect the
subscription (Solomon, 2013, p. 27).
OA repositories
The term institutional repository is defined as a computer server that stores an
institution’s digital products of knowledge and offers them online for free (Parker, 2007). Irish

31

Research Council for Science Engineering and Technology (IRCSET) (2008) defined OA
repository (OAR) as
a storage and retrieval system where published research findings and papers
would be stored and made available for full, open and free access by the research
community and the general public (para 2).
There are four types of repositories “the subject-based repository, research repository,
national repository system and institutional repository” (Ambruster and Romary, n.d., para 1).
According to OpenDOAR (2014) the number of OA repositories reached 2714 on
October 13, 2014. This is a great increase from 2005 when there were only 128 institutional
repository databases recorded. Fig.2.2 shows the development of OA repositories.
Based on the country of publications, the United States has the biggest repository (439 or
16.8%), followed by United Kingdom (221 or 8.5%), and Germany (169 or 6.5%). Most OA
repositories use Open Source applications such as Eprint and DSpace (Parker, 2007).

The contents of OA repositories can vary but in general repositories contain theses,
dissertations, and other institutional documents as well as preprints and post-print of journal

32

articles. In addition, there may also be course materials, audio and video files, and other digitized
resources (Suber, 2013). OA repositories provide free access to research publications directly to
users without involving commercial publishers “who would sell it back to the research
community at a significant markup” (Joint, 2008, p. 574).

According to Open DOAR (2014), Asia contributes 463 OA repositories to the
OpenDOAR directory with the leading country being Japan, followed by India and Taiwan.
Japan has 144 institutional repositories and contributes 6.3% of the world’s institutional
repositories and the biggest in Asia.
Indonesia is one of the Asian countries that is currently developing both OA journals and
OA repositories. At present there are 111 journals from Indonesia listed in Directory of Open
Access Journals (DOAJ) and 34 repositories are registered at OpenDOAR. These 34 repositories
consists of 1 repository belonging to the Indonesian Science Agency and 33 repositories of
academic libraries.
Roy, Biswas, & Mokhopadyoy (2012) observed the Asian repositories and found that the
most prominent contents of repositories are published papers (preprints, post prints, conferences,
articles), theses, unpublished documents, multimedia objects, learning objects, special items, etc.
Wani, Gul, and Rah (2009) also found that the contents of repositories in Asia are articles,
theses, and unpublished manuscripts, while DSpace is the leading software used by these
repositories, followed by EPrints and XooNIps (a Japanese e-repository software). Other
software systems are also used. Roy, Biswas, & Mokhopadyoy (2012) also found that English is
used by most of the repositories. However, Chinese and Japanese are also considered the

33

common language, while German and Latin are used by Koara (Keio Academic Resource
Archive) repository.
Advantages and Challenges of OA Movement
Internet has increasingly been able to realize Bush’s idea of knowledge dissemination.
Bush (1999) thought of a device that can store recorded documents and “may be consulted with
exceeding speed and flexibility” (p. 186). Nowadays people can access various types of
documents, including of course OA publications and therefore it enables scholarly and scientific
literature reach the previously unreachable scholars. The availability of free scholarly resources
help them produce new knowledge and therefore scholarly and scientific communication will
expand geographically and scientifically within and across disciplines. OA movement can also
be viewed as the answer to the problem of access to scholarly resources. Besides accelerating
research and enriching education, the OA movement enables wider readership because OA
“shares learning across rich and poor nations” (Bhat, 2010, para 1). More scholars will be able to
enrich their knowledge and produce more scientific findings. In short, the OA movement is a
global attempt to guarantee access to information resources freely (Civallero and Plaza, 2008). It
provides access to publications across disciplines and scholarly communities and therefore will
have better impact on scientific development, develop better perspectives, and increase citations.
In contrast to conventional scholarly communication in which publishers can play a
dominant role, the OA model gives a wider chance for scholarly communication to flow wider
and better. OA enables scholarly communication works well with minimum cost. In this case the
OA model does not try to get benefits but does help the flow of scholarly and scientific
communication lifecycle. Slowly but surely, OA can be the best model of scholarly
communication as the awareness among scholars increases.

34

OA publications can be an ideal model for the future of scholarly communication as they
produce an increasing impact (Fitzpatrick, 2012). A survey by Oxford University Press shows
that OA publications have more readership compare to the subscription-based journals (Saxby,
2006). However, OA does not mean to replace academic journals and quality mechanism such as
peer-reviewing, but it is about free access to publications so that quality scholarly literature and
research findings can be available for readers without any charge (Steyaert, 2011). OA
publications will surely close the “gaps in the access to knowledge, enabling every researcher to
try and see the entire picture.” (Velterop, 2005, p. 7). It will make scholarly communication
develop faster, easier and wider besides eliminating the duplication of research.
Another challenge facing OA is that humanities scholars are not so aware of the OA
existence and they make less use of OA publications and services than scholars of science
(Chullen and Chawner, 2011). Some scholars are also doubts about the quality of OA journals
because some of the journals are not indexed. Scholars often lack of time to browse OA journals
and unaware of the availability of such journals (Bjork, Laakso, Welling, and Paetau, 2014).
Meanwhile, the number of OARs is also still low. Not all librarians have courage to make their
repositories open. This is especially true in Indonesia and it is mainly due to the fact that they
still believe that OARs may cause plagiarism.
Promotion of the existence of OA movement world-wide is the best way to increase
scholars’ participation. Scholars from developing and underdeveloped countries should be
encouraged to make use of OA publications and OARs. Using free Open Source software, higher
education institutions can build their own OA publishing units that will help scholars disseminate
their research findings easily and get more knowledge from other scholars through OA

35

publications. Academic libraries can develop their OARs cheaply and help scholarly
communities to produce more research.
Role of Libraries in OA Development
While an increasing number of scholarly societies and institutions develop OA journals,
academic libraries develop OARs as part of their contribution to OA movement. Libraries have
theses, dissertations, institutional documents and data, as well as other files that may likely be
accessible to public. Higher education institutions are the major institutions that develop OA
repositories and it is academic libraries that manage the development of OA repositories (Cullen
and Chawner, 2011). Other information professionals may collaborate with academic librarians
to develop OA repositories.
Academic libraries provide OA repositories in order to collect and make available the
research output of their institutions (Schmidt and Shearer, 2012). Latif, Timo, and Tochtermann
(2014) stated an interesting note in relation to OA movement as follows:
Repositories as systems for collecting, publishing, disseminating and archiving digital
scientific content have become one of the most prominent types of digital library
applications. Especially with respect to Open Access publishing, repositories nowadays
serve as platforms for acquiring and disseminating scientific content, which before had
been almost exclusively released by commercial publishers (para 1).
Making resources available through OA repositories will also help researchers and other
academicians get scholarly information. The availability of preprint and postprint, dissertation,
theses, research reports, and other scholarly resources is valuable for scientific and knowledge
development. The tradition of providing such resources has actually been done by libraries in the
past and the collection was called grey literature. With the OA model, those resources are more
visible and accessible and therefore more readers can get access to them. Libraries can preserve
research documents, data, and other repository materials of their institutions for future use.

36

Commenting to the emergence of OA repositories, Hunters (2012) stated that actually academic
libraries have embraced digital publishing to provide digital resources for both faculty and
students.
Libraries can be the resources and publishers all at once. Nowadays this has been
practiced by some libraries and in the future, libraries will have more important roles both in
publishing and disseminating knowledge. In fact, libraries are always considered as “important
support for research and scholarly communication” (McKee, Stamison, and Bahnmaier, 2014, p.
190).
Besides offering OA repositories, librarians can also help scholars get OA resources by
compiling and indexing the OA websites. Librarians can play a role in scholarly and scientific
communication by providing access to research output and other documents from their
institutions in the form of OA repositories. In fact it is the librarians’ task to contribute to the
scholarly and scientific communication by providing and marketing the resources instead of
keeping them away from users. By providing resources through OA movement, librarians open
the doors of scholarly communication.
Libraries and Readiness of OAR Implementation
Besides urging the journal articles to be accessible online and free, the OA movement has
also brought repositories to follow the path and become OARs. Apart from all other stakeholders
such as the authors and funding agencies, librarians have led this movement. However, the OAR
movement does not exist world-wide. In the developing and underdeveloped countries, the
development has been slow. Many libraries still consider their repositories as an important asset
of the institutions and therefore the librarians keep them away from public. The librarians still

37

also consider themselves as the guardians of repositories. Another reason is lack of infrastructure
for online access.
The OA movement can help increase scholarly and scientific communication and it asks
librarians to change their ideas of keeping and managing their repositories and make the
repositories available online and freely accessible via Internet. Librarians need to understand the
change. They also need to understand the meaning and mission of OA movement which is to
provide resources in order to boost the growth of scientific knowledge. This change requires
librarians and the libraries as institutions to be well-prepared too. In this case, librarians do not
only need new skills, but they should also change their mindset. To be able to change from
closed access repositories to OARs, libraries need support from librarians as individuals and as
part of teamwork. The change will be successful if the librarians are ready and support the
change.
Definition of Readiness
Implementing a new policy, program, or activity in general will be successful if the
organization is ready. Implementation is a set of activities with certain dimensions designed to
put into practice (Fixsen, Blasé, Friedman, and Wallace, 2005). Being ready is defined as being
“prepared to do something” or “properly prepared or finished and available for use,” and “almost
about to do something” (Merriam-Webster, 2014). Readiness is also defined as a condition in
which the individuals within the organization is “psychologically and behaviorally prepared”
(Weiner, 2009, p.2). This means that readiness is a key element in implementing a new activity,
program or policy. Implementing a new activity, program, or policy means change from the old
to the new one or from nothing to become something.

38

To be successful in implementing a program or activity such as OARs, individuals in the
organization should be ready. In this case the individuals means both the staff and manager. The
Staff’s and manager’s attitudes towards change and the organizational factors like planning,
resources, and leadership are important for the success of implementation (Helfrich, Blevins,
Smith, Kelly, Hogan, Hagedorn, Dubbert, & Sales, 2011). Kirke (2013) also states that managing
change is important for an organization:
Whether the change is a small one, like the implementation of a new system, or a much
bigger one such as a company takeover or merger, the way that change is managed makes
all the difference to its success or failure

It should be noted that when there is change, the members of an organization may believe
that it is a good decision, some may anticipate it, and some others may be fearful (Self, 2007).
The content, process, context, and individuals involved in the program or activity within the
organization influence the readiness for implementation of a new program or activity (Holt,
Armenakis, Feild, and Harris, 2007). Thus, psychological and behavioral preparedness of both
staff and manager is required in every stage of implementation (Weiner, Amick, and Lee, 2008).
It should also be noted that readiness is “measurable across multiple dimensions, and vary across
dimensions” (Plested & Jumper-Thurman, 2006, p. 3).
Implementing an OAR requires readiness of the librarians and the libraries alike. The
librarians should learn beyond the scope of a library’s perspective. They should know their roles
in the scholarly communities and should be psychologically and behaviorally ready. Meanwhile,
the library should also be ready in terms of organizational factors.
Theory of Organizational Readiness for Change (TORC)
Theory of Organizational Readiness for Change (TORC) can be viewed as an attempt to
respond to the idea of generating change and lead to a successful objective. Readiness can be

39

studied from the organizational factors. However, in the last two decades readiness has also been
studied in the individual level within an organization (e.g. Armenakis, Harris, and Mossholder,
1993; Cunningham et al. 2002; Holt, et al., 2007; and Weiner, 2009). Table 2.1 shows the
summary of the measures of organizational readiness for change that have been adopted in
addition to Weiner’s theory of organizational readiness for change.

Systems Adoption. Proceedings of the Eighteenth Americas Conference on Information Systems,
Seattle, Washington, August 9-12, 2012. pp. 2-3.

Weiner’s theory of organizational readiness for change (TORC) identifies some factors
that affect the organizational readiness for change and emphasizes the contribution of individuals
involved in the implementation. In this case, the individuals are viewed as part of the teamwork.
In other words, implementing change requires a teamwork of individuals at different levels
within the organization to have the same perspectives of change. Problems may emerge if any
individuals in the teamwork do not commit to the implementation.
TORC describes five factors that affect readiness of an organization. This study on
OARs, however, does not use the theory as a whole; instead, it uses those contextual factors to
study the readiness of OARs. TORC proposes five contextual factors of readiness for change,
namely (1) organizational culture, (2) policies and procedures, (3) past experiences, (4)
organizational resources, and (5) organizational resources. The organizational culture refers to
various aspects of the organizational culture that affect readiness of implementation. In relation
to OAR implementation, those five contextual factors can be described as follows:
1. Policies and procedures of the academic libraries that may affect the readiness of OA
implementation
2. Past experience that shows the organizational culture when there is an implementation or
change

41

3. Organizational resources that include human resources and technological resources that
affect the readiness of OA implementation of OAR.
4. Organizational structure that affect the readiness of implementation of OARs in the
academic libraries
5. Organizational culture that affects the readiness of OAR implementation
It can also be stated that policies and procedures refer to those within the organization
that affect readiness for the implementation; while past experience shows the previous methods
of implementation that may have been done. The organizational resources are technology and
professionalism of individuals in handling implementation that could affect the readiness.
Organizational structure means the structure that influences the implementation. Theoretically
these five contextual factors can predict both change valence and informational assessment. In
fact, those contextual factors can either support the change or become barriers for
implementation.

As stated earlier, the contextual factors affect valence. Weiner (2009) also proposes that
change valence affects commitment. If the individuals in the organization value the change, they
will have commitment that will encourage them to participate in the implementation. Meanwhile
the contextual factors also affect informational assessment that shows the individuals’ level of
understanding of the implementation tasks, the amount of resources to implement, and situational
factors of change. When the readiness of the individuals in the organization is high, the change
will likely happen successfully. This study will not use the whole theory that leads to the
implementation effectiveness, instead it will use the theory up to the readiness for change (fig.
2.4).

Readiness should not only be created before the implementation but throughout the
process (Armenakis, Harris, and Mossholder, 1993). This is due to the fact that implementation
is not a single event but it is a process; therefore, it will not happen at once or can be done at one
time (Fixsen, Blasé, Friedman, and Wallace, 2005). As a process, the change refers to the stages

43

during the implementation (Holt et al., 2007) and readiness can be applied to “the adoption as
well as the implementation stages” (Stevens, 2013, p. 344) and at any levels (Weiner, 2009).
In other words, doing research on organizational readiness for change can be conducted
either before (pre-implementation), during (the implementation), or after the implementation
(post-implementation). Conducting a study on readiness prior to implementation will show how
ready the organization to begin the implementation; while conducting it during or after the
implementation will ensure that the implementation is running as planned.
Factors Influencing Readiness for OAR Implementation
Factors that influence readiness for OAR implementation include, organizational culture,
organizational resources, and management support. In other words, the management support, the
resources, and the culture of the organization will affect the success of implementation.
Organizational Culture
Organizational culture relates to the organization’s mission, values, the manager’s management
styles, the relationship among staff and staff and the manager, and the daily activities of the
organization. It is also viewed as “the ‘glue’ that binds an organization and “compass” may show
direction (Tharp, n.d., p. 2). Organizational culture relates to behavior and perception but
Lunenburg (2011) further considers the organizational culture as “the beliefs, feelings, behaviors,
and symbols that are characteristic of an organization” (p. 2). However, except the symbols,
some factors of organizational culture may not be clearly visible, for example “beliefs, values,
attitudes, and assumptions” (Desson and Clouthier, 2010, p. 3). O’Donnell and Boyle (2008)
stated that:
Culture…gives organisations a sense of identity and determines, through the
organisation’s legends, rituals, beliefs, meanings, values, norms and language, the way in
which ‘things are done around here’. (p. 4)

44

The organizational culture should be considered when an organization is experiencing a
change or implementing a new system as this requires new perception and different value. This is
so because the organizational culture “affects the performance of organisations” (O’Donnell and
Boyle, 2008, p. ix). Desson and Clouthier (2010) also mentioned that the culture of organization
can either support or hinder the implementation of new activities or programs. Therefore, when
implementing an OAR, a library should consider the organizational culture as it also relates to
leadership and past experience (O’Donnell and Boyle, 2008), policies and procedures (Bal and
Quinn, 2001), and motivation and commitment (Mobley, Wang, and Fang, 2005).
Organizational Resources
The main organizational resources that relate to organizational resources are the
collection or information resources, IT resources, and human resources. Ismail, Rose, Uli, and
Abdullah (2012) stated that organizational resources can be categorized as tangible and
intangible. The tangible resources, for example, are human, physical, organizational and
financial, while the intangible resources include reputational, regulatory, positional, functional,
social and cultural resources. Kraatz and Zajac (2001) considered resources represent
“commitments in the organization” (p. 635) and therefore it can be beneficial for the
organization. Implementation may not be successful if the organization lack the necessary
resources including budget, systems, time and information, and expertise (Gill, 2003, p. 308). In
other words, knowledge and skills of the organization’s members are crucial in the
implementation process. Implementing an OAR should consider the expertise of staff and other
resources especially information technology for OA.

45

Management Support
Management support means that the organizational members view their managers
supportive of the change or implementation (Holt, et al., 2007). It should be noted that effective
leadership will lead to successful change Gill (2003). In fact, leadership “deals with values,
visions, and goals” (Tsai, 2012, p. 82). Implementing an OAR requires leadership. The library
manager should support the change when an OAR is to be implemented. Mullen and Otto (2014)
described that the importance of library leaders in open access as follows:
The library can move from a passive management role to a strategic, more influential
leadership role when library leaders not only partner and collaborate, but actually lead
open access efforts with expertise and confidence (p. 296).

In addition, the implementation should be guided prior to the implementation and until it
is running. Gill (2003) warned that the implementation may fail if planning, monitoring, and
control are poor; while Armenakis, Harris, and Mossholder (1993) stated that staff should be
made ready and the readiness should be maintained during the implementation. In short,
implementing an OAR will be effective and successful when it is understood by all staff
including the manager.
Summary of the Chapter
This chapter has discussed OA, OARs, OARs in Indonesia, and theory of organizational
readiness for change. Implementing an OAR should consider readiness and readiness deals with
the organizational culture, organizational structure, organizational resources, and management
support.

CHAPTER 3
RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
This chapter addresses the research methodology that was applied to answer the research
questions and to fulfill the objectives of the research as outlined in Chapter 1. The research
design and setting, data collection, and data analysis are discussed as well as issues of validity
and reliability and any ethical research issues.
Research plays an important role in the contribution of knowledge and there are many
reasons why people do research. For example, they may want to increase their understanding or
knowledge of a particular subject; to find evidence with regard to policy development; or
develop a profession. This research investigated the readiness of OAR implementation and
Indonesian academic librarians’ perception of OARs.
Research Questions
This study is about readiness of librarians to implement open access repositories in
Indonesia. Readiness leads to successful implementation. The study on readiness for OAR
implementation has not been widely discussed in LIS but it has not been discussed in Indonesia;
therefore, it is beneficial to investigate the readiness of academic libraries for OAR
implementation in Indonesia. This emerging issue of Indonesian academic libraries to change
their repositories from closed to open access raises the research question: What has made them
ready to build open access repositories? And the research questions for this study therefore are:
Q1: What are Indonesian academic librarians’ perception of Open Access
Repositories?
Q2: What factors contribute to readiness to implement open access repositories in
academic libraries in Indonesia?

47

Q3: Why do these factors exist in the implementation of OARs in Indonesia?
Q4: How does the theory of organizational readiness for change (TORC) help to
explain the readiness of open access repository implementation in Indonesia?
Research Design
Quantitative and qualitative research approaches have different perspectives and different
purposes and therefore both methods have different designs. The mixed method approach
combines both qualitative and quantitative methods. In fact, the choice of which approach to use
for a research project depends on “the research problem, personal experiences, and the audiences
for whom one seeks to write” (Creswell, 2003, p. 23). Information science is an interdisciplinary
science so it is advantageous to use multiple approaches—as supported by Bates’ (1999)
insistence that information science “requires multiple methodological approaches” (p. 1048).
This research on readiness of OAR implementation was qualitative in nature but a quantitative
analysis was added to better understand all of the issues.
A quantitative research approach is both objective and appropriate to understand a large
data set. It uncovers the causality of a phenomenon and then generalizes the phenomenon.
Quantitative research approach is “largely planned beforehand (Krathwohl, 2009, p. 239). In this
case, instruments for data collection are prepared in the early stages of research and the analysis
applies a specific measurement. A quantitative approach is indeed more appropriate in certain
settings. It is also fast and economical, therefore it is suitable when time and resources are
limited.
Researching on readiness for change using a quantitative research approach will also
enable the researcher to generalize the results and discover what variables really influence OA
implementation. Holt, Armenakis, Field, and Harris (2007) consider a quantitative approach to

48

be efficient “to garner change-related information in large global firms” (p. 233). However, this
approach gives little understanding about the problem and will not find out new variables or
theory of readiness in OA implementation. In addition, this method can also make it difficult to
predict any future changes.
A qualitative research approach, on the other hand, is based on the interpretation of the
data obtained by the researcher. The method provides a better understanding of the phenomenon
especially because it is done through a direct observation or interviews with the people in the
location so that the process can happen naturally. In fact, the aim of a qualitative approach is to
cultivate an in-depth understanding of a phenomenon. This type of research approach is
conducted in the place where the phenomenon exists and it is done by interpreting the behavior
and meaning that a person experiences. In other words, qualitative research deals with
understanding a person’s perception of the phenomenon. This approach is “ideal for exploring
complex phenomenon about which there is little knowledge” (Krathwohl, 2009, p. 236).
Qualitative research also requires “much time-consuming, hands-on attention” (Krathwohl, 2009,
p. 239). However, conducting research on readiness for change using a qualitative approach
provides “incredibly rich change-specific information” (Holt et al. 2007, p. 233) and could result
in the identification of new variables or theory on readiness of OA implementation in Indonesia.
As stated above, the research questions were concerned with what, how, and why of OA
implementation readiness and led to multiple explanations. The research, therefore, applied a
mixed method with an emphasis on the qualitative approach. In other words, this was a
qualitative research design with the addition of some quantitative data.
This research was also interpretive. Lee (1991) writes that in social science, the reality is
not always measured quantifiably. He states that

49

The physical artifact, the same institution, or the same human action, can have
different meanings for different human subjects, as well as for the observing
social scientist” (p. 347)
An interpretive approach also refers to “such procedures as those associated with
ethnography, hermeneutics, phenomenology, and case studies” (Lee, 1991, p. 342). The
interpretive approach was considered appropriate for this research because the objective of this
research was to explore factors that affect the readiness of OAR implementation and this dealt
with the librarians’ perceptions of OAR implementation. The approach provided rich multiple
subjective realities and offered more than one explanation and evidence to its expletory approach
and reason. In addition, an interpretive paradigm offers a good basis for conducting relevant
research because it can facilitate the development of an understanding of the realities of the
organization’s members.
Readiness for implementation is a process which is multi-dimensional in nature and can
be assessed from several perspectives. In addition, quantitative, qualitative, or mixed approaches
can be applied to study the readiness for the implementation of OA repositories. Previously Holt,
et al. (2007) described that conducting a study on organizational readiness can use either
qualitative or quantitative methods. Some research on readiness have also been conducted using
a mixed method. However, as of this writing, there has been no mixed-method study on the
current topic in Indonesia.
Research Setting
This study took place in Indonesia, the fourth biggest country in the world in terms of its
population. In Indonesia, there are about 3,000 higher education institutions, but most only offer
diploma and undergraduate programs and out of that number, 375 are public institutions. While
the number of institutions offering masters’ programs is increasing, the institutions offering

50

doctorate programs are still few and no doctorate program in the field of Library and Information
Science (LIS) due to lack of faculty with LIS background. Currently there are only 5 higher
education institutions offering masters’ degree in LIS and 23 institutions offering undergraduate
program in LIS.
Out of about 3,000 academic libraries in Indonesia, there are thirty three that have
registered their OARs in OpenDOAR. This study dealt only with those academic libraries that
had registered their repositories in OpenDOAR. This was due to the fact that there had been no
data in Indonesia as the number of OARs in Indonesia. While online catalogs were common and
many libraries were still working on implementation of Online catalogs, repositories with fulltext
contents were still rare and few.
Sample Population
This study was aimed at understanding the phenomenon of academic libraries in
changing from close to open access in their repositories and registered their OARs to
OpenDOAR. Therefore the population of this research was the academic libraries that had
registered their OARs in OpenDOAR. Choosing a sample population is important in this
research. Onwuegbuzie and Leech (2007) stated that:
If the goal is not to generalize to a population but to obtain insights into a phenomenon,
individuals, or events, as is most often the case in interpretivist studies, then the
qualitative researcher purposefully selects individuals, groups, and settings for this phase
that increases understanding of phenomena (p. 242)

As stated earlier, the population for this study was the academic libraries that had
registered their OARs in OpenDOAR. As seen from the list, there were 33 academic libraries
that had registered in OpenDOAR (table 3.1). To get a better view of the situation, the sample
population was purposively chosen based on the size and number of types of repository.
Onwuegbuzie and Leech (2007) stated that sample size for qualitative research design should not
be too large and too small. If it is too large, it will be hard to extract the data, while it will also be
hard to achieve data saturation if it is too small.
There were 18 interviewees from six (6) out of 33 academic libraries. The interviewees
were based on the size of the repository size and number of variety of content based on the data
from the OpenDOAR data. They covered the large and small sizes of the repository and the
number of variety of content. Diponegoro University and Sepuluh Nopember State Institute of
Technology libraries had the large repositories and content, while Maulana Malik Ibrahim State
Islamic University library had the smallest repository and content. Meanwhile University of
Indonesia library has only one type of repository but it had the large repository but small variety
of content. The director of University of Indonesia library was newly appointed and it was
difficult to get in touch with him, so Syarif Hidayatullah Islamic State University library was
chosen as a replacement. Sunan Ampel Islamic State Institute, Borneo University, STIKOM
Institute of Business and Informatics, and Pontianak State Polytechnics libraries have small
repositories but large variety of content. Sunan Ampel Islamic State Institute and STIKOM
Institute of Business and Informatics libraries agreed to participate in this study. Both had big
numbers of content types but small sizes of repository. The other two institutions—Borneo
University and Pontianak Polytechnics were not able to be contacted.

Data Collection and Instruments
This study involved two data collection techniques: interviews and questionnaires. A
pilot study for the interviews was conducted prior to data collection in order to ensure that the
questions are understandable by the interviewees. Most of the qualitative data were used in this
study. The data from the interviews were analyzed manually as it was conducted in Bahasa
Indonesia. The findings were translated into English.
Interviews
Jacob and Furgerson (2012) state that qualitative researchers gather information “by
interviewing people” (p. 1). As such, interviewing is a common method used in qualitative
research to gather information from participants. It “provides access to understanding their
action” (Seidman, 2006, p. 10). It also answers the research questions and fulfills the purpose of
the research. Turner (2010) stated that interviews can provided in-depth information concerned
with “participants’ experiences and viewpoints of a particular topic (p. 754).
The web has increased the way people interact and it is common these days for
interviews to be conducted both synchronously and asynchronously. Synchronous interview are
conducted in real time and it can be conducted either face-to-face or distance, such as a
telephone interview. However, Opdenakker (2006) states that in addition to face-to-face and
telephone interviews, Web-based interviews are also increasingly used to gather data. He further
describes that using a chat box for interviews is preferred when social cues of the interviewees
such as facial expression, are not important and the interviewer has a limited access due to the
distance. However, this type of interview requires both the interviewer and interviewees to be
competent in using the chat box. Communication using a chat box is no longer a big issue and

54

exchanging messages using any types of chat box has become very common. However, it is
sometimes hard to get the most convenient time.
Interviews using a chat box may take longer than telephone interviews, but it still can
save time because the interviewer can directly download the interview chat log from the chat box
and paste it into a word-processing application, thereby giving the interviewer more time for the
transcription.
In contrast, an asynchronous interview is not conducted within a frame of time, instead,
there is time lag between the questions and the responses. This type of interview can be
conducted, for example, using an email. According to Ratislavová and Ratislav (2014) the data
richness and quality obtained from this method of interviewing is considered similar to those of
face-to-face. They further describe that
The asynchronous email interview is a qualitative research method where information
is repeatedly exchanged online between researcher and participant within a particular
timeframe. The data are not shared with other participants as is often the case in virtual
focus groups (p. 452).

A study by Brondani, MacEntee, and O'Connor (2011) shows that the feeling expressed
by participants in both face-to-face and email interviews is the same.
It is appropriate for people who prefer online than face-to-face interviews, email
interviews are good for people who “are not easily accessible or are geographically far apart”
(Meho, 2006, p. 1485). Email interviews are also appropriate if there is a big time difference
between the interviewer and the interviewee. In fact, email interviews encourage openness in
communication and enable the researcher to get closer to the experiences of the participant
(Ratislavová and Ratislav, 2014, p. 456). The result of interviews “can easily be transcribed,
copied and pasted” (Ratislavová and Ratislav, 2014, p. 452). It is interesting to note that although

55

this method has been common nowadays, few LIS researchers have adopted this interviewing
method (Meho, 2006). This study applied email interviews due to the time differences,
convenience for the interviewees to answer the questions.
There are three types of interviews based on the kinds of questions asked: structured,
semi-structured and unstructured (Mathers, Fox, and Hunn, 1998). Structured interviews enable
the interviewer to ask each respondent the same questions in the same way. In other words, it is
used very much like a questionnaire in a more quantitative approach. In fact, structured
interviews “often produce quantitative data” (DiCicco-Bloom and Crabtree, 2006, p. 314). In an
unstructured interview, the interviewer may discover a specific topic without any preconceived
plan thus allowing the interview to expand. Semi-structured interviews fall somewhere between
structured and unstructured ones. They are normally designed using open-ended questions.
During the interview both the interviewer and interviewee are free to discuss any topic in a more
detail.
This research used semi-structured interviews to collect data. There are at least two
advantages to use semi-structured interviews. First they are suitable to explore perceptions and
opinions of respondents and may be followed by further clarification if necessary. Second, varied
backgrounds of the participants do not require standardized interviews (Barriball and While,
1994, p. 330). Mather, Fox, and Hunn (1998) found that semi-structured interviews are useful for
exploratory research in which they can collect attitudinal information on a large scale. Semistructured in-depth interviews are commonly used for qualitative research and are conducted
either individually or in groups and can take anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours
(DiCicco-Bloom and Crabtree, 2006).Semi-structured interviews were conducted with the
academic library directors, heads of repository units, and the librarians involved in the OAR

56

implementation in order to gain understanding of their understanding of OA and their perception
and readiness to implement OARs in Indonesia. The interviews were asynchronous and used
email as the medium due to the geographic distances of the locations.
The interview questions were generated from the theory—in this case the contextual
factors of readiness for implementation and they are adopted from the previous study on
readiness by Allamki (2013). Changes were made due to the differences of study. Some new
questions were added including a question on how the participants define OA; whether the
library management communicated the implementation plan to library staff; and whether there
were resources about OA for library staff. In addition, the problem statement, research questions,
and literature review also served as sources for generating the interview questions.
As the location of this study was in Indonesia and both the interviewer and interviewees
were familiar with the national language of Indonesia the interviews were conducted in
Indonesian. The researcher translated the interview questions and a translator will confirm the
accuracy of the translations. After the translation of interview questions and prior to the actual
data gathering, the researcher conducted a pilot study in order to identify any problems in the
instruments and protocols before the actual research was conducted (Hassan, Schattner, and
Mazza, 2006). This pilot study was aimed at finding out if the interview questions were well
understood by the interviewees, in this case, the academic librarians in Indonesia. This pilot
study also provided feedback on the appropriateness of the questions when doing the actual
study.
Interview Sampling
Semi-structured interviews with the library directors, heads of repository units, and
librarians involved in the OAR implementation were conducted in six (6) academic libraries that

57

had been selected for interviews. The selected institutions qualified as the participants of
interviews based on a classification of size of the repository and the variety of content in the
repository: large repository and content; large repository, but small variety of content; small
repository and content; and small repository but large variety of content.
Based on the criteria of size and content, 18 participants were chosen from six academic
libraries out of 33 academic libraries. Those six academic libraries reflected the large repository
and content, large repository but small variety of content, small repository but large variety of
content, and small repository and content (table 3.2.). Diponegoro University and Sepuluh
Nopember Institute of Technology had the large repository and content and they had agreed to be
participants. Sunan Ampel Islamic State Institute and STIKOM Institute of Business and
Informatics represented the small repositories but large variety of content. Meanwhile Maulana
Malik Ibrahim Islamic State University had the smallest repository and content. In addition,
because University of Indonesia just had a new director and it was difficult to contact, Syarif
Hidayatullah Islamic State Institute was chosen instead. Both the libraries of University of
Indonesia and Syarif Hidayatullah Islamic State University had similar case, they both had large
repository but small variety of content.

The interviews were conducted in Indonesian using email that the interviewees had and
familiar with. The interviews started with the description of the research objectives and the
importance of their contribution to this research and followed by consent and the main questions.
The responses from all interviewees showed their perception of OA and OAR implementation
and current situation. Other issues uncovered by the interviews included the libraries’ readiness
to implement OARs and factors affecting their readiness to implement OARs.

59

The interviews was transcribed into Microsoft Word documents. The researcher asked the
interviewees to re-read the transcribed interviews and allow them to add any additional
comments and notes. The interview took approximately one hour per interviewee.
Questionnaires
Questionnaires were used to gather quantitative data for this study. A questionnaire is a
reliable way to develop a representative picture of the attitudes and characteristics of a large
population. The questionnaire was distributed via library emails (institutional emails) to the
designated persons who distributed the questionnaires in the locations and the respondents
answered them anonymously. The questionnaires were written in both English and Indonesian.
Before they were distributed, they were submitted to the Institutional Board Review (IRB) to get
approval. As the study dealt with human subjects, such approval showed that they were legally
acceptable. This study was approved by the Institution Review Board (IRB), University of North
Texas in April 2015. Documents for research such as bilingual questionnaires, bilingual
interview questions, informed consent for interviews and questionnaires, and approval letters
from the institutions participating in this study were forwarded to the IRB. Confidentiality was
preserved.
The questionnaires selected for this study were aimed at obtaining data on what librarians
understand about OA repositories, what factors affect the readiness of OA implementation as
well as the barriers that affected the implementation of OA repositories.
Close-ended questions were used in the questionnaire. Closed-ended questions allowed
for easy identification of different respondent’s answers. Additionally, the answers were also
definite, clear, and easy to codify and analyze statistically. The only limitation with closedended questions is that they force the respondents to choose only the available answers.

60

The questionnaire used in this research was adopted from several research questionnaires
on readiness for change with modifications for this study. The questions generated in the
questionnaires were based on the research questions, problem statement, research objectives, and
literature reviews above. To avoid the respondents’ losing interest and save their time, the length
of the questionnaires were considered; so were the consent and confidentiality of their answers.
The format, content (the required information), wording (understanding of questions),
response format (close-ended questions) and structure and layout of the questionnaire were
considered to make it easy for respondents to read and understand.
The questionnaires were tested in order to determine if the questions needed any
modifications. First, the questionnaires were distributed to librarians at Diponegoro University..
Their comments and suggestions were expected to aid in revising the design of the questionnaire
where needed.
As the questionnaires were distributed to six academic librarians in Indonesia, the
questionnaires were translated into Indonesian. The Indonesian version was sent to a translator to
compare the two versions to ensure accuracy of the translation before distribution. The
Indonesian version was emailed to academic librarians in Indonesia for any suggestions and
comments before it was finalized.
The questionnaire was sent to the designated librarians who helped distributing the
questionnaires in six academic libraries. Three academic libraries—libraries of Sunan Ampel
Islamic Institute, Sepuluh Nopember Institute of Technology, and STIKOM School of Business
and Informatics—were in one city (Surabaya) and one librarian from The Foundation of
Indonesian Library Development went to all three libraries to distribute the questionnaires. She
also went to Jakarta to distribute the questionnaires at Syarif Hidayatullah Islamic University in

61

Jakarta. Lastly, another librarian distributed the questionnaires in Semarang where Diponegoro
University library was located. One librarian distributed the questionnaires at Islamic University
of Malang Library.
The distribution of questionnaires was administered by three librarians who helped the
distribution of questionnaires. Prior to the distribution of questionnaires, the researcher contacted
the three librarians who helped to distribute the questionnaire using all possible avenues of
communication. The questionnaire were then sent to them in MS-Word format and they printed
and made copies of the questionnaires prior to the distribution. The data obtained from the
questionnaire were scanned and sent back to the investigator for data analysis.
Questionnaire Sampling
The questionnaires were distributed to librarians from all six institutions. The number of
librarians in all six libraries can be seen from the following Table 3.3.

achieve this number, the questionnaire were distributed to librarians. Four librarians both from
the institutions and outside of the institutions helped distributing the questionnaire.
The research questions were addressed both in the interview and questionnaire. As stated
earlier, the interviews were conducted with library directors, heads of repository units within
libraries, and librarians involved in the repository. Meanwhile questionnaires were distributed to
librarians in all six (6) libraries. The links between the research questions and the instruments of
data collection—interview questions and questionnaires—can be seen below in Tables 3.4 and

Data Analysis
The data analysis was divided into two processes: qualitative and quantitative data
analysis. The qualitative data obtained from the interviews were analyzed using relevant
technique; in this case the results of interviews were analyzed manually and also translated into
English for analysis using NVIVO software. Meanwhile data obtained from the questionnaires
were analyzed using the quantitative data analysis. In this case, the data were analyzed using SPSS.
Both data from qualitative and quantitative results were triangulated. Zohrabi (2013) states that

67

“collecting information from a variety of sources and with a variety of techniques can confirm
findings” (p. 258). This chapter ends with the discussion on the results of the findings.
Qualitative Data Analysis
After obtaining the data from the interviews with 18 library directors, heads of repository
units, and librarians, data analysis followed. Taylor-Powell and Renner (2003) suggested the
following stages to analyze qualitative data (Table 3.6):

The qualitative data obtained from the asynchronous interviews were exported from
emails and were transferred into MS-Word-Office and translated into English. Content analysis

68

was conducted using NViVO, a software for qualitative analysis and was based on the themes
and subthemes.
Understanding the qualitative data was the first step in the qualitative data analysis. As
the interviews use asynchronous written medium, there was no time to transcribe the data and
this saved time. The researcher needed to focus on the data and understood them well before
coding them. It was also important to focus on the value of a qualitative study by considering the
validity and reliability of the data.
Validity and Reliability of Qualitative Data
Shenton (2004) stated that there are qualitative methodological issues related to the value
of a qualitative study. These include (1) credibility, (2) transferability, (3) dependability, and (4)
confirmability.
Credibility is aimed at ensuring that the study measures what is actually intended. This
also means that the subject of enquiry can be identified. Credibility can be achieved by
developing “an early familiarity with the culture of participating organizations” (Shenton, 2004,
p. 65) as well as triangulation by using different sources of data such as interviews and
questionnaires to validate the results. Another researcher can also review the results the study to
increase confidence and enhance the credibility. The researcher held regular meetings with
another researcher/supervisor in order to increase the credibility. For this study, multiple coders
shared the analysis.
Transferability is one of the issues in qualitative data analysis. It means that the result of
the qualitative analysis may be generalized for similar situation. Sinkovics, Penz, and Ghauri,
(2008) view transferability as “parallel to external validity or generalizability in quantitative
research” (p. 699). However, Morrow (2005) warned that due to the small sample size and

69

inexistence of statistical analysis, “qualitative data cannot be said to be generalizable in the
conventional sense” (Morrow, 2005, p. 252). In the case of this study, the results were not
generalizable.
Sinkovics, Penz, and Ghauri (2008) stated that dependability is “concerned with the
stability of the results over time” (p. 699), while Morrow (2005) believed that dependability can
be “accomplished through carefully tracking the emerging research design” (p. 252).
Dependability is also related to auditing the research. In this case, the auditing is to ensure that
the research is conducted rigorously and systematically. The research data should also be welldocumented and the documents should be made ready for an audit.
To get reliable data for this study, data from the multiple coders were collected in the
Codebook and shared with the second coder. Data were considered reliable if the interrater
reliability is >0.8. Cohen’s Kappa is applied as this study had two raters. Finally, triangulation
was conducted for credibility
Confirmability of the study aims to reduce the effect of any researcher bias in conducting
a study and to assess that the findings are surely from the data obtained from the study instead of
from elsewhere. According to Sinkovics, Penz, and Ghauri, (2008) the researcher has to be able
to show that the data and the interpretation come from the condition and situation “outside from
researchers’ own imagination” (p. 699). In order to avoid this bias, the researcher should be able
to present the collected data and share the transcripts of the interviews, and that the participants
or informants can read the results that have been interpreted.
By taking into account credibility, transferability, dependability, and confirmability, the
researchers may be confident that the desired quality of the results can be achieved.

70

Quantitative Data Analysis
The quantitative data obtained from the questionnaires were analyzed using descriptive
statistics such as frequency, averages, and the range of data. The quantitative data collection
were conducted with regard to validity and reliability.
Validity and Reliability
In a mixed method, validity is “a matter of trustworthiness, utility and dependability”
(Zohrabi, 2013, p. 258). Meanwhile Allamki (2013) states that dependability is “parallel to
reliability, and trustworthiness which is in parallel to validity” (p. 89). Validity is concerned
with “whether our research is believable and true and whether it is evaluating what it is supposed
or purports to evaluate” (Zohrabi, 2013, p. 258).
Frequency and percentage, Pearson’s Correlation, and Chi-square were applied for data
analysis in this study. The frequency and percentage were applied to describe the group of
participants, while Pearson’s correlation and Chi-square were used to find out the relationship
between participants’ demographic data and their perception. For example the relationship
between participant’s age and their perception of OA, the number of years working in the library
and their perception of OA, gender difference and their perception, and the relationship between
the education background and their perception of OA. The questionnaires were analyzed using
SPSS and the reliability of the questionnaire was >0.7 Cronbach’s alpha which means it was
acceptable (see Cronbach’s alpha Table 3.7) below.

Internal consistency of the data obtained from the questionnaires was measured to
confirm that there was no contradiction in the responses from the participants. In this case,
triangulation was conducted in order to ensure the validity of the data. Zohrabi (2013) further
states that if the results of two different data are the same, the data are valid and triangulation can
be used to corroborate the findings.

This study deals with human subjects. This means that this study “uses people as the subjects of
experiments or studies” (Emanuel, Abdoler, and Stunkel, n.d., p. 3). Therefore, this study must
be ethical and respectful. For this study to be ethical, this study required approval from the
Institution Review Board, university of North Texas; approval from the institutions that would
the subjects of the study, and informed consents. It was important for the subjects to know about
this study in advance that their participation was voluntary.

Summary of the Chapter
This chapter has addressed the research methodology and design. As stated above, this is
an exploratory, descriptive, and mixed-method research. The population of the research is the
Indonesian academic libraries that have registered their OARs with OpenDOAR. The data
collection techniques will be synchronous interviews and questionnaire.

CHAPTER 4
DATA ANALYSIS AND RESEARCH FINDINGS
Introduction
This chapter deals with both the qualitative and quantitative data analysis and discussion
about the findings. The chapter begins with the qualitative data analysis and is followed by
quantitative data analysis. The qualitative data from the interviews with three levels of
positions—library directors, heads of repository units, and librarians—were analyzed to establish
an in-depth understanding of the issues explored in this study: perception of open access (OA)
and the contextual factors influencing the readiness of Indonesian librarians for open access
repositories (OAR) implementation. Meanwhile the quantitative data from the questionnaire
distributed to librarians were analyzed to support and confirm the qualitative findings. The
quantitative data obtained from the questionnaires distributed to librarians in all six libraries
were expected to support the qualitative data analysis. The chapter ends with a discussion about
the findings from both the qualitative and quantitative data analysis and it ends with the chapter
summary.
Qualitative Data Analysis
The semi-structured email interviews were conducted by email as it was considered the
most appropriate method due to both the time difference and distance between the U.S.A. and
Indonesia.
The participants in this study included library directors, heads of repository units, and
librarians involved in the management of OAR. They were interviewed individually to discuss
their perception of OA and the readiness of OAR implementation in their academic libraries. The
interviews were conducted in April and May 2015.

74

Fourteen (77.78%) out of eighteen participants responded to the interview emails. They
consisted of three (21.43%) female and eleven (78.57%) male participants. The 14 fourteen
participants consisted of three (3) library directors, six (6) heads of repository units, and five (5)
library staff. In other words, 50% directors, 100% heads of repository unit, and 83% library staff
responded to the email interview. One librarian and one library director failed to respond to
initial emails and follow-up reminders and two other library directors initially replied the
reminders sent via Whatsapp and email and said that they would be willing to participate but, in
reality, they never responded to the email questionnaires.
Semi-structured email interviews were considered appropriate for this study because they
offered an opportunity to ask more exploratory questions about their perception of OA and the
contextual factors of readiness for implementation.
The interview explored the librarians’ perceptions and definition of OA in general, and
the readiness of OAR implementation in their academic libraries specifically based on Weiner’s
Theory of Readiness for Change (TORC). Five contextual factors taken from the theory were
explored in the interviews: organizational policies and procedures, past experience,
organizational structure, resources, and culture. One additional factor—information sharing—
was proposed in this study to enrich the theory.
The contextual factors were appropriate to investigate the readiness of the academic
libraries that were attempting to implement OARs. Those factors were also important and
relevant for planning strategies to promote OA for future OAR implementation across other
academic libraries in Indonesia. Weiner’s theory conveys aspects that librarians need to deal with
when implementing an OAR.

75

Besides uncovering the academic librarians’ view of the issue and how they began to
implement OAR, the theory also offers a means of merging the structural, cultural, and
psychological views of the organizational readiness for OAR implementation found in this study.
This becomes a foundation of the study to identify organizational issues affecting the structure of
readiness for an OA implementation.
This section of qualitative data analysis deals with the views of the 14 interviewees
regarding their perception of OA and the contextual factors of OAR implementation in the
academic library environment in Indonesia, the problems that academic libraries face in the OAR
implementation—both internally within the libraries and outside of the libraries, and possible
solutions for future implementation.
As previously stated, the following study objectives were:
1. To explore the perception of Indonesian academic librarians in the Higher Education
institutions towards OA; and
2. To identify the factors that affect the readiness of OAR implementation in the
academic libraries in the Indonesian Higher Education institutions.
All contextual factors from policies and procedures, past experience, organizational
resources, organizational structure, and organizational culture were dealt with in this study. One
additional factor of information sharing is added. The perception and contextual factors from the
conceptual framework became the main themes in the qualitative analysis.
The qualitative data obtained from the interviewees through the email interviews in
Indonesian were imported into an MS-Office document and then translated into English. The
translated version was read and corrected by an Indonesian-English translator. Both the

76

Indonesian and English version of data were analyzed manually for preliminary understanding to
find themes and codes. A PhD graduate also analyzed this Indonesian version, shared the results
and did some corrections. Later, NVIVO was also used to generate themes and subthemes
obtained from the interviewees. The NVIVO software was downloaded as a free trial for 30
days.
First, the translated data were imported to NVIVO software and coding was conducted.
Important words from the interviewees were highlighted as themes for the perception and each
contextual factor. Later, word query was used to analyze and generate themes from the
interviewees. The frequency of words obtained from word query were used as themes for
perception and each contextual factors of readiness.
Perceptions and Understanding of Open Access
The first aspect of qualitative data analysis in this study is the librarians’ perception and
understanding about Open Access in general. This was done by asking the interviewees’ about
their awareness of OA, their definition of OA, and their perception of the benefits of OA for the
academic environment (see Table 4.1).
It was important in this study to recognize their awareness and benefits of OA from the
interviewees’ own perspectives. Understanding how they perceive OA is the key to determining
their level of knowledge about OA and how they would manage the implementation of OARs in
their institutions.

1. How do you define Open Access?

Definition of OA
A firm understanding of an issue is very important for every individual in an organization
before implementing a new program, system, or service, including OAR. In the interviews, most
librarians showed that, in general, they were aware of the existence of OA. However, they
seemed to have limited understanding of the issues and, therefore, most of the interviewees
defined OA in a very simple terms. Based on the NVIVO word frequency, the words open
(9.48%), access (5.37%), works (3.71%), institutions (3.00%), free (2.84%), online (2.84%),
information (2.37%), scholarly (2.37%), public (1.90%), and scientific (1.90%) are the highest,
as seen in Figure 4.1

Figure 4.1. OA definition
All of the interviewees defined OA as free access to information without any barriers.
One interviewee, L3, stated that OA should be free from any technical, legal, and financial
restrictions. L3 defined OA as follows:
OA is an initiative and movement that is aimed at opening access to research findings and
other scientific activities as widely as possible to the public without any technical
restrictions (without any login), legal restrictions (you can duplicate, keep, and
redistribute) and financial restrictions (without payment).

Overall, most interviewees also stated that OA enabled people to use the information
resources freely. While most interviewees stated that OA allowed free, open, or public access to
information resources, L8 viewed OA as a way of sharing resources:
OA is a way of sharing or making use of online references [which] can be accessed by
anyone at anytime, anywhere without any barriers (cost, licensing, etc.)
L12 gave another definition about OA:
OA is where a library provides everyone/public access to the collection belonging to the
higher education institution’s library where the copyright is produced by the institution.

79

It is interesting to note that although most agreed that OA offered free resources to be
read, downloaded, and distributed, L5 stated it differently. They considered the resources
available as OA could be in the form of bibliographical data and/or fulltext.
OA is a facility of access provided by institutions, government, or private agencies,
higher education institutions, etc. in relation to what they have produced in the form of
scholarly works that are considered as having value in developing knowledge through
OA. The format could be bibliographic data and/or fulltext depending on the institution’s
policy. With the hope that the OA will be able to rapidly develop knowledge for the
community widely with the available information.

L5’s statement eliminated the definition of OA and showed that they did not understand it
well. In other words, L5’s understanding of OA was limited and confused an OAR with an
Online Public Access Catalog (OPAC). Another confusing definition came from L4 who
considered OA as access to online information both freely and with payment:
Open access is freedom to access fulltext information both freely and with payment and
make use of it with respect to copyright.

Meanwhile other interviewees defined OA poorly. Below are the definitions of OA from L10,
L11, L13, and L14 consecutively as follows:
OA is what is available online, free, and free from copyright and other licenses.
OA is resources that are free to own, for public access.
OA is free to access
OA is a policy to provide public with an OA to scholarly works from an institution.

80

Based on the interviewee’s responses, it is clear that most of the librarians interviewed
viewed OA as free access to information, scholarly works, or research papers, but they had no
exact idea of the types of resources available via open access.
It is also clear that the librarians had a very basic understanding of OA. Although they
know that OA is an access to information that is free from any technical, legal, and financial
barriers, they had no specific idea of OA. Instead, they had a variety of ideas and considered OA
as an initiative or movement, system, policy, a medium, access facility, open service, and just
‘information’.
Familiarity of Open Access
The interviewees stated that they were all aware of the existence of OA and they knew
OA. NVIVO also showed that the interviewees were familiar with OA.

Figure 4.2. Librarians’ familiarity of OA

81

Figure 4.2 shows that the interviewees were familiar with OA, especially in relation to
access to library. The words familiar (10.14%), library (10.14%), access (7.25%), open (7.25%)
that were generated from NVIVO confirmed that the interviewees were familiar with OA.
However, L2 and L12 stated that they had only been familiar with OA for the last few years and
they were still developing their institution’s OAR. This was emphasized by L3 who said that the
library was aware of the existence of OA and the library started its OAR. L3 commented as
follows:
Thank God, our library has known OA. We have seriously introduced OA since 2010,
both to the librarians and the academic community.

L2 stated:
OA has been the current trend and it has become our library’s concern to establish and
develop it in the last few years.
In the interview, L12 stated that the library was aware of the importance of OA and
therefore the library was implementing it. It was surprising, however, that the implementation of
OAR was based on the belief that the implementation could lead the university to achieve a
World-Class university ranking. L12 stated:
Yes, currently UIN is developing an Open Access (repository) to become the WorldClass University.
Benefits of OARs
When discussing the benefits of OA, the interviewees mentioned several benefits and
especially those that dealt with scholarly communication. Specifically, open access helps in
supporting scholarly communication, increasing the quality of authors and papers as well as the
university rank, and avoiding duplication of research and control of plagiarism. The NVIVO

82

result showed that plagiarism (5.10%), scholarly (4.08%), and community (3.57%) were the
highest among others (see Table 4.2).

Control of Plagiarism and Avoiding Duplication of Research
There has been two contrasting views of OA among scholars in Indonesia. On the one
hand, OA can increase the number of incidents of plagiarism, on the other hand scholars view
OA as a way of preventing plagiarism. In the interviews, the interviewees considered OAR as a
medium to control plagiarism and to avoid duplication of research. Six interviewees mentioned
the benefit of OAR as a medium of control for plagiarism or duplication of research. One of
them, L7, stated as follows:
Automatically, the academic community can openly benefit from the repository and may
get information that is needed. Besides, OAR can be a measure or consideration of
scholarly works. It can also be used to prevent plagiarism.

Supporting Scholarly Communication
According to L1 and L9, OAR could provide access to scholarly works and therefore it
would open new research and develop new knowledge. This was also emphasized by L3 who
stated that:
OAR can function as one of the sustainable scientific communication infrastructure. The
sustainable scientific communication enables the development of knowledge more
rapidly.

Meanwhile L6 stated more specifically that OAR could be a medium of scholarly
communication within and across academic communities. L6 stated as follows:

84

In my opinion, OAR is very beneficial as a medium for scholarly communication among
academic communities within and across higher education institutions. Through an OAR,
a member of an academic community can access various scientific information needed to
develop science and technology.

Increasing the Quality of Authors and Papers and the University Rank
The interviewees considered OAR as a medium to increase the quality of the authors and
the rank of the university. They stated that this could be achieved because the publications in the
OAR were accessible widely and therefore increased the number of citations of their papers. L5
mentioned that OAR indirectly increased the rank of the university. L5 stated:
OAR may also increase the quality of research and the topics that are studied and will
result in new scientific information. Indirectly, OAR will increase the rank of the
university when many cited the scholarly works of the university.
Contextual Factors of OARs
The contextual factors of readiness for OAR implementation are discussed in the
following sub-sections and deal with policies and procedures, past experience, organizational
resources, organizational structure, and organizational culture. Another factor, information
sharing was added in order to determine whether there was information exchange within an
OAR, as well as the availability of OA resources for library staff and how they learned about OA
and OAR to support the implementation that leads to readiness.
As stated earlier, these contextual factors affect the change valence and informational
assessment that lead to commitment and efficacy. According to the conceptual framework
described in Chapter 1, both commitment and efficacy reflect the readiness of an organization to
implement a new program, policy, or activity.

85

Policies and Procedures
This sub-section discusses the policies and procedures as one of the contextual factors of
readiness for the OAR implementation. It is also intended to investigate the organizational
procedures of the OAR implementation, how other stakeholders affect the implementation, and
the most appropriate OAR policy in their institutions in order to build an OAR. The theme and
subthemes are presented in Table 4.3 below:

Encouragement of OAR Implementation
In implementing an open access repository (OAR), the library director had an influential
role both within the library and outside of the library, especially in relation to the OAR
stakeholders in the institution. On the one hand, the library directors ensured the university
administration about the importance of OAR and introduced the issue to other stakeholders such
as faculty and other units within the institution, and especially the university administration. At

86

the same time, the library director also needed to collaborate and discuss the issue with the
library staff who dealt directly with OARs and make the other staff aware of the issues.
The stakeholders—the university administration, faculty, students, and librarians—in an
institution may view the implementation of OA and OAR differently. While some faculty did not
always support the implementation of OAR, L1, L3, L5, L6, L13, and L14 responded that both
the university and library administration did support the implementation.
L1 and L14 stated that the library director played an important role in the process of OAR
implementation from the beginning. L1 described how he started the implementation and gained
support from the university administration during the early process:
The management invited me personally to discuss the future of ITS repository, [and]
encouraged me to have a better repository for ITS. And we responded positively with the
university’s complete support, in terms of budget and policy.

Meanwhile L14 showed a similar experience regarding the early process of OAR
implementation and stated the importance of communication between the library director and the
university management. L14 described how the process of OAR implementation was initiated by
the library director:
The library director initiated communication with the university president and deans,
about the urgency of OA implementation. With a good and intensive approach, finally the
president decided to implement Open Access. UIN Malang actually implemented OA
since 2010/2011, but it did not work due to the disagreement among faculty and students.

What was surprising to discover was the idea that OA implementation was based on the
plan to achieve world ranking for the universities instead of developing better scholarly
communication and access to information. L14 stated:

87

During the university meetings discussing Webometrics 1 and university ranking, the
library director was always present and ensured the management about the contribution
of the library in the Webometrics ranking. It should be noted that in our campus, the
urgency of OA has been understood as one of the factors to increase the university rank
in Webometrics, instead of a medium to share resources. Therefore, we use their way of
thinking to realize the implementation of OA.

Another important point was that the library director showed the importance of OAR to
all staff, as stated by L13:
In the library where I work, the library director is supportive toward the implementation
of Open Access Repository. In the place where I work, it has only been one year that we
began implementing the Open Access. Earlier in my office there was no Open Access.

As one of the stakeholders in OAR, the university administration at one university
understood the need to have an OAR, therefore they discussed it with the library director. In
another institution, the library director initiated the plan to ensure the university administration
about the repository implementation. According to L1 the university president invited the library
director to discuss the possibility of implementing an OAR and encouraged the library director to
develop it. Meanwhile another interviewee, L3, also stated that the university president
supported the implementation of its OAR by issuing a mandatory policy for students’ thesis.
According to L2 implementing an OAR should get support from the university administration.
Surprisingly one interviewee viewed OAR as a type of the media related to the university’s
prestige. He stated that:
The library, especially, should simultaneously encourage the university management to
support the implementation and development of OAR, because OAR is also related with
the increase of prestige of the university.

1

See the “Webometrics Ranking of World Universities” at http://webometrics.info/

88

A similar expression came from L1 who stated that the university administration
supported the implementation of OAR to achieve the university ranking. According to L2:
The university emphasized the need to develop the repository [that was formerly] not in
the ranking to become one that is in the ranking; however, the procedure should be
managed by the library.

While the university administration believed that OAR could help achieve the ranking,
departments and colleges disagreed with the implementation of OAR. Both had ideas about OAR
that were different university administration. L2 commented that:
The departments and colleges suggested to have only abstracts instead of fulltext. This
suggestions was not favored by the university who preferred fulltext Open Access
Repository so as to make it easy to access.
To cope with this disagreement, the library considered the support from the university
president as an important way to establish the OAR. This was realized by the university
management’s issuing of a decree for mandatory policy.

Mandatory Policy
The majority of librarians interviewed agreed to the idea of a mandatory policy, while
three of them were doubt and preferred to apply both mandatory and voluntary submission
policies. The NVIVO result showed that mandatory (6.78%) is higher than voluntary (3.61%)
one as seen in Table 4.4.

In this case, the mandatory policy was for students, while the voluntary was for faculty
due to the fact that not all faculty agree with OAR. According to L10, a mandatory policy for

90

submitting scholarly works to the repository would also increase the quality of scientific and
scholarly works and become a medium to control plagiarism of research. L14 stated that:
With a mandatory policy, I am sure that the benefit of shared repository contents will
increase.
However, the idea of achieving the rank of a world-class university again continued to
influence the librarian’s view of OA as L12 stated:
To reach the objective of a World-Class University, it seems to be necessary to require all
faculty, students, and other academic community members at UIN to help develop the
knowledge and preserve the resources in the repository. On the other hand, the library
itself is the center of knowledge resources.

In fact, the idea of becoming a world-class university had attracted higher education
institutions in Indonesia in the last ten years with the widespread discussion on Times Higher
Education Supplement (THES) among higher education institutions. THES reported that some
Indonesian academic institutions such as University of Indonesia, Gadjah mada University,
Bandung Institute of Technology, Bogor Institute of Agriculture, Sepuluh Nopember Institute of
Technology, and Diponegoro University had achieved good world rankings and that this report
had become a continuing issue.
Another issue of academic rank is Webometrics that measures the level of visibility of
academic institutions in the Web. Webometrics provides “reliable, multidimensional, updated
and useful information about the performance of universities from all over the world based on
their web presence and impact” (Webometrics, n.d.). Meanwhile Thelwal (2009) defined
Webometrics as “concerned with measuring aspects of the Web: web sites, Web pages, parts of
web pages, words in web pages, hyperlinks, web search engine results” (p.1).

91

Based on this idea of achieving a high rank in both Webometrics and world-class
university rankings, the librarians were of the opinion that mandatory deposit policies and
published works are a good policy as it would increase the number of resources for the repository
and therefore, the repository would support the online visibility and would then likely help to
achieve a higher rank.
Past Experience
This sub-section discusses the factors that affect the implementation practice in general.
The most important aspect is the organizational communication and planning factors that affect
the implementation. In other words, the contextual factor of past experience is aimed at finding
out the process of implementation—what is the issue, whether it is communicated and planned
ahead (Table 4.5).

Interview Questions
8. What are the main issues that affect the
implementation practice in general that needs to be
considered?

Responding to External Issues of Ranking
In the interview, it is clearly shown that national issues were communicated in the
institutions and could be the reasons to implement any activity or program, including the
implementation of OAR. L1 described how the national issues and the spirit of competition were
communicated and became the background of implementation:
The institute has been accredited “A,” but its repository is worse than private higher
education institutions such as Gunadarma University, Petra Christian University, and
others. The university management felt embarrassed, and personally asked the library
92

director who was just appointed in 2008 to develop the repository so as to be equal or
better than them.

Another example was described by L9 who described that the OAR was important
because it helped increase the university’s visibility:
University visibility, especially Webometric rank and control of plagiarism.
Communication and Planning
Communication among units within the institution and communication within the unit itself
became a starting point for implementation. As stated above, L1 personally discussed with the
university administration about how to have better repositories than those of other institutions.
The communication resulted in the library planning and implementing the OAR. In
implementing an OAR, L14 stated a similar situation:
In our campus there was communication and planning before the implementation was
started. The communication [was between] the library director and the university
management and the planning was conducted by coordinating with other units, such as
the Computer Center.

The communication and planning existed but these were only for a limited number of
people such as between the library director and the university administration at the institutional
level. There was no mention about the communicating with the staff in the library.
Organizational Resources
This sub-section deals with three aspects of resources, namely, the IT infrastructure for
the OAR implementation, support and skills of librarians in managing the OAR, and financial
support (Table 4.6).

IT Infrastructure
Implementing a sustainable OAR requires a good IT infrastructure. Based on the
interview, the librarians did not show strong confidence about the infrastructure. They stated that
the IT infrastructure level was between poor and sufficient. L2 expressed the need to improve the
infrastructure for the repository and stated that:
The technological infrastructure still needs to be developed so that there will be no
problem with the process of uploading files into the repository server; so will the access
or retrieval.

Another problem existed in the network as stated by L6 who mentioned the need to
develop the infrastructure:
The technological infrastructure still needs to be developed so that there will be no
problem with the process of uploading files into the repository server; so will the access
and retrieval.
Meanwhile L8 complained about the infrastructure that did not support the OAR and stated that:
Our technological infrastructure does not support us. We need a good server, good
bandwidth, and the most important of all is IT staff and librarians with IT skills.

94

Librarian’s Support
In general, the librarians showed enthusiasm towards the implementation of OAR. L6
mentioned how the librarians supported the OAR:
The support from their skills are very good and the librarians have worked hard to
develop the OAR from digitizing to data input or content management for the OAR.

However, while they were very supportive of the implementation of OAR, they were still
worried about their libraries lack of librarians who could manage the OAR as a big issue. They
tried to find a way to increase the number of librarians who worked for the repository. In fact,
many libraries still had a limited number of librarians who had IT skills. In addition, the OAR
did not always have assigned staff in charge. Due to lack of IT staff and librarians with IT skills,
the libraries collaborated with the university’s computer center unit to manage the OAR as stated
by L2:
In term of library system development at UIN, the library always collaborate with Pusat
Teknologi dan Pangkalan Data (Center for Technology and Database) that was formerly
called Computer Center Unit.

L11 also emphasized the statement by L2:
At UIN, there is a collaboration between Pustipanda (Center for Technology and
Database) as the unit responsible for the network infrastructure and software support. The
library works as an operator for repository data input and data validation.

L14 mentioned the need to work with the university’s IT center:
In my opinion, the level of ICT infrastructure to run the OAR should be sufficient, for
example the campus should have a high-capacity server (due to the amount of data to
keep). Besides, if there is no staff with IT capability for OAR, the library has to work
with the computer center unit.

95

Financial Support
From the interviews, it was clear that most libraries had no problem with the financial
issues. However, the problem of infrastructure, as stated previously, was mentioned during the
interviews. This problem could clearly be associated with the financial issue, because they also
stated that there was a problem of not having a server. This was also emphasized by L14 who
stated “there is one [problem], for purchasing a server.”
Another issue was the speed of approval of the purchase of facilities. It always took time
to get approval from the university management to purchase equipment for the OAR and make
the facilities available.
Organizational Structure
This sub-section of organizational structure deals with the OAR in practice, especially the
perception of librarians in relation to the persons in charge of OAR and whether librarians were
capable of managing the OAR (Table 4.7).
Table 4.7.

Interview Questions
12. In your opinion, who is able to run an open
access repository? And why?

Librarians’ skills for OAR
Based on the interview, it was clear that librarians were not very confident about stating
that they could manage the repository. Most of them thought the management of OAR was better
managed collaboratively by both the staff with IT-background and librarians. Only one
interviewee, L9 confidently stated that librarians were capable of managing OARs:

96

Librarian, because a librarian has strong knowledge about the basics of
information organization and knowledge management.
The main reason librarians were not so confident about managing the OAR is that they think
OARs are fully IT-based and therefore it require staff with IT capabilities and that librarians do
not have enough IT skills. Instead, they could only do the routine of data input.
Organizational Culture
This sub-section explores the organizational culture within the institutions that affects the
implementation of an OAR. The interviewees responded to the questions about the cultural
challenges and how the challenges affect the implementation (Table 4.8).

Interview Questions
13. What are the cultural challenges that could
face the institution when implementing an
OAR?
14. How does the institutional culture influence
the development of an OAR?

Staff Report
L6 mentioned the daily administration report as one of the organizational cultures that
affected the implementation. Reporting the daily work activities is conducted in some libraries.
This daily report could show how much work was done for the OAR. L6 commented on this
daily report in relation to the implementation of OAR:
In our institution, all staff should have a work plan and report the achievement online via
e-lkp—an online staff performance report. The report is dependent and will be considered
valid if it has been verified and validated by the direct supervisor, therefore, the
supervisor knows what should be planned and accomplished every day. The
implementation of OAR is affected by the culture of performance.

97

L2 emphasized this by stating that:
The working culture and clear work distribution in an organization supports the
implementation of OAR. Uploading data has been the daily routine that should be
reported in the Staff Performance Report.

It is true that nowadays many organizations including universities require all staff to
write the plan and reports to the supervisor. This model was also adopted in the state universities
quite recently.
Education and Information Sharing
According to L14, the most challenging culture was poor learning habit among
stakeholders including librarians. Although many did not understand OA very well, they also did
not try to learn about OA and kept themselves ignorant of the definition of OA. L14 stated:
Poor habit of continuous learning among staff (faculty and other staff) and librarians, in
this case understanding the OAR. Not all librarians and other staff are familiar with the
OAR concept, therefore, when a student asks about the OAR, they get no satisfying
answers.

The reluctance to share information among staff kept them from learning any new
knowledge and developments. Besides a lack of resources about OA and OAR, information
about OAR was not commonly shared. This resulted in the lack of awareness of OA. L14 stated:
There is no culture of information sharing in the campus so some faculty disagree with
the OA implementation at UIN Malang.

Apart from information sharing, in the interview, L12 complained about the slow
decision making by the university. L12 stated that:

98

Our library has been interested in Open Access Institutional Repository since a long time
ago and [we were] very eager, but the barrier was the policy from the institution;
therefore, it was only a year ago we started to implement this Institutional Repository.

A similar statement came from L14:
The organizational culture affects the OAR. At present, poor commitment and culture of
information sharing at UIN Malang will—in my opinion—affect the size of OAR. The
awareness of self-archiving will also be low if the challenge is not soon coped with.

In other words, information sharing had not been common. The development and
implementation could not run efficiently due to poor information sharing among units or
departments.
Influence of organizational culture on the development of OAR Cooperativeness
According to the interviewees, most librarians were basically helpful in providing
information resources and they expected the resources to be freely available. However, besides
being helpful, the librarians were also flexible in terms of decision and policy, especially when
the library had to deal with other stakeholders.
L1 described the difficulty of managing the contradictory perceptions of OAR among
stakeholders and the fear of plagiarism. In the interviews, L1, L7 and L11 mentioned that some
stakeholders disagreed with the implementation of OAR because of plagiarism. In this case, they
agreed to include only the title page, abstract, table of contents, and references, instead of
fulltext. Meanwhile L1, L7, and L11 also described that those who supported the implementation
of OAR believed that OAR would develop new knowledge and increase their citation indexes.
L1 said that those who believed in the importance of OAR agreed to say that OAR would help to

99

minimize any plagiarism because many people could read the repository and might identify any
practice of plagiarism. More knowledge of the literature would help to identify any plagiarism.
To cope with the contradictive views of OAR, L1 decided to put watermarks on all
resources in the OAR collection and provide a reading software application, but there would be
no downloading facilities. L1 believed that by not allowing downloading the resources in the
OAR would be safe from plagiarism.
However, an unexpected response came from L11 who stated that OA would lead to
plagiarism which of course it was related to copyright. L11 felt that students also did not want
their works to be published because it would be a file of their complete works, including
appendices.
The solution to the disagreement was to accommodate both parties. However,
accommodating both parties actually showed how weak the librarians’ position really is in the
university. And, to a large extent, accommodating both parties is at odds with the spirit of open
access.
Information Sharing
This sub-section deals with the management and sharing of information when dealing
with the new area in the profession. Communication within the library and the availability of
information resources (Table 4.9) are discussed.

Interview Questions
1. Is there any information for library staff about
implementing an Open Access Repository?

100

2. Are there resources for staff to learn about OA
and OAR in the library?
Information about OAR for Library Staff
In terms of knowledge about OA and OAR, it seems that most librarians lack of resources
because most of them rely the information about OA and OAR from the Internet and the Web.
However, according to L1, L2, L3, L6, L9, and L11, library staff were made aware of the
existence of OA. This was done, for example, through workshops and promotion of OAR to all
staff. The workshop was conducted to prepare staff for managing the OAR. In other words,
information about OAR was not communicated to all librarians, but only to those who involved
in the implementation of OAR.
One librarian mentioned that the library was still developing its OAR and that not all
library staff understood OAR. In addition, information about OAR was only available among a
few staff. L14 stated that:
Not all library staff understand OAR. At present we are in the process of implementing
an OAR—starting from the beginning, because our previous collection in the “digilib”
that have been uploaded, almost all are deleted due to the wrong procedures in 2012.
Information concerned with the implementation of OAR is only available among a few
number of staff, not all staff.
At this point, it is clear that most librarians understood OAR only from the technical side.
This was emphasized by L1, L6, and L11 who stated that the library held workshops to prepare
staff to manage the OAR in which they received information about how to do scanning,
uploading, and publishing documents. In other words, issues surrounding OA and OAR were not
communicated to all librarians, rather only to a certain number of people involved in the OAR
and the information conveyed about OAR was mainly about the technical work that the librarians
should do for the repositories.

101

Information Resources about OA and OAR
Although some stated there were resources and information about Open Access, it
seemed that the resources were limited. One librarian even mentioned that there was no
information about OA at all in the library, while L14 stated that the resources about OA were
mostly from Internet and the Web.
Resources about OA and OAR are mostly available from online [Internet] and Open
Access, we always try to share and learn together.

L6 mentioned that information about OA was obtained from the staff who had knowledge
about OA, while L1 stated that information about OA only consisted of papers about OAR in the
library. Another interviewee said that there was only one guideline on how to upload data to the
IR system.
The Internet has been viewed as the main source of information about OA. One
interviewee stated that librarians could access the Web to get information about OA; however, it
was emphasized that information about OA from scientific or scholarly publications was rare as
they did not subscribe to e-journals or databases on Library and Information science. It should be
noted that scientific meetings and discussions about OA are rare in Indonesia, although one
librarian mentioned that there was one conference proceeding on OA published by National
Science Agency, Republic of Indonesia. L6 mentioned that besides this proceeding, staff could
only learn about OA from a person who had knowledge about OA:
Staff can also learn or discuss with persons who understand the OAR (luckily in our
university there are two PhD candidates whose dissertations deal with IR), and the
institutional repository in our institution was also initiated by the idea from one of
them.

102

Lack of resources about OA and OAR in general was also admitted by L14:
There is no specific resources about OAR. We could only look for it in the e-journals (by
accessing the National Library databases and sources other than UIN Malang), because
we do not subscribe to any e-journals. And search from any browser.

In essence, the libraries still lack of information about OA and OAR. Some libraries
provided manuals and partial guidelines on how to manage some assignments for the OAR,
while resources about OA were obtained mostly from Internet.
To summarize, it can be stated that academic librarians in Indonesia are somewhat
familiar with OA and OAR. However, their understanding of OA is still limited and it is viewed
as a free access and free from financial, legal, and physical barriers. They also know the benefits
of OA in relation to scholarly communication, but their understanding of OA was only in the
technical nature of it.
It is also clear that the implementation of Open Access Repository was mostly based on
the goal of achieving a specific rank in the world-class university ranking and Webometrics. In
order to achieve this, they implemented Open Access Repositories with limited technological
infrastructure and skills. In addition, the implementation of OAR was not based on knowledge of
OA, rather the librarians learned only the basics and the day-to-day manual and training on how
to work with an open access repository.
It short, they valued the implementation of an open access repository and they understood
the tasks and the work that had to be done to manage the repository. The academic librarians in
Indonesia are ready to implement OAR, but with limited knowledge of OA and different
objectives, some of which were contradictory to the idea of open access.

103

Quantitative Data
In order to ensure the reliability of the findings based on the interviews, the results have
been triangulated with the quantitative data obtained from the questionnaire. This section deals
with an analysis of the questionnaire responses obtained from all six institutions between the end
of March and early April 2015.
A total of one hundred forty-four (144) questionnaires were distributed to library staff in
six (6) academic libraries in order to investigate their perception of OA and OAR and the
contextual factors of readiness to implement OAR. The questionnaire was sent to all staff
working in the libraries excluding the director, middle manager, and librarians who had
responded the interviews.
Out of 144 library staff, 106 responded to the questionnaires. The overall response rate was
73.6% (106 out of 144 respondents). The data were analyzed using SPSS software. The result of
the questionnaire is presented in the following pages
Demographic Information
This sub-section discusses the demographic information about the respondents who
participated in this questionnaire which includes their age, education, current positions, and their
length of time working in the library.
The demographic information of the study participants showed that the 106 respondents
consisted of 54 female and 52 male library staff and that their positions were varied: head of
library units, 10 respondents (9.4%), library staff, 19 respondents (17.9%), collection
management, 16 respondents (15.1%), repository units, eight respondents (7.5%), library
services, 27 respondents (25.5%), reference departments, seven respondents (6.6%), ICT, seven
respondents (6.6%), and other parts of the library, 12 respondents (11.3%) (Table 4.10).

The demographic data also showed an interesting interval of ages of the respondents.
Ages fell between 18 to 61 years old (Figure 4.3) with a median age of 40.5 years old. The
largest number of respondents (nine respondents or 8.5%) were aged 37.

Another interesting finding was the length of time the respondents were in their position. As seen
in Figure 4.5 15 respondents (14.2%) had been new in their current positions and stayed only for
one year or less while 16 respondents (15.1%) had been in their positions for five years.
Surprisingly, there were 22 respondents (20.5%) who had worked between 11 to 21 years and
had never moved from their positions.

Perception of OARs
The analysis of OA and OAR perception is divided into three aspects: knowledge about
OA, librarians’ definition of OA, and impact of OA and OAR on their academic libraries.
Knowledge about OA
OA has been around for about two decades, but it has been discussed and practiced in
Indonesia only in the last few years. As stated earlier by an interviewee in the qualitative data
above, there was one academic library that had started to initiate an implementation of a
repository in 2010, but it was postponed due to disagreement among the stakeholders. It has only
been implemented within the last year.
Based on the questionnaire, almost all respondents (106 or 99.1%) indicated that they
knew about open access and only one librarian (0.9%) did not know it. Forty-three (43.4%)
respondents stated that they knew OA from Internet and Web and 31 (29.2 %) respondents knew
OA from seminars or conferences. A total of 32 (30.2%) respondents learned from the
institutions, while only 15 (14.2%) respondents knew it from publications such as books, journal
articles, and papers (Table 4.12).

The data shows the respondents had low exposure to all media that would help them to
learn about OA. As seen from Table 4.12, 101 (85.8%) respondents did not read publications to
learn about OA. Similar findings existed for other sources such as seminars and conferences—a
total of 75 (70%) respondents never attended any seminars or conferences about OA. This is
clearly the result of the lack of seminars and conferences on OA held in Indonesia. Another
interesting point is the low number of respondents who got the information about OA and OAR
from their libraries. In the interviews, respondents stated there was a workshop about how to
perform scanning or digitizing resources for a repository but it was likely that not all librarians
participated in it.
Although the numbers were close, the number of respondents who did not learn about
OA from the Internet or Web was still lower when compared to those who did not.
In terms of the OAR in their institution, 103 (97.2%) respondents were aware of OARs in
their libraries, leaving only two (1.9%) respondents who were not sure about the existence of
OAR and one (0.9%) respondent who didn’t know about it at all (see Table 4.13). In general, the
respondents knew the existence of OAR in their institutions.

OA Awareness
Obviously, an awareness of the existence of Open Access is important for the libraries
when they implement an OAR. The respondents likely agreed with the idea that their libraries
were aware of OA. This is seen from the fact that 75 (70.8%) respondents agreed and 25 (23.6%)
respondents strongly agreed that their libraries were aware of the existence of OA. Only three
(2.8%) disagreed with the statement and three (2.8%) were neutral (see Table 4.14).

OA Definition
An interesting phenomenon existed when respondents were asked about their definition
of OA. As stated in chapter two, the declaration of OA states that OA allows any users to read,
download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of these articles, without
financial, legal, or technical barriers. However, when the respondents were asked if OA allowed
users to read, download, copy, distribute, print, and go to the link, 57 (53%) respondents agreed
and 19 (17.9%) respondents strongly agreed with the statement. However, there were 13 (12.3%)
respondents who were in doubt about the idea and chose neutral. Meanwhile 12 (11.3%)
respondents disagreed and five (4.7%) respondents strongly disagreed with the statement (Table
4.16). OA had been understood by many, but not all, respondents.

OA Benefits
According to respondents, OA gave benefits to their institutions. They also believed that
OARs helped to support research and scholarly communication and gained a better picture of
research output from their institutions.
In the questionnaire, 64 (60.4%) respondents agreed and 25 (23.6%) respondents strongly
agreed that OA publications in the OAR had more readers. However, there were nine (8.5%)
respondents who disagreed with the idea and eight (7.5%) were neutral (Table 4.17)

Besides readership, OA also supported research and scholarly communication. According
to the questionnaire, 64 (60.4%) respondents agreed with the statement and 32 (30.2%) strongly
agreed and only three (2.8%) respondents chose neutral and seven (6.6%) respondents disagreed
with the idea (Table 4.18).

In addition, they also agree or strongly agree that OA increases the visibility of their
institution’s research impact and helps to prevent plagiarism by both students and faculty. In the
questionnaire, 62 (58.5%) respondents agreed and 30 (28.3%) strongly agreed that OAR could
help prevent plagiarism by students and faculty. There were five (4.7%) respondents who
disagreed with the statement and nine (8.5%) who remained neutral (Table 4.19).

Contextual Factor of Readiness for OAR
The following is a discussion on the contextual factors of readiness for OAR
implementation. Five factors—policies and procedures, past experiences, organizational
structure, organizational resources, and organizational culture—were dealt with in order to
understand the readiness of the Indonesian academic libraries in the OAR implementation.

113

Policies and Procedures
The policies and procedures relate to the process of implementation and decision making.
It also relates to how the stakeholders view the issue. In the questionnaire, the respondents
viewed that influence of management and other stakeholders differently. Forty-nine (46.2%)
respondents showed disagreement that the management and other stakeholders did not affect the
implementation. Twelve (11.3%) strongly disagreed that the management and other stakeholders
did not affect the implementation. However, 27 (25.5%) respondents agreed and two (1.9%)
strongly agreed that the management and other stakeholders were not important in the
implementation. Meanwhile 16 (15.1%) respondents showed neutral (Fig. 4.7.).

In terms of the increasing role of the library due to the OAR implementation, 67 (63.2%)
respondents viewed there was an increasing role of the library in the institution. Thirty-four
(32.1%) respondents strongly agreed with the idea (Table 4.20).

In terms of policy, 54 (50.9%) respondents agreed and 46 (43.4%) strongly agreed that OA
should be mandatory for students (Table 4.21). They definitely supported the idea of mandatory
policy for submission. In terms of policy for faculty to submit their publications, 61 (57.5%)
agreed and 30 (28.3%) strongly agreed that faculty should submit their publications to the OARs,
14 (13.2%) respondents were neutral and one (0.9%) strongly disagreed (Table 4.22). In other
words, mandatory policy was considered as the most appropriate to support the success of the
OAR implementation.

In terms of copyright, the responses were varied. Eleven (10.4%) respondents believed
that there could be a problem with copyright while 11 (10.4%) strongly agreed there would be no
problem with copyright. Meanwhile 50 (47.2%) respondents agreed that there was no problem
with copyright, and 34 (32.1%) respondents were not sure about it (Table 4.23).

Past Experiences
According to the questionnaire, 64 (60.4%) librarians agreed to the statement that the
management supported the OAR and 33 (31.1%) of them strongly agreed with the statement,
while those who strongly disagreed, disagreed and neutral were 3 (2.8%), 2 (1.9%), and 4 (3.8%)
respectively (Figure 4.8).

welcomed the suggestions in order to implement the OAR. Sixty-four (60.4%) respondents
agreed and 33 (31.1%) strongly agreed that the management was open to any suggestions. Only
two (1.9%) respondents disagreed and 10 (9.4%) stated neutral (Table 4.24).

It is interesting that 71 (66%) respondents agreed and 28 (26.4%) respondents strongly
agreed that there was communication within the library before the implementation of OAR and
only five (4.7%) disagreed with the statement and three (2.8%) stated neutral (Table 4.25).

Financial Problem

Figure 4.9. Problems of financial issue
Organizational Resources
According to the questionnaire, 43 (40.6%) librarians agreed that their libraries faced a
financial problem for the implementation of OAR and 10 (9.4%) librarians strongly agreed with
the idea. While 30 (28.3%) librarians responded as neutral, and 21 (19.8%) librarians disagreed
and only two (1.9%) librarians strongly disagreed with the idea that the libraries had financial
issues (Figure 4.9).
The librarians also viewed that their libraries lacked of technological facilities to support
the implementation of OAR in which 56 (52.8%) librarians agreed and eight (7.5%) librarians
strongly agreed. Meanwhile 24 (22.6%) librarians disagreed and one (0.9%) librarian strongly
disagreed with the statement, leaving 17 (16.2%) librarians as neutral (Figure 4.10).
There was a similar issue between financial and technological aspects of OAR
implementation, in which the librarians viewed there were financial problems, while at the same
time they also thought about lacking information technology (IT) infrastructure.

enough capability of managing OAR. Based on the questionnaire, five (4.7%) stated they
strongly disagreed with the statement that the librarians lacked IT skills, and 58 (54.7%)
librarians stated that they disagreed. Meanwhile 24 (22.6%) librarians said they were neutral,
while 16 (15%) librarians mentioned they lacked IT skills and three (2.8%) librarians strongly
agreed that they lacked of IT skills (Figure 4.11).

Organizational Structure
Concerning with the most appropriate persons who can manage OARs, respondents
believed that librarians and staff with IT background could manage the OAR. Specifically, 74
(69.8%) librarians agreed and 20 (18.9%) strongly agreed that OAR should be managed by
librarians (Figure 4.12).

This is an interesting phenomenon as the respondents considered themselves capable of
managing the OAR but at the same time they also agreed that IT-capable staff could manage the
OAR. More interestingly, the number of respondents who strongly agreed that staff with IT
background were more appropriate was higher than the number of respondents who believed that
the librarians were capable of managing the OAR. In other words, the respondents were not
entirely confident about saying that librarians were capable of managing the OAR.
Organizational Culture
Apart from the low learning habits, the librarians were still enthusiastic in dealing with
the daily routines of their works and were aware of the existence of open access. The need for
learning and understanding was expected by the librarians and they agreed that they should get
information about open access repositories. Sixty-nine (55.7%) librarians agreed that they
needed to know more about OA and 42 (39.6%) librarians strongly agreed that they wanted to
know more about OA (Table 4.27).

In other words, librarians actually showed interest in knowing further about OA and they
expected to learn more about OAR.
Information Sharing
In term of information sharing, librarians stated that their libraries had resources about
OA and OAR in their libraries. Seventy four (69.8%) librarians agreed and 20 (18.9%) strongly
agreed that the library management informed the librarians about OAR (Table 4.28). This means
that there is information about OAR provided for the librarians.

Responses from the Open-Ended Questions
The questionnaire also had three open-ended questions in which the respondents could
express the condition in their libraries. Their responses are categorized into three main issues and
reiterated many of their responses in the previous questions.
First, most respondents demanded information and skills in relation to OA and OAR.
They felt that they did not have enough skills to work with current technology for implementing
a repository. In addition, they expressed a need for to learn more and better information about
OA and OAR through such events as workshops and seminars.
Second, they also expect to have better technology for the repositories. In other words,
they expect to have funding for technological facilities. They specifically mentioned
technologies such as scanners, servers, and better bandwidth.

124

Third, they considered that some faculty did not want to have their publications deposited
in the library as an OA publications nor did they want their students’ works deposited as OA
publications.

125

CHAPTER 5
DISCUSSION
Both qualitative and quantitative data analysis have been presented based on the
perception and the contextual factors that have been the basis for the analysis. There is also one
additional factor added to this study, information sharing. Both qualitative and quantitative data
analyses show some similarities and each supports the other. However, there are some
differences as well. This chapter presents some further findings and a discussion of the results of
the analysis.
Indonesian Academic Librarians’ Perception of OA
The qualitative data obtained from the interviews with the library directors, head of the
repository units, and librarians show that they were aware of the existence of OA and the
importance of OA and OAR in their institutions. They also knew the benefits of the OAR for
their institutions and scholarly communication in general. The quantitative data from the
questionnaire also showed that the librarians knew about OA and OAR.
Basically, the librarians understood the definition of OA and OAR and the benefits of
OA. The quantitative data show that most librarians read little about OAR and therefore they
knew only the basics of OA. However, those participants who were interviewed mentioned that
they did not have a lot of resources and did not subscribe to any databases or e-journals. They
learned about open access from the proceedings of a conference and how-to manuals for using
technology for scanning and data uploading. In addition, they also learned OA from a colleague
whose dissertation was about OA.
Education still plays an important role in making librarians aware of the issues. In this
study, it is clear that education has an impact on their perception of the OA. In other words, the
126

importance of OA is understood by those who have education. The Spearman’s rho (rs) between
education and perception of open access was not statistically significant (rs=-.182, p=.061).
Therefore, it is important to investigate further the LIS education. The same case happened with
age and perception of OA in which it was not statistically significant (r=.022, p=.820). The
relation between age and OA awareness was not statistically significant either (r=.105, p=.254).
Meanwhile, based on the chi-square test, there was no significant difference between
male and female on the perception of OA (X2 (4, 106) =2.665, p=615). (Table 5.1)

Lack of available publications about OA actually resulted in their poor knowledge of the
fundamental issues underlying open access. At the same time, most of the respondents and the
interviewees showed that they understood OA from the technical side. However, the underlying
philosophy and knowledge of OA did not really exist and the reasons of implementing an OAR
was not based on the spirit of OA in general. In addition, some of the librarians were not very
clear on the difference between an open access repository and a library catalog or OPAC; some
believe that records in an OAR are similar to bibliographic data, instead of fulltext.
In other words, it can be said that the librarians actually have the necessary skills but not
enough knowledge of the fundamentals of open access and OA repositories. In fact, there was a

127

difference between the library directors who held masters’ degree and the librarians who had
diplomas in LIS or other fields. Most library directors understood open access better than the
staff and the librarians.
The university administration discussed with the library directors the importance of
achieving a higher university ranking and this was clearly one of the main reasons for
implementing an OAR; the administration was very enthusiastic about implementing OAR due
to their expectation that the repository would raise the reputation of the university. Meanwhile
the librarians viewed the repositories in their libraries as very important and would enhance their
role of supporting scholarly and scientific communication. At the same time, the idea of
achieving the repository rank of Webometrics also affected the librarians’ feelings about
implementing the OAR.
Contextual factors of readiness of academic libraries for OAR implementation
As discussed previously in Chapter 2 Weiner’s theory of organizational readiness for
change (TORC) identifies some factors that affect the organizational readiness for change and
emphasizes the contribution of individuals involved in the implementation. The individuals are
viewed as part of the teamwork. In other words, implementing change requires a teamwork of
individuals at different levels within the organization to have the same perspectives of change.
Problems may emerge if any individuals in the teamwork do not commit to the implementation.
Again, this study does not use the theory as a whole; instead, it uses those contextual
factors to study the readiness of OARs. TORC proposes five contextual factors of readiness for
change, namely (1) organizational culture, (2) policies and procedures, (3) past experiences, (4)
organizational resources, and (5) organizational resources. The organizational culture refers to

128

various aspects of the organizational culture that affect readiness of implementation. In relation
to OAR implementation, those five contextual factors can be described as follows:
•

Policies and procedures of the academic libraries that may affect the readiness of OA
implementation

•

Past experience that shows the organizational culture when there is an
implementation or change

•

Organizational resources that include human resources and technological resources
that affect the readiness of OA implementation of OAR.

•

Organizational structure that affect the readiness of implementation of OARs in the
academic libraries

•

Organizational culture that affects the readiness of OAR implementation

The Policies and Procedures
As discussed, it is clear that the process of OAR implementation was really initiated by
the stakeholders’ need to achieving a certain rank, most notably by Webometrics. In this case,
the visibility of the institution on the Web. Another factor, which was the university prestige,
also affected the plan to implement an open access repositories.
Competition in various fields have existed in Indonesia, including that in higher
education institutions—for example, students’ competition, faculty competition, and institutional
level competition. This competition has indeed become a phenomenon that triggers higher
education institutions to spend time and effort to achieve it. Winning in a competition is
considered important because achieving awards can help the institution to increase their prestige
and thus promote themselves. The high number of higher education institutions in Indonesia has
made competition an important factor in institutional survival, especially for private universities

129

that struggle to get students. It is no surprise that implementing an OAR could also be one of the
factors that could be used to win in a competition. OA repositories have indeed become one of
the more popular emerging practices in Indonesia due to the announcement of the Webometrics
competition.
Unlike OAR, Open Access Journal (OAJ) implementation is not popular and rarely
discussed in any media in Indonesia. OA journals are not considered as helpful in increasing the
rank. Rather they are viewed as media of a scholarly communication without prestige. In
Indonesia, the prestige of journals is based on accreditation by Higher Education Agency and
this is done only for printed journals and not online (i.e., e-journals).
Communication between the university administration and the library was one of the
factors to realizing OAR prior to implementation. The communication was initiated by the
library director or the university administration. Unfortunately, this communication was mainly
between the university administration and the library and it did not involve other stakeholders
such as faculty and students. This is ironic because the decree of mandatory OA policy was for
students’ thesis and dissertations to be deposited and it was issued without any preliminary
discussion with students. In addition, the mandatory policy did not affect faculty’s publications
either. No decree had been issued for faculty to submit their publications to the OAR, but
students have to submit their thesis, term-papers, and dissertations. Some faculty also disagreed
with the OAR implementation due to their belief that OAR would be the source of plagiarism
instead of helping to prevent it.
There was a clear lack of collaboration between academic librarians and faculty who are
also stakeholders in the repository. It is important for academic librarians to collaborate with
faculty and promote the benefits of OAR to them in order to gain more support from them. This
130

support would help the library to develop the variety of resources in the OAR. So far, thesis and
students’ term-papers are the main repository content as the number of dissertations is not very
high. Also, the university administration and the library in this study did not consider it urgent
for the university to issue mandatory policy for faculty publications.
Past Experience
The implementation of OAR passed the process of communication and planning. First,
the communication was with the university administration and the other was within the library in
which planning was also held. In the communication between the library and the university
administration, two models of communication were apparent in the implementation of OAR.
First, the library director proposed the implementation of OAR to the administrators, and second,
the administrators invited the library director to discuss the implementation of OAR. In both,
however, the library director preferred to discuss the implementation of OAR from the viewpoint
of the university administration—to achieve a higher rank in Webometrics and THES.
The librarians mentioned the communication between the library administration and the
librarians. The library director communicated with the librarians about the need to implement
OAR and was open to suggestions from the librarians. The plan was also supported by some
activities, such as holding workshops and training on how to manage the collection for OAR.
There was no statistically significant relationship between current position and communication
(X2 (15, 106) = 9.459, p=.193) (see Table 5.1), which means that there is no barrier of
communication among librarians with different positions (Table 5.4).
While the number of female and male respondents was almost equal, the data analysis
shows that there is no statistically significant relationship between gender and communication
within an academic library X2 (3, 106) = 3.450, p=.326 (See Table 5.1).
131

Librarians were trained on how to manage the OAR, for example, by practicing how to
scan the available printed collection. By doing this, the librarians could manage the daily
operation of the repository works. So far, OAR is mainly viewed from the practical side. It is a
service for the library users who need online resources. Most of the academic libraries that had
implemented OAR had manuals and technical resources about OA for the librarians working in
the OAR unit. The availability of manuals and technical papers on how-to helps the librarians in
the day-to-day routines of running a repository. Most of the librarians knew how to manage the
resources for OAR. But, due to lack of resources about OA and OAR, they have limited
knowledge of OA. To support their understanding, there should be more information resources in
Indonesian so that academic librarians can read more broadly and learn more deeply about open
access.
Organizational Structure
In term of persons in charge of OAR, it is clear that the librarians were in doubt as to
whether they were entirely capable of managing the repositories. Therefore, they felt that staff
with IT-background were the ones who would also be competent in managing the OAR. Both the
interviews and questionnaire responses showed that they mentioned both librarians and staff with
IT-background as being the most appropriate to have. In fact, librarians in Indonesia have been
viewed as having less confidence in becoming librarians. People in general view librarians as
persons who keep books on the shelves. The Library and Information Science (LIS) education in
Indonesia in general still lacks technological advancement, therefore, it is very common for the
librarians to not feel confident with information technology.
Compare to those who manage the repositories, librarians in general view themselves as
capable of managing the repositories’ resources because they felt that they had learned how to

132

manage library resources but not the technology. Therefore, they also considered those staff with
IT background could also manage the OAR or work collaboratively with the librarians.
However, in the open-ended questions in the questionnaire, they expected to get more IT-related
training as they felt no confidence with their management of any services that required IT
knowledge and skills.
Statistically, however, the Chi Square test shows there is no relationship between position and
their perception of a person who is capable of managing an OAR X2 (20, 106)=18.568 p=.550
(see again Table 5.1 above).
Organizational Resources
Three points are discussed in this sub-section, technological issue, support from
librarians, and financial issue. The technological aspect is important in the OAR implementation.
This includes IT software, hardware facilities, and Internet access. Based on the interview and
questionnaire, most librarians did not clearly show that they had problem with financial issues.
During the interview most stated that they had no problem, and only one who clearly stated that
they had problem. However, the statement that they needed sufficient technological facilities can
be seen as there was actually financial problem. In the questionnaire, more than half of the
respondents stated they had problem with the IT infrastructure, while in the interview there was
also statement that the process of getting budget was a problem as it took some time to get
approval.
In fact, the problem in the university is that the process of budget approval usually takes a
long time. Another problem is that the budget usually is not available in the first few months for
the state academic institutions. In addition, although there is a place to purchase, most items for
purchase usually have to go to the bidding process.
133

In term of library support, the librarians in general felt they could manage the OAR
because they had skills to manage the resources, but they preferred to work together with the IT
staff due to their lack of confidence to manage the IT aspects. This aspect of human resources
was stated in the questionnaire and interview. In the open-ended questions at the end of the
questionnaires, librarians also mentioned the need of training especially in relation to IT.
Organizational Culture
The fact that the librarians felt inferior to faculty existed as librarians never had a definite
decision when faculty urged to close the access to repository contents and no policy had been
issued with regard to faculty. The librarians also accommodated the faculty’s expectation instead
of urging the faculty to submit their publications. Also, when the librarians expected to upload
the students’ thesis and the faculty disagreed with this practice due to plagiarism, the library put
watermark and that the resources were not downloadable. This is actually against the idea of OA
but the librarians accommodated the faculty’s idea.
Information Sharing
In term of information sharing, the librarians mentioned that the library director and
management communicated with the librarians about the implementation of OAR. Therefore,
they knew about it. The information was useful because the librarians should know what new
program or activities were implemented in the library.
In addition, librarians stated that their libraries had resources about OA and OAR in their
libraries. However, as found out in the interviews, the resources were mainly manuals and
practical guidelines on how to work with the collection and management of repository in general.
Apart from the contents of the OA information, there is a relationship between education and
information sharing X2 (18, 106) = 32.403, p=.020 (see Table 5.1). It can be said that the
134

librarians understand the information if they have education.5.3.3. Contextual factors and
readiness
Based on the analysis of the qualitative data above, it can be said that overall the library
values the OAR implementation. This was shown by the existence of policy and procedure that
involved communication between the library and the university administration. The
organizational culture led the librarians to support running the OAR.
The organizational structure shows that the librarians could run the OAR with the support
of IT staff. The positive support of the librarians was also shown by the belief that they had
knowledge on how to manage the resources for OAR. There are some potential financial
problems. The OAR, however, still can run with the current situation. The information sharing
shows that there was communication about OAR within the library and there were also
information resources available for staff, although they were not scientific resources, but they
had and could use the resources to run the OAR on a daily basis. In short, they had good
efficacy. With strong commitment and good efficacy, the library could run the OAR
implementation. The quantitative data analysis showed similar results. However, the strong
commitment of the library may lead to readiness for OAR implementation with the support and
commitment from the institution.
The theory of readiness for change describes that good organizational culture, policies,
and past experience will lead to change valence. The higher the valence, the higher the
commitment. Meanwhile organizational structure and organizational resources affect information
assessment which lead to efficacy. High efficacy and commitment will lead to readiness.

135

When measuring construct validity, there were three questions from contextual factors of
organizational culture, policies and procedures, and past experience that had loading factors <0.5
(See Appendix B), while in the contextual factors of organizational structure and organizational
resources there were three other questions with loading factors <0.5. By omitting those six
questions, all loading factors were >0.5. The process was followed by reading the reliability
coefficient using both Cronbach Alpha (Table. 5.2) and Composite Reliability (Table 5.3).

The reliability coefficient in Table 5.2 showed that there was one component Contextual factor B
(organizational structure and organizational resources) which was lower than 0.6 in Cronbach
Alpha. In the composite reliability, all factors are >0.6 (See Table 5.3), therefore, composite
reliability is used in this study.

Based on the data analysis, it was found that Contextual Factors A (organizational
culture, policies and procedures, and past experience) supports change value (T = 7.8 > 1.96);
while Contextual Factors B (organizational structure and organizational resources) supports the
informational assessment (T=2.8>1.96) and leads to high efficacy (T=4.4>1.96). The efficacy is
also strong which means efficacy support readiness (T=5.98 > 1.96). However, high commitment
of the library does not always lead to readiness (T=0.9 < 1.96).
This is understandable because the library is only one part of the institution as a whole.
There are other stakeholders that play a role in the implementation of OAR. It is important for
the library to convince other stakeholders to support the implementation. The library director
also plays an important role in the OAR implementation and in convincing the other stakeholders
of the need to support open access.
Summary of the Chapter
This chapter has discussed data analysis and finding. The analysis shows that both the qualitative
and quantitative data have similarities in the responses. In general, the librarians have a only
basic understanding of open access. All five contextual factors (policy and procedures, past
experience, organizational structure, organizational resources, and organizational culture) were
constructive for readiness of OAR implementation.

CHAPTER 6
CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Introduction
This final chapter presents the main conclusions of this exploratory study in relation to
the aims, objectives and questions of the research. Contributions to knowledge are highlighted,
and contributions to practice are made. Practical recommendations are also made concerning the
readiness for implementation of an OAR in Indonesia. Finally, suggestions for further research
and the research’s limitations are presented.
Conclusion of Research
The study has shown several underlined factors that Indonesian government, the
academic communities, and librarians should consider in relation to scholarly communication,
repository, and open access.
First, with regard to the idea of open access and open access repository, there should be
more discussion, meeting, and lectures on open access with wider participants as it is important
to have the same understanding among the stakeholders of open access repository. It is also
critical for the academic communities to understand open access from its philosophical and
scientific aspects instead of merely the technical side of it. Librarians do need to learn further
about open access. Without understanding the fundamentals of open access repository, the
implementation of OAR will only become a daily routine of collecting resources and neglecting
the development of scholarly communication in Indonesia. With limited number of research
output and poor number of research publications, it is important for academic libraries to support
the dissemination of knowledge and collaborate with all stakeholders of OAR. Instead of
showing and providing access to subscribed databases that mostly written by foreign scholars

138

that has been the daily practice among academic librarians, they should also develop the
resources written by Indonesian scholars for the benefits of scientific and scholarly
communication in Indonesia.
It is also important for the Library and Information Science (LIS) schools to introduce
open access and scholarly communication in their courses. So far, both open access and scholarly
communication have never been dealt with in the LIS courses both in the undergraduate and
graduate levels. Besides, LIS schools in Indonesia need to consider having courses related to
current information technology so that the graduates will have more confident in managing
resources and services and IT capabilities in the institutions where they work.
Academic libraries should also provide more workshops on open access and trainings on
information technology for their librarians. Providing resources about open access will also
enable them to learn about the fundamentals of open access. Librarians should have broader
knowledge of open access when implementing an OAR.
Second, the library director plays an important role in implementing an open access
repository, the director should be knowledgeable of open access. Ensuring all stakeholders about
the importance of open access scientifically and more rationally, instead of merely considering
the university and repository rankings and the technical sides. Before the increasing number of
librarians adopt the idea that implementing an open access repository will increase the university
ranks, it is better for librarians to have better vision of open access. The library director should
consider the importance of librarians having better ideas of open access
Finally, as found in this study, plagiarism has also been an issue according to the
librarians. Faculty still believe that open access repository will result in ease of plagiarizing

139

scholarly works and the increasing number of plagiarism. They do feel worried that their works
will be easily plagiarized. Instead of accommodating the faculty’s belief, librarians should
approach faculty and promote open access to them. Accommodating their idea of open access
means that the librarians still do not understand the role of open access for scholarly
communication.
Limitations of the Study
This study was far from perfect but it has contributed to issues concerning with the Open
Access Repositories in Indonesia. There should be further studies about Open Access
Repositories in Indonesia. This was the first study of readiness of Open Access Repository
implementation in Indonesia and dealt only with limited number of academic libraries that have
registered their repository to OpenDOAR. It did not deal with the academic libraries that had not
registered their repositories to OpenDOAR.
Another limitation was that all academic libraries that became the subjects of this study
was in the island of Java the most densely populated and most advanced in terms of information
technology, internet access, and academic libraries. Therefore, it did lack of information about
the Open Access Repositories in 8 academic libraries outside of Java Island, namely, Andalas
University, Bengkulu University, Sriwijaya University, and University of North Sumatra in
Sumatra Island; Borneo University and Pontianak Polytechnics in Borneo Island, Hassanuddin
University in Sulawesi Island, and Denpasar Institute of Arts in Bali Island. It should be noted
that out of 33 academic libraries that have registered their repositories in OpenDOAR, 25 of
them are in the island of Java.
This study of readiness of Open Access Repository implementation dealt only with
academic librarians, whereas there are other stakeholders that play roles in the repositories
140

including the university management, faculty, research departments, and computer centers, and
students. Therefore, this study reflected the views of only academic librarians instead of the
whole stakeholders within each institution. Further studies on Open Access Repository
implementation in Indonesia should deal with those other stakeholders in order to get better
views of the issue.
Future Research
This was the first study on readiness of Indonesian academic libraries for OAR
implementation. This study was far from perfect, but at least it uncovered the understanding of
the OAR implementation in the Indonesian academic library environment. There are a lot more
that need to be explored for future research in order to get better views of OA and OAR in
Indonesia.
The fact that in Indonesia, Java Island has better IT facilities and more skillful librarians,
future research should also include academic libraries outside of Java island or a comparative
study between academic libraries in Java and other islands in Indonesia. In addition, the
academic libraries that became the subjects of this study were all based on the OpenDOAR and
had implemented or had been implementing OAR. It will be beneficial too to study the same
topic for the libraries that have not implemented OAR.
Finally, as the stakeholders of OAR are not only librarians, but also other units within an
institution, a more comprehensive study that involves other stakeholders will be valuable.

141

Recommendation
Based on the findings, below are some recommendations for both the academic libraries
that have implemented the Open Access Repository and those that will implement an Open
Access Repository:
1. There has been lack of knowledge about Open Access and Open Access Repository in
general that causes their understanding of Open Access and Open Access Repository was
not strong enough. The philosophy and knowledge of Open Access does not really exists
and the reasons of implementing an Open Access Repository was not based on the spirit
of Open Access in general; instead, it is based on the ideal of achieving the institution’s
rank. The university management were enthusiastic to implement Open Access due to
their expectation to achieve the repository rank.
2. So far Open Access and Open Access Repository are mainly viewed from the practical
side. Most academic libraries that had implemented Open Access Repositories had
manuals and technical resources about Open Access. The availability of manuals and
technical papers on how-to helps the librarians to do the routines of Open Access
Repository works. However, to support their understanding, there should be more
information resources in Indonesian so that academic librarians can read and learn about
Open Access better. It is also good for academic institutions that have LIS education to
include the topic of OA in the courses.
3. The findings show that there is lack of collaboration between academic librarians and
faculty who are also the stakeholders of the repository. It is important for academic
librarians to collaborate with faculty and promote the benefits of Open Access Repository

142

to them and to gain more support from them. This support will help the library to develop
the variety of resources in the Open Access Repositories that they have implemented.
4. As the study shows that the number of academic libraries that have implemented Open
Access Repositories was still small, it is important for the Indonesian academic library
association as well as the National Library of Republic of Indonesia to promote the
implementation of Open Access Repositories so that more academic libraries will
implement Open Access repositories.
5. Policy is an important part of the implementation of Open Access Repository. Based on
the findings, most academic librarians prefer to have mandatory policy. However, this
seems to work well only for students to submit their thesis and dissertations, instead of
publications from the institutions. Also, the university management of all institutions in
this study have not considered urgent for the university to issue mandatory policy for
faculty’s publications.
6. The findings also shows that librarians feel lacking of confidence in terms of their
expertise in information technology. The fact that Library and Information Science (LIS)
education still deals mostly with the management of traditional libraries may be one of
the factors that has caused the librarians feel no confident to manage the repositories.
Therefore, it is important for educational institutions that offer LIS education to revise
their curriculum and offer more courses that deal with the use of technology.
