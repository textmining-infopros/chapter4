Abstract
This exploratory study identified the types of experiential field-based learning (FBL)
courses included in the top 20 U.S. two-year MBA programs identified by the 2015 U.S. News &
World Report ranking. The foci of FBL courses are consulting projects in which students work
outside the classroom to develop recommendations for solving a real business problem posed by
a company or organization. This research analyzed the organizational structure of these courses
and in particular, how business librarians, faculty, career services professionals, and other expert
advisors supported the student teams in these courses. The research utilized a mixed methods
approach, which began with an online survey of business librarians from the 20 programs, and
continued with interviews, website analysis, and the development and analysis of six in-depth
case studies. Theoretical support for this research drew from the field of sociology, with a dual
focus on role theory and the concept of “jurisdictional claim” posed by Abbott’s 1988 theory of
professions.
This research informs new ways to conceptualize the design of FBL courses and the
structure of embedded librarianship support with social network models that represent the
engagement levels of various roles. Beyond the opportunity to work on real business projects,
some additional benefits to students of FBL identified were practicing teamwork and learning
from the field of consulting to apply to this work. The diverse roles that provided team support
also helped the students learn how to make effective use of knowledge experts. Constraints to
this pedagogy included working within an academic timeframe and having access to enough
individuals with the right expertise to provide the customized attention required. Other factors
included contending with project sponsors that changed their project focus, adapting roles and

iii

infrastructure to support FBL, and adequately communicating learning outcomes to all
stakeholders.

Chapter 1
Introduction
1.1 Context
In recent years, there have been calls to “re-envision the MBA” or Masters of Business
Education degree (Bisoux, 2011). Employers are seeking graduates who can immediately
engage in today’s dynamic business environment. Employers are also concerned that the current
MBA programs are not adequately preparing students for the actual processes and practices of
managerial work and its often ambiguous, complex challenges (Mintzberg, 2004; Raelin, 2009;
Somers, Passerini, Parhankangas, & Casal, 2014). Critics have charged that the research and
education in MBA programs are too theoretical and abstract (Bennis & O'Toole, 2005; Ghoshal,
2005; Khurana, 2007; Mintzberg, 2004; Pfeffer, 2007; Thomas, Lorange, & Sheth, 2013). Such
criticism is not new (Augier & March, 2011; Cheit, 1985; Hayes & Abernathy, 1980). In recent
years, a number of MBA programs have implemented major changes that included expanding
their offerings of immersive activities that give students the opportunity to practice what they
learn (Datar, Garvin, & Cullen, 2010; Graduate Management Admission Council [GMAC],
2013).
One form of experiential pedagogy is field-based learning (FBL) with a real company or
organization. In this work that occurs outside of the classroom, students apply techniques
learned in their MBA courses to developing recommendations for solutions to a sponsoring
company or organization’s real problems. This approach has been identified as a very effective
way to close the gap in the “being and doing” vs. the “knowing” aspects of management
education (Datar et al., 2010).

1

Baker and Schomberg (2003) defined a field study as “a for-credit course or project
where a small team of MBA students conducts a consulting-type study, for a business or other
organization” (p. 35). The outcome of this experiential learning, which is also called “projectbased learning” and “action-based learning,” requires the production of a final report or a
presentation to the sponsoring organization (DeFillippi & Milter, 2009). This form of learning
has been available as an elective course for some time in a number of MBA programs (Corey,
1990). More recently, there has been an increase in these courses not only as an elective but also
as a required component of the MBA curriculum (Rynes & Bartunek, 2013).
A considerable amount of ambiguity and uncertainty surround field-based projects in
which students rely on support roles that include teaching assistants, practitioners, alumni, and
librarians who help them understand unfamiliar areas of the business. This is a key distinction of
this instruction. Instead of leading the instruction, the professor, with the help of others, works
in a coaching role to facilitate learning (Datar et al., 2010). This learning requires “more
individual coaching and assessment, and thus … requirements for quantitative and qualitative
increases in teaching effort and infrastructural support” (Skipton & Cooper, 2012, p. 36).
1.2 Problem Statement
This study identified the types of experiential field-based learning courses included in the
top 20 U.S. two-year MBA programs (Boyington, 2014) and the roles that support them. The
research examined how business librarians, as well as faculty, career services professionals, and
other advisors supported the student teams who worked with experiential field-based learning
courses. This investigation focused on how support was provided for credit courses vs.
extracurricular activities. Two-year, full-time MBA programs that offer experiential learning
opportunities for credit were targeted for this study because they represent the most typical,

2

established format for this type of degree in the United States (Hay, 2013; Khurana, 2007). In
addition to examining the roles that support this pedagogy, this study analyzed the organizational
dynamics of its design at several schools. Although the focus was the librarian role, the research
considered the broader structure within which all the roles were interacting, and the intensive and
varied support required for these projects.
Numerous studies in the business literature have found that managers need guidance in
contending with information overload (Bawden & Robinson, 2009; Dean & Webb, 2011;
Edmunds & Morris, 2000; Eppler & Mengis, 2004). In particular, there is a need for managers
to develop skills in identifying and filtering relevant information from the abundance that is
available (Farhoomand & Drury, 2002; Keeney, 2004). Experiential field-based learning
projects offer a way to practice and develop these information-related skills by working on real
projects (Corey, 1990).
This research surveyed the work of different librarians and how they viewed their role in
experiential field-based learning. Studies on the involvement of librarians with FBL courses in
MBA programs to support the development of information skills have been limited to case
studies of single institutions (Berdish & Seeman, 2010). These studies have not provided a
comparative analysis of FBL courses at different institutions. Previous research has also failed
to examine the organizational support and network dynamics of this type of learning, and have
focused instead on the pedagogical design features, such as type and length of projects and
outcome expectations (Brown, Arbaugh, Hrivnak, & Kenworthy, 2013; Sciglimpaglia & Toole,
2010). This study attempted to address these gaps by reviewing the organizational structures
and patterns of support provided by several MBA programs. However, this research did not

3

compare the effectiveness of one school’s model for FBL courses over another, which was
beyond the scope of this study.
In the literature on the future role of the librarian, there have been calls for library support
to be more integrated in the curriculum (Budd, 2005; MIT Ad Hoc Task Force on the Future of
Libraries, 2016; Oakleaf, 2010). This study assessed experiential field-based learning in MBA
education and the need for assistance in gathering information for decision making. The study
examined how this method was included in MBA curricula, the roles that librarians played to
support the informational aspects of this pedagogy, and the various models of integrated support.
This study examined the various configurations of FBL and the structure of support roles.
In a world of “flipped’ or inverted classrooms (Chuang, Weng, & Chen, 2016; Lage, Platt, &
Treglia, 2000) where the “sage on the stage” (King, 1993) model of education is being disrupted,
this examination of organizational roles within the experiential FBL component of the MBA
curriculum could not be more timely. By looking at the role of the librarian, which has
traditionally been passive and segregated from the educational process (Budd, 2005; Grassian &
Kaplowitz, 2009) and how some MBA programs were more fully integrating this role, this study
offers evidence on the shifting norms in MBA education and the new, emerging support roles.
The major involvement of practitioners other than faculty in this pedagogy offers an alternative
approach to the traditional academic model. The research focus on the various roles in
experiential FBL in this study offers a different perspective and new insights in the ongoing
debate about balancing theory and practice in the MBA curriculum.
The following four guiding questions framed this research:
Research Question 1. What approaches to experiential field-based learning are used by the top
20 U.S. MBA programs?

4

This research question sought to identify the types of experiential FBL opportunities that
are offered by different MBA programs and the extent to which each program included
information exploration and gathering. This research considered information activities to be
secondary as well as primary source exploration, collection, and use. The research also
examined whether this instruction was part of the schools’ required course work or if it was an
elective course, which meant that some graduates never participated in this form of instruction.
Research Question 2. What organizational structures are associated with the different types of
experiential field-based project learning offered at these different programs?
This question sought to assess and review the organization and coordination of
experiential FBL at the different schools. The research identified those responsible for the
overall pedagogical design and leadership of this learning, the location of these positions within
the school, the grouping of the supporting roles that contribute to student learning, and the
interaction of these groups with one another.
Research Question 3. What are the perceptions of the outcomes of this learning on MBA
students in general and in particular, on the quality of students' research and information
gathering skills?
This question reviewed the impressions of faculty, career services professionals, and
business librarians about the influence and impact of their school’s experiential FBL on
developing general student capabilities and more specifically, in identifying and using evidence
for decision making after graduation and in the workforce. This included the professors'
impressions of the quality of the student research projects, the integration of librarians in the
FBL pedagogy, and the perceptions of the librarians’ contributions.

5

Research Question 4. What are the roles and jurisdictional claim of those involved in the
provision of this learning?
This final question analyzed the roles involved in supporting FBL in the various
programs, and investigated which roles were formal or informal, the functions of these different
roles, and if they were providing information-related support. In MBA programs in which
business librarians had formal roles within their program’s experiential FBL, the research
identified the extent of the librarians’ integration in the curriculum, the type of activities in which
they were involved, and any changes in job responsibilities that were necessary to accommodate
this support.
1.3 Theoretical Frameworks
Theory, as defined by Johnson and Christensen (2008), “refers to an explanation or an
explanatory system that discusses how a phenomenon operates and why it operates as it does” (p.
20). Role theory informed this research with an appreciation of the importance of assigned roles
in determining how organizational systems function (Biddle, 2000; Hall, 2002). Role theory was
considered in evaluating the current roles in place and changes that had taken place to influence
any adjustments in roles. The other theoretical framework that guided this research was Abbott’s
theory of professions (1988) and how this theory depicts the concept of various professions
taking jurisdictional ‘claim’ for certain organizational roles. This research examined how this
type of MBA experiential pedagogy affected the roles and professional jurisdictional claims of
librarians and others who support FBL in the current business school landscape.
Role theory is based on the assumption “….that social systems are organized and operate
through roles. Hence, roles function dynamically to structure the interaction of participants so as
to maintain, defend, alter, innovate, or advance the purpose of social systems” (Biddle, 2000b, p.

6

2421). Role theory provides a way to examine how individuals adapt to and shift roles in an
organizational context (Biddle, 1986). This study assessed how institutions were using
experiential FBL projects and the roles that supported these efforts, but did not examine the
rationale for the choice of certain structures. The research not only looked at current roles in
place but also changes that influenced further adjustments in roles. In this way, the data revealed
the emergence of new roles.
Abbott’s theory of professions (1988) explains the dynamics of various professions
taking jurisdictional ‘claim’ for playing certain organizational roles. For example, some
librarians were moving into more of an instructional role as part of the experiential learning
pedagogy. This research examined how librarians and other individuals who facilitate learning
in these programs enacted their roles and how jurisdictions on various responsibilities were
affected.
1.4 Organization of Dissertation
After this introductory chapter, Chapter 2 reviews the literature that is relevant to this
study. This includes research on the information behavior of business managers, the need for
information gathering and evaluation skills development in business education, recent
recommendations for experiential FBL in the MBA curriculum, activities by academic business
librarians to provide information literacy instruction, and a brief overview of role theory and how
change affects occupational roles. Chapter 3 presents the research questions and describes the
methodology used in this study that combined an online survey, interviews, and the development
and analysis of six detailed case studies of the survey respondents. Chapters 4 and 5 present the
findings of this study. Chapter 4 is organized into three sections that address the first three
research questions. Chapter 5 answers the remaining research question and provides an analysis

7

of the roles that support FBL. The final chapter concludes this dissertation with a summary of
key learnings, limitations of this study, the implications of the study results, and opportunities for
future research.

Chapter 2
Literature Review
This literature review includes five themes in this study: 1) the information behavior of
business managers, 2) the need for information gathering and evaluation skills in business
education, 3) recommendations for experiential FBL in the MBA curriculum, 4) current activities
that provide information literacy instruction in business schools and 5) an overview of role
theory and how change affects occupational roles. In some of these areas, there is little
published academic research. Thus, some literature is referenced from non-peer reviewed
publications such as business education and professional magazines.
2.1 Information Behavior of Business Managers
Many studies have attempted to define what business managers do and their engagement
with and use of information as a key component of their role (Drucker, 1974; Katzer & Fletcher,
1992; Mintzberg, 1973). In their book Business Information: Needs and Strategies, Abels and
Klein (2008) suggested that “….the information world of business professionals is complex and
is comprised of information that is both internal and external to the organization” (p.25). The
information sources “include informal and formal as well as verbal and written” (p. 26). Abels
and Klein describe how the most sought after information by business professionals was from
interpersonal sources, and relied on a range of individuals such as colleagues, clients, and experts
for information. “External business information sources [formed] only a relatively small portion
of sources used,” they found (p. 26).
In recognition of the importance of information to business managers as professionals
(Drucker, 1974; Mintzberg, 1973; Somers et al., 2014) and other professional occupations such
as engineers, numerous studies have explored their information behaviors and practices (Case &
Given, 2016; Leckie, Pettigrew, & Sylvain, 1996). Case and Given (2016) reviewed the
9

extensive research on the information behavior of various occupations that included managers
and asserted that “….occupations have been the most common type of social role investigated”
(p. 278). In a recent (2014) examination of this literature, Julien and O’Brien found that 61% of
information behavior studies, in which the type of respondent was discernible, focused on
occupational roles, with only 5% within the category of professional roles.
Leckie, Pettigrew, and Sylvain (1996) reviewed studies on the information behavior of
engineers, healthcare professionals, and lawyers to inform the development of a general model of
the information seeking behavior of all professionals. Through this review, they identified
standardized characteristics of the types of professional roles and the associated information
related tasks, and also recognized a potential constraining aspect that “….the information seeking
activities of various types of professions are as diverse as the professionals they represent” (p.
178). One component of the information seeking model developed by Leckie et al. included
“awareness of information” which identified that professionals could only refer to information of
which they were aware.
Pinelli (1991) conducted research on the information seeking practices of aerospace
engineers and scientists. Pinelli surveyed 1,627 aerospace engineers and scientists in academia,
government, and industry with the majority of respondents (n=1044) from industry. Pinelli
examined the influence of a number of institutional and sociometric variables on the reasons that
engineers and scientists were likely to use four known, commonly referenced published sources:
conference meeting papers, journal articles, in-house technical reports, and U.S. government
technical reports. The institutional variables were “education, academic preparation, years of
professional aerospace work experience, type of organization, professional duties, and technical
discipline” (p. 21). The sociometric variables included “accessibility, ease of use, expense,

10

familiarity or experience, technical quality or reliability, comprehensiveness, and relevance” (p.
21).
The findings revealed that when engineers sought these four types of published
information, no sociometric variable had a dominant influence. Pinelli admitted that among the
variables that had a greater influence in his statistical analysis, only “a weak argument can be
made for a relationship between relevance, technical quality or reliability, and
comprehensiveness” (p. 251) over the other sociometric variables, and that the institutional, and
not the sociometric variables, more likely explained the use of these sources. This research also
found that respondents “prefer informal over formal information systems” (p. 261) and that their
first choice was to solve problems on their own or with the help of colleagues and then to seek
additional information from known, familiar sources. The respondents sought the help of a
librarian or used a formal system for locating information such as an online index to publications
only when the earlier options did not provide the needed information.
Pinelli (1991) reported that on a scale of one to five, librarians --with an average rating of
3.87 --were considered to have a slightly higher level of importance to respondents than the other
four information sources, whose average rating ranged from 3.51 to 3.84. However, this study’s
examination of the actual use of various information sources by both managers and nonmanagers in this field found that “….use of personal store of technical information and collegial
discussions are common to both. Asking a librarian either inside or outside of the organization
ranked last for both groups as part of the overall information search strategy” (p. 226).
Matarazzo, in his 1991 review of the Pinelli study, observed that its results suggested that
librarians needed to change their work to a more embedded approach. “If librarians want to
become one of the sources first consulted by these engineers, then we must become a part of the

11

informal network of the engineer – more a colleague than the representative of the formal, and
therefore, a source sought out last,” he said (p. 409).
In research on the information behavior of managerial professionals, Auster and Choo
(1993) examined the environmental scanning practices of CEOs. They surveyed the
environmental scanning behavior of 115 chief executive officers (CEO) in the Canadian
publishing and telecommunications industries. The authors defined environmental scanning as
“acquiring information about events and relationships in a company’s outside environment” (p.
202). Similar to Pinelli (1991), they found that personal sources such as managers, staff,
customers, and associates were more frequently used by CEOs in contrast to reaching out to
formal sources such as the company library. The research of Auster and Choo found that among
the 16 types of information sources they investigated, “….the company library and electronic
information services are not frequently used in their scanning” (p. 200). In terms of the source
that most influenced the CEOs’ choices, “….perceived source quality is a more important factor
in explaining source use than either perceived source accessibility or perceived environmental
uncertainty” (p. 200). These results diverged from previous investigations that claimed that
accessibility was a more important factor (Allen, 1977; Gertsberger & Allen, 1968; Rosenberg,
1967;). Auster and Choo’s research also provided insights on how change and environmental
uncertainty could increase CEOs’ information use.
In their review of forty years of literature on the information seeking behavior of
managers, de Alwis, Majid, and Chaudhry (2006) found that there were four dimensions to
information source choices: contextual (work related), situational (organizational/
environmental), personal/socio-cultural, and informational. One factor identified in the review

12

was the challenge faced by managers in effectively evaluating, filtering, and not being
overwhelmed by too much information.
In terms of the processing and application of information, Keisler and Noonan (2012)
pointed out that each manager’s decision involved a different mix of “….judgment, theory, and
data… and will be filled in with different insights as decision makers triangulate from multiple
channels” (p. 280). There have been some studies on how managers could benefit from making
better use of data or information in their decision making; this is often referred to in the
management literature as “evidence” (Baba & Hakem Zadeh, 2012; Pfeffer & Sutton, 2006). In
their proposal for a theory of evidence-based decision making, Baba and Hakem Zadeh defined
evidence as “a fact, organized body of information or observation, which is presented to support
or justify belief or inferences” (p. 840). The authors argue that, based on an extensive literature
review of studies on the use of evidence by managers, that “….the best evidence needs to be
evaluated against methodological fit, contextualization, transparency, replicability, and
consensus” (p. 841). Other studies have determined that to be effective at gathering evidence for
decision making, managers should consider a wide range of evidence that offers a variety of
perspectives (Kahneman, Lovallo, & Sibony, 2011; Keeney, 2004). Other research indicated
that managers were not successfully using evidence in their decision making for many reasons,
which included having a biased view to being overwhelmed by too much information or
“information overload” (Baba & Hakem Zadeh, 2012; Pfeffer & Sutton, 2006).
Numerous studies in the business literature observed that managers needed guidance in
effectively processing information that would confront overload (Bawden & Robinson, 2009;
Dean & Webb, 2011; Edmunds & Morris, 2000). A review of these studies by Soucek and
Moser (2010) found that “….information overload results from a discrepancy between the

13

amount of information people receive and (the limits of) their information process capacity.
Accordingly, there are two general approaches to reducing information overload: (1) reducing
the amount of incoming information and (2) enhancing recipients’ information processing
capabilities” (p. 1459). In their extensive review of the literature on information overload in
diverse management disciplines, Eppler and Mengis (2004) highlighted the urgency of providing
guidance to help business professionals improve their ability to process information:
There is a wide consensus today that heavy information load can affect the performance
of an individual negatively (whether in terms of accuracy or speed). When information
supply exceeds the information-processing capacity, a person has difficulties in
identifying the relevant information…, becomes highly selective and ignores a large
amount of information.., has difficulties identifying the relationship between details and
the overall perspective…, needs more time to reach a decision…, and finally does not
reach a decision of adequate accuracy. (p. 331-333)
An article that reviewed the research of Bawden and Robinson (2009), entitled The Dark
Side of Information: Overload, Anxiety, and Other Paradoxes and Pathologies, maintained that
there was a need for a more purposeful, focused approach to information gathering. “There is
simply too much choice of potentially relevant diverse information readily available for a
‘perfectionist’ approach to be feasible, except in the most unusual circumstances. The important
point is that this must be practiced rationally, rather than arbitrarily or thoughtlessly, as anecdotal
evidence suggests is all too often the case” (2009, p. 187). Studies indicate that providing
instruction, guidance, and practice that induces more confidence in information gathering
techniques could help make managers more adept “information consumers” (Eppler & Mengis,
2004, p. 334).
2.2 The Need for Information Skills Development in Business Education
In view of these challenges faced by business professionals in effectively using
information, it was not surprising that discourse on the reform of the business education

14

curriculum has included the need for students to develop information gathering skills (Boyatzis,
Cowen, & Kolb, 1995; Datar et. al, 2010; Dacko, 2006; de Onzono, 2011; Glen, Suciu, &
Baughn, 2014; Navarro, 2008). These studies subsumed these skills as a component of the
problem solving and critical thinking abilities that students needed to develop to become shrewd
information-using professionals. In addition, there has been a growing amount of research that
supports the benefits of teaching evidence-based decision making in the business school
classroom (Erez & Grant, 2014; Rousseau & McCarthy, 2007). Developing the information
gathering skills of business students had also been specifically addressed by some management
educators (Castleberry, 2001; Gilinsky & Robison, 2008; Gunasekara, 2008; Hawes, 1994;
Hilliger & Roberts, 2001; Julien, Detlor, & Serenko, 2013; O’Connor, 2008).
In describing the characteristics of full-time MBA students, Garvin (2007) stated that the
students were “….typically in their mid-to-late 20s, with three to five years of business
experience. Most of that work experience has been in relatively low-level positions, such as
analyst, associate, or individual contributor roles. Most MBAs have had limited exposure to the
realities of organizations and management practice” (p. 369). Although this description is from
2007, it is an accurate description for today (Stainburn, 2014). The most common MBA
program format is the two-year, full-time program, where students will normally participate in a
paid internship at a company in the summer in between school years. However, it is worth
noting that other options for these students are available and are increasing every day given the
popularity of this degree (Hay, 2013; Stainburn, 2014).
The book, Rethinking the MBA (Datar et al., 2010), surveys current practice at many of
the top business schools and offers an extensive review of recent discussions about the need for

15

changes in the MBA curriculum. In the area of developing skills to effectively gather
information for decision making, the authors observed that:
MBAs are not good at seeing around the corner or detecting discontinuities. They need
to learn how to collect information – how to cultivate and develop great sources, to find
the expert wheel-maker and learn from him” (p. 97). In order to make proper sense of the
information gathered, the authors highlighted how communication skills and the effective
use of information are integrally linked. They [MBAs] should have a compelling point of
view, marshal supporting evidence in a convincing fashion, distinguish fact from opinion,
and flow logically and consistently from beginning to end. Clear thinking and effective
communication are closely linked. (p. 98)
2.3 Recommendations for Field-based Learning (FBL) in the MBA Curriculum
There has been much debate at many educational institutions that offer MBA degrees
about the best approach for preparing today’s students for the 21st century information- rich
workplace. Many have raised concerns that MBA programs over emphasize a rational-analytic
approach and are not providing the practical skills graduates need such as identifying and
gathering information to gain insight in unfamiliar areas (Bennis & O'Toole, 2005; Ghoshal,
2005; Khurana, 2007; Mintzberg, 2004; Pfeffer, 2007; Thomas, et al., 2013).
Business schools overemphasis on rational analytics in teaching and research has come at
the expense of the practical, yet open-ended issues that managers regularly encounter…
The analytic approach may lead one to overweight knowledge based on available data
that can be readily analyzed, blinding one to other perspectives. (Glen et al., 2014, p.
655)
While such critiques were not new (Cheit, 1985; Hayes & Abernathy, 1980), a number of
programs have recently implemented major changes that range from complete overhauling the
curriculum to initiating new types of courses and immersive activities (Datar et al., 2010;
GMAC, 2013). One recent study (Thomas, Thomas, & Wilson, 2012), sponsored by the
European Foundation for Management Development (EFMD), summarized the problem with the
MBA curriculum: “Overall, the evidence implies that a lack of focus on practice, teaching in

16

silos with no integration, and a focus on rational managerial behavior and academic research, all
reduce the effectiveness of management education in teaching the art of managing” (p. 18).
Datar, Garvin, and Cullen (2010) ascertained that one of the key concerns -- in addition
to more global perspectives and an emphasis on leadership and ethics -- of formal business
education programs in universities was “how to balance the demands of scholarship and
practice” (p. 75). They defined this as a gap in “being and doing” vs. the “knowing” of
management, and identified experiential learning as a way to address this issue. “Experiential
learning offers a special opportunity to narrow the knowing-doing gap. It provides a uniquely
different dimension to business education by giving students the chance to define and scope
problems, test ideas in practice, recognize the constraints placed by organizational realities, think
innovatively, and recognize the need to reconcile multi-disciplinary and sometimes conflicting
perspectives,” they said (p. 157).
Experiential learning theory has a long tradition (DeFillippi, 2001; Kolb & Kolb, 2005).
This type of learning has also been cited in the literature by other names such as field-based
learning or practice-based learning (Randolph & Nielsen, 2008), project-based learning
(DeFillippi, 2001) or action-based learning (Revans, 1983). This type of pedagogy offers a way
for students to practice their problem solving abilities, which is a competency that research
indicates is highly valued by employers:
Executives and recruiters are critical of MBA graduates for their limited understanding of
organizational realities and underdeveloped execution and implementation skills…The
enthusiasm for experiential learning in MBA programs comes from deans, faculty and
executives increasingly recognizing that critical aspects of managing and leading are
learned most effectively through practice rather than through traditional classroom based
pedagogies. (Datar et al., 2010, p. 148)
In a survey of the top 50 American MBA programs, Navarro (2008) found that
“….experiential exercises range from real world business and consulting projects to management
17

game simulations and business plan competitions” (p. 114). Navarro’s research found that
“….many schools appear not to require significant integrative and experiential elements in their
core” (p. 116). However, Sciglimpaglia and Toole (2010) found experiential field-based projects
widely used in U.S. business schools but did not specify if this type of learning was required or
optional. In a study of “168 graduate management programs [worldwide] that had revised their
core curriculum between 2009 and 2011” (Rynes & Bartunek, 2013, p. 182), almost all of the
full-time MBA programs in the survey included courses with experiential field-based projects,
with 29% requiring such projects for graduation and 67% offering the projects as an optional
elective.
As DeFillippi and Milter (2009) proclaimed, this experiential type of pedagogy is learnercentered, because students are required to direct their own learning. “Project and problem based
learning methods draw upon a constructivist perspective on learning, in which students are
responsible for constructing meaning from their experience. In each mode, education is thus
learner-centered rather than teacher directed. Indeed, the role of the instructor is more focused
on providing facilitation and social and technical support than explicit direction or knowledge
transfer,” the authors said (p. 345). The authors stated that a key distinction of problem vs.
project-based learning was “….that project-based learning involves the construction of a
concrete artifact or project deliverable (the draft of a design or an end product) as an outcome of
project work.” (p. 350).
One example of an MBA program that included experiential FBL learning was the Ross
Business School at the University of Michigan. This school required a team FBL project entitled
the “multidisciplinary action project (MAP).” An article in the Association to Advance

18

Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) publication BizEd described the structure of this
course:
In January, students form five-person teams and bid on the projects they’d most like to
tackle. Once they’ve been assigned their projects, students attend weekly advising
meetings with faculty and tap the expertise of research consultants, librarians,
communications coaches, and second-year MBAs. The school integrates such milestones
and points of contact to keep student teams on track. At the end of the course, students
deliver their recommendations to the client. (Bisoux, 2011, p. 30)
As this description suggests, various facilitation roles can support experiential FBL projects.
This was a key distinction of this instruction (Raelin, 2010). Rather than the professor leading
instruction, the professor, as well as others, supported the students in more of a coaching role
that facilitated learning.
The organization, planning and coordination of experiential learning courses, particularly
when done at scale, require substantial human and financial resources. Students need
support as they work in teams on messy, complex and ambiguous problems in unfamiliar,
difficult and high-pressure situations. Without proper support, teams can become
dysfunctional, considerably diminishing the benefits of experiential learning. (Datar et
al., 2010, p. 157)
Skipton and Cooper (2012) also suggest that ‘real-world’ experiential learning in
business schools can “….require more individual coaching and assessment, and thus …
requirements for quantitative and qualitative increases in teaching effort and infrastructural
support” (p. 36). However, despite these challenges in adequately providing the needed support,
it has been shown that this pedagogy could reap significant benefits, enriching the student
experience and credentials they brought to the workplace, and helping schools build stronger
relationships with companies, recruiters, and alumni (Bisoux, 2011).
2.4 Information Literacy Instruction in Business Schools
The provision of instruction on effective information gathering and use has been referred
to in library and information science as information literacy (Grassian & Kaplowitz, 2009).

19

Zurkowski introduced the concept in 1974 to encompass a more comprehensive view of
information instruction rather than the previous, more confining term of bibliographic instruction
(Badke, 2010; Eisenberg, Lowe, & Spitzer, 2004). Since the concept was introduced, a number
of competency standards in information literacy have gained acceptance as guidance for teaching
these skills (Eisenberg et al., 2004). The standards developed by the Association of College and
Research Libraries (ACRL) in 2000 and reconceptualized in 2016 have been the most frequently
adopted standards, particularly by academic libraries.1 Unlike previous standards, this “new
framework is not based on a step- by- step definition of information literacy but instead is based
on a much more integrated set of core competencies” (Berkman, 2016, p. 1). The new
framework is “organized into six frames, each consisting of a concept central to information
literacy, a set of knowledge practices, and a set of dispositions. The six concepts [are]…
authority is constructed and contextual, information creation as a process, information has value,
research as inquiry, scholarship as conversation, [and] searching as strategic exploration”
(ACRL, 2016, p. 2).
The need to provide instruction in the language of business vs. the library language of
ACRL was raised in O’Sullivan’s 2002 article “Is information literacy relevant in the real
world?” O’Sullivan emphasized that the discourse on information literacy had largely taken
place in the academic library domain, and speculated that in the area of business, “….We must
search for new ways of describing information literacy, and align it with business concepts” (p.

1

The former version of the standards was formally rescinded by the ACRL Board of Directors in June, 2016
(Drabinski, 2016). It is worth noting that ACRL is the largest professional association of academic librarians in the
U.S..; there was much activity and discussion around the creation of this new framework which is deliberately broad
in scope to counter criticisms of the earlier standards as too narrow. The ACRL recommends that “neither the
knowledge practices nor the disposition that support each concept are intended to prescribe what local institutions
should do in using the Framework; each library and its partners on campus will need to deploy these frames to best
fit their own situation, including designing learning outcomes. For the same reason, these lists should not be
considered exhaustive” (ACRL, 2016). For more on the debates around the adoption of this new framework, see
Foasberg, 2015.

20

13). In 1991, a report issued by the U.S. Department of Labor Secretary’s Commission on
Achieving Necessary Skills (SCANS) stated that information literacy was one of the five
essential competencies for solid job performance (Cheuk, 2002). Other symposia and initiatives
have highlighted the need for information literacy skills in the workplace (Grassian & Kaplowitz,
2009). Matarazzo and Pearlstein (2014) provided additional evidence of this need.
Some information literacy standards and instructional frameworks specific to the
workplace have been proposed (Bruce, 1999; Cheuk, 1998; Cheuk, 2002; Kirton & Barham,
2005; Leigh & Gibbon, 2008; Lloyd, 2006). All incorporated some attributes of the
competencies recommended by ACRL but emphasized information use in the workplace. With
a focus specifically on business students, Cullen proposed a “Conceptual Framework for MBA
Information Skill Development” (2013a, p. 415). This framework emerged from primary and
secondary research on the information skills that MBAs should possess. The framework
included factors that influence the design of this type of instruction and five dimensions of the
desired skills.
Business schools have a history of developing curriculum differently from other schools
in the university because of their traditional, heavy reliance on the case method (Datar et al.,
2010). Consequently, the support provided by the library for curriculum development has been
different. With the case method of instruction, there was less need for student research because
the case typically includes all the data used for the class discussion (Berdish & Seeman,
2011). Business school programs typically included stronger career support for students, with a
large focus of their librarians on helping MBA students with research to prepare for interviews
and career exploration (Barnhart & Ogur, 2014). Historically, business libraries served as
document warehouses with entire sections designated for storing company annual reports and

21

Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) filings -- when they were only available in print,
microfilm, or CD-ROMs -- as well as extensive holdings of reference volumes, indexes, and
trade publications in these formats (Bogardus, 1970; Pagell, 2003). Since almost all research
resources used by business schools are now available online, many business libraries have
decreased in size or had their library eliminated altogether, which required operating the library
from staff offices (Dreyer & Bakkalbasi, 2015). As a result, libraries had more resources
available to focus on services such as instruction and supporting curricula rather than supervising
a space that houses books, documents, and other business research-related resources (Seeman,
2015a).
There were a number of examples in the literature of business librarians providing
instruction (Fiegen, 2011; Hesseldenz, 2012; Huber, 2013; Roldan & Wu, 2004). Klusek (2012)
provided an overview of the variety of engagements that ranged from indirect activities such as
creating online research guides to being very involved in serving as “educational planner” (p.
195) in the design of information instruction and use in a specific course. Another example of a
fairly extensive engagement of business librarians designing and providing instruction with an
MBA program was the core curriculum of Goizueta Business School (GBS) (Crenshaw, 2016;
Cullen, 2013b) at Emory University. A distinguishing characteristic of this instruction was its
conceptual viewpoint on the effective use of evidence, which is a critical component of MBA
instruction (Datar et al., 2010). The GBS program required a full-semester experiential learning
course entitled “Management Practice”2 that all MBA students completed during the first
semester of the program. The students were also required to select from six experiential fieldbased learning elective courses. According to a survey of U.S. business school library directors
in a recent unpublished study of the Academic Business Library Directors of North America
2

While the content remains generally the same, as of fall 2016 this course was renamed Goizueta IMPACT.

22

(ABLD) with a 67% response rate from its membership of over 40 institutions (Cullen, 2013b),
no other MBA program among the respondents was partnering with their library to this extent.
One motivation for the different way instruction had been designed in the GBS MBA
program was in response to personal experience and research that showed in curriculum
activities, librarians did not always effectively communicate how their expertise added value
(Anthony, 2010; Cullen, 2013c; Julien et al., 2013; Julien & Pecoskie, 2009; Saunders, 2012).
Consequently, completely new methods of explaining core ideas were developed to support this
instruction. These were encapsulated in five “business intelligence” frameworks created with the
program’s associate dean to communicate the key concepts (Cullen & Noonan, 2014a-e) that
were derived from research which identified the role of data and evidence in decision making
(Keisler & Noonan, 2012).
There have been few surveys of how librarians provide instruction across business school
programs. The Academic Business Library Directors of North America (ABLD), which
represents libraries from all the major business schools in the United States (ABLD, 2013),
published its annual meeting reports in the Journal of Business & Finance Librarianship from
1998 to 2008 (Buxbaum, 2003; Buxbaum, 2004; Carner, 2006; Doan, 2007; Doan, 2008; Mento,
1997, 1998, 2000, 2001, 2002; Popovich, 2005), and more recently in their online publication
Ticker (Seeman, 2015b). These reports included the highlights of activities at various business
libraries cited at their annual conference and were not comprehensive surveys of member
operations that included instruction.
A 2001 survey administered by Abels and Magi was the most recently published
systematic review of the operations of academic business libraries. These authors focused their
review on the libraries of the top 20 U.S. MBA programs based on the most recent U.S. News &

23

World Report ranking (1999). Abels and Magi reported the resources and the services of the
business libraries in the survey, including instruction, and found that “….there seems to be a
preference for user education sessions that focus on topics over resource specific sessions” (p.
17). However, this survey did not report further descriptions of how business librarians were
working with their business school’s curriculum.
A recent book entitled Business School Libraries in the 21st Century (Wales, 2014)
reviewed the challenges and worldwide opportunities faced by these libraries. The final chapter
included the results of a survey of academic business library director groups from North
America, Asia-Pacific, and European regions on key challenges their libraries would face in the
future. There were 23 business librarians who responded to this survey from the total combined
membership of over 90 members in the Academic Business Library Directors of North America
(ABLD), European Business School Librarians’ Group (EBSLG) and Asia-Pacific Business
School Librarians’ Group email lists. The only emerging theme included about instruction was
the following statement: “….the relationship between the library and teaching – comments
related to the rapid changes to curriculum and the disconnect between library and teaching staff”
(p. 195).
A recent unpublished study by Cullen (2013b) included a survey of the ABLD
membership with a 67% response rate. This survey revealed that most of the business libraries
were providing some form of training or instruction for their MBA program’s core and elective
curricula. However, in measuring the scope and extent of engagement in the required MBA
curriculum , “….for the majority, less than 1% of total core course hours were devoted to inclass teaching by librarians” (p. 54). This measurement indicated the extent of the integration of
librarians with the curriculum. This assumed that a librarian in the classroom teaching indicated

24

a particularly high level of partnership and engagement. However, although there might be other
approaches to measuring the extent of MBA curricular integration of librarians, this review of
the literature failed to identify any such studies.
One form of intensive partnership between business librarians and their key stakeholders
in curriculum and information literacy instruction is embedded librarianship. In the past ten
years, this practice has increasingly been adopted by academic librarians as a way of providing
curricular support. Embedded librarianship was defined by Shumaker and Talley (2009) as:
Focusing on the needs of one or more specific groups, building relationships with these
groups, developing a deep understanding of their work, and providing information
services that are highly customized and targeted to their greatest needs. It involves
shifting the model from transactional to high trust, close collaboration, and shared
responsibility of outcomes. (p. 9)
In his overview of embedded librarianship in academic libraries, Brower identified the
following elements of these engagements: “….Embedded librarians collaborate with
users…[They] form partnerships on the department and campus Level.., Provide needs based
services,…Offer convenient/user-friendly services outside of library settings,..become immersed
in the culture and spaces of our users” (2011, p. 13). Hines (2013) identified two challenges
librarians faced in approaching and deploying this level of engagement; these included the
amount of time required to do it well and the communication and outreach skills necessary for
making the necessary connections and developing trust. Nevertheless, some business librarians
have engaged with their curriculum by following this model (Berdish & Seeman, 2011; Li,
2012). Examples found in the literature of business librarians that supported field-based learning
(FBL) projects from the top 20 U.S. MBA programs included the business libraries at Harvard
Business School, Anderson School of Management at the University of California, Los Angeles
(UCLA), Goizueta Business School at Emory University, and the Ross School of Business at the

25

University of Michigan (Berdish & Seeman, 2011; Crenshaw, 2016; Horne & Seeman, 2016;
Rosen, 2015).
2.5 Role Theory and How Change impacts Occupational Roles
Role theory first emerged from research in the 1930s, when social scientists began to
seriously consider that “….social life could be compared with the theater, in which actors played
predictable roles” (Biddle, 2000a, p. 2415). “The underlying assumption of role theory at the
broadest level is that social systems...are organized and operate through roles. Hence, roles
function dynamically to structure the interaction of participants so as to maintain, defend, alter,
innovate, or advance the purpose of social systems,” Biddle said (p. 2421). In the area of
occupational roles, this theory had been used to examine organizational behavior, design, and
“….the formal designation of roles that organizational actors are assigned to play,” Biddle added
(p. 2422).
The factors that influence changes in roles could be both external, such as socio-technical
shifts, as well as internal intra-organizational realignments (Van DeVen & Poole, 1995). As
Bradley (1996) pointed out: “Change is emergent. The results are not predetermined but unfold
through incremental action and reaction of the participants” (p. 2). Biddle (1986) had professed
that organizational roles change under two dynamics, either those in a role agreed on a need for
change (consensus) or outside forces induced roles to change (conformity). As Zai (2014)
suggested,“….consensus implies that any normative agreement has been the result of individual
agency; whereas conformity implies a pressured norm compliance” (p. 10).
Abbott, in his book The System of Professions (1988), asserted that information
professionals were part of a profession where roles were likely to change more often. “Deciding
what is relevant information inevitably embroils the information client and the information

26

professional. The information professions are, by definition, involved in continuously,
negotiated and contested professional divisions of labor,” Abbott said (p. 223). In his analysis of
the features that affect the development of various distinct professional roles, Abbott highlighted
the topic of “jurisdictional claim” as an important element of what was at play when roles were
emerging to identify or lay claim to a certain tasks for their role. “In most professional work
settings, actual divisions of labor are established through negotiation and custom, that embody
situation-specific rules of professional jurisdiction,” Abbott said (p. 65). When organizational
change occurred, these roles “must then be renegotiated, with the common result that boundaries
of actual professional jurisdiction change to accommodate organizational imperatives,” he
concluded (p. 65).
An example of an information profession facing transition is medical librarianship. In
2013, McMullen and Yeh conducted a survey on changing job descriptions in medical
librarianship. A total of 165 institutions responded to the survey. Almost all of the respondents
(98%) were from hospital libraries or academic health science libraries. They reported that
“….changes in access and delivery of information” (p. 249) ranked highest of the reasons given
by respondents for changes in job duty. Other reasons cited by the respondents were that “user
needs were changing, budget constraints, and technological developments” (p. 249). However,
the survey found that instead of creating new positions to respond to these shifts, the majority of
respondents were simply changing what they did in their current role. These shifts of roles
mirrored the experiences of the information systems management sector where changes in
“access and delivery of information” had also resulted in changes in the skills required to
perform existing occupational roles (Applegate & Elam, 1992).

27

One significant change in academic librarian roles was the shift from “access provider” to
that of educator (O’Connor, 2009). The dynamics underlying this shift occurred as more
resources were available remotely online rather than in the library building. Without being
encumbered by the limitations and constraints of a physical collection, Zai (2015) contended that
librarians had an enhanced capacity to shift to the role of educating students on identifying,
gathering, and evaluating information. Zai referenced role theory in his discussion of this shift.
In A Role Theory Approach to Librarians Teaching, Zai (2015) identified challenges that
librarians were facing in this role, and cited that “….academic librarians have coalesced around
three competing models of IL [information literacy] instruction: the course-integrated, the creditbearing, and a small array of hybrid models” (p. 13-14). Zai concluded the article by
summarizing how academic librarianship was a field in flux now that many responsibilities
connected with supporting a physical library collection no longer exist:
Until recently, academic librarianship was a largely homogeneous and stable profession.
The scope of academic librarianship was known, and success was a matter of proficiency
in the selection, organization, and the accessibility of information. However, within the
IT era, librarians have increasingly sought out new roles and explored new jurisdictions
and the result has become an increasingly heterogeneous and strained profession. It is
difficult to imagine that academic librarians will arrive at a consensus concerning their
instructional role anytime soon. (p. 20)
In contrast to surveying the changing job responsibilities of librarians, Cox and Corrall
(2013) explored the changing nature of work roles in academic libraries. Cox and Corrall
examined new academic library specialties such as informationists and information literacy
educators using Abbott’s 1988 “theory of professions” as a frame of reference for their evolving
development and establishment in the profession. By considering how these roles might impinge
on the claims from professional jurisdictions, such as faculty research and teaching, Cox and
Corrall’s concluded that “….the information identity is more blurred, less easy to explain

28

especially in any case where professionals are embedded in multidisciplinary contexts” (p.
1538), and they suggested that the success of these new roles would be based upon:
A number of factors, including the efficacy of the profession’s knowledge base in that
area or its ability to absorb other knowledge bases, the plausibility with which new roles
can be equated to the existing public image of the profession, and the organization and
posture of other professions that are jostling for position. (p. 1538)
Cox and Corrall suggested that these new roles would “demand high level influencing and
collaborative skills to work with others effectively” (p. 1538). In addition they alluded to a
success factor supported by extensive research on coping with occupational change to suggest
that those with a higher “tolerance of ambiguity” will fare better in adapting to new roles (Judge,
Thoresen, Pucik, & Welbourne, 1999).
Thus, as librarians and others have adapted to changing roles, the theoretical research on
roles and change support the position that technical skills and psycho-social skills affect their
success in coping with the changing information and organizational landscape. Role theory and
Abbott’s concept of professional jurisdictional claim provide approaches for examining the
existing and emerging dynamics of occupational roles.

Methodology
3.1 Participants and Design
The sample for this study included the top 20 U.S. MBA programs based on the 2015
ranking from U.S. News & World Report magazine (Boyington, 2014). This exploratory study
described how these schools were using experiential learning during the timeframe of data
collection, which was initiated in May 2015 and completed in December 2015.
Two-year, full-time MBA programs were targeted for this study because they are
representative of the most typical and established format for this type of degree (Hay, 2013;
Khurana, 2007). Table 3.1 presents the schools in the top 20 ranking of two-year, full-time
MBA programs.

Rubin and Dierdorff (2009) confirmed the primary use of rankings as a measure of
leading business schools when they stated that “….although highly imperfect and notably
critiqued, no other reputation indicator has attracted more attention than that of media
rankings…rankings are an integral factor in business school policy making” (p. 212). As
emphasized by Pagell (2003):
Rankings of business schools are important for the recruitment of students and faculty
and for the placement of graduates in top positions…Two magazines U.S. News & World
Report and Business Week have become the standards for ranking MBA programs.
Although other programs such as the undergraduate, evening, and executive education
programs are also rated, it is the [full-time, two-year] MBA rankings that drive the
competition. (p. 23)
Broadly referenced as a benchmark for American business schools (Pagell, 2003; Rubin
& Dierdorff, 2009), the U.S. News & World Report ranking was selected as a means to identify
the top 20 schools for this research. The placement of these schools in the highest rankings also
served as an indication of a more dynamic, more adequately resourced curriculum that would be
more likely to offer innovative types of courses that included FBL projects. The 20 programs
examined in this study varied in size from programs with a few hundred students to those with
over 1,000 full-time students. Some programs offered only two-year, full-time MBA programs,
while others offered a diverse variety that included evening MBAs, weekend MBA programs,
and accelerated programs. The commonalities in much of the curricular content in these 20
programs reflected the standards imposed by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of
Business (AACSB), the organization that accredits these business schools.

31

Purposive sampling was used to select the subject population of librarians who were
initially surveyed for this study (Gillham, 2008). As Gillham states, this method is appropriate
when “researchers have a clear idea of the kind of group they are interested in and an
approximate idea of what they want to find out” (p. 20).
The research design was a descriptive multiple-case study (Eisenhardt, 1989; Yin, 2014),
with the data collected in two ways. First, the researcher sent an online survey using Qualtrics
software to a business librarian at each of the 20 schools. From this initial survey, six MBA
programs were identified for more in-depth study as cases. Following the requirements of the
descriptive multiple-case study method, the six programs were selected by their similar
characteristics (top two-year U.S. MBA programs) as well as contrasting features such as
program size and their approach to and support for experiential field-based learning projects
(Yin, 2014).
Guiding questions were used to conduct this exploratory investigation of the involvement
of MBA programs in experiential field-based learning (FBL) pedagogy and the role of librarians
and other roles in supporting this curriculum. Each research question (RQ) posed for this
investigation as well as the sub-questions considered in the design of the research instruments are

3.2 Data Collection
Table 3.2 identifies the data collection methods used to address each of the research
questions. Appendix A provides a detailed list of the instruments used to gather information that
would answer each research question and sub-question. To confirm the robustness of these data
collection methods, a pilot study was conducted with a U.S. two-year MBA program that was not
included in the Top 20 list (Cullen, 2015).

The data collection commenced with the online survey that was distributed in May 2015;
all responses were received by June 30, 2015. The survey asked business librarians to identify
their organizational reporting structures and how they were working with experiential field-based
learning projects. For details on the survey questions, see Appendix B, which also includes the
participant consent form that was approved by the Simmons College Internal Review Board. A
librarian at 19 of the 20 schools responded for a response rate of 95%. The online survey
included a question that asked if the respondent was interested in more in-depth participation in

34

this study. Of the eight schools that volunteered for more in-depth participation, six were
selected as case studies.

Table 3.3 depicts the characteristics of the six programs chosen as case studies.
Throughout this dissertation research, each MBA program that served as a case is identified by a
number such as MBA1. Half of the programs were in the 1-10 rankings with the others in the
11-20 rankings. A third of the programs were in the lower range of student enrollment from 300
to 600 students; a third were in the middle range of 600 to 1,000; and a third in the upper range
with 1,000 to 2,000 students. In four of the case studies, field-based learning courses were a
35

required part of the curriculum; in these four programs, business librarians had a formal role in
the curriculum. Of the eight programs that volunteered to participate further in case studies,
these four were the only programs in which the business librarians had a formal role in the
experiential field-based learning curriculum.
After the six institutions were identified, data were collected from their websites on their
FBL course offerings (RQ1) and the organizational structures that supported this pedagogy
(RQ2). In addition to inform the proposal for this dissertation (Cullen, 2015), a review of all 20
school websites was conducted in spring 2015 to gather information on whether the programs
offered experiential field-based learning and whether it was required or only an elective course.
The website review for the six case studies was conducted in September of 2015 before
interviewing for the case studies commenced. The review of websites followed the method used
by Rubin and Dierdorff (2009) to identify manifest content related to FBL at the schools. The
recording units (Wildemuth, 2009) used to track descriptions of relevant content were the pages
from each business school’s website. As a means to track the sources of all information, content
was copied and pasted into an Excel spreadsheet. This spreadsheet included each cited quote,
the website source of that information, and the date of retrieval. A summary of the results of the
six website reviews was created and used for analysis by this researcher but is omitted from this
report because the institutions could be identified.
In total, 18 interviews were conducted in the fall of 2015. Interviews were conducted
with a career services professional and a business librarian from each of the six schools. A
faculty member who taught in the experiential field-based learning curriculum and was
responsible for evaluating final project deliverables was also interviewed in five of the six
programs. All interviews were with one individual except one. For five of the case institutions,

36

the interview with the business librarian was conducted with the head of the business library. In
one interview, the researcher met with three business librarians at the institution as a group that
included the head and two other business librarians. Seven interviews were conducted with
career services professionals. In five instances, only one person from the institution was
interviewed. For one institution, two career service professionals were interviewed separately at
the request of the first career services staff member.
All interviews were conducted in person or by phone using an interview guide (Rubin &
Rubin, 1995). Three of the business librarian interviews, two of the career services professional
interviews, and three of the professor interviews were conducted in person. The remaining
interviews were conducted by telephone because of the geographic location. Therefore, any
“non-discursive” (Van den Berg, 2005) elements of the interviews such as gestures made by
respondents that may have enhanced the quality of the data collected went undetected and this
secondary element of observation (Padgett, 1998; Rubin & Rubin, 2012) was not possible.
A semi-structured protocol for interviewing was followed in both the telephone and faceto-face interviews with a guide used as an anchor for the “conversational partnership” (Rubin &
Rubin, 1995). The interviews were digitally recorded and processed by a transcription service.
The interviews ranged in length from seven minutes with a career services professional to 85
minutes with a professor. In general, the interviews with the professors were the longest and
with the career service professionals, the shortest. For details on the interview lengths, see Table
3.4. For copies of the interview guide used with each category of respondent, see Appendix B.

3.3 Procedures
Qualitative and mixed method techniques (Creswell, 2007; Miles, Huberman, & Saldana,
2014; Yin, 2014) were used in reviewing and analyzing the online survey responses, website
content, and the interview transcripts to determine general themes and commonalities. The data
were also used to inform a preliminary social network analysis (Carolan, 2014) that would
examine how the identified roles interacted and worked together. To facilitate greater in-depth
analysis, the entire interview transcripts were loaded into the computer assisted qualitative data
analysis Atlas.ti software for coding. Codes were established with the procedures of Miles,
Huberman, and Saldana (2014).
This coding was checked for inter-coder reliability with the following protocol.
Instructions as well as two sample transcripts and the codes to be checked were created. This
material was then distributed to three external coders who coded the two sample transcripts. The
transcripts they coded were then checked and revealed that the majority of codes from these
reviewers were in agreement with the original coding. However, a revision was made to include
an appreciation of positive as well as negative valence. This was to remedy the fact that a code
existed to identify the challenges in communications between various roles or areas in the
organization but there had not been one for examples in which the communications were

38

working well. The reviewers also suggested that codes be added to identify discussions of the
culture of the business school and participant background details.
Following the analytic procedures recommended by Yin (2014), summaries of program
and experiential FBL curricular attributes were compiled for each of the cases, as shown in
Appendix C. Data from the programs were also reviewed by listening to the audio transcript for
each interview and taking notes. After all coding was completed and revised, a second review
was conducted to cluster codes for general themes for analysis and to identify quotes that would
support evidence in this data. Appendix D provides a listing of these codes and the number of
times the codes matched text in the transcripts. After a preliminary draft of this dissertation was
completed in October 2016, all interviewees were contacted with the quotes to be included from
their interviews. This was done to check for accuracy and to serve as a form of member checking
(Padgett, 1998, p. 100-101). The communication requested that they respond if they wished for
any of the information from their interview to be adjusted. Of the 18 respondents, three
requested slight adjustments in their quotes. These adjustments had no impact on the original
meaning conveyed in their interviews.

Chapter 4
Results
Detailed quantitative and qualitative analyses of the online survey and interview data
were performed to answer the questions that guided this research. Chapter 4 presents the
findings that answer research questions 1, 2 and 3; Chapter 5 addresses research question 4.
This chapter begins with a review of school characteristics, which provides context for the
institutional environment in which FBL courses are offered.
Table 4.1 presents selected characteristics of the top 20 full-time MBA programs. The
number of students in the programs ranged from 384 to 1867 full-time MBA students; two-thirds
of these institutions were private and one-third of the institutions were public (U.S. News &
World Report, 2016). In six of the 14 private institutions and four of the six public institutions,
FBL was required (Cullen, 2015). Of the ten larger programs (with 798 to 1867 students), only
three programs required FBL.

A standard bundle of required courses is included in most accredited MBA programs.
According to Rynes and Bartunek (2013), “….more than 80 percent of both U.S. and non-U.S.
programs require seven courses: marketing, finance, strategy, management or organizational
behavior, financial accounting, operations, and managerial accounting” (p. 182). The top 20
programs included in this study followed this tradition. The required courses at some schools
encompass the entire first year and in others, just the first semester. After completing these core
requirements, students may take elective courses that are more aligned with their specific goals.
In the summer between the first and second year of the programs, students will typically
complete an internship with a company or organization. According to an overview from
Feldman (2013) on MBA student engagement, students who have a successful experience in the
internship are more likely to receive a job offer at that organization after graduation. Cocurricular activities such as business planning and case competitions, club activities, voluntary
consulting projects, community service opportunities, global trips, and other activities are also a
very important component of the student experience in these programs (Rynes & Bartunek,
2013).
4.1 Characteristics of Field-based Learning (FBL) courses
Research Question 1: What approaches to experiential field-based learning are used by the top
20 U.S. MBA programs?
This section reviews the characteristics of FBL courses in the top 20 full-time MBA
programs. This includes an overview of the characteristics of FBL courses in these programs, as
well as a review of the history and origins of these courses at the six institutions that were
41

examined as case studies in this research. This section concludes with a review of the programs
among those cases in which a FBL course was required, when it was only an elective course, and
whether any commonalities were apparent among programs that made each of these choices.
4.1.1 Characteristics of FBL Curriculum at the Top 20 Full-time MBA Programs
A preliminary review in 2015 of the websites of the top 20 US MBA programs found that
all cited experiential learning opportunities that included field-based learning (FBL) projects
(Cullen, 2015). In ten of the 20 full-time MBA programs, FBL course work was part of the
required curriculum.3 Schools also often offer these experiences as not-for-credit, informal
learning activities such as clubs. Some current, for-credit, field-based courses emerged from
such initial informal initiatives. These not-for-credit field projects were beyond the scope of this
research which focused on how support was provided for projects that were included in the
formal management curriculum (Caza & Brower, 2015).
General characteristics of these FBL projects included teams of four to seven students
who typically work on projects sponsored by an organization with a business-oriented,
ambiguous problem. A faculty member advises each team, which also receives advice from
individuals at the sponsoring institution. The work is typically graded. Project deliverables can
include recommendations on how to address the problem, which are usually presented as a report
or presentation to the sponsoring organization, but may also be presented to the advising faculty
member who grades the team’s work. The projects are sometimes conceptualized as
competitions in which external reviewers vote for the winning project team. Winning a
competition is not included in the project grading, which is done by the advising faculty member.

3
MBA Programs that listed experiential field-based learning projects as required course work at their websites: Carnegie Mellon
University (Tepper), Cornell University (Johnson), Dartmouth College (Tuck), Duke University (Fuqua), Emory University
(Goizueta), Harvard Business School, University of California—Berkeley (Haas), University of California—Los Angeles
(Anderson), University of Michigan—Ann Arbor (Ross), University of North Carolina—Chapel Hill (Kenan-Flagler), and
University of Texas-Austin (McCombs).

42

Methods vary at different schools on the assignment of projects to student teams.
Students sometimes bid or vote for projects; teams find their own projects; or teams are assigned
to projects by a field study office that pairs them with entities that have expressed interest in
doing a project. The length of work on these projects ranges from one week to six months,
although the length is typically a full semester of three to four months. The businesses and
organizations with which students work are usually called "clients" -- this mirrors the term used
in real consulting engagements. However, this review found that the terms "partner" or
"sponsoring organization" were used as well. Some MBA programs charge the sponsoring
organizations a fee for the student work. At other schools, the programs provide reimbursement
for incidental student expenses. In some cases, small grants are also available to cover expenses,
particularly for students who are working with nonprofit organizations. Most sponsoring
organizations require the students to sign some form of a non-disclosure agreement.
One advantage of FBL was the opportunity it gave the students to actually implement
what they had learned in a real company or organization.
The implementation piece is critical. I mean that’s what they’re going to do in business,
right? … This is one of the few times where they have to take full ownership; they don’t
get a lot of hand holding. They’ll get support from the school, but the company doesn’t
do a lot of hand holding. The company gives them a project and says, ‘Figure it out.’ So
they’re really having to apply what they’ve learned. (MBA2 Career2)
The opportunity to implement what the MBAs had learned in their previous courses
offered a unique sort of “flipped classroom” experience. As one professor said, [If] “….you
want to deconstruct just what is action-based learning and then you’ll find that a flipped
classroom may be closer to that than a chalk and talk lecture based class” (MBA5 Professor). A
basic definition of a "flipped" (or inverted) classroom is offered by Lage, Platt, and Treglia
(2000) who said that “….inverting the classroom means that events that have traditionally taken

43

place inside the classroom now take place outside the classroom and vice versa” (p.32).
Chuang, Weng, and Chen (2016) agreed that “….a flipped classroom is a pedagogical model in
which the typical lecture and homework elements of a course are reversed” (p. 9). In this model,
students process their own course content through readings, videos, or assignments and then use
class time to discuss issues or to complete exercises with that material. With FBL courses, the
“live” content was rarely in the classroom; instead, the student worked with actual clients and
referenced what they had learned in their previous coursework. This flipped structure helped
students obtain useful practice in real business work before they graduated. One respondent said,
“….The honeymoon period for someone starting in a job is getting shorter and shorter and so it’s
important for a new MBA grad to hit the ground running pretty quickly. And so the more
practice they get while they’re in the program the better it is for them.” (MBA3 Career)
Despite some evidence of the effectiveness of this form of learning, there were detractors.
As one respondent mentioned, at his school “not everyone is a big fan” (MBA5 Librarian). In
some of the programs, FBL projects were removed from the core curriculum in response to
negative feedback. One respondent shared that the leadership in his program once challenged
him on its relevancy, saying that computer simulations could achieve the same objectives;
I remember two deans back, I was in this conversation, and the dean was saying, “you
know [FBL course name], in five years is going to be gone,” because we’re going to have
these computer simulations…and so forth, and we don’t need this project-based stuff”.
…it’s turned out that he was wrong. These sort of computer-based simulations are good,
but they can’t teach the same things as field classes can. Businesses want to see that
students can apply these tools. They don’t want someone whose classroom smart, and
then can’t apply the tools. (MBA6 Professor)
Not all programs provided FBL experiences in the same way. There were commonalities
of a focus on practice and the “flipped classroom” approach, but there were variations as well.
Some programs included experiential field-based learning projects that did not have clients or

44

sponsoring organizations. Instead, the student team created a new business, product, or service.
In these projects, the focus shifted exclusively to determining market needs and product or
service viability. Potential customers rather than an actual client became the focus. There were
also instances in which actual consulting firms like Deloitte and A.T. Kearney were involved in
student instruction, and organizing the field engagement and student work with clients from that
firm. At Carnegie Mellon University, for example, A.T. Kearney offered “projects for student
teams to tackle over a 12-week period" (Poets & Quants, 2015). Sometimes, the work on these
projects was connected with a capstone experience and some schools had “laboratories” that
facilitated these projects. For example, at the MIT Sloan School of Management “….students
work in interdisciplinary teams and immersive, experiential exercises are administered through
Action Labs” (Somers et al., 2014, p. 54).
In MBA programs in which experiential field projects are required as part of the formal
management curriculum, programs gave them different names such as: “Applied Management
Research (AMR)” [UCLA], “Applied Innovation Course” [Haas UC Berkeley], “FIELD” [HBS],
“First-Year Project course (FYP)” [Tuck Dartmouth], “Fuqua Client Consulting Practicum”
[Duke], “MBA+ Micro-Consulting Projects” [McCombs U Texas], “Management Practice
(MP)” [Goizueta Emory], “Multidisciplinary Action Projects (MAP)” [Ross U Michigan] and
“Student Teams Achieving Results (STAR)” [Kenan-Flagler UNC]. At Columbia University’s
business school, the elective FBL classes were entitled “master classes” that were only offered to
full-time MBAs in their second year in the program. The school’s website stated that “….each
Master Class focuses on a specific industry context such as consulting, real estate, or
entrepreneurship and draws significant input from the professional community via interaction

45

with student team projects and project sponsors, guest speakers, adjunct faculty members, and
alumni participation” (Columbia Business School, 2015).
Global experiences and foreign travel were included within FBL projects at a number of
schools. One FBL course partners with students from an MBA program outside of the U.S.
This program was managed by the school’s marketing department and taught by faculty who
were primarily adjunct professors. In another global FBL project, one respondent discussed
taking video footage that was used in the classroom to support FBL: “I actually went with a
team to Tanzania, Dar es Salaam, as a consultant in the field with a hotel entrepreneur in Dar es
Salaam. And so from that 16 hours of footage, I put together a learning based kind of
documentary, if you will, for them to use in the classroom” (MBA1 Career). All programs
investigated in depth as case studies also offered an independent study component that could
include an FBL type project in which a student identified and worked on a real business
situation. Some of these projects were also outside of the United States. Independent study
project courses are a standard offering for most business schools (GMAC, 2013).
4.1.2 FBL Courses at the Six Case Study Institutions
A number of the six programs used as case studies acknowledged that the implementation
of FBL courses at their school was associated with revisions of their overall curriculum. From
the literature (Mintzberg, 2004; Thomas et al., 2013), such revisions appear to be done by
business schools periodically and particularly after significant events such as the 2008 recession.
The dynamic tends to be either moving to more required courses, or moving in the other
direction of more flexibility. As one librarian commented, “[A few years ago]….the MBA
curriculum was modified here…to be more flexible…they had gotten feedback from students

46

that they weren’t able to – there was too much in the way of the core and they didn’t have
enough ability to explore certain of their interest areas” (MBA6 Librarian).
All six schools offered primarily face-to-face instruction at their institution. A number of
the respondents identified this feature as an added value of their program. Said one professor,
“[The dean] feels strongly that MBA programs are under great threat and among other things,
from online courses and all of that stuff and that one of the unique features we have at [business
school name] is …the face to face stuff, including the experiential stuff” (MBA2 Professor).
Three of the six case study programs viewed their schools as defined by their experiential
field-based learning (FBL) programs in different ways. One program noted that FBL was a big
attraction for those who wanted to apply to their program (MBA5 Librarian). Another school
saw a real advantage in being located in a major American city and that because of that “we can
bring all these companies and executives into the classroom” (MBA1 Librarian). In one
interview, their school’s legacy with FBL promoted their part in a broader endeavor that tapped
into this expertise as part of a university wide entrepreneurial network (MBA2 Librarians).
Respondents also mentioned that the increasing popularity of FBL lead to the exploration
of new course format options that would add more FBL project experiences to the curriculum.
One professor said, “….I think it’s getting bigger and bigger, so, you know, we’re on this new
innovation thing now, so, at [business school name], we’re trying stuff, they only have one class
for a whole week, but they only go to this one class, so out in San Francisco, they spend a week
[or] going down to Mexico, looking at all these different factories” (MBA6 Professor).
4.1.3 History of FBL Project Courses at the Six Case Study Institutions
This study found that the structure of an FBL course could be influenced by the past
challenges and successes of this pedagogy at its school, and the expertise of the leadership who

47

designed the learning such as the faculty member’s quantitative or qualitative perspective on
research and consulting experience. One of the faculty members shared that “….because I’m a
quantitative guy, I’m always pushing them for some quantitative modeling, because I think
quantitative modeling in the business world…is more acceptable, and plus if you understand it,
and you have clear logic, you can defend your results better” (MBA6 Professor).
Four of the five faculty interviewed led their respective FBL project courses and their
reason for taking on this leadership role varied. One respondent participated in the launch of the
experiential FBL course at his school in the 1990s because no one else wanted to do it. He said,
“….No one really wanted it, and so, the strategy group decided to take it on, because there was
a—it was in the core, so it was a required class. So we took it on, that’s how I basically got
involved in it” (MBA6 Professor). At another program where they had offered some form of
FBL courses since the 1970s, changing faculty leadership over the years affected the type of
content and design of its FBL course. A career services professional who was also an alumnus
of the program shared that the course had changed when it had a new faculty leader. He said,
“….When I was a student 10 years ago and I did an experiential field-based project, the advisor
was a professor who was an expert in his academic field, but not necessarily on how to run a
consulting project. I think now if you look at the team of advisors, both internal and external to
[business school name], invariably these are people who have worked professionally as
consultants and who can really help teach the students on how to do this job” (MBA2 Career1).
Two of the case institutions had launched FBL in their school’s required curriculum over
40 years ago. One of these program respondents stated that “….they credit themselves with
being the first school in the nation to do this back in the ’60s” (MBA4 Librarian). The data did
not provide extensive details but in general, particularly with programs that had a longer history,

48

there was evidence that the curriculum had shifted in response to changes in leadership over
time.
One faculty lead said that when the dean asked him to take over the FBL course seven
years ago:
I had no background and no interest…[but] after saying no three times, I ended up
running the program” (MBA2 Professor). One concern was that he felt the faculty team
running the course were all academics and did not have much practical business
experience. “The faculty team was extremely ineffective and one of my conditions of
agreeing … was the dean said I could get rid of them all and I did. So I chose my own
[faculty] teams and …none of them are tenured faculty other than me…They’re mostly
[just] very experienced people. (MBA2 Professor)
Another change he implemented was adding more structure to the course because when he took
it over, he found that “….the course had no learning objectives. There was no course. It was
…pick a project, go out and do the project, if you have any troubles come talk to me and that’s
it” (MBA2 Professor). This issue of the faculty lead playing a crucial role in the success of the
FBL course was articulated in all the interviews, as one professor said,
When [the FBL course]…was initially launched there were no resources. It was just
supposed to magically happen. And the commitment to an associate deanship [to lead the
program] but also to raise the level of funds that the projects themselves bring into the
school and to deploy them back into support resources for quality control, to not only
continue the pipeline of good quality projects and clients but also to continue the pipeline
and improve the consistency of high quality deliverables and high quality educational
experience. (MBA3 Professor)
This idea of “cleaning the slate” and rethinking the program and what to do to effectively
deploy it emerged in other interviews as well. Two of the programs started an FBL course in the
1990s as part of new curriculum initiatives at their respective schools (MBA5, MBA6). MBA3
was launched in 2009 under similar circumstances. The respondents from MBA5 and MBA6
had participated in them from the beginning. The professor from MBA5 discussed how the form
of the program had shifted over the years. He commented, “….In the beginning, an

49

interdisciplinary team of five faculty members worked with 20 student teams. These days, a
smaller group works with eight” (MBA5 Professor). This professor attributed continual
adjustments and his school’s dedication to reflect and actively learn from past experiences in
their deployment of FBL courses to their success. He said, “….We are forever looking at our
pedagogy and trying to improve it. Making all kinds of changes over the years” (MBA5
Professor). Another interviewee said their program had a similar approach in describing their
FBL courses as “….an evolutionary process, very incremental, and a lot of experimental things.
Try a lot of things, do quick learning, you’ve got another cycle coming up next semester,
integrate, try new thing. So I think that we’ve gotten some very good progress in this despite
enormous odds” (MBA3 Professor).
In describing the history of his school’s FBL curriculum, the professor from MBA6 also
recounted that many changes had taken place over the years including switching it from a
required to an elective course, which was done in response to student feedback and capacity
constraints. The faculty member commented that having to “….find over 100 projects a
semester. There were just too many projects. So, they decided to take it out of the core” (MBA6
Professor). In terms of student feedback, one particular negative issue about this program was
that students who had previously worked in consulting felt they did not learn anything in this
course:
So, it’s in the core for… maybe about five years… everyone had to take it, 750 students.
Usually, in the core classes, you could waive either by credentials, take a test; or by your
past experience... Unfortunately, we couldn’t waive people based on any of
those…There were students who didn’t think that they should have to take it, because
they had been consultants, and so forth. But, again, there was no formal mechanism to
say ‘OK, fine, you waive.’ (MBA6 Professor).
As an elective, however, this professor added that this course has become very popular.
He said, “….[It has] just kept growing and growing and growing. Now, I believe we’re the
50

biggest elective at [business school name], or, if not the biggest, we’re one of the biggest”
(MBA6 Professor). In another program (MBA1), the FBL course had evolved from being a
required to an elective course because of negative student feedback. The librarian recalled that,
“….The students complained and …they just abandoned it...They were always going to replace it
with something but they never did. It just went away” (MBA1 Librarian). This respondent then
added that this change coincided with the arrival of a new dean for the school. Table 4.2
provides a listing of the years these various programs have included FBL and whether these
courses were required or an elective.

In MBA3’s program, they began offering a required FBL course as part of the revision of
their full-time MBA curriculum in 2009. The inclusion of this course work was in response to a
demand from faculty, recruiters, and employers from internships that “….students just didn’t
have as much rigor in terms of dealing with analytics, nor were they as comfortable in talking
through situations that were very ambiguous and open-ended” (MBA3 Librarian). Over time,
the FBL course content in this program had evolved to two FBL-type courses, one in the fall and
another in the spring semester. For the spring course option, students chose from among five
FBL elective courses. Similar to other programs, the lead professor at this program indicated
that adjustments were needed, particularly in this spring semester FBL course component. He
51

said that initially there was very little coordination between these courses, but over time they had
become more aligned:
There was absolutely no coordination or communication across those courses nor was
there any explicit tie-in made from any kind of core [FBL] course. It was a bunch of
separate islands of work. And what we’ve done first is to try to at least create a
foundation of skills and ideas in the core courses that could be used by the field-based
courses and then taking a number of courses that had been designated [FBL course name]
electives, try to develop the faculty members in those areas, still as islands, but to reflect
and harmonize with a common set of themes and processes. .. And to try to start to build
a little more consistency on …what would be deemed an appropriate type of a field
project so that at least these islands looked a little bit more like one another. (MBA3
Professor)
The faculty members conveyed in their interviews a devoted dedication to this
unconventional approach to education. As one professor said, “….There is a group of faculty
that care deeply about this that are trying their best to learn as much as they can and share it with
each other and then share that more informally with their colleagues when they get involved in
this stuff” (MBA5 Professor). Another interviewee phrased it simply as, “I’m a massive
supporter of this type of learning” (MBA4 Professor). This passion and inventive thinking made
them very entrepreneurial in their approach to FBL. This was articulated by one respondent who
felt that because of the learning objectives of his school, there was no model so he was
“….starting from scratch.” In this program, he had taken over leadership of FBL in 2012,
several years after it had launched as part of the school’s revised curriculum in 2009. He said:
We had no model out there to work from. We didn’t have other places to look at and say
we need to do what they’re doing because we didn’t really see anything out there that
really was doing things quite the way we wanted to do it. We also were a work in
progress because we had already launched [FBL course name] so there was an aspect of
rebuilding an aircraft that was already in flight. And enormous resource constraints.
Bandwidth constraints on the students because of the number of courses that they have to
simultaneously do. The imperative to make this program a self-funding kind of a
program. A lot of status quo to be shaken up. The fact that it’s very unconventional. So
it’s a real work in progress. (MBA3 Professor)

52

4.1.4 Programs in which FBL was a Core Required Course
In four of the six programs examined as case studies, FBL was a core course in their
school’s full-time MBA curriculum. All these programs offered these courses in different ways.
One program had a core FBL course as well as global elective FBL courses, as described by one
respondent:
So there’s a [FBL Course name] project which is the core class. It’s kind of the capstone
class of the first year and this is a consulting project for a real client who has a real need.
Teams come together and then are assigned a faculty advisor and then work on this in the
spring term with the final presentation being the last thing they do before they leave for
the summer… The other part of this is then on site global consulting which is a second
year elective that they can sign up for. This is usually where companies pay to have a
student team come and do consulting work for them. There’s no cost to the student even
though they might be flying somewhere else in the world and there usually are three or
four weeks phase one, which is mostly secondary research on campus, and then there’s a
three week in country piece of consulting which will be done at the client site usually.
(MBA2 Career1)
Table 4.3 shows the lengths of the FBL courses in the various programs, which varied
from two months of complete immersion with no other classes to a series of two courses that
extended through the whole first year of the program.

6 months in second year – fall or spring
2 months in first year – spring (students only do this during this time)
Elective - Spring or fall semester, first or second year

Three of these four programs also had business programs at their school other than the
full-time MBA program, such as their evening, executive MBA, and undergraduate business
programs. The FBL project courses were being phased into the required courses at these
programs. At one school, “….the business school has a curriculum called [FBL course name]
53

and this currently is a required component of the curriculum for the one year and the two year
full-time MBAs and the evening MBAs” (MBA3 Librarian). In another program (MBA5), the
FBL course had expanded “….to the executive MBA, part time MBA, global MBA, weekend
MBA, and it’s actually expanding to the undergraduate curriculum as well, but not in the formal
sense… It’s a required core class for all the groups except the part time MBAs, so everyone goes
through it” (MBA5 Librarian).
As a required course, FBL was placed in the first year of three of the programs, although
in one “….they’re doing this project in their second year of their two year program" (MBA4
Professor). At this program “….all students are required to do this or a business plan
development project in order to graduate with their experiential learning process framed as if it’s
a consulting project” (MBA4 Career).
4.1.5 Programs where FBL was only an Elective Course
In two programs, FBL was only an elective course. In one program (MBA6), where they
also had a fairly small healthcare management program major, students “are required to do field
activity projects… It’s not an option" (MBA6 Career). An FBL course was not required for all
the other MBA students in this program. Despite there not being a required class at MBA1 and
MBA6, the interviews clearly indicated that there was a demand and increasing focus on FBL at
their schools. As one interviewee reported, “….In November or December there’s always an end
of the semester faculty report and everybody goes. So there are three or four professors that give
their findings from these [FBL] classes. Because everything is now geared towards these -- I
mean the heat is on for these classes” (MBA1 Career). A respondent in the other program
indicated the same. “….I do think that there has been more of an emphasis in the last probably
three to five years in having people participate in one of these experiences” (MBA6 Librarian).

54

Both programs indicated that most MBAs chose to take these classes in their second year.
One respondent indicated that the reason for this was “….because the whole first year is pretty
much packaged. So it’s really the second year when they’re doing their electives and the [FBL]
classes” (MBA1 Librarian). This respondent stated that at her school “….often they’re
entrepreneurship type courses… They have a few others …most always finance based. But
mostly entrepreneurship I think is the big area” (MBA1 Librarian). She said that at her school,
there were fewer FBL elective courses than in the past. She believed this was because they
required so much of a time commitment from faculty. While most students chose to take these
courses in the second year, the professor at MBA6 indicated that his course could be taken in a
student's first semester before any core classes had been completed. This reflected the powerful
influence of the faculty member on its structure and requirements. Unlike the other faculty, this
professor was not concerned that not having taken any courses in the core curriculum would
constrain MBA students’ ability to apply the necessary skills for these projects.
They can either pick up the tool that we’re using [themselves], or they can just pick them
up from other students … I’m pretty flexible. I mean, as long as I don’t get stopped by
the administration, I don’t really care, right? I don’t believe that you have to take a class
to do well in this class. I mean -- [they can learn from their peers]... Or, I’ll just send
them right to [name of professor] about branding, and in 45 minutes, [professor’s name]
can tell them the basics of, you know, branding, and so forth. It’s much more efficient, in
terms of them learning, I can tell you that much. (MBA6 Professor)
The appeal of these courses was characterized by this professor when he stated that at his
school, his FBL course was popular because "….it’s the only class where there’s no classroom
learning. So, they’re [students] interested in, sort of, applying these techniques" (MBA6
Professor). In both schools, the respondents discussed the application process for these FBL
elective courses. Students could not just sign up. At MBA1, depending on the elective, there
were different application procedures and unlike MBA6, certain classes were a prerequisite for

55

consideration: “Some of them had to write out an essay beforehand why you want to be in it.
You need to have a certain grade level. You need to have taken certain classes before. So they
were sort of for the elite more than just -- they weren’t just for everybody" (MBA1 Librarian).
4.1.6 Summary of Research Question 1
In reviewing the different forms of FBL courses at the top 20 full-time MBA programs,
there were many admirers of this form of pedagogy, but this sentiment was not universal.
Schools differed in the administration of these courses, with non-faculty staff often playing
different roles in their governance. Many programs were led by faculty who played a decisive
role in their structure and content. There were similarities and differences at the schools about
the requirement for FBL courses. Some started and continued with a required FBL course, while
others changed to elective courses. In one institution, their program initiated a required FBL
course in 2009. As shown in Table 4.1, more of the smaller MBA programs had FBL courses in
their required core curriculum. The entrepreneurial character of those leading and involved with
these courses and their willingness to continually be open to revising and trying out new
approaches with these courses was apparent.
4.2 Organizational Structure of Field-based Learning (FBL)
Research Question 2: What organizational structures are associated with the different types
of experiential field-based project learning offered at these different programs?
This section reviews the data collected on the organizational structure of the experiential
field-based learning (FBL) project courses at the six case study institutions. Organizationally,
responsibilities fell within two areas: 1) administration of logistical aspects of FBL and 2)
curriculum design. This section describes these two perspectives and reveals that different types
of expertise and organizational leadership were required.

56

4.2.1 Administration of Logistical Aspects of FBL
This study identified variations not only the pedagogical design of these courses, but also
in their logistical administration through such activities as locating projects, matching teams with
projects, managing auxiliary financial and contractual obligations that could come with securing
projects, and securing flights and other travel arrangements for student teams working in another
location. These administrative requirements could be quite extensive and complex, and they
varied among the six programs. In one program, there was a managing director of an office
responsible for coordinating all the school’s FBL courses; this person had assistance from
various roles. As a professor stated, "….She’s the business managing director if you will of the
whole thing, but in terms of ... pedagogy and what we’re doing she’s been doing this long
enough that she knows that that’s [most] often sitting in faculty hands… [This] managing
director of [FBL course name] has her own staff and she’s a full-on professional …she’s
reporting to the MBA associate dean who’s reporting to the dean” (MBA5 Professor). There was
also a faculty director at his school for FBL who reported to the dean.
Of the faculty interviewed for this study, the professor at MBA5 was the only one who
was not the lead faculty member for the FBL course design at his school. He depicted the
administrative managing director and faculty director as having distinct roles but working very
closely together. As he pointed out, the two directors had clearly different areas of
responsibility, with the managing director “and her team is responsible for making the trains run
on time. With say 400 to 500 students and about 80 or 90 projects, you can imagine the
complexity. We also have a faculty director…. He or she works hand in glove with our managing
director to ensure the integrity of the program” (MBA5 Professor).
At MBA2, the leadership for the FBL course was also divided between a faculty and

57

administrative director role who, along with the program manager who worked for her, handled
the logistical aspects of the course that included “55 to 60 projects a year” (MBA2 Professor).
The professor who was also the faculty director at this program indicated that over the years, his
administrative director’s role had grown in managing the FBL course; however, similar to
MBA5, he felt that the pedagogical design role for the course needed to remain with him as
faculty director. “….Where I feel like I sort of earn my keep is when we’re talking about course
design. And that’s where I think I have some, some knowledge, a lot of experience and just a
feeling that that’s my profession and administrators don’t, understandably” (MBA2 Professor).
This interviewee mentioned that for the two experiential FBL elective courses at his
school that were offered to MBA students in their second year, there were just administrative
directors in leadership and course design roles. He said, "….There’s no faculty director, in those
other two courses there’s [just] an administrative director who is not a tenure-track nor a PhD
person” (MBA2 Professor). These administrative directors were leading teams that had faculty
members as advisors on the team level. “And faculty, in that context, also with very few
exceptions, means adjuncts, non-PhDs, non-researchers" (MBA2 Professor).
In some programs, the course design and administration were combined in one role. In
MBA3, where the associate dean for this school’s FBL curriculum served in this capacity, he
discussed the broad range in his responsibilities from course design and teaching the full-time
and evening MBA FBL courses to identifying projects and directing the strategy for how this
sort of learning fit with the school’s curriculum overall and broader objectives:
As the director in effect of this program… really trying to help the school think
strategically about what the programs mean, what their mission is, what the objectives
are, and thinking about a good operating model. Thinking about what resources would be
required, thinking about pedagogy, thinking about everything that would be required to
create and effectively run the program as well as the economic model. So … I think the
contract for the position said a very broad portfolio to be able to develop and lead [the]
58

program. (MBA3 Professor)
In some programs, this faculty member lead reported directly to the dean’s office. The
professor said,
When I took it [FBL course name] over I started reporting to the deans, in the sense that I
would write, create a presentation every year and in the summer, organize a meeting and
make a presentation to the deans. I did that not because they asked me to but because I
thought it was in our interest for them to know what the heck we were doing" (MBA2
Professor). At MBA3, the associate dean heading FBL reported to the vice dean who
reported to the dean. “….Because it’s a programmatic role that spans multiple [MBA]
programs so it does report to the vice dean” (MBA3 Professor). At MBA4, the faculty
lead reported to “the academic dean for all the field studies programs at [business school
name]. (MBA4 Professor)
In this program, there were four experiential FBL course options. The applied
management field study course was the primary course MBAs took to fulfill this course
requirement. One professor said,
So there’s a full-time, fully employed field studies program, there’s a global field studies
program, there’s an applied management research field studies program which I think is
the biggest...And then there’s a business creation option field studies project course. So
all of them, the heads of each of those programs basically fall under the academic dean
for field studies programs at [university name]...That person reports to the academic dean
for [business school name]...there’s an academic dean and then there’s a sort of a, I guess
for lack of a better word, a non-academic dean. And so it’s the academic dean that that
person reports to. (MBA4 Professor)
In describing these organizational dynamics, the respondent in one interview felt it was
important to emphasize the sense of teamwork and collegial good will among all involved at his
institution regardless of being administrative staff or faculty. “….So there’s a reporting
relationship that to me it feels very much like a team… We’re just all doing this together. There
never is a sense of I’ve got to get back to you on this, I need to talk to Bob or I need to talk to
Betty to see if I can do this” (MBA5 Professor). This was not the case at all other programs
where the administration appeared to be more fractured.
At MBA6, similar to MBA2, the two FBL project courses had different administrative
59

structures. One course, in place for many years, had a very lean administrative structure of just
one faculty director and one administrator. This school had an elective global marketingoriented FBL course that fewer students took but which had a bigger administrative
infrastructure. The librarian said,
We also have something called the “global consulting practicum” [GCP] which is in the
marketing department and that is something where students actually also work with
students from other institutions… in the world…, on a project as well -- a client project.
And this has kind of a larger maybe supporting structure around it… there’s a kind of a
faculty oversight person for the GCP as well as like more of an administrative structure
than there is for the -- for the [other FBL course name]. (MBA6 Librarian)
The faculty lead at the other FBL course at MBA6 suggested that he would not want
more administrative staff. He even shared that he does not want the course to grow any further
in terms of number of projects so they do not have to take on extra staff:
Just, you know, [the course administrator] and I, OK. And then we have these other
professors, you know, area of expertise faculty, so we know who to call when we have to.
But besides that, I mean, we try to run a lean operation here. I mean we’re doing about
between 30 and 35 projects a semester, so we cycle through a lot of students. But we
really don’t have staff; it’s just me and her. (MBA6 Professor).
One of the programs had recently moved all administrators for their three different FBL
courses in one location called the “experiential collaborative." This change was in progress
when the interviews for this dissertation were conducted. As described by one professor:
The [FBL course name] project team and the on-site [global FBL courses] team will
move from their offices to a zone in [Business School Name] now where there’s a sort of
a mezzanine floor and they all have their offices surrounding it, so they’re using a shared
meeting space, shared coffee facilities, etc. So it’s known at the school as the
collaborative. If a student is going along to meet one part of this they’ll be exposed to the
marketing materials and the staff of the others. (MBA2 Professor)
Administrators, and not faculty connected with FBL courses, moved to this space, reported one
MBA2 professor, “….If a professor is now acting as a faculty advisor, the professor would still
use his or her office to run those meetings. So it’s the admin staff who’ve been collocated.”

60

Another respondent from this school added that by having these roles physically collocated, “the
students have been encouraged to see our various offerings as part of a suite of things” (MBA2
Career1).
Locating projects. For this type of curriculum, the respondents alluded to the importance
of finding quality projects for the students as well as providing a consistent level of support for
the projects. Said one respondent:
I think it will be imperative in order for experiential learning to be successful to have sort
of a core support network in place … to source quality projects, to have real time
feedback, to have sort of a consistent level of quality and feedback for the students in
order for the students to realize the benefits from experiential learning. And for the client
as well. So, like any project, if nobody’s really watching over it, it can go off the rails.
(MBA3 Career)
Finding good projects for this type of learning could be challenging. As one professor stated,
“So, the trouble is, you generally have to, especially in large organizations, you have to find
someone with a project at the right time. So they’ll come back, but they may not come back
every year” (MBA6 Professor).
All programs had systems for identifying quality projects for their programs. One
program that had done FBL projects for quite a while discussed this in detail, along with the
problematic issues that needed to be addressed. At this school, there was a faculty committee
that reviewed all project proposals from sponsors to determine which would be included in the
final list for the student bidding process. Projects would be removed if the committee felt they
were not viable because they included elements that could impede the student teams’ ability to
achieve successful outcomes. The faculty members chosen to be on this committee had
considerable experience supporting FBL projects at this school:
These folks have a very good idea of what is a doable project. They review the proposals
before students get a chance to bid on them. In some cases, we go back to the sponsoring
organization to refine the proposal. It cannot be too broad at the same time it cannot be
61

too narrow. With experience, we all have a reasonable idea of the sweet spot. Of course,
we have our priorities as to whether or not the students will want to work on these
projects … but we do not impose our will on them. (MBA5 Professor)
After the committee finished this culling, there would be about 200 projects for which the
80 to 90 student teams could bid. One professor commented that:
The students bid on the projects that interest them. There are always some projects that
go unaddressed -- and the potential sponsors know that when they submit them for
consideration” (MBA5 Professor). According to this professor, the fact that the
companies knew there was a 50% chance that students might not select their project
served as “….an incentive to make sure they [come] up with a good project compelling to
MBA students. (MBA5 Professor)
All of the schools contended with the variability of potential projects and the challenges
of fitting them within the constraints of the defined course period and its learning objectives.
Said one professor, “….We try to choose projects that have …fairly unstructured questions that
the students and the student teams need to structure” (MBA3 Professor). In one school, a
project that went beyond the proscribed course time was then continued over several semesters
so that different teams could work on it to accommodate the sponsor’s needs:
Sometimes, we have projects which we can’t finish in one semester, and so, we’ll just
carry on the project for a full year, or even two years. So, we’re doing a marketing ROI
model for some mutual fund companies, and that’s been taking us a long time, because
we had to come up with the design, and then we had to implement it, and [are] now
piloting it. So, we have these long-term projects. (MBA6 Professor)
One respondent mentioned that because their school did not have a database of
companies, it would reach out to different departments in the school to assist with sourcing
projects. This process made it more complicated to locate potential companies. This same
program also shared how improvements in their curriculum had made their program more
popular with potential clients and this made identifying projects easier. The professor said:
Because this program is really well received by students now and they work their tails
off. Five, 10 years ago I think it was not nearly as well received and it was harder to get
clients and I expect that the deliverables weren’t nearly as good as they are now.
62

Because now we have like a waiting list of clients that want to submit projects into this
program. And given the size of it that’s a big order because we have 60 plus companies
whose projects -- or 70 companies who are involved in the program and there’s probably
another list of 35 or 40 that didn’t get their projects accepted. (MBA4 Professor)
The career services professionals indicated that they provide a peripheral role in finding
potential sponsors for these projects through their recruiting activities that raise awareness about
their school. However, these professionals did not play an active role in actually securing
projects: “….We don’t force the companies or we don’t get the projects. Those are done by the
academic team” (MBA6 Career). In one institution, there was a high-level leadership role that
reported to the dean and who in addition to other outreach responsibilities identified potential
sponsors for FBL project courses. This position “….makes contacts out into the city to leverage
the connections” (MBA1 Librarian).
Respondents indicated that over the years, the focus of the FBL student projects would
change. As one professor recalled: “The projects change depending on where business is. So
broadly when we first started doing this, it was all process redesign stuff in the ’90s, and now it’s
a lot of market entry stuff projects” (MBA5 Professor). The programs shared that many projects
had a marketing focus, and one professor agreed, “….the projects, of course, are all over the
map, but 60 to 70% of them have a marketing flavor. They could be introducing a new product,
could be going to a new geography” (MBA2 Professor). This professor felt strongly that there
were some projects that were not well suited for MBA students to work on in FBL courses:
Companies aren’t stupid enough to ask us to do really important strategy formulation
projects. … We’ve got smart students, we’ve got, and you know, for 28-year-olds, very
experienced students. But they’re still not; they’re not a McKinsey team. So we don’t
get much in the way of strategy. We don’t get very many quantitative, operational kinds
of projects. Our students aren’t interested in that kind of thing. With some exceptions.
So … for these various reasons, not all of which I think I understand, they tend to be sort
of marketing projects. (MBA2 Professor)
A respondent from another program described examples of FBL student projects that
63

were marketing related:
So it might be that a company wants to consider entering a new market and so the
students have to evaluate all of the costs and benefits and risks associated with venturing
into a new market…It might be launching a new product so they would have to do a very
detailed environmental assessment of not just the competing products that are out there
and competitors, but then they’d have to look at the attributes of the product that the
company is thinking of launching and market test those by collecting primary data from
target customers to validate the company’s presumption that launching this new product
will make sense. (MBA4 Professor)
Some programs charged fees to project sponsors for this work while others did not. One
respondent defended the practice of charging fees because he felt the fees emphasized that they
were “real projects”:
These are real projects. These aren’t make-believe projects. And the clients spend
money with [university name] and so the clients want real results. They don’t want to see
some academic study. So that’s why it’s … a very exciting and interesting program
because we force on the students a level of academic rigor in terms of when they do their
primary and secondary research, but they still have to meet the goal of having real impact
on the client. (MBA4 Professor)
At MBA6, the program had a hybrid model and only charged clients who were not
alumni of their school: “They’ll be alumni, and they’ll use [FBL course name], and we’ll waive
the fees, and it’s just their way of sort of connecting back to the school. And, so, we’ll waive the
fees for those alumni” (MBA6 Professor). The programs at MBA3 and MBA4 charged fees to
sponsors for most project work, while the programs at MBA1, MBA2 and MB5 did not charge
fees to sponsors for projects. In all programs, non-profit project sponsors were not charged a fee
for the work. At one program that did not charge fees, the faculty lead said he was given a large
budget to use for these projects and that in his school’s culture, there was no official budgeting
oversight. However, he reported the expenses because they were incurred with outside
organizations: “I sort of feel I have to be a little bit more corporate about it because it is different
in these ways" (MBA2 Professor). Another school that did not charge a fee only asked that the

64

“sponsoring organizations cover the costs -- just the straight costs, that’s it. And in some cases,
we do it for free” (MBA5 Professor).
Project team assignments. Fairness in the assignment of projects to student teams was a
concern for the programs where projects were assigned. This could require extra administrative
effort to assure that teams were suitably matched with a particular project:
We do our best to give our students the projects that they want… [In the] bidding process
they will look over the available projects and pick their top 10 or so. The good news is
we have operations faculty here. We have a good assignment algorithm; our success is
measured by what percentage of the students received their first choice, second choice,
third choice, and etcetera. We pride ourselves on the fact that the vast majority of
students get their first, second or third choice. While there may be a tiny percentage that
receives their sixth choice or something, we try really hard to minimize that kind of
outcome. (MBA5 Professor)
Not all programs had such an elaborate selection process. At another program, the professor
shared that in the "spring term, the students select a project off a list that my director creates.
Maybe there are 100 potential projects in that of which about half get selected, so they select
their projects and they select their own teams. There are teams of five" (MBA2 Professor). In
some programs, teams could identify their own project or select from a list provided by the
course: “….Students either source for themselves or choose one of the sourced projects where
they and four other classmates will solve whatever business problem is put in front of them”
(MBA4 Career). In some programs, student teams worked on projects outside of the United
States. Thus, language ability could play a role in which projects were selected by the students:
Language provides an opportunity and a constraint. Lots of people want to work in a
‘foreign country’ (I say that recognizing that the United States is a foreign country for
students from abroad). Some countries are easier for English speakers than others. In
Brazil, for example, you can often get by with English – and a translator - because so
many people speak English there. China, on the other hand, can be a “problem” for us.
We try very hard to put at least one Chinese speaker on a team that’s going to be in
China. We know that some Chinese students are happy to go home and others are not. It
all works out. (MBA5 Professor)

65

The extensive logistical work involved in coordinating and securing these projects was a
primary focus of some FBL administrative roles. At one school, the two roles were described as
organizing “….everything else that have to do with these projects. They scope the projects, they
pull in the projects, they do all the administrative work to get students to figure out how to team
the projects… [And] if there’s travel involved they’re the ones that coordinate the travel"
(MBA2 Librarians). In describing the administrative issues with the projects, one respondent
exclaimed that “….there are all kinds of complexities as the rubber hits the road” (MBA5
Professor). He then described the myriad of issues that arise with students working on projects
under this area’s purview:
Our students come from all over the world and … we send our students all over the
world. They need to get their vaccines and visas under some time pressure. Beyond that,
there are sometimes non-compete issues. For example, you may have a student from Ford
who is going back to work for Ford. A company like General Motors or Chrysler might
have an issue with a “Ford employee” in their midst. These are not big issues but they do
need to be addressed. (MBA5 Professor)
In one program, the FBL course’s only faculty advisor met with all 35 teams once a
week. He facilitated the course in the fall and spring semester. Overall, since each course had
180 students, the logistics could be quite complicated. There was never a time in the semester
when all the students registered in this course met as a group. This professor said that for the
past three years, he also had some teams in San Francisco. For this class, he conducted weekly
meetings by telephone and only traveled to San Francisco for an introductory session and to
observe the final project presentations at the end of the course. For this course, the sole
administrator was quite involved in helping secure projects and making arrangements for all the
team meetings.
This same program had devised a way to accommodate students’ as well as potential host
companies’ interests in identifying their own FBL project teams. Officially, in the registrar’s
66

list, this course would be identified separately as an independent study although the faculty
member supported the students with weekly meetings in the same way as in his FBL course.
This was an example of some schools’ more fluid approach to these FBL project courses:
So, Urban Outfitters uses us a lot, and …we have a lot of alumni there. And they always
want to choose their own team, so we’ll have people apply. They’ll look through the
resumes, they’ll choose their own team. It’s a [FBL course name], but we can’t [put] it
through the [FBL course name] [registration] process, but we can accommodate them by
just saying “oh, well, you’re an [independent study] under me.” But, you know, it’s
basically the same thing [course]. (MBA6 Professor)
4.2.2 Curriculum Design
All the programs indicated that they were still finding their way in terms of the best way
to organize and design curriculum in these FBL programs. They presented the FBL curriculum
as something their schools were continually refining. These shifting dynamics were evident,
even in programs where this type of course had been established as a required and key part of the
curriculum:
So redefining [FBL course name] and figuring out the role of classroom and field as an
integrated model …And then thinking also about coordination, recognizing that this was
a program and that classroom and field, and across all the school, needed to be working
together. That’s another contribution. We started moving down the road at least, haven’t
gotten there yet, but I think we got basic agreement also on the issue of resources.
(MBA3 Professor)
Faculty leadership. In all programs, the faculty lead was primarily in charge of
curriculum design of their required FBL project courses. In some schools, this position was
responsible for oversight of other areas, which resulted in capacity strain:
So part of my role, aside from being the academic director, is on a number of the topics,
client management, scope management and [overseeing] projects… I’m over everything,
and this term I’m not advising teams, but the last two years I was advising multiple teams
[too]… I serve on a number of boards as well and so because of the additional oversight
responsibilities of being the overall academic faculty director for this program I didn’t
want to add to that also of advising teams… It’s just too much stuff. (MBA4 Professor)

67

At two programs, the faculty spoke of how they alone, as tenured or tenure-track faculty,
have the expertise best suited for designing the curriculum of the FBL course:
I feel that I am uniquely responsible for the pedagogical design. I would not defer or not
let anyone else -- that doesn’t mean I don’t listen to people, but I just mean the
responsibility is mine. And I suppose leadership, too. Yeah, I’m definitely the
spokesperson for the [course]-- but that’s because being here 30 years I’m tenured, I’m a
faculty member...I carry a different weight ... if the dean wanted someone to talk about
this course to the MBA Advisory Board, he would not choose my administrative director,
just would never, ever do that. He would choose me. For all the reasons I cited. (MBA2
Professor)
At one school where FBL was well established, there was a group of experienced faculty
who together played a leadership role. They had been working with the FBL course for many
years and by coaching newer faculty and others, they supported this learning and influenced its
evolving curricular design. This knowledge often prevented problems from occurring with the
sponsors and student teams that can arise with this type of project learning. One professor said,
“….Every year begins with a kickoff where new faculty meet with experienced faculty. We try
to pass some wisdom across the generations” (MBA5 Professor).
Structure of curriculum design. Some programs preferred a more informal structure,
while others created a more formal structure. MBA6 and MBA1 had less structure, while
MBA2, MBA3 and MBA4 had more structure in the design of their FBL project courses. The
MBA5 program was somewhere in between because the teams were given a fair amount of
autonomy, while the support system infrastructure was quite extensive. At one program
(MBA6) where the faculty member had been involved with the FBL course since its inception
over 20 years ago, the approach was unstructured and completely focused on team meetings with
no regular time-slot for the course. Teams met with the professor each week in person or by
phone for 45 minutes.
Some programs felt that imposing too much structure on FBL courses could hinder the
68

practical learning it espoused. As one professor commented, “….I think in these types of
experiential learning, it’s very important to not provide much structure for the students. Part of
the real learning experience is for them to put structure into something that’s really unstructured"
(MBA4 Professor). Other programs felt that more structure was necessary to provide guidance
to students who could find FBL project work quite challenging:
The whole process is very challenging to them [the students]. It’s a new way of
thinking…They tend to be drawn to advocacy over discovery. They tend to think about
expediency over thoroughness. They tend to chase initial thoughts and inspirations…as
opposed to a thorough systematic approach… So I think part of the learning process is for
them to do it and to get some developmental and evaluative feedback that helps them to
understand that there’s different levels [of developing expertise]… we try to use a
framework to help them understand that what they do is a step along the way, but that
there is a path, there is increasing levels of sophistication to this and that there are tools
and techniques for doing this. (MBA3 Professor)
Three of the programs (MBA2, MBA3, MBA4) said that their FBL course was based on
the “consulting model.” These were also the only three of the four required FBL courses that
involved individuals with consulting backgrounds in designing the course. One faculty
respondent mentioned that he incorporated the consulting method approach when he took over
and redesigned the FBL course:
So over several years with one of my colleagues, who’s an adjunct professor and a
longtime consultant, we rebuilt the course around the consulting methodology…So now
we can say, ‘You will learn primarily by doing, the consulting methodology,’ so there are
deliverables along the way. There’s a one-page description of the problem early on, then
there’s a work plan. Then there’s an interim deliverable and so on… The point is that it’s
structured. It’s not just ‘go out and do it’. (MBA2 Professor)
The faculty lead at MBA3, who also drew heavily from the “consulting toolkit” in
designing his school’s FBL course, supported this approach: “….Think about what it is that the
consulting profession trains their people to do and starting with that, training all of our students
to have an understanding of those processes and some of those techniques” (MBA3 Professor).
This respondent felt that this method provided a needed focus for the FBL courses:
69

It’s a combination of classroom and field that has to work together. Defining the focal
point of it as what we call the big three, which is tools and techniques for solving
problems, ways for managing teams and projects, and techniques for communication and
persuasion, and integrating those gave it some kind of a focus, a set of what kinds of
specific skills that could be assessed that are important and validating against what the
field needs. So giving it that kind of focus….drawing very heavily on the consulting
toolkit... [These projects confront] more complex research questions that require the
students to do a lot of thinking, working, structuring, to focus, what is the key question
and to break that into a set of research questions that clearly add up to answers to the key
question. (MBA3 Professor)
In three programs, the faculty had very strong feelings about their responsibilities in
designing a more structured course that they felt offered students the level of support they
needed for the projects. “….I try to stay away from people who will think that they can do
anything they want, or people who believe … that we learn by being thrown into the pool and
swimming… That’s not what I think experiential education is. I think it’s designed education. I
think our role as designers for the learning is really important” (MBA2 Professor).
In contrast, another program chose a deliberately unstructured approach for their FBL
course:
There’s no classroom learning…a team is usually between four and six students. They
meet with me once a week… We sort of go through their progress, what are they doing,
and so forth. And then, these are multi-functional projects, and so, we have area of
expertise faculty. So, depending on, what they’re doing. So, if they’re doing a marketing
survey, we’ll send them off, and talk to some marketing survey person, or, if they’re
doing some financial spreadsheets, we’ll send them off there”. (MBA6 Professor)
He then continued to describe how he worked with teams to focus on the project work:
Most of the issues that we get from these hosts are way too broad… We have…one
semester, so, the first third of the class, a lot of times, is, well, let’s focus down [on] this
problem, let’s see what we think is high-priority, and let’s have a project-based on that…
And a lot of these teams, they don’t know how to do it… They really struggle, and I
don’t help them, because, this is part of their learning. In the real world, I’m not there to
help them. So, a lot of it is they have to come up with a focus…-- and then they have to
persuade the host ‘yeah, this is a focus that you want.’ (MBA6 Professor)
In another program, where these FBL course projects were less structured, one faculty

70

respondent was particularly philosophical about the goals of this type of education when
describing his school’s approach:
I am always reminded of Aristotle when I think about [FBL course name]. He spoke of
different kinds of knowledge: Episteme (timeless knowledge like mathematics) Techne
(craft-based knowledge) and Phronesis (practical wisdom). To be sure, all kinds of
knowledge is cultivated in our curriculum. Some economic and statistical principles may
be timeless and certainly the ability to put together a customer relationship management
program or structure a leveraged buyout would constitute craft-based knowledge. But of
course, much of management draws upon practical wisdom. That is, how do we make
judgments among a sophisticated and complex set of alternatives with evaluation criteria
that may be at odds with each other, and with different constituents reading the options
and decision criteria differently? How do we implement our decisions in a world of
unintended consequences? This is the Phronesis that we are trying to develop among our
students. I think our impulse to do action-based learning is rooted in a quest to have our
students mindfully engage a world where knowledge and truth commingle with the
complex realities of a day-to-day organizational life. (MBA5 Professor)
In MBA1, where FBL was offered in different elective courses, the level of structure
varied with the faculty member who taught the course and the engagement of the project
sponsor. The librarian commented, “….It depends on the class and the professor how well
organized it is. That’s the other piece I think that can be complicated. So -- and how involved
the company is willing to be and willing to give them information and work with them. So it
really varies based on the professor and the projects involved” (MBA1 Librarian).
At another school, there was a required course on project and problem decision making
based on the “consulting method” that would prepare students with the skills they would need for
FBL work. No other programs offered such a course. Some respondents indicated that they did
not feel that additional preparation was necessary and that it defeated the “figure it out” messy
experiential nature of FBL. However, MBA2 offered this sort of a course as an elective and the
faculty lead said he had hoped it could be made a requirement in preparation for FBL project
work. When discussing this elective consulting methods course, he stated:

71

Many with consulting experience don’t take the course. She [the instructor] gets more
than a quarter of the class, probably. So we consider it a big success … that’s a mixture
first years and second years, but primarily first years. … The method that she describes
[is] an adaptation [of what] all the consulting firms [do] (MBA2 Professor).
He then described his reasoning for adding this elective consulting course to the current required
FBL course at his school:
In the ideal world, I think this [FBL course] is two courses and I think it’s important
enough for that. Calling [this elective course] “consulting skills” is a problem. Because
some of our students hate consulting. [They] think it’s not something they’re ever going
to do. If you called it “problem-solving” or “project management,” it’s something they
all need. And I tell them that. If you’re going to be a staff person to a vice president,
guess what you’re going to be doing? Exactly this kind of work. And you’re not going
to have nine weeks. You’re going to have a week. (MBA2 Professor)
In the context of expertise, the FBL faculty leads had extensive backgrounds in an
academic discipline. Some also had experience working in top consulting firms such as
Mckinsey or Deloitte. All had differing perspectives on their guidance to students on structuring
these projects and working with project sponsors. Some felt it was important to follow the
client’s lead as closely as possible. In terms of project scope, others felt it was important to
determine what was best for the client without being influenced by their input:
So, they’re [student team] generally a little more scared to -- of the host, right? …And I
just had to make it clear. Look, I don’t care what the host really wants here. This is what
we’re going to do, because this is what the host needs. …And, if there’s some issue, I’ll
go back to the host. I generally try to stay out of it, because they should learn how to do
that, anyway. So, but, if there’s some issue, I’ll go back to the host, and I’ll just tell the
host. (MBA6 Professor)
The data revealed that in some schools, the process of assigning projects to student teams
was viewed as a critical part of the pedagogy. Programs worked hard to make sure that teams
had diverse membership and included students beyond those they knew well and had typically
worked with on other school work. Teams were also based on the team members’ interest in the
project. At MBA3, MBA5, and with some projects at MBA6, student teams were assigned by

72

the students’ bids. In other programs, students choose their own teams. One of the arguments
for assigning teams was that this approach reflected the real world work where employees are
not given the option of selecting team members. In programs where students selected their own
team members, one professor acknowledged that there would always be some less motivated
teams who did not accomplish as much in the FBL experience as other teams:
There’s this project in the spring. They just don’t care about it. They’ve got other things
to do. They find four other people who don’t care and guess what? The project doesn’t
work very well. Sometimes they have real troubles with the clients and the project either
morphs into something the students didn’t sign up for or whatever. So five fantastic, five
real disasters and in the middle, they almost all do really good work for a real person and
I think they learn a fair amount. (MBA2 Professor)
In one interview, a professor said that a unique feature in their FBL curriculum was the
inclusion of the expertise the business librarians in the research process. He felt this
demonstrated a clear example of how his program’s FBL project courses were experimenting
with new ways to approach curriculum:
One of the areas that I think has been -- that is very unique about the way we’ve done
this… has been the partnership with the library. It’s just my understanding that that’s a
different way to approach it. It certainly is different from what we had done historically
here at the business school. …But to me it’s one of these examples where a lot of rapid
prototyping, a lot of experimentation, a lot of close cooperation and involvement and
continued improvement really has led to a lot of very good work and some evidence of
improvement in value with still a lot of value left to be created. …Having pretty
thoroughly tested this now for a few years [we need] to start to bring other faculty and
staff into it so that that becomes… much more marbleized throughout the culture and the
process of the school. (MBA3 Professor)
In terms of curricular design, respondents discussed the importance of scheduling
activities for FBL that worked best with student routines. In some cases, this was limited to
scheduling weekly meetings with the team’s faculty advisor but in others, additional
programming was included as part of the course. In one program, respondents reported that they

73

had recently structured the schedule so that Wednesdays were dedicated to students working on
these projects and FBL focused programming:
We have a whole series of [voluntary] noontime workshops that start right when term
begins. That’s where I do my opening. Where there are sort of intense sessions on
interviewing and running surveys effectively or workshops on strategy frameworks. So
someone will go through all the different strategic frameworks that are well known from
the core courses to the SWOT type analysis through a whole load of others. There will
be someone that does a session on conjoint analysis. There will be someone that does a
session on marketing strategy. So depending on the nature of the project these
workshops are targeted at providing rigorous tools and methods if those particular tools
and methods are appropriate for the particular project you’re working on. (MBA4
Professor)
Deliverables. The final graded work that students produced for their projects’ sponsor
typically included a slide deck that summarized their recommendations and that they presented
to the client in person or virtually. In addition to this final deliverable, interim materials were
sometimes assigned. One professor described this:
As they move through the process …the deliverables become much more focused on
[how to] make a persuasive presentation...Early on in the instruction the deliverables are
quite modest and quite focused. They’re based on cases, based on problems, based on
things in the news, based on stylized client work, creating process type deliverables from
problem statements and issue trees and work plans and storyboards up through a final
presentation deck. (MBA3 Professor)
The faculty member at another program described the final output of these projects at his school
as a 20-page report that included details on their work process and approach:
We have between four and six students on a project. This is all they’re doing that term.
And so, if you get four to six people working 50 hours a week; that is a fair bit of person
power there. The work can be amazingly good. We ask the students to present a deck to
the sponsor and to write up a formal report. The report is about 20 pages of text (with as
many appendices as they like); it is akin to a dissertation. By that I mean that we ask
them to “think in slow motion.” They lay out the entire context, the problem or
opportunity statement, the options that are available to them, the criteria to select from
among and between the options, their decision, and their implementation considerations.
(MBA5 Professor)
All programs emphasized that the project deliverables were the result of analysis and

74

work by the team over time. One professor described this process:
The students work in groups of five over 20 weeks and they have to literally go from an
overall objective from the client for the project to actually defining the scope of the
project, setting up a project plan, and then creating milestones along that project plan and
key deliverables, and then in the end presenting their final recommendations to the client
in front of a set of judges as well that are industry experts. And so have the confidence to
be able to stand by and actually represent their recommendations. (MBA4 Professor)
At another program in which the typical final deliverable was a 25-35 minute PowerPoint
presentation to the host, the professor said that deliverables could vary depending on the project
focus. He cited examples of one team creating a “pitch book” for a real estate project in Costa
Rica and another that created a spreadsheet tool that included all the factors a company must
consider for an international expansion (MBA6 Professor). At this same program, the professor
incorporated a mid-point review of FBL projects with their sponsor to guarantee that the student
team was on track:
So, as part of a contract letter, we have what we call this mid-project review, which is
after about maybe five to six weeks we’ve been working on the project. And we’ll go
back with the host, and it’s more like a road map. You know, this is what we’re going to
do, this is why we’re doing it. And, it’s the host’s final chance to say OK, or not.
Generally, the host will say “fine,”... [If not] I will accommodate some, yeah... I mean,
half of it is, you have to persuade the host that this is what they want. (MBA6 Professor)
Instruction. All the schools spoke about how FBL projects give students the opportunity
to apply the skills they had learned in business school to real business situations. One faculty
respondent said that this instruction challenged students to dig deeper into different cognitive
abilities. The professor said, "….It’s a different type of learning; it’s a different type of cognitive
processing, and so forth. And some students just aren’t very good at it. So, I think they are
picking up these new skills” (MBA6 Professor). Building on this idea, another faculty
respondent concluded that FBL provided an opportunity for students to become more fully
engaged in their learning than they had been before:

75

Take a broad look at the nature of education over the last couple of decades. You will see
that students are no longer passive vessels sitting in a classroom waiting to have someone
crack open their skulls, pour in knowledge, piece their skulls back together, and give
them an Op-Scanned test to test for recall. Those days are gone. And I think they’re gone
because such education does not prepare students to live and lead in a complex and
dynamic world. Students need practical wisdom. The only way to get it is to be fully
engaged and involved in their own education. (MBA5 Professor)
When discussing an FBL project where he recommended the students use the financial
modeling software called Crystal Ball, one faculty member suggested that this sort of hands-on
learning provided unique opportunities to connect classroom teaching to business practice:
It’s weird, like, they don’t know how to use these models. I’ll talk about Monte Carlo
simulation, right? And they have to, you know, and they do Crystal Ball [software] in
Operations [Operations course]. But, they’ve never used it, and then you say, “well, you
know, why don’t we do some-- Crystal Ball,” and they say, “oh, yeah, Crystal Ball, oh,
yeah, we can use Crystal Ball for that, yeah. Let’s do that.” It’s like [on their own] they
don’t make the connection. (MBA6 Professor)
Despite the varied projects from sponsors, many discussed the need to maintain
consistency in the FBL course instruction and support. One faculty lead said he dealt with this
issue by requiring the faculty team advisors meet to:
….have lunch every week during the spring term.... [to] without too heavy a hand, to
keep them running the course in a similar way because our students are very sensitive to
differences in that way. If one advisor forces a meeting every week and no one else does
then we’ll get complaints about that. So it’s not only managing student feelings but it’s
quality control. (MBA2 Professor)
At MBA6, the professor approached this in a completely different way by making the entire
experience unique for each student team.
Guidance, coaching, and facilitation. The professors had very particular ideas about the
type of facilitator support roles that needed to be involved with FBL. As one said, “….We ask
them [students] to slow down and articulate what they’re doing at every step of the way, with
very informed people standing at the ready to listen and help as they can” (MBA5 Professor). In
one program, all the teams had a non-tenured faculty advisor. The faculty lead there stressed that
76

a more important quality of an advisor was their willingness to follow a shared model on how
they worked with student teams.
Every team has a faculty advisor coach and that’s a staff of nine that that’s really my
primary job is managing those people…None of them are tenured faculty other than me.
Or tenure track or any of that. They’re mostly [just] very experienced people. Then you
have them with some consulting backgrounds. …And they want to work with students
and they want to work under me and they don’t give me, they’re not such egotists that
they won’t pretty much do the course the way we all do it. (MBA2 Professor)
In terms of input from project sponsors, MBA4 had weekly team meetings with the
faculty advisor and the client. The faculty advisor also regularly checked in with the client
separately to make sure the student work was on track. In this program, there was typically one
faculty advisor for one to four teams. There were 18-20 advisors, with a third tenured or tenure
track faculty and two-thirds who were lecturers at the business school with senior level business
experience, and who “….could be an ex-partner for McKinsey or they could be an ex-CEO for
some company” (MBA4 Professor). The faculty respondent at MBA5 described extensive
support for student teams as part of the FBL course at his school:
The faculty are more like coaches than they are players. We are “of the team” but not “on
the team.” We give our students our best advice and counsel but we are not there in the
trenches with them every single day. Of course, there are times when we do not have an
answer. The good news is that we know people all over the world who might help.
Faculty are not shy about tapping into their networks for advice and counsel about some
idiosyncratic issue. (MBA5 Professor)
The sentiments of some respondents were reflected in this comment about the facilitation
of FBL student teams. It “…works really well where the team knows how to deal with their
conflicts, the company is available and gives them the information they need to do their job,
faculty set it up in such a way that it’s clear what their objectives are” (MBA5 Career).
However, providing the right amount of coaching support could be a challenge as one faculty
respondent acknowledged:

77

There’s always this balance in courses like this, between being so involved that you do it
for them and being so uninvolved that they do it, but they don’t learn anything. So
somehow each advisor has to figure out, are they [student team] getting that they have to
do interviews? Do they get that they don’t know anything about the interviews, do they
know that there [are] resources here that they absolutely must use? And if the answer’s
yes to all that, fine. But if it isn't’, then we push. (MBA2 Professor)
Regularly checking in with teams to make sure the students were on track with their FBL
project work was something all programs emphasized. One professor reported that, “….I meet
with them weekly, because they’ll wait until the last minute, right? And, so you’re trying to, you
know, sort of shove that process along” (MBA6 Professor). The programs found that despite
their best efforts, finding the “right” level of support and guidance for this teamwork was a
continuing struggle. As one librarian said, “….Sometimes teams don’t get along with their
faculty coaches, sometimes they don’t get along with their librarians, and we’ll try to make
combinations as best as we can. The goal is that everyone gets what they need during the
process” (MBA5 Librarian).
To support these projects, some schools (MBA1, MBA4, and MBA5) provided a
resource repository of past projects:
We have a place at [business school name] where there are samples of very successful
past projects in different areas. There are guidelines; there are video lectures on a whole
variety of topics that students can just listen to at their leisure online. So that all exists as
well, which again are just more resources to sort of increase the likelihood of success
reaching these teams. (MBA4 Professor)
In discussing coaching support for students, a number of respondents mentioned the issue of how
FBL gives students the opportunity to practice making good use of the expertise available to help
with project work. This offered a means for students to develop a deeper understanding of the
broader collaborative nature of effective project work and the importance of not approaching
such work with a narrow limited mindset. One faculty lead reported that “….I stress that

78

learning to work with experts is part of what this course is about… It’s access to expertise”
(MBA2 Professor).
4.2.3 Summary of Research Question 2
Two themes emerged in this research about the organizational structure of FBL: who was
in charge and responsible for various aspects of these courses and how much structure the course
included in order to satisfy its objectives. There were issues with the roles of tenured or tenure
track faculty, adjunct faculty, and non-academic staff in course leadership and administrator
roles. In some programs, the courses were part of a more open organizational structure that was
focused exclusively on team meetings with faculty or other advisors; others included required or
optional training classes as part of the course curriculum. The FBL courses with more structure
generally drew from the “consulting model.”
4.3 Field-based Learning (FBL) – Outcomes
Research Question 3: What are the perceptions of the outcomes of this learning on MBA
students in general and in particular in terms of the quality of students' research and
information gathering for these projects?
This section reviews the perceived outcomes achieved in FBL courses. This includes the
general characteristics of the learning outcomes and the specific details. These include outcomes
that could be quantitatively measured and others that did not lend themselves to such a defined
evaluation. This section also reviews specific outcomes discussed by respondents in the area of
improvements in students’ research and information gathering abilities.
4.3.1 Experiential Field-based Learning Outcomes – General Characteristics
In examining the perceptions of the general benefits and learning outcomes from FBL
courses, the respondents stressed that this type of learning could not be quantitatively measured
and should not be. They felt the takeaways were too nuanced:

79

We live in a world where measurement matters. Certainly, some folks would like us to
run some kind of regression where action-based learning would sit next to all manner of
other predictors of some educational outcome. A large and significant beta coefficient
would somehow prove that action-based learning “matters.” Of course, those with
practical wisdom know that such an analysis will never capture the benefit of practical
wisdom. Einstein was the one who reportedly said, ‘Not everything that counts can
be counted, and not everything that can be counted counts.’ We need to be wary of such a
measurement regime. (MBA5 Professor)
Even without quantitative measures, the respondents were quite passionate about how valuable
they felt this learning was for students. One professor said,
Every intuition I have tells me that we really do need to take our students… into a
complicated and changing world where people are working on complex problems and
opportunities that really matter... The idea is hone their judgment and decision making
capabilities by doing this kind of mindful work. (MBA5 Professor)
They felt this learning had a real impact on students:
I mean not really if you’re talking about students who directly attribute that to their
success. No, probably not. But is it a growth experience? Yes. Is a growth experience
of any kind going to translate into your professional life? Probably. I mean you can
learn something from it... I wish I could say it is the reason or a real deciding factor for
companies to come to [business school name], but I don’t think that’s the case. I think
it’s attractive to students and I think it’s a selling point for students. And I think it’s a
learning experience that they’re not going to get in that form anywhere else in their life or
in their professional career. (MBA2 Career2)
A faculty lead at another program added that these projects with real business people
offered ways for students to develop their professional network. He pointed this out in
describing how potentially consequential the outcomes could be of these FBL projects. He said,
“….Because until you have to apply what you’ve learned in a course on a real problem that has
real consequences if you screw it up, other than just a grade consequence -- because these are
prospective employers. These are nodes on your future network” (MBA4 Professor).
Another aspect that made it difficult to evaluate its impact was the level of novelty for
many students. The learning curve for some students could be quite steep. As one professor
commented, “….The other thing that makes it difficult to assess is because there’s a great deal of
80

variability. There are some students who get it early on, immediately, and others I think for
whom it will take time and that would include for some never. So there’s an awful lot of
variability” (MBA3 Professor). In addition, the projects could vary considerably. This variation
could also complicate a satisfactory standard process for evaluating what students learned. The
professor said:
The degree of difficulty varies dramatically across these projects. Sometimes the students
are handed a very well-structured problem or opportunity with a ton of support from the
company. I have been stunned by the support our students sometimes receive. Bring a
team of six super-smart and super-motivated students to a project like that and well, the
results can be stupendous. But sometimes (and thankfully, not often) you may see a fourperson team try to run through administrative quicksand to get the work done. Nothing is
worse than a loosely structured problem offered by an anxious but noncompliant
company. The end result may not compare to the former project but then again, the latter
group of students may have done a yeoman’s job. We are very alert to that kind of
situation. (MBA5 Professor)
At MBA3, which had a more structured approach in its FBL course with frameworks to
follow and techniques for student teams to use, the faculty lead admitted that there had been
“mixed success” in terms of student outcomes:
Some completely get it and become quite expert in it. Others really still try to take the
path of least resistance and to be honest part of it’s a question of capacity, they don’t
quite get it, but often it’s the cold calculus of too much work to do across all their courses
and too little time and they’re looking for ways to shortcut and sometimes these research
projects are the victims of that… We’ve got processes to help them and …we get mixed
results. Despite our best efforts, I must say. (MBA3 Professor)
Other sorts of valuable but difficult to grade learning outcomes that could be
accomplished with these projects included developing skills in working with teams and working
effectively with clients and different cultures. As an example, one lead faculty member
described the work from students on a project in Armenia he had witnessed:
In four days there, they did 39 interviews... They just had an amazing experience
parachuting into a culture they knew nothing about and trying to help out and trying to
listen to people and figure out an answer for the client. So does that have an influence?
Yeah. That’s going to have a big influence. Not very academic... but it’s good stuff.
81

(MBA2 Professor).
Another respondent summarized some additional skills students had developed. He suggested
that, “….This form of experiential learning takes even the case study form up to a different
notch… in terms of developing leadership capabilities in the students, in developing real sort of
capabilities in time management, project management, analytics” (MBA4 Professor).
4.3.2 What Could be Measured
Grading. One quantitative measure used to evaluate outcomes was the grade each
student received for their work in these courses. Primary among them was the grade received for
their final project deliverable. There were issues around evaluating this project work because
there were numerous facilitator roles. Evaluating this type of learning was challenging because
choices needed to be made about what was evaluated, how it was evaluated, and how the FBL
course would be integrated into the grading systems used with the more typical MBA courses.
One professor suggested that this evaluation problem could be the reason some institutions had
stopped offering this type of learning. As the professor said, “….The assessment part is, you
know, all business schools are under this kind of pressure to assess. Well, that’s hard enough to
assess a statistics course. It’s really hard to assess a course like this, but we should be working
on that…I think there’s more we can do” (MBA2 Professor).
Another consideration was the need to determine how much input from the support roles
could be factored into the final grade. The MBA3 program made an effort to include insights
from other support roles, including librarians, into each team’s final evaluation and grade.
However, in other programs, input on that grade and final grading came only from the student
team’s faculty advisor. In terms of grading presentations, one faculty member stated that he
focused on “quality of argument. That’s what I grade presentations on” (MBA2 Professor). At

82

MBA4, the team’s work was graded by the faculty advisor. Evaluation was based on peer
assessment, quality and quantity of research, teamwork, and whether recommendations added
value to the client. At another program, where only the two advising faculty for each student
team were responsible for the grading, the respondent discussed the challenges of grading work
by teams with the proportional system of grading typical of MBA programs. One professor said:
Grading is difficult. Two faculty members will grade each student team. I mentioned that
25% of our students can receive an “excellent” grade. But what happens when one
faculty member is working with eight teams and another is working with two? Obviously,
the first person can give two “excellents,” but the second can only give one half of one.
Suffice it to say that we are aware of this problem and that we have ways to solve it.
(MBA5 Professor)
In some programs, only the content of the final presentation to the sponsor, not the team
process of working on it, was graded. This was not the case at other programs (MBA2, MBA3,
and MBA4). The professor interviewed at MBA5 said they did not grade the student work on
process because they felt such grading would distract the students from focusing on the quality
of the final deliverable. The professor said:
We pay far more attention to the content of the work than we do the process involved in
producing it. That is to say that we know the students will struggle from time to time. We
do not want them to worry about managing us when they are having a hard time
managing themselves. I should also say that we have all kinds of “process help” available
to them. (MBA5 Professor)
The team process of working on these projects and the final deliverable were both graded in
other programs, as described by one professor:
The faculty advisor actually gives them the grade, their final grade, and it has a whole
load of components to it. They get evaluated on how their peers evaluate each of them on
the team, they get evaluated on their actual research quality and quantity, so primary
research and secondary research, they get evaluated as to the effectiveness of their team,
and then they get evaluated as to whether the project actually added value to the client.
(MBA4 Professor)
In another program, the professor met with all the teams in the course and evaluated all of

83

their work for the final grade. He focused more on “team effort” from his and the peer
evaluations submitted by the team members:
I do the evaluation of the work…. So, we grade more on effort, and we give a team grade,
so the team gets a grade. But, then the team members have peer evaluations on each
other and someone’s grade can either go up or down, based on the peer evaluation, and
generally, the grades go down, because, you know, someone’s not been pulling their
weight. (MBA6 Professor)
In MBA3, the grade incorporated evaluation of the process as well as the interim and final
deliverables. This grade also factored in evaluations from the different team advisors and other
roles, as one professor reported:
The work is evaluated in numerous ways …In the classroom phase it tends to be -- the
faculty member and TAs who have taken the course before using rubrics to try to
evaluate the progress along the way. At the end when they’re making presentations
depending on the setting it’s some combination of a faculty teaching team, which broadly
includes not just the professor but also sometimes program directors, program staff, and
also staff from the library. It includes TAs, sometimes includes alumni, and it often
includes clients themselves. And so depending on the situation there can be a very robust
panel who have a rubric that they use to look at the presentation, not just the delivery but
the content on the page, the analysis behind it and so forth, in order to provide
developmental and evaluative feedback. (MBA3 Professor)
Career-related outcomes. The respondents believed that what students learn from FBL
courses made them more attractive to recruiters and helped them in attaining their career goals
when they graduated. One advisor said, “…..I think any sort of practical hands-on experience
with problem solving, with working with information, with sort of delving through and finding
what the core issue is, is helpful for their internship and their future jobs and their career”
(MBA3 Career). However, this same career services professional stated, in terms of the potential
career outcomes of FBL that “….there’s no way to sort of measure that. At least from our
perspective. Is that what is causing students to succeed in their internship or in their full-time
position? We like to think that that’s one of the reasons why the school is doing better from an
outcomes perspective. It’s difficult …to draw the direct absolute correlation” (MBA3 Career).
84

Another respondent had observed that sponsors for projects at his school had used them as a way
to become more familiar with potential hires. He said that, “….So, some firms use us for hiring,
right, because they get to see students up close, the students get to know them. And, so, they do
hiring through a [FBL course name], it’s, you know, relatively cheap for them” (MBA6
Professor).
Students may come into MBA programs because they are looking to change or switch
their career path. One respondent identified how helpful these projects could be for these “career
switchers to explore and get experience in different areas” (MBA6 Career). One program
routinely surveyed their alumni to obtain feedback on the impact of this learning on their careers,
and the responses have generally been favorable:
We survey our alumni and asked them to reflect on their education. The [FBL course
name] testimony is very favorable. But of course, working with the [FBL course name]
program for 25 years now, we have no control group. That is, our students do not know
what it is like to have an MBA education without [FBL course name]. They only know
what they know. Still, all signs suggest that [FBL course name] is an important and
essential part of their educational experience. (MBA5 Professor)
Another tangible outcome was how the work of FBL courses with project sponsor
organizations gave the development office at one respondent’s school an opportunity to promote
the school in a different way. The professor there commented, “….Generally, when you’re a
partner here… You get this tangible product. In three months, you get this full report, -- so, you
know, you can use it. So, development has sort of used us to interest people in the [business
school name] school. And, so, we’re used that way by them. (MBA6 Professor)
4.3.3 What Could not be Measured
Perceived outcomes. Beyond grades, there were a number of loosely measurable
outcomes from FBL. The learning process made students more attractive to recruiters and
helped them get jobs. The outreach that took place working with project sponsors also provided
85

an opportunity to promote the school in a different way. Beyond these effects, the interviews
clearly indicated that while the respondents felt that the outcomes from FBL project courses for
most students was quite positive, they admitted that there was no definitive way to measure the
impact. A number of respondents referenced the longevity of their programs, positive student
feedback, and the fact that the sponsor organizations kept returning for more work with students
as evidence that what they did had a positive outcome. As one professor said:
Can I quantify that our students are somehow wiser and more prudent for the experience?
It’s hard to say. I’d say probably not. We could try. But the fact is that students,
companies and nonprofits keep coming back, other schools are now copying us, and we
celebrate this as a signature aspect of our program. All of that says that we are doing
something right. Look at the numbers: 9,588 students have completed 1,845 projects in
1,292 organizations in 93 countries. Maybe that says it all. (MBA5 Professor)
Student course feedback was another means of assessing learning outcomes. One of the
problems with this mode of evaluation was that the feedback was collected from students
immediately after they completed the course. A faculty respondent at MBA5 suggested that this
feedback would be more valuable if it was focused on how they had applied what they learned in
FBL in their internship or job after they graduated:
The feedback we get anecdotally from students, particularly after they’ve been through
an internship and have gotten into a full-time job, has been good. And in fact, that seems
to be where the light bulb starts to really turn on brightly where it makes sense to them.
As they’re doing it, they’re not quite sure…it’s unlike anything that they’ve seen in their
previous education. They compare notes with people at other schools and they tend to
not find anything quite like this, they tend to trust us, but it’s when they go to their
internship …and they find themselves getting called out for superior work or something
that’s different and better than some of their peers from other schools. When they get the
[job] offer, when they …start developing some of the new people that come in behind
them [in the MBA program], there’s just some anecdotal evidence that they start to really
see oh, this whole [FBL course name] portfolio is very powerful stuff and it’s different
and it’s better and it helps distinguish me from these others. (MBA3 Professor)
This aspect of students not realizing the long-term relevance of FBL during the course
was mentioned by a career services professional:

86

I think a lot of students initially will look at [FBL course name] and go like oh, this is a
really long task and I’m not necessarily, I don’t want to go into consulting so I don’t see
why this is relevant. But at the end of the day, after going through it and recognizing that
many of the projects that they’ll be working on in their work and many of the chores that
they have will require a lot of the same skills… end up paying dividends in their career. I
can definitely speak to that as a student. It definitely helped me prepare for my career.
(MBA4 Career)
Another respondent pointed to the judgment of the many professionals involved in supporting
this learning who see its merits despite the absence of quantifiable “return on investment”
measures:
[In terms of] ASCSB requirements and all this outcome based assessment and everything
else, there’s a sense that it would be nice to be able to tell your story and there is an
investment here … [based on] the judgment of professionals that suggest that this
matters. But on the other hand, if you’ve got the judgment of a building full of
professionals that spend their whole life thinking about educating MBA students and they
all seem to think this is a good idea, you might want to honor that as well. Despite what
they say about “group think” and everything else. (MBA5 Professor)
Reflection. Two of the programs had recently been working with reflective exercises as
an outcome tool for students to assess their learning. In both programs, this was a relatively new
initiative. At MBA5, reflection had become a major initiative for the school’s leadership
institute that included the entire curriculum, not just FBL:
Now we’re going to require you to reflect on that experience in these different
ways…What did you learn, what did you do well, what would you do differently,
etc.. So that’s something that [business school name] is starting to do, because that is
how leaders develop and grow - by reflecting and learning from their experiences. I think
it will be required four times a year, where every time a student has a major experience
like [FBL course name], or doing their internship, or team project, they will be asked
to reflect on it, and think about it, and learn from it, and then be intentional about what
they want to do different going forward. (MBA5 Career)
The faculty member from MBA2 said his program did reflection work with FBL as an
additional team paper of five pages as well as a personal one page debrief from each team
member. In describing this assignment, he asked the students to reflect on “Why did you choose
the project? Why’d you choose the team? What were your goals? What did you expect to have
87

happen?” (MBA2 Professor). He then added that the school had a required course in teamwork
skills, so “….we try at the beginning to get them to think back to the teamwork course and to
formulate specific objectives around their teamwork skills… we’re always looking for ways in
the projects to draw on what they’ve been taught in other courses” (MBA2 Professor). He
reported that after the MBA students completed these papers, each faculty advisor met with their
team for an in-person review. The professor stated that:
The point of it is, really to try to get them to realize that to a large extent the experience
they had was determined by the effort they put in, the goals they formulated... And each
faculty advisor does it with his teams. And that report and that just goes into kind of an
overall participation grade. So we grade them on -- how they perform in team meetings,
how they perform in the presentation. That’s all participation grade (MBA2 Professor).
The programs admitted the challenges they had faced in adding reflective activities to
their pedagogy. At one program, the professor interviewed the students but did not include
reflection work because he thought the students just saw it as busy work. One other professor
who thought reflective work was beneficial said that a major challenge was the timing after
students had completed their projects, which was at the end of the school year:
Students have just worked their guts out for seven weeks. Wanting to put their experience
behind them for a while, attend their friends’ graduation parties, and get ready to move
away for the summer, well, it is just a difficult time to sit back and reflect. We have tried
a number of things and truth be told, none of them seem to work all that well. We
continue to look at this. (MBA5 Professor)
Comparable frustrations were shared by the other faculty members who said, “….The reflection
part is, it’s a great idea and all three [FBL] courses use it, but nobody’s got any real
understanding of well, how you operationalize it” (MBA2 Professor).
At MBA5, reflective exercises were not only advocated for students but they had also
taken the process of self-evaluation of the FBL program overall quite seriously over the years:
We have a standing [FBL course name] committee that reviews projects and works to
ensure the integrity of our program. On top of that, it seems like every few years, we put
88

together a task force to take stock of the program. We are always trying to improve it
(MBA5 Professor).
This same program had an annual FBL instructional debriefing as a way to share stories and
build programmatic goodwill:
It’s fun to go to our end of the year meeting. Everybody comes to the table to say “Okay,
what went well and what went not so well this year?” We ask ourselves how we can do
our work better. It is fun because the entire team is made visible...our communications
faculty, our research staff, librarians, the head of our coaching group, and more. There’s
respect and good will all around. It is nice to see that so many people care. (MBA5
Professor)
This program valued programmatic self-evaluation and had a Chief Learning Officer who
assumed responsibility for this function. No other program included such a role:
We also have an adjunct faculty colleague (a woman with a PhD in education), who for
the past few years has served as our in-house learning officer. She moves among and
between the teams to capture the nature of all the informal work and the implicit learning.
So she’s been paying attention to what we do; she has been trying to codify lessons
learned and carry them back to the faculty. (MBA5 Professor)
4.3.4 Experiential Field-based Learning Outcomes – Information Related Aspects
The respondents indicated that the student research varied in quality. They could not
define any factors that influenced this quality other than the assumption that the teams that were
more focused and worked well together tended to do better information gathering and had better
deliverables. In only one program did the librarians play a role in formally evaluating the
research component of each team’s work. In two other programs, students evaluated the
librarians’ support of FBL project work, although the librarians did not evaluate students. In
discussing the typical quality of the research done on these projects, one respondent stated the
following:
It’s quite varied both in type and in quality.… What we like, the best work is stuff that’s
really very focused where the work stream, the research stream, can be tied directly to
necessary answers to necessary questions and where they’ve thought carefully and deeply
about all the possible sources of information and the quality of information and so forth,
89

where it’s a discovery process as opposed to backing into an answer or an advocacy type
of a process. So in that regard the typical quality starts out poor and gets better.
Sometimes it’s pretty good, sometimes it remains not great, to be honest. It’s a very
challenging -- the whole process is very challenging to them. (MBA3 Professor)
Business librarians at this school evaluated the research and information gathering components
of student team presentations. This evaluation was then factored into each team’s final course
grade:
The specific evaluation form that we use is based on one of the briefs that we created
called The Five Dimensions of Business Intelligence. And that, specifically, speaks to the
hat that we wear which is looking at their deck, looking at the presentation, listening to
the Q and A and getting a sense of, you know, how -- did they use good resources? Did
they do good research? Did they really push themselves and challenge themselves and
the resources? So that’s the hat we wear when we judge. And then we would summarize
our observations for each team and share that with the faculty and they will use that as
part of their decision-making process on grading the teams. (MBA3 Librarian)
At another school, librarians sent surveys to students which asked if the student’s
experience with their team’s FBL project librarian was positive or negative; however the survey
did not ask how that experience changed their capabilities. One librarian said that, “….We don’t
have a strong feedback loop on that …, which I think is unfortunate” (MBA2 Librarians). At
another school, the librarians were part of surveys about the students’ experiences with their FBL
course. One librarian said, “….We are evaluated, as are the communication consultants, and the
faculty on their [students] overall experience with the [FBL course name] office” (MBA5
Librarian). This librarian added that, “…We get really great feedback from the faculty and the
students about our participation” (MBA5 Librarian).
In discussing information related outcomes, one professor emphasized how challenging it
could be for students to effectively incorporate the research they had done on these FBL projects:
Part of the real learning experience is for them to put structure into something that’s
really unstructured. That’s really hard. It’s very hard to do that. And then to build a
story once you get to a logical plan and you do your due diligence and all of your
research and come up with some recommendations based on real data, then converting all
90

of that into a real story that is telling and persuasive to someone, it’s a real art. There’s a
blending of an art and science here that makes it such a valuable experience. (MBA4
Professor)
One faculty member discussed how difficult it was to determine:
….what particularly about research skills they do better. We do see improvements intra
program where they do tend to get a little better, but we also see evidence of when given
an opportunity to do it however they want when they’re not being evaluated on it, so
many of them do tend to fall back into old habits very quickly. So you know, it’s tough.
It’s a very difficult one to measure and assess. (MBA3 Professor)
Another respondent discussed how challenging it was to make graduates discerning consumers
of information when they did research. As one librarian said,
We’re building students who appreciate and understand the complexity of the
information landscape, and I think that’s a more -- I think at the end of the day, that’s a
more powerful graduate, who will then be able to hopefully make better decisions by
understanding that [if] they’re looking at a single report on the Thai food industry,...OK,
that’s one opinion. How do we figure out something else, as opposed to someone who
says, ‘Well, it’s in a pretty report, so therefore it must be 100% valid.’ So, that’s been,
for me at least, that’s been a really big issue. (MBA5 Librarian)
On this same theme, another librarian from another program talked about the success her
program had in helping students “connect the dots” in terms of project work and the research
they did, while admitting that there still was work to be done:
I think, as [FBL course name] has gotten more formalized over the past two to two and a
half years, we’ve seen more of those dots being connected …if you ask any of the
business librarians, I think they might say that perhaps, in the past … six months to a
year, they’re seeing more of the light bulbs going off with the students. Still a lot of work
to be done but I think we’re in a really, really good place in terms of starting to figure out
-- actually, I think we’re almost a little bit beyond figuring out what’s needed and now
figuring out how do we message it and integrate it in the other learning experiences so
that it’s not a one off experience. But that they’re continuously taking …all the toolkits
that they learn … and using those over and over and over again in their classes and their
preparation for internships and jobs so that…they develop the habits that are important.
(MBA3 Librarian)

4.3.5 Summary of Research Question 3
There were many challenges in assessing the outcomes in the different FBL courses.
Student work was evaluated in a number of ways, with some programs focusing on formal
evaluation of final deliverables, while others also evaluated the process of students working on
the project and some interim work deliverables. All respondents said that the FBL projects gave
students the opportunity to practice the type of information gathering they would need to do in
the real world. Self–reflective work was seen as a powerful means for students to determine
their own achievements but no program had yet uncovered a single effective evaluation method
that worked for all students.

Chapter 5
Roles Supporting Field-Based Learning (FBL)
Research Question 4: What are the roles and jurisdictional claim of those involved in the
provision of this learning?
This chapter reviews the different roles that support FBL project courses. The roles
include the school administrative leadership represented by the business school dean, FBL
administrator roles, faculty, team advisors, project sponsors, career services professionals,
student peer advisors, information technology staff, alumni, and business librarians. Within the
organizational mix of those who support FBL at the top 20 full-time MBA programs, this
research focused with particular detail on the business librarians at these schools.
This chapter describes and analyzes the roles that work with FBL project courses. This
includes analyses of the interaction between different roles, and the various forms of the business
librarian role that supports FBL. The final section of this chapter includes a social network
analysis of the roles involved in FBL project courses at the six programs that served as cases for
this research.
5.1 Descriptions of Roles
The delivery of FBL project courses involved administrator roles that secured projects
from sponsor companies or organizations, and managed logistics and the financial management
of the course expenses. There were also pedagogically focused roles that involved designing the
curriculum and supporting student learning throughout the instructional process. As an example,
one respondent provided an extensive list of all the individuals who supported the FBL course at
his school:
Take a look at our ecology of learning here. It is quite something. In addition to the
team’s two dedicated faculty members, the students have a communication faculty
member by their side, a full-time research scientist at the ready to help with
methodological and statistical questions, a personal reference librarian, and an MBA 2
93

coach (a trained second-year MBA student to help them with group process challenges).
And of course, they have the entire [FBL course name] back office available to help with
their travel, reimbursement, health, and issues of all kinds. It is pretty amazing. I know
that pride cometh before the fall but even still, I am proud of what we do. (MBA5
Professor)
5.1.1 School Administrative Leadership
In all six case studies, the business school dean was the individual with overall
responsibility for administration of the school’s programming and curriculum. According to
Thomas, Lorange, and Sheth (2013), business schools are always led by a dean who “must learn
to champion both the academic values of the university and the professional values of their
external management constituency” (p. 202). Deans not only serve as a school’s leader but also
as the school’s chief ambassador to the outside world, chief fund raiser, and leader who is
devoted to “enhancing the school’s intellectual capital base” (Hay, 2013, p. 84) through strategic
support and development of its scholarship, teaching, and thought leadership. The interview
data revealed different organizational structures under the dean that administer the work of the
school, including its FBL curriculum. Schools that offered different types of MBA degrees, also
had staff that reported to the dean.
5.1.2 FBL Administrator Roles
In three of the four programs in which FBL courses were required, there was a separate
administrative infrastructure to support FBL courses. One school (MBA2) had one required FBL
course and two elective FBL opportunities, with each having an administrator in charge with
staff who assisted with this work. In cases in which the program charged fees for such projects,
the FBL administrators managed the collection of the fees. In the course that did not have a
separate infrastructure where the FBL course was required, the lead faculty member, an associate
dean, held both the administrator and curriculum design roles. This program was smaller and

94

newer than the other programs. While this school did not have a specific FBL administrative
department, other administrative areas of the school were involved with various aspects of this
course. The faculty respondent at this program shared that positions like chief financial officer
(CFO) and vice dean for faculty had interests in the non-curricular administration of FBL. This
was also the case in the other programs:
Our CFO has an interest in this because there are monetary implications. Our vice deans
have an interest and involvement in this because the vice dean over programs wants to
make sure we have coherent programs to make sure that these things work and are an
effective part across all our programs. They need to be staffed and so the vice dean for
faculty has an interest. She has to make sure that we’ve got the right kinds of resources
and staffing from a faculty perspective and so on and so forth. And of course the
program offices themselves. (MBA3 Professor)
At MBA6, in which the main FBL course was an elective, one individual held the
administrator role. The lead faculty member at this program, who was responsible for
curriculum design, met with all the teams in the fall and spring offering of the course. He also
was involved in identifying project sponsors for the course. His colleague was in charge of
administration, and was involved in securing projects, managing the finances and any logistical
issues for the teams such as travel and arranging the weekly meetings of the professor with
student teams. Since this program had no classroom learning, all instruction took place in
weekly team meetings with the professor. In the other school where this type of instruction took
place only as an elective in specially designated FBL classes, curricular design was led by the
faculty member teaching the course. However, it was clear that this type of learning was very
important to that school’s dean, emphasized by the fact that a new role in the Dean’s office had
recently been established to identify contacts for the school and especially those interested in
sponsoring FBL projects. The title of this new position was Director of Strategic Curricular
Networks and Partnerships (MBA1).

95

One respondent shared that the associate dean responsible for managing the full-time
MBA program was a strong advocate for the FBL course. He felt that this type of learning could
teach students skills in effective information gathering and research that would be a challenge to
acquire effectively with typical instruction. The professor said,
In the full-time MBA program the current associate dean for MBA programs is
particularly interested in what he would frame as business intelligence and what we think
about as the research component, the good questions and good answers component of it,
and he’s made it part of his own mission to support that. He really wants to see it happen
in the students because from his own experience and practice that is really key. (MBA3
Professor).
5.1.3 Faculty
Faculty often report to their disciplinary department chair who reports to the dean’s
office. Interviews confirmed that this reporting arrangement was quite unstructured in some
schools. One of the professors commented that before taking over the faculty leadership of his
school’s FBL program:
I guess I reported to the associate dean for MBA curriculum, but we have a tradition of
extreme autonomy, almost complete autonomy and the associate deans are busy, mostly
with students over other things, you know. So if you ask me, who do I report to, I think I
would have said, No one really, I certainly felt no one. (MBA2 Professor)
In addition to tenured and tenure track faculty, these MBA programs had management
practitioners who did not have doctoral degrees and who served as professors of practice in the
roles of adjuncts or lecturers.
In all programs, a faculty member served as both a key designer of the FBL course as
well as a teacher. This often also included managing the group of faculty members that was
directly advising each team. One faculty lead described how important he felt it was to design
these courses clearly so that students would receive focused, constructive guidance. He said,
“….That’s a lot of our role, it’s just being devil’s advocate, just requiring them to challenging

96

[sic] assumptions and requirement to put together a really tight, logical presentation, into which
information of various sorts contributes” (MBA2 Professor). In this program, every team had a
faculty coach and there were nine faculty coaches who were called advisors. Some advisors had
only one team and others had more. The faculty lead supervised five teams.
One of the career professionals was unusual because he was also a faculty advisor for
FBL projects. He had been a faculty advisor for only one team at a time. The faculty advisors
in this program were all adjunct faculty except for the faculty member who lead the program. In
another program, the required FBL component for full-time MBA students included a required
core class in the fall semester with guidance on the consulting and problem solving process that
students applied to a simulated project. In the spring semester, the students chose among five
FBL course electives in which teams worked on real projects with a company or organization.
The faculty lead for each of these courses had considerable autonomy in the course design. As
the professor said, “….They’re really their courses and they’re free, as any faculty member
would be, to do most anything they want in their courses, provided that it sticks within the
approved definition of what a field course looks like” (MBA3 Professor).
At MBA5, each team had two full-time faculty members who advised each project, with
one entitled the “travelling advisor” and the other the “non-travelling advisor.” The travelling
advisor was the liaison with the sponsoring organization. Both faculty advisors were on a tenure
track, although one typically had more experience with the school’s FBL required course:

“We

almost always pair a new faculty member with an experienced one. We try not to take two
complete greenhorns and put them together with students in an organization” (MBA5 Professor).
The teaching load credits for working with these FBL courses increased by the number of teams

97

being advised, with a typical amount of eight projects per faculty member. These faculty
members graded the teams’ final project deliverable.
At MBA4, there were weekly team meetings with the client and faculty advisor. The
faculty advisor also spoke to the client on a regular basis to assure that the student work was
progressing. Typically, there was one faculty advisor for one to four teams. Of the 18 to 20
advisors, a third were tenured or tenure track faculty and the others were lecturers with extensive
business experience.
5.1.4 Team Advisors
The FBL project learning provided students with an important opportunity to develop an
understanding of the effective use of specialized knowledge expertise. The programs included
an assigned team faculty advisor and additional optional advisors with special expertise.
Typically, these advisors came from outside the school and from diverse work backgrounds.
One faculty lead commented that “….I stress that learning to work with experts is part of what
this course is about” (MBA2 Professor). This same respondent who described the various
advisory roles available in his program highlighted this diversity of support:
The resources that we make available to the students include not just the librarians, but a
professor who is a marketing professor who’s an expert in survey design. One of our
faculty advisors, who’s an adjunct professor who’s an expert in interview design -- and
they can always come to me for expertise on spreadsheets. And when they need
statistical help they tend to go to one of the other the people who taught them the
statistics course. So that’s just quickly a set of resources that I put under the heading of
accessed expertise. (MBA2 Professor)
As an example, this professor described the support offered by the survey design expert:
“We pay this professor to give us an actual 90 minute classroom session on survey design and
offer a ton of office hours” (MBA2 Professor).

The program also offered support from an

expert in interviewing. According to this professor, students were not required to attend these

98

classes although faculty advisors typically recommended attendance. One real asset of the
program was these experts’ experience outside academia. The professor felt that this expertise
complemented that offered from within the faculty:
I think now if you look at the team of advisors, both internal and external to [business
school name]; invariably these are people who have worked professionally as consultants
and who can really help teach the students how to do this job. I think that’s important
actually. I think it makes the students respect the process more, that they’re learning
from people who have done it, and I think it does inevitably improve the quality of the
product. I think we also have a lot of other ways of bringing in experts. So for instance,
if the students are going through a process of running a conjoint analysis or a survey we
now have a marketing professor who’s an expert in the subject who will give tailored
classes at the right time of year for this project to those students. So I think it enables us
to bring in some of the academic expertise at the point of need vs. just in a completely
classroom based environment which is detached from reality. (MBA2 Career1)
In another program, there was one faculty member who was a “dedicated person who is
just their research resource available to students for construction and interview protocols”
(MBA5 Professor). At this school, each team also had a communications faculty member who
supported them. Some of these positions were filled by full-time faculty and some by adjuncts.
The advisory roles at MBA4 included a team effectiveness advisor who collected a
personality profile of each team member and coached the team. The business librarian referred
to these advisors as the “team therapist.” There was also a communications faculty member who
advised all teams on writing and presentation skills. Additional advisory roles included various
presenters at optional “noontime workshops” who discussed different tools and methods
appropriate for the student projects, such as interviewing for primary data and conjoint analysis.
Attendance at these sessions was not required but was recommended if the topic would be
helpful to the team’s project. This same program had an informal role called alumni mentors
who were available as needed by the teams. According to one professor, this was:
Somebody that graduated the previous year from [the school] and did the strategy
project…So those folks are there as a resource where a team can use them as a sounding
99

board on various things, whether it be how to get around a specific obstacle, how to
increase their sample sizes, how to get more people to say yes on responding to interview
requests. It could be anything like that and they’re just a sort of as needed resource that’s
there to help. (MBA4 Professor)
5.1.5 Project Sponsor Organization Representatives
To participate in an FBL course, an organization or company must provide a real
business project for the MBA students. The sponsors at the six case programs were called
“clients, hosts, or sponsors.” At one program where the organizations were called “hosts”, the
organizations returned as sponsors year after year. The professor estimated that at his program
“….40% of the host organizations they get projects from they have gotten projects from before”
(MBA6 Professor).
At MBA6, advisors limited the team’s interaction with the host. They felt that by
keeping a distance, the teams were more likely to provide a fresh outlook in their
recommendations. Only one student in a team was assigned as the host contact. Commented
one professor,
We feel our competitive advantage is that we have this fresh outlook on the situation,
right? So, unlike a lot of programs, we try to limit the interaction with the managers,
because we don’t want the managers influencing the students in what they want....we just
try to limit [contact with the host]... give us data, that’s all we want from you, you know.
We don’t want to hear what your ideas are, and so forth, because we’re probably going to
come up with something different. (MBA6 Professor)
This program was the only one of the six cases that handled client engagements from a distance.
In the other programs, the student teams had more interaction with the sponsor organizations,
which expected to work directly with the students throughout project.
5.1.6 Career Services Professionals
Career services departments in this research did not have any direct role in supporting
FBL. As one respondent said, he felt his role was greater “….once they [MBA students] have

100

the experience, how can we help them market it? How do they market it for themselves?”
(MBA1 Career). A respondent from another program described this informal role in a different
way:
So I guess that’s where we’re most helpful is helping them to kind of think through the
project, helping them put structure around the project, or listening to what they think they
want to do and just being a sounding board. And then the other thing is actually
connecting them with people who are in that field or who know something about that
field. (MBA2 Career2)
The roles that offer career support in business schools are typically organized by sector verticals
that focus on career advising and corporate outreach (Feldman, 2013; MBA Career Services &
Employer Alliance, 2014). The sectors or categories interviewees supported included finance,
healthcare, consulting, marketing, entertainment, and energy. Two of the career services
professionals interviewed for this study were also alumni of the MBA program for which they
worked.
The career services professionals said their positions included advising students as well
as conducting outreach to companies for recruitment. One respondent was also the manager of
the school’s career services center who had oversight for all staff in that department. Their
responsibilities included the extensive career advising of students:
I work with the MBA students right when they come to campus to start their MBA until
they graduate in those two years. Any help, any questions, any guidance they need
related to their career such as career opportunities, resume review, interview preparation
and offer negotiation, I am their point of contact. (MBA6 Career)
When not supporting students in locating internships and jobs, the career services professionals
connected with potential employers for their students:
On the corporate outreach side my role is working with companies… to help them
understand what strategies they can use to more effectively work with [our school] as
well as for me to have an understanding of the profiles that they’re looking for so I better
know how to prepare our students for that process. (MBA4 Career)

101

Another career services professional emphasized that professionals in her position are assets
because they are not academics: “We actually have a work background…We’re sounding
boards. We’re industry resources…I’ve got a whole network outside of [this school] and they
use me for that” (MBA2 Career2).
At five of the six programs, the career service professionals said that they played an
auxiliary role as FBL course advocates and sources for recommendations about company
sponsors for potential projects. At MBA2, a career service professional also served as a faculty
coach for a FBL course student team. One career services professional said that:
We don’t play an active role in the experiential learning component, although as
companies have -- perhaps they want to do a project or whatever or they’re looking for
interns or part-time help to do certain types of work [and] we think that that might be an
interesting project, we will try to channel that to the right faculty member. (MBA3
Career)
Although these individuals did not actively engage with FBL courses, they had a peripheral role
in the learning process. At one school, the faculty lead said that he clearly saw career service
professionals as an important partner whom he had sought out for program advice. He also said
that at his school, career services professionals sometimes served as judges for student final
project presentations:
The career management area has a very strong interest in these courses going well
because they are specifically designed to help the students be what we call “day one”
ready. There’s a feeling… that these kinds of courses can help the students be ready for
their interviews, it helps them place well, it helps them perform well once they get there
so they get to get an offer, they get promotions. It helps the school look good to
recruiters. And so we have had a lot of interest and involvement from the career
management area. The head of career management has provided a lot of very
constructive advice and ideas for some of the ways in which we implement [FBL course
name] and she and her team are actual participants as judges in some of our case
competitions and some of our presentations. (MBA3 Professor)
At MBA5, career services professionals had no formal role in FBL although they trained
50 second-year MBA students to be peer coaches for the first-year MBAs. The training involved
102

experiential learning and role-playing. This training exemplified this school’s embrace of action
learning in many facets of their MBAs’ experience. The student peer coaches also served as
second-year coach advisors to teams for this school’s required FBL course.
5.1.7 Student Team Peer Advisors
In all programs, the student teams assigned roles among the team in order to complete the
work on their FBL projects. For example, the team might designate one or more individuals to
be responsible for collecting secondary data, or to serve as the primary client contact. In some
programs, the student team coordination was a more formal process (MBA2, MBA3, and
MBA5) than others. At MBA5, there were second year MBA student peer advisors assigned to
each team. These advisors had participated in a coaching course conducted by the career services
department. At MBA6, the professor offered an opportunity for peer learning between teams.
In his course, if several teams that were working on a project in the same area such as brand
loyalty programs they would meet and share what they had learned.
5.1.8 Information Technology Support Roles
The interview data did not provide many insights into the role of information technology
(IT) support in FBL. All programs had information technology departments that assured the
functioning of computing and media systems of the programs, but they appeared to play a
utilitarian role. This could be attributed to the fact that FBL is focused on active in-person,
participatory teamwork. The programs acknowledged the important role of the information
technology staff in supporting conferencing systems for virtual team meetings and making sure
the technology worked when team members were traveling to international locations that did not
have dependable online networking systems. Some respondents also mentioned maintaining
online repositories of video for students to use as an extra resource (MBA1 and MBA4). In a

103

few instances (MBA1, MBA2 and MBA4), the librarians made online guides (LibGuides) of
recommended secondary sources that catered to the research areas in the student projects. One
respondent shared how her school liked to foster IT innovations:
Technology absolutely is a part of this. This is a school that likes to build things. They
don’t do off the shelf. So they have a scheduling system that was home grown and it
allows the students to go in and book their consultation with a librarian and they also use
it to book their consultation with their coach -- their emotional coach. And that
technology is something that was built up over the years…It sends out automated emails.
It allows us to put in our availability up front and they can go in and select the slots that
they want. And they can cancel those slots, etcetera, etcetera. (MBA4 Librarian)
5.1.9 Alumni
Alumni played a role in FBL project pedagogy at all of the programs. Alumni were
potential sources for project sponsors and could serve as student team advisors, either in a formal
role at two programs as adjunct faculty or in an informal role, advising on certain aspects of the
project, or providing industry knowledge to the student teams. Within the project process, very
often an alumnus was the sponsor company contact for the student teams. At MBA4, recent
alumni who held a team advisor role were called alumni mentors. Alumni services departments,
or external relations departments, were described as having an occasional role with FBL at some
schools:
Our external relations and corporate relations also have a role because when you’re
talking about field courses you have to have a client. And so the whole complicated issue
of dealing externally outside the school with various types of organizations, corporations
and so forth, some of whom are already partners with the school or the university, others
are not. Some involve financial transactions, some are not. That’s very complicated.
They have an indirect role and a very strong interest in promoting the program, but also a
lot of interest in managing a coherent external outreach and corporate relations. (MBA3
Professor)
5.1.10 Business Librarians
This section provides details on intra-organizational relationships and how business
librarians were supporting FBL at all 20 MBA programs, and information on the specifics of

business librarian support of FBL at the six case study institutions. The data were collected
directly from 19 of the top 20 schools through an online survey with business librarians at the
institutions. The complete results from this survey are located in Appendix E. Due to a
computer processing error, the results from survey question 4 were incomplete and consequently
not included in these results.
The survey data indicated that the number of business librarians that support FBL at the
top 20 full-time MBA programs ranged from 1 to 11 business librarians. Table 5.1 describes the
number of business librarians at each school that support FBL in these MBA programs, the total
number of full-time MBA students, and the schools’ public or private status. There was a large
discrepancy in the ratio of librarians to students, with the most discrepancy at one school which
had one business librarian to support an MBA class of over 500 students. In a number of large
programs, support was provided by three or fewer librarians. Table 5.1 also shows that at four
of the institutions business librarians answered “yes” to having a formal role with FBL at their
school and being directly involved in supporting experiential field-based learning projects.
These four institutions were among the six case studies.

The list in Table 5.2 is organized by schools in which the business librarians had a formal
role with FBL followed by those that did not. This information is accompanied by the business
librarian reporting structure, source of funding, and the location of the business librarians. There
was no association between whether the business librarians had a formal role with FBL and their
source of funding, reporting relationship, or location. In ten programs, the business librarians
were located in the business library and in nine, within the main library. In one program, the
library served both the business and another professional school. Subsequent research of these
programs’ websites found that six of the 20 programs did not have business library departments.
Instead, there were just one or two librarians dedicated to a business focus.

In more than half of the programs, funding for the business librarians came from the
central library or a combination of the business school and the central library. In a few cases in
which the business librarians were located in the business school, the funding came from the
central library. In terms of reporting relationships, the majority of the business librarians
reported to the central library and not the business school.
Many business librarians with their own library have experienced their spaces shrinking
and their service focus changing as a result of most research resources used by business schools
being available online (Long, 2014). These issues of shifting space priorities and focusing on
service and instruction were cited by three of the business librarians in the study. At MBA2, the
librarians were consolidating from two floors to one. At another school, the department name
had recently been changed from “Library” to “Library Services” which emphasized that the role
of librarians was no longer about facilitating a space but offering expertise and a service instead
(MBA5 Librarian).
In some programs, the business library was also supporting another subject area such as
engineering. As one librarian said,
There’s three business librarians, but you also then have three engineering librarians...
[and some of their time is allocated differently]…For example, in [library staff member
name] case he’s at [the] Library 60% of his time and 40% of his time is in digital
technologies group. So he’s all in when he’s in that 60%, but if the students need him on
107

a Thursday or a Friday he’s not here. (MBA2 Librarian)
How business librarians at the top 20 full-time U.S. MBA programs work with FBL.
One business librarian commented that the student questions were becoming more complex and
that this provided an opportunity for instructing the MBAs on research techniques: “….The
questions that are coming at us are harder and more difficult. And I think that’s where instead a
lot of people will throw up the flag of -- we need to instruct them” (MBA5 Librarian). This same
librarian said that the increasing demand for FBL project courses in the core curriculum of the
full-time MBA program as well as other programs had resulted in the creation of more business
librarian positions on his team. The librarian said that beyond their support for the full-time
MBA FBL project course teams in the spring, there were also other FBL project teams from
other programs that were supported by the librarians:
We also have programs in the summer. We have other programs that last throughout
winter term, the weekend MBA program is during that time as well. So, there’s very few
times in the year where we don’t have teams… what we’ve been able to do over the last
couple years is basically try to keep up with the increased demand. (MBA5 Librarian)
This same school that had seen such an increase in demand as a result of their need to
support FBL project courses was also a business library space that had substantially reduced its
size. This change to a smaller space did not include a reduction in business librarians. The
librarian credited their extra activities in proactively reaching out, and being heavily engaged
with FBL courses and other “non-traditional assignments” in the business school as factors that
had “saved” them:
We’ve actually over the past -- let’s say 9, 10 years since I’ve been [here] … focused on
doing more with the community by really being proactive, by being service orientated.
I’m basically grabbing non-traditional assignments, and I think in the end you can make
the argument that it served us very well because when we went through last year the
process of actually removing all the books in the library and removing all the
management of the space in the library, that the first thing they didn’t say was, “Well,
why do you need all these people around if you’re not managing a print
108

collection?”…Part of it was taking on new service opportunities and moving people
around…I think service has been the element that’s really saved us and saved the staff
here. (MBA5 Librarian)
In the online survey results one way almost all these librarians indicated they provided
support to FBL project courses was through standard reference service (89%). Other common
ways the librarians provided support was creating web guides with lists of recommended
secondary sources (47%) and providing optional workshops on research as part of experiential
field-based learning projects support (32%). A total of 42% of the librarians indicated that there
was no standard pattern to when they met with MBA students, while 32% indicated that they
typically met with them repeatedly throughout the length of the FBL project. A subsequent
question provided additional context with librarians at 8 of the 19 schools stating that they often
did meet with the whole team even if they were not formally engaged with FBL and assigned to
a team.
In measuring the librarians’ performance and formal job responsibilities, only 21% of the
librarians indicated that their work supporting FBL was specifically included in their
performance reviews, while only 16% indicated that their job responsibilities had changed to
accommodate FBL course support. The survey also asked if positions had been added to their
program to support information gathering and analysis for FBL projects. Six of the respondents
said “yes” to this question, but most of the additional positions were just librarians from other
subject areas such as forestry or engineering. A non-librarian position listed was “Director of
Startup Consulting Program.” The survey only asked for a listing of job titles and not a
description of job responsibilities.
Information related functions and skills MBAs could develop with FBL projects.
Questions 14 and 15 in the business librarian survey referenced the list of information related

109

functions and skills in Table 5.3. These are capabilities in gathering and analyzing information
that can be developed by students through experiential field-based learning projects. The
research supporting this list of information functions MBAs can develop with FBL projects is
derived from the five Business Intelligence Briefs (Cullen & Noonan, 2014a-e).
Table 5.3
Information Related Functions and Skills
Breaking a problem apart - Ability to break apart a problem effectively to identify the questions that
will need to be answered and sources of information where answers to those questions might be.
Confronting information gaps – Approach what cannot be found constructively in terms of possible
alternative ways to answer the question. Understand the challenges and limitations in gathering
information to support the decision making process to solve real life business issues.
Contextual Intelligence – Identify facts connected with the past and/or present situation.
Creative Intelligence – Use information gathered to consider or predict “what could be.”
Problem Finding – Use information gathered to explore potential risks.
Integrative Thinking – Consider multiple options from diverse sources and effectively synthesizing
information.
Time management and resource allocation – Implement an effective plan for doing and delivering the
work.
Balanced use of types of evidence - Effectively balance the use of primary (e.g. interviews, customer
surveys, internal company reports) vs. secondary information sources.
Credibility - Assess factors regarding the creators of information and their motivations to determine its
credibility.
Evidential Responsibility – Document referenced sources and present information that clearly
communicates and demonstrates authority and credentials concerning a point of view.
Copyright - Appreciate issues around copyright and fair use in the proper use of information.

Survey Question 14 posed the question: “When you are working with students on fieldbased projects how often do you help them with these information functions?” These data were
collected to determine how many business librarians had more of a proactive instructional role
through their support of these varied information related functions and skills. In examining the
calculated statistical means of the ranked responses to this question with the listed information
functions in Table 5.3, “Confronting Information Gaps” and “Credibility” were highly ranked by
most respondents. The four areas ranked the lowest with less or no involvement were “Creative
Intelligence,” “Problem Finding,” “Time management and resource allocation” and “Balanced
110

use of primary and secondary types of evidence.” This suggested areas of information skills that
could be developed through FBL where the expertise of librarians was not typically being
utilized.
Question 15 asked which roles provided support with these information functions and
skills. The other roles listed were the faculty members advising projects, individuals at the
project's company or sponsor organization, student project team members, and other support
roles. When comparing these high and low mean rankings with the responses from Survey
Question 14 on which roles the business librarians identified as providing support for the list of
information functions, it was notable who the librarians saw as supporting the acquisition of the
skills that they felt they were less able to bolster. Ranked the lowest with less or no involvement
were: “Creative Intelligence,” “Problem Finding,” “Time management and resource allocation”
and “Balanced use of primary and secondary types of evidence.” These identified areas of
information skills that could be developed through FBL where the expertise of librarians was not
typically being applied. For these functions and skills, business librarians saw advising faculty or
student team members as more likely to provide this guidance. For functions where the business
librarians on average felt they did tend to offer support, the data pointed to potential allies who
librarians could partner with in providing this assistance.
There was also evidence from the survey comments that some librarians felt providing
assistance with these information related functions and skills did not pertain to their role. A
librarian from one institution responded that these questions could not be answered because their
librarians “are not involved in the program enough to know how every student gets assistance."
Another respondent was uncertain about responding because she was “unclear what defines an
experiential field-based learning project" and did not see how these categories related to “a

111

librarian’s usual role.” The response rate for survey questions 14 and 15 was 18 rather than 19
for this part of the online survey.
The interviews with the business librarians in the six case studies provided more detail on
how they were supporting FBL at their schools. In one program, the business librarians had a
very close partnership with the FBL course. A professor at that school provided details on the
varied ways their expertise contributed to the program:
If we think about the core of what happens in a field project, there has to be some actual
fact finding. There has to be asking good questions and finding good answers and then
making sense of that. …Not only is the library traditionally the source of a lot of
materials that can be the raw material for that, but that’s also the locus of where a lot of
experts are on how one should do that, how one might learn a process of really careful
inquiry and careful evaluation of an exploration and evaluation of evidence. And so with
their strong interest and willingness to take some risks and explore we have brought the
library in much more closely in this process…So they play a very important integrated
role in developing the ideas, contributing ideas and framework to what [FBL course
name] is about. Using all of those ideas, they play instruction roles, they play evaluative
roles, and of course they’re a great counsel. They give us the feedback of what the
students are and are not getting and we share our frustrations with each other about what
we can do and what’s the most efficient way to try to move them forward. (MBA3
Professor)
At MBA4, there were three business librarians who supported students on these FBL
projects. A librarian was assigned to each team, which was required to meet with that librarian
early in their project to review relevant resources. The meeting took place in a conference room
in the library where the librarian during the session referenced an online guide or “LibGuide”
that the library had compiled specifically for the team’s project. The professor called these
“online platforms” (MBA4 Professor). This business library had a coordinator who was the
library’s liaison with this core FBL course. The various individuals in this role over the years
had established how the business librarians worked with the course:
So there’s one person who is considered the -- and has the title of -- has the role of
coordinator of basically administrative support. So they’re the official liaison from the
library to the program for this field study. And that means that they are checking in,
112

they’re writing some of the publicity. They’re working with the program office to know
how many teams are there. What are the projects. And who are the people on the
different team, etc., etc. So that’s a very administrative role. .. The administrative
coordinator on the library side -- she does a quick kind of overview with the students
during -- there’s something called student launch. So there are days during the fall where
the students come together and they have all kinds of different lectures from different
components of the field study program. The librarian gets a short piece of that. So it’s
more reinforcing what they heard already from orientation and what they know. (MBA4
Librarian)
In this program, the librarian also mentioned that after the librarians met initially with
their teams, they typically returned for help with their research again. The professor at this
program felt it was important that student teams were exposed to the business librarians and their
support with secondary research very early in the learning process:
The quality of the research is quite good. The secondary research is really supported by a
very actively involved … Business Center Library at [business school name]. They’re
very actively involved in the very beginning. So they develop online platforms for each
team. They know what the scope and industry is of each team’s project by the middle of
August, when school starts, and they start setting up these online platforms where there
are direct links to industry and segment and competitor data, environmental data, industry
associations, trade events, government organizations, demographic databases, all that sort
of stuff. So that then the student teams, once they’re formed and they’re matched up with
a particular company and particular project, then they meet with the librarians and the
librarian spends time with each individual team taking them through the platform that
they’ve already set up, which really accelerates the secondary research that the teams do.
So it’s very good, very effective. (MBA4 Professor)
At MBA5, business librarians were also assigned to each team and had a formal role. In
total, 5.5 business librarians supported this required FBL course. The librarians grouped the
teams supported by similar topics to manage the scope of work. Typically, each librarian
supported 14 to18 teams and would try to meet with all their teams the first week of the project.
The business library director also supported some teams. After the initial consultation, teams
scheduled additional meetings as needed. Sometimes, the projects did not require additional
secondary research support and the librarians would not hear from those teams again. According
to the business librarian interviewed at this school, about 25% of teams needed no extra support
113

beyond the first meeting, 25% needed a high level of support and interacted frequently with the
librarian, and the rest were somewhere in between.
In another program, six librarians supported FBL teams with one librarian assigned per
team. Some librarians supported twelve teams. To determine team assignments, one librarian
would review all of the FBL course’s project descriptions and then assign teams to different
librarians. As one librarian said,
I will read every single project team and I am responsible for divvying them up among
the librarians…Some of us are only here…part-time so I try to give them -- they’ll get
less projects or I’ll try to give them projects that are all in the same industry so that they
don’t have to try to find the information across a lot of industries. (MBA2 Librarians)
Teams that were not required to meet with their assigned librarian did not always meet
with them. The faculty lead at one school was unconcerned that some teams did not meet with a
librarian. He felt that the:
Overall role of the librarians is minor if not unimportant...I would say most [teams] don’t
use their librarian…But there are times when they really, really, really need the librarian
and the students are almost completely uninformed about what a modern librarian can do
(MBA2 Professor).
He then continued that a key part of FBL was to learn how to work with expertise:
It’s again, its access to expertise. For me, the point is not that everyone should go to the
library and listen to a lecture on databases. I mean…they’re not going to learn anything
from that. But they should be thinking, is there anything there that I might need? Can I,
is it worth half an hour of my time going and finding out what they might have? Just as it
is with the survey expertise and the interview expertise, and so on. (MBA2 Professor)
At MBA1, the librarians were not formally connected to FBL, and simply gave a halfhour presentation in class when requested. At this school, librarians often did not meet with
MBAs who were taking the FBL project courses. Any consultations were usually with just one
member of the team. However, the business librarians almost always made an online guide

114

called a LibGuide that they included in the school’s course management system; this included
recommended resources to use for research on these projects. As one librarian stated:
Once the research guide goes into the Canvas site, they’re kind of happy and if they get
stuck they come to us” (MBA1 Librarian). The librarian at this program said that she
estimated that librarians met with less than 25% of the teams working on FBL projects.
She added that at her program it was “not part of the MBA culture to ask a librarian.
(MBA1 Librarian)
Librarians at this school did not receive information in advance on the teams in the FBL courses.
Instead, the service was more dependent on a “self-service” model where the librarian created
online guides of the available business research tools that students could reference. As a further
example, the librarian mentioned that a recent important initiative of her business library
department was linking an online “Business Library Starter Guide” to all courses in the school’s
course management system.
At MBA6, librarians did not have a formal role in their primary FBL elective course
offering. Teams were not assigned a librarian or required to meet with one. However, the
faculty lead recommended that teams meet with a librarian and highly valued the expertise the
librarians provided the students. The faculty member felt that it was the students’ responsibility
to reach out to the librarians. The librarian at this program said that they were not formally
involved in FBL project courses and did not do any formal outreach. This was attributed to
capacity issues. There were five business librarians on her team and she felt she did not have
enough staff to partner with each student team and at the same time fulfill all of her area’s other
service obligations. They were just reacting to on-demand requests and were focused on
primarily supporting faculty research over student research. She also mentioned that with these
projects, she felt “uncomfortable with what students may or may not be doing with our licensed
resources” when they were working with a real outside business. This also discouraged her team

115

from pursuing outreach. This was particularly a problem with their global FBL elective course
because the teams included students from other schools who fell outside of her institution’s
licensed coverage.
Expertise and level of engagement. In all programs, the business librarians were
appreciated for the expertise they offered their institutions. While not all respondents felt they
needed to be highly engaged with FBL projects and meet with all student teams, some professors
indicated that all student teams needed to meet with a business librarian for advice about
research. In the four programs where the business librarians provided active formal support for
FBL, everyone -- including the manager of the library-- took part in supporting these student
teams. In three of the four programs, the business librarians were responding to a faculty
member’s directive. Only at one program were business librarians working side-by-side with
faculty in designing how to present and discuss the information component to students as part of
the course. The business librarian from that program described how they were very engaged
with FBL curriculum. She said that they had assigned the term “business intelligence” to all the
information gathering and librarian related components of the course. These included a group of
business information briefs written by the librarians and faculty that served as part of the text for
this course:
In terms of actually looking at what we do … We teach what we call Business
Intelligence Workshops. They’re about an hour and a half. They usually are taught
…just when the faculty is ready to kick off the students beginning their secondary
research, and so we’ll develop that class …around what their live client project is so that
there’s a real component that makes sense to them. We also meet with -- in many cases
the students are required to meet with us -- meet with one business librarian at some point
in the semester. That’s still a little bit uneven but I think what we’re seeing that the trend
is that what we are getting more and more of the students to meet with us later if not
sooner. We also do sit in on the client presentations when the client first comes in to
meet the students and kick off their presentation typically they’ll spend 15 or 20 minutes
talking about the problem, and then they’ll do a Q and A with the students. So we sit on
in on that. We will have already had advance notice from the faculty as to who the client
116

is and what the problem is so that we’ve, offline, before the client even comes in the
classroom, we’re already thinking about it. And in most cases we’re developing a pretty
substantial recommended resource guide… and then we may pop in, you know,
throughout the semester into the class. Some of the classes, the faculty will actually have
the client come in and have meetings with the students so we sit in on those… And then
at the end the students each do around a -- they’ve had about 20 minutes to present and
we sit in on those and we participate as judges. (MBA3 Librarian)
Information gathering components of FBL projects. In all the programs, students
were expected to collect some sort of primary or secondary data. Primary information gathering
typically consisted of surveys or interviews. As one professor said, "….Research is a pretty
broad term. We have established in the syllabus and a principle, which is that every project must
develop, to some degree, some original information...But surveys and interviews are
predominant" (MBA2 Professor). For this professor, gathering secondary data was seen as
possibly relevant for some of these projects, although he stated that primary information
gathering from his perspective was a more important objective in FBL:
I think teaching them to do interviews is a huge thing... I mean setting this up and then
doing this and then analyzing the results in a creative way I think is much harder than
analyzing a survey… [then] having to put it all together in a presentation and being at
least somewhat held feet to the fire about the logic of that presentation, I think does give
them some good training in using information taken broadly to tell a story that is logical
and credible and not based too much on business stereotypes. (MBA2 Professor)
The faculty leads at other programs had a different perspective that viewed practice in
both primary and secondary data gathering as an important component of this instruction:
Sometimes it’s survey work, sometimes it’s interview work, but a lot of it does involve
what we might call library research where you’ve really got to go into databases and
news sources and try to come up with answers to the questions that are answerable in that
way. And so depending on the situation it’s a mixture of a variety of different kinds of
primary, secondary types of sources. (MBA3 Professor)
A faculty member at another program also shared that the information gathering for FBL projects
could be from a combination of primary as well as secondary sources. The professor said:

117

They do all kinds of research ...So it could be interviews, it can be surveys, it can be
simulations... They’ve done decision analytic tools where they hand people tools and it’s
like a straight up analytic model ... They will do secondary analyses of all kinds of data
that they can get and that’s where the library comes [in]. (MBA5 Professor)
The respondents varied in how intensive they felt librarian involvement should be even
where the librarians had a formal role and were each assigned to teams. The professor
interviewed at MBA2 said he did not think most projects required business librarian support:
I would say most teams don’t use their librarian…and they’re probably right in that. You
know, they’re decent at surfing the web to get that kind of background information. It’s
not critical to their projects. They don’t really have to know a whole lot about the
company or the industry because the projects are, have to be pretty focused for nine
weeks, part time. (MBA2 Professor)
This was in contrast to a respondent from a different school who shared that "in our case all
advisors are expecting every team to do some amount of secondary research" (MBA4 Librarian).
MBA students understanding of business librarian support available. A number of
respondents indicated that they did not think most of the MBAs knew how to gather information
very well. One respondent felt that “students don’t understand how to use the librarians” (MBA2
Career2). She continued that they did not know what they did not know, were more comfortable
with searching with Google, and wanted information handed to them. Another summed up his
view by saying that "….our students are not PhD students. You know, they’re not interested in
research... they really have no, well, a very unsophisticated view of data quality" (MBA2
Professor).
Another respondent felt that the situation had deteriorated over the years and students had
a false sense of complacency that now on the internet all information was easy to find. She
shared that she recently had:
….encountered some students here who I think have the least appreciation of how to do
research that I ever encountered. And I think it’s just because time is passing. In 2015
you’ve got different students than you would have had in 2010 for example. I think it
118

seems easier access to our resources -- super simple. You don’t need to have the
intermediary of the librarian as much. (MBA4 Librarian)
Several interviewees echoed this respondent’s comments that "students are almost completely
uninformed about what a modern librarian can do" (MBA2 Professor). Another faculty member
described the help business librarians provided student teams and how it facilitated their
information gathering. However, he lamented that the only reason students did not make use of
librarians’ assistance was because “they’re lazy”:
Usually, the librarians are very helpful, students will come back with all these reports,
they’ll have all this data. I mean, very helpful. I mean, teams that don’t follow that
advice generally pay, because, they either find that they don’t find the material, or they
spend a lot more time finding it. And if they had just gone over and asked, it would have
been easy. And here, they can just email, and they’ll just send them stuff through by
email, I mean, it’s so easy...Students are just lazy, that’s why [they don’t]. That’s the
only reason why, they’re just lazy. (MBA6 Professor)
In a different program, the professor stated that he felt students were actually "eager
consumers of library resources and then the librarians seem to like tracking down crazy stuff
about the market for bulldozers in Pakistan or something" (MBA5 Professor). In some cases,
respondents indicated that students could have unrealistic expectations of librarian support:
Let’s say I’m doing work on coffee shops, OK? There’s a ton of stuff on that. And my
buddy is doing work on a new medical device that is going to help with stomach cancer.
There’s not a lot on that. And yet, they look at this as being, ‘Oh, your librarian got a lot,
my librarian didn’t do squat.’ (MBA5 Librarian)
Following on this idea, another business librarian stated how important the personal engagement
of the librarian working with students to identify information was in demonstrating how their
expertise added value to this work:
It’s that type of working with them and trying to understand what the goal is here and
where we’re going to be able to give them information or help them with research data
and where we can’t…. I think through these field study encounters when you meet with a
team and you show this is what the librarian is able to do for you it opens up their eyes in
a way that they have no idea that this is the sort of thing that an academic business library
can offer them. And it’s not something that’s necessarily even promoted that much,
119

certainly not here, as part of the package of this is what you’re going to get. (MBA4
Librarian)
Proper use of databases and appreciation of copyright and contract restrictions.
One concern cited in all of the business librarian interviews was that some MBAs did not
understand the limitations on the use of the databases in the library, and that these databases
were only for school or personal non-paid professional development work, and for example, not
for use at paid internships. This comment typifies comments about these concerns:
It’s a huge, huge problem...but understanding that this information is just not a
commodity that anybody can use and do whatever they want with. There are
responsibilities, there are agreements, there’s licensing, there’s laws, there’s publishers
who will not hesitate to sue organizations. And they need to take that seriously. (MBA3
Librarian)
As a way to contend with this, some libraries posted information on their website about proper
database use at their institution:
This is a matter of very large concern for us and we have really ratcheted up -- although
we always had them sign a form when they came in... The past couple of years we have
really ratcheted up our messaging -- content on our website, a pdf document. And then,
for the full-time program… -- the dean of that program …does sort of a kick off before
our internship town hall and we now participate in that. (MBA3 Librarian)
In one program, the central library administration would not permit posting a statement on its
website about the proper use of their databases and complying with their licensing agreements:
It would be nice if we could, and we’ve talked about this, is to have a statement right on
our research guide…and when we ran it against library administration they said no, we
could not put that up there. Which confuses me. I don’t know why we couldn’t put it on
there and make it more explicit that these are for academic use only. (MBA2 Librarians)
In one business library, the proper use of databases was also an issue because the school
had an elective FBL project course in which MBA students were working with students from
other schools. The business library’s database contracts explicitly stated that only students,
staff, and faculty from this school could use these databases. The librarian, who was concerned

120

about potential usage violations with this type of project learning, said, “….I feel uncomfortable
with what students may or may not be doing with our licensed resource, ” she said (MBA6
Librarian). In this program, the respondent stated that this issue had played a factor in their not
pursuing more aggressive outreach with FBL courses.
Ways librarians provide student team projects support. In the four programs where
librarians were assigned to student teams, they had either one individual with the responsibility
for matching librarians with teams or the decision was made together as a group. In both
scenarios, there was an attempt to balance out projects that were likely to be more vs. less
research intensive, as well as grouping by topic when allocating them to each librarian:
Occasionally by the luck of the draw, we’ll actually put in requests internally as to what
teams we want. We used to have like a fantasy draft, but now we’ve been doing it -we’ve been bunching it more together. A lot of people really don’t care. But what we try
to do is if there’s three teams from Latin American Airlines, for example, I took all three
because it could be a little easier down the road to have something more cohesive, and
then I could get information that could be applicable for three. But there’s -- you have a
gut feeling as to what might be busy, but it may or may not be the case. (MBA5
Librarian)
The number of student teams supported in the FBL courses by business librarians ranged
from 33 to 80 teams. Table 5.4 presents the data on the number of teams in the FBL courses in
2015 when the interviews for this dissertation took place. These represent the typical number of
teams at these programs. The required FBL courses at these programs are presented in this table
except for MBA6, where information on the main FBL elective course is provided. Most of the
schools where librarians were assigned to teams also required that they met at least once with
their librarian. The librarian at MBA4 described how her group approached this process:
So we have around 65 teams right now because it’s, again, every student who’s in the
full-time program is in this...So again every team -- it’s usually around five people -- is
required to do this…This is basically the equivalent of your thesis. You get an advisor.
You get a support from the program and you get a librarian. I have a small team so
there’s three of us that actually do librarian consultations. (MBA4 Librarian)

Striving for a consistent FBL approach in which every student had an equal quality
experience was cited by many of the librarian respondents in this study. An important factor
was the issue of timing and when to best introduce and subsequently provide librarian support
for student teams. In referring to where librarian support was placed in the timeline of the FBL
course, one librarian said:
So they changed the scheduling over the last couple of years. Wednesday mornings now
have kind of been anointed as this is when they’re going to be working on this. So when
we’re offering consultations we’re really trying to target Wednesday mornings because
there’s an expectation that the students will be on campus...And then we have other times
of the week that we think are going to be good times to be available for them when
they’re not typically in classes. So it’s really been, I think, around let’s make sure that
our scheduling and what our expectations are for when they’re available are kind of in
sync. That sounds minor but it’s actually a big deal in a city like this where it’s just hard
for people to get around sometimes. (MBA4 Librarian)
Consistency of service was a concern cited by one of the respondents who admitted that
the experience of teams with different librarians was not always the same. One librarian said,
“….I think the relationship that the librarian has with the students can be uneven, if you will.
That it depends on sort of the personality of the librarian, the willingness to engage, the
enthusiasm for the work” (MBA2 Librarians). Another challenge was when librarians who

122

supported student teams did not share information among themselves very well. This was
something one interviewee was hoping to change:
I won’t get into some organizational challenges that also I’ve inherited. But how things
are kind of done here. There hasn’t been a lot of sharing amongst the librarians in terms
their best practices and how they interact with the teams and there’s been zero
assessments. (MBA4 Librarian)
At four of the six case study institutions, the librarians felt it was important for the
librarian to meet at least once with their student teams. In only three of these four cases did the
professor share this opinion. One librarian said, "….So, that’s really the most important thing.
Meeting with teams, it’s pretty effective to do that, just to even get a face, and let them see who
you are” (MBA5 Librarian). Another challenge was that while the librarians were assigned and
working with the teams, they were not consistently working with the faculty advisors for those
teams.
In terms of roles, one business librarian shared that they were not referred to as librarians
in the FBL project courses. He reported:
We’re considered the secondary research consultants. The primary research consultants
are -- there are a few people. …a faculty member here… and she’ll work with students
who are looking at creating some primary research -- they want to interview people,
customers, potential customers, et cetera. (MBA5 Librarian)
One respondent shared that at times, her role had expanded to other areas of support for
these project teams:
I’ll get asked questions when I’m working with teams that I think really fall into, ‘You
need to go talk to your coach about this.’ They’ll have issues. I’ll see them when I’m
meeting with them where they’re not getting along or they need help figuring out how do
I divvy up the work or how do I do a piece of it. I kind of end up being in the therapy
role. (MBA4 Librarian)

123

Deeper integration of the business librarians with FBL. One program had taken their
partnership with FBL much further. A key feature was that learning effective information
gathering should not appear only once in the course but should repeated over time:
When it’s reinforced in that way in other core and elective courses, which it can be, we
will go much further much faster. Because nobody gets anything in business school the
first time around. Nobody gets regression the first time through. It’s the subsequent
reinforcement and application and also the validation from everyone else that this is an
important part of thinking well and doing good work, that’s where it really is going to
connect… One of the portfolio skills that can be helped the most will be in the research
area…So for example, instead of the one-off beginning of the semester, here’s the library,
here’s our databases, look forward to seeing you, and then just dealing with people as
they come running in ad hoc, we have built in more focused time sensitive and structured
training and practice sessions into the course. So within the [FBL course name] curricula
across full-time and evening programs there are required sessions where the students in
the midpoint of their first semester go through library workshops to get additional
instruction. And so the librarians are actually playing the roles of instructors. They’ve
got frameworks, they’ve got processes, they’ve got tasks that are designed to integrate
with what the students are doing in the [FBL course name] class. The librarians attend
the [FBL course name] sessions, they know the material well, and so they and their team
can reflect back to the students the concepts and the process steps and even the language
that they’re getting in [FBL course name] to integrate this and to reinforce this. They
play an essential role in the evaluation of the materials. They provide a rubric and a way
of thinking about what quality research looks like. They attend the presentations, they
review the decks, and they provide scores that become part of the actual evaluative
grades of the students as well as qualitative feedback. (MBA3 Professor)
The librarian at this school also mentioned that she felt that an advantage of their approach was
that they made information gathering a required outcome. This was because:
We know at the end of the day that, with the exception of a handful of rare students, none
of the students are really going to take the research component seriously unless they’re
being forced to do it, required to do it… that if the students are truly going to get all -everything that they’re learning in [FBL course name], including the research component,
it has to be iterative and it has to be reinforced throughout all of their learning
experiences at the school. (MBA3 Librarian)
At MBA4, while their support of FBL was exclusively through supporting student teams
with consultations, the librarian alluded to this need to be more "programmatic" and integrated
with the MBA program which she referred to as “clients” of the librarians:

124

I invited all of the program managers to meet with the librarians for them to learn for the
first time ever what it is we do during these consultations and what it is we do as we work
with the teams month after month after month when they come back for help. They had
no idea... So I say that’s been a change in terms of trying to make this more
programmatic and to have our clients understand just as we’re their clients in a sense.
(MBA4 Librarian)
When the faculty member described the role of the business librarians at his school, he said that
“they’re fully respected members of the team" (MBA5 Professor). This suggested that in this
program, the librarians had a more integrated role just by designating them as co-members of the
“team.”
Positioning of traditional reference support from business librarians. The two
business libraries that had chosen a more traditional level of support for these FBL projects with
staffed as needed reference support provided contrasting reasons for offering support in this way.
In one instance, the librarian talked about their investing a fair amount of time creating online
LibGuides and consequently assuming the reason they did not hear more from students was
because the students found using those guides sufficient. Therefore, she saw no need to advocate
for more support beyond the half hour resource presentation she or her business librarian
colleagues might be invited to give for an FBL class:
I don’t think it has been too time consuming for us because it’s not a required course and
not every student will be involved in it. Usually we’ll -- we won’t meet with the entire
group and we’ll only meet with them once or twice depending on their needs for the
semester. Probably designing the research guide takes more time. (MBA1 Librarian)
When business students did seek assistance from business librarians at this school, she
continued that:
I won’t talk to the entire team. They’ll usually portion out the work. So if they need
additional help after the presentation they’ll pick someone to come talk to the librarians.
They wouldn’t all come together…But I don’t actively reach out to the teams. They
know if they need help they’ll come to us. (MBA1 Librarian)

125

The business librarian at the other program (MBA6) stated that ideally she would like to
pursue more engagement with FBL project course teams and an “embedded approach,” but she
just did not see it as feasible with the number of existing staff: "We are providing office hours in
the main building... we are in office hours on a daily basis so kind of a remote reference services
[sic]. We are also providing more extensive chat services" (MBA6 Librarian). She then
provided more details on why her team did not have the capacity to provide more engaged FBL
support given their other established reference obligations:
We’re not set up staffing wise, I mean, to be able to support this fully or to support
everything that is going on-- which I suppose -- we don’t have to support everything that
was going on. We could certainly make decisions about that. But how to make those
decisions is an issue as well. But yeah, we basically -- I wouldn’t be able to have
anybody get embedded in the way that they are at -- at other places because they really -they wouldn’t be able to do -- I mean, or my impression of how that works on some of
these other project teams is that they are -- they’re truly -- there’s a great deal of time that
the information professional is taking to be part -- to be really part of those teams. And
we just wouldn’t be able to do anything else except that and I just -- I’m not able to
support that...I mean we also have an undergraduate program for example. I mean, we
have 2,600 undergraduate students so it’s not just the MBAs that we are supporting. We
are doing a lot of responses to -- I mean, we get a lot of ad hoc questions -- you know, not
just from these field experience people, but we do get many regular questions each day
from students. We are trying to support our -- faculty research as well and …that support
for faculty research would be a priority over student research…. So those type of things - not anything particularly unusual, I guess. It’s just a -- a quantity problem. (MBA6
Librarian)
Online resource guides. Four of the six business librarians spoke about the web-based
resource guides they created specifically tailored toward the research being done by the student
teams on FBL projects. The platform format used for these at three institutions was called
“LibGuides.” This references a content management system for creating online guides that many
libraries use that is sold by a company called Springshare (Springshare, 2016). Consequently, in
several interviews, the business librarians described their online guides as “LibGuides”: "I’ve
required every librarian to create a LibGuide that is tailored to that particular project so then

126

that’s what we’re teaching from when we’re meeting with them...So every team gets a LibGuide.
There’s a certain template that we use for that for the most part” (MBA4 Librarian).
One librarian felt these guides might be a more effective means to communicate with
students rather than the team meetings:
I don’t know if it’s part of that MBA culture to actually think to go talk to a librarian. It’s
something you really have to work at and push. This year we got a link to our MBA
research guide put into Canvas. Every single student sees that guide. And they’ve
actually been using it so I feel like they want to do their own work and they only come
when they’re stuck. (MBA1 Librarian)
This librarian mentioned that many of the student teams working on FBL projects at her
school did not ask for help and attributed this to one of two factors: “They think they know
everything. Or they have the research guide and the resources aren’t that hard to use" (MBA1
Librarian). The business librarian at another program spoke about their resource guides that
support FBL project work as more “robust” and informative than typical LibGuides:
So these are pretty substantial and these are developed to mitigate their wasting too much
time trying to figure out where to begin or how to move through the research process. So
they’re very robust. They’re very, very, very targeted to the client project and I think that
one of the things that distinguishes these is unlike what you typically see in LibGuides
where you’ll just have a series of links and then maybe a one sentence descriptor of the
resource -- we are really introducing each individual source to the students relative to
their client project and the kind of information and the kind of data they want. So even if
they just look at the guide they’re already getting layers of the beginning of
understanding about how complex and rich these resources are. (MBA3 Librarian)
Advocates for the librarians in the FBL partnership. Many interviews addressed
how the roles of faculty, career service professionals, and FBL project team advisors could play
an important role as champions of the expertise the librarians offered to students. In one
interview, the faculty member spoke about recommending to teams that they meet with a
librarian and how he valued the expertise the librarians could provide the students; yet he left the
decision to them to reach out to the librarians (MBA6). In another interview the librarians said

127

that some faculty insisted that students needed to go to speak to the librarians and others were
less adamant. When this support came from the faculty advisor as “have you gone to ask the
librarian about this?” (MBA2 Librarians), students were more likely to seek out assistance from
librarians. Most of the respondents felt that such advocacy encouraged MBAs to be more
inclined to work with business librarians. One librarian spoke about being included in facultyled team meetings run by more proactive “librarian champion faculty” as a way to become more
familiar with a team’s project. This librarian believed that being present at these meetings had
helped reinforce the research support librarians could provide for the student projects:
Oftentimes the project description that we get, by the time the students get together with
their advisors, it’s changed and we are not informed of that change. So we might do a lot
of work that’s missing the mark. So it really was important for me to be involved in a
couple of these where I could hear what the students are hearing from the advisors and
then I could provide them with better information, more targeted and timely. It was very
helpful…I think one of the other outcomes of having us there is that the students see that
we have a seat at the table, that they see how the faculty treats and believes that we are
part of the team. So I think it just instills in the students that we’re important and that
they need to come and use us. (MBA2 Librarians)
A career services professional said that she did not just advise students to see the business
librarians; she would detail the steps that students needed to take and how the librarian could
help:
They really expect things to be handed to them. So sometimes in order to take initiative
you’ve got to actually outline how to do it. OK, these are the steps you need to take and
these are the people that can help you. If it’s not easy they don’t necessarily do it.
(MBA2 Career2)
5.2 Analysis of Roles
5.2.1 Positioning of Roles Supporting FBL
The roles of the respondents in the six case study institutions and their positioning with
FBL were either proactive or more reactive in character. Spitzmuller and Van Dyne (2013),
citing the research of Parker and Collins (2010), define proactive vs. reactive actions as
128

“proactive behaviors emphasize the notion of foresight where an individual initiates actions in
anticipation of future outcomes. Moreover, proactive behaviors emphasize taking control or
causing change. By contrast, reactive behaviors do not depend on intentionality and foresight.
Instead, they occur in response to the situation or incident” (p. 562). In the context of this
research, this means that roles that were actively engaged with the FBL course vs. those that
provided only support when students or faculty in the course requested. See Table 5.5 for a list
of respondents in these categories. The designation of “informal” indicates that the respondent
said they did not have a formal role working with the student teams in FBL courses.

All career services professionals were identified as reactive in connection with FBL
because of their informal role. The only exception to this was one program in which the career
services professional also served as a faculty advisor for a team in the FBL course (MBA2).
The entire group of lead faculty members at these programs played largely proactive roles except
for one in which the faculty member orchestrated the process by having weekly meetings with
his teams, but was willing to allow the process to evolve through a more open and
noninterventionist approach. He expected students to contact him for assistance when they were
struggling but was not too concerned about the students’ struggles because he actually saw that
as key to the learning process. Although all the programs shared this view of giving students the
opportunity to struggle with the ambiguous problems in their project, this program took a
129

particularly hands-off approach. This may also have evolved from necessity, given the
unstructured character of this FBL course and that this professor was advising over 30 teams.
Of the roles in all three categories (reactive, somewhere in between, and proactive),
business librarians appear in each. This indicates the different choices made by MBA programs
on where this role fits in FBL courses. Some programs chose to have the librarian assigned to a
team and proactively reaching out to each team. One component that further illustrated the level
of proactive involvement of business librarians in some programs was their attendance at student
presentations.
The student teams shared their results in FBL courses by creating final presentations for
the sponsoring organization. This was an important element of this curriculum in which students
could be evaluated on the quality of their slides and on how well they presented and answered
questions about the project. Only one program (MBA3) had business librarians who not only
attended these presentations but also evaluated the secondary research component of these
deliverables as part of the student teams’ final grade. In two other programs (MBA4 and
MBA5), in which the business librarians were not involved in formally evaluating projects, they
appreciated the value of attending these presentations as another way to connect with the FBL
course and to witness the results of the student teams’ efforts. As one librarian said:
It’s been really good for people to go and just see what the students are doing, and what
are the conclusions they came up with. From my vantage point, I think it’s very useful
because it connects the things that we’re doing with the outcomes in a way that you can’t
really capture in any other way. (MBA5 Librarian)
In the other three programs, the librarians did not attend these presentations. In the online survey
conducted with business librarians at the Top 20 MBA Programs (see Appendix E), only two
institutions replied that librarians serve as judges for these project presentations.

130

5.2.2 Issues of Jurisdictional Claim among Roles
The data revealed much evidence of the different players vying for jurisdictional claim in
certain FBL support roles (Abbott, 1988). The FBL approach is evolving as academia seeks
new models for this type of education. As new roles were being developed to support FBL, there
were issues of contention that were arising from where roles had jurisdiction. In terms of active
engagement of business librarians, programs differed in how this role was best deployed. This
research identified three approaches to the work of business librarians with FBL project courses.
Figure 5.1 shows the three approaches to the positioning of business librarians with FBL
courses and which were followed by each of the top 20 full-time MBA programs: 1) self-service
(proactive), 2) embedded (proactive) and 3) on-demand (reactive). In many instances, the focus
of the librarians in their work with FBL was not exclusively found in one of these three
approaches, although they were a primary focus. For example, some of the libraries identified as
“self-service” indicated that they also scheduled optional “research drop-in sessions specific for
these student teams” and another mentioned participating as “program managers” with FBL
experiences. Unfortunately, the survey response did not provide further details on what it meant
to be a “program manager” for their school’s FBL course “experiences.” Some of the libraries
with a more hands-on focus also created self-serve online guides for students to use for these
projects. The following section describes in detail the three approaches through which business
librarians interacted with FBL.

131

Approach 2 – Embedded. In this second approach, librarians met with the FBL course
teams with a heavy focus on in-person engagement that supported research on the FBL projects.
This required a larger business librarian staff. Consequently, a school with only one or two
business librarians would not be able to choose this approach. Only one respondent in the online
survey indicated that they used this approach with fewer than three librarians. Minimal IT
support was necessary, since this approach worked well with LibGuides or even Microsoft Word
documents posted to the course management system for students to reference as research
guidance tools. One benefit of this approach was that the close interaction with teams allowed
for adjustment of recommendations and guidance as the project evolved and possibly changed its
focus. This approach was more connected with activities of the actual course through its
interaction with the other course facilitators. This level of engagement could also lead to the
involvement of the librarians in project judging and after action reviews.
The heavier involvement provided the librarians with more information about the projects
that could be applied to their work with the student teams. The big challenge was the
unpredictability of the demands on time and workload. Providing the right level of support could
take away from time available for other duties such as central library committee work and other
general demands. Table 5.6 includes two institutions’ comments in the online survey about their
school’s embedded approach.
Table 5.6
Comments from Schools with an Embedded Librarian Approach
"It is one of our biggest success stories enabling us to partner and collaborate with faculty and students; it
has contributed to librarians being seen as part of the student teams and their community; it has greatly
increased our visibility and value."
"This is a core role for us. Expectations placed on the librarians by the programs we support can be
difficult to meet due to timing of expected consultations. Some programs also have difficulty placing the
required library consultation at the best time for the team. Rather than have timing that maximizes the
team's needs, the consultation is scheduled during the best time for the program. Even if that might mean
133

the night before a major exam. This relationship, across multiple programs, is a work in progress and
ever-improving."

Approach 3 - On-Demand. The final approach was one-shot instruction and on-demand
support in which the librarians provided an in-class source review when requested in addition to
traditional reference services. In institutions with only one business librarian, this approach
might be the only option because it did not require a larger staff. One clear benefit of this
approach was that it reflected the status quo of typical librarian support and did not affect
personnel issues and the librarians’ other job duties. One potential challenge of this approach
was that the librarians had less understanding of FBL course work and may not be prepared
when higher demand for library services was needed in FBL project courses.
Of the three approaches to partnering in the six case studies, the majority of the business
librarians engaged in the embedded approach. Business librarians provided proactive support
through intensive in-person support or through focused online guides. Beyond the roles of
business librarians, there were two areas where issues of jurisdictional claim between the roles
were uncovered in the data analysis. These were 1) the issue of tenured or tenure-track faculty
vs. business practitioners serving as adjunct faculty being the best instructors and facilitators for
FBL and 2) the rise in the number of administrative roles created to support FBL at some schools
and the extent to which they should be involved in pedagogical design and delivery vs. tenured
faculty. In response to the potential contentions between lead faculty and administrators in
course design, one professor felt it was the responsibility only of faculty when discussing a high
level administrative role for FBL at his school:
She’s the business managing director if you will of the whole thing, but in terms of ...
pedagogy and what we’re doing she’s been doing this long enough that she knows that
that’s [most] often sitting in faculty hands, what are we trying to do with our pedagogy
here and what’s the nature of action-based learning. Now, this woman is involved in that,
she goes to the conferences with her peers that are putting this on and she clearly has
134

something to say about that, but that [curriculum design] seems to be sitting inside of
faculty deliberations about our program. (MBA5 Professor)
Another respondent indicated that his program had:
….kind of elevated experiential education a bit. We have a new dean, that means we
have new associate deans, the new associate dean [of the experiential collaborative]
really knows nothing about experiential education. I don’t think he’s going to do
anything about it. (MBA2 Professor)
This comment underscored the potential tension between someone who had done FBL for some
time and those who were new, and it highlighted the challenges that arose as new roles emerged
in the curriculum development in the midst of those with more established expertise and
experience with FBL.
The emergence of a separate administrator role was a notable development revealed in
the data. Some interviewees suggested that the recently created Leadership of Experiential
Project-Based Education (LEPE) conference, begun in 2009, focused primarily on individuals in
this role. (For details on this conference and FBL administrators, see Appendix F.) The
establishment of this annual conference relates to Abbott’s theory of professions and the concept
of jurisdictional claim that identifies how emerging professional roles create official groups to
establish their legitimacy. As stated by Abbott, “….some groups are lobbying groups, some
informational ones, still others aim at particular control” (Abbott, 1988, p.79).
An additional dynamic was the issue of which roles received extra compensation for
work supporting these teams. Faculty and other advisory roles were given extra compensation for
their time working with students on FBL projects. As one professor said, “….We pay this
professor to give us an actual 90 minute classroom session on survey design and offer a ton of
office hours” (MBA2 Professor). Another program said that individuals involved with their
FBL received supplemental compensation:

135

All the work for [FBL course name] is extra pay, because they don’t know how to, you
know, judge it relative to a normal class, right? ... So, the decision was made, ‘well,
we’ll just pay cash extra, because it’s extra work’, and then it won’t be end-loaded.
(MBA6 Professor)
However, the interviews revealed that there was never any extra compensation for the librarians
who supported these projects.
5.2.3 Social Network Analysis of Roles supporting FBL
The FBL form of instruction lends itself to an examination of the social networks of the
roles involved beyond just teacher to students. In examining the data from this research the
following details were found. First was the central role of students and the various facilitation
roles that support student teams in FBL. There were some additional roles that supported these
facilitation roles such as the faculty lead and administrator roles at some programs. In terms of
the dynamics of the business librarians, some were gravitating closer to the center of action of
these networks and others were further removed. Business librarians and faculty in some schools
were quite close partners (MBA3 and MBA5).
The data on these networks represented in Appendix G assumed that the student team
was at the center of the network as depicted in Figure 5.2. For some roles such as administrators,
these positions often had other roles supporting the work they did, although this is not
represented in the tables in Appendix G. The one role not included in the tables in Appendix G
is the information technology role, which was not cited in the interviews mentioned as a specific
role that supported this learning. Such support, when mentioned at MBA1 and MBA4, was seen
as a basic utility and communication platform with no direct connection to FBL pedagogy, even
from an advocacy perspective. Students used online conferencing systems, video, email, Excel,
and Power Point programs as part of this learning, but they used the same information

136

technology tools for their other courses. There was nothing distinguishable about the role of IT
and FBL at any of the schools.
Appendix G includes a table with the levels of engagement of different roles in place to
support the FBL experience at each program. Roles that were required are represented by the
number “1” and worked more closely with student teams than the others. Level “2” indicates
optional roles that students were encouraged to use, while level “3” is a support role available
but not really promoted by the curriculum. “A” represents roles that advocated for the FBL
curriculum but had no direct connection in supporting student teams. Table G.1 counts the
number of roles connected with the FBL course at each of the six programs. Fewer roles were
mentioned, 4 and 7 respectively, at the programs where FBL was only an elective course (MBA1
and MBA6) than the average number for the other programs, which ranged from 6 to 11 roles
that supported teams. At MBA3, where FBL was a core class, only six types of roles were
identified that supported this learning. Another point revealed in this data was how in some
programs the administrator role was merely an advocate represented by the letter “A” for the
FBL curriculum whereas in one school this role was directly engaged with this learning as
represented by the number “1” which indicated that students were required to work with this role
as a required component of this learning.

137

Figure 5.2 Definitions of Level of Formality of Role Support for Student Teams

A figural network depiction of these roles and level of formality to student teams at each
of the six MBA programs is shown in Figure 5.3. Proceeding in the order of the numbers of
each MBA program, at MBA1, only four roles were identified. This was a program in which
according to the interviews the FBL courses were led by a faculty member without additional
support roles. Both the business librarian and career services professional were not very engaged
with these courses. However, this program did have a high level position reporting to the dean
who was an advocate for these courses and who identified curricular partnerships for the school.
At MBA2, there were more roles involved in FBL and the respondents mentioned
different roles that advised project teams on certain topics such as statistical analysis or
designing a survey. Students were encouraged to call upon these roles for assistance on an asneeded basis. The data set only lists the specific topic experts mentioned in the interviews, but
there appeared to be others that offered this type of support to teams as well. The business

138

librarians were also an “as needed” resource at this program where teams were not required to
meet with their assigned librarian.
Figure 5.3 Roles supporting FBL and Level of Formality at the Case Study Institutions

139

140

141

There were fewer roles supporting FBL at MBA3. At this school, which was similar to
MBA6, one faculty member advised all teams in the fall version of this course and led the
grading of their work. At MBA4 and MBA5, which also had the largest number of teams to
support at 65 and 80 respectively, there were many additional roles that supported this type of
learning and a separate faculty advisor or advisors for each team with the number of teams to
advisors ranging from one to six. At MBA5, there were two faculty members serving as advisors
to each team and grading their work. At MBA4, in addition to a faculty advisor responsible for
directly advising and grading the work, this program engaged recent alumni in this learning as
advisors to project teams in the role of Alumni Mentors. At MBA6, the faculty member and
course administrator worked together in the management of all aspects of the FBL course with
the faculty member directly advising teams and grading their work. At MBA4, each business
librarian was assigned to a student team, and served as the library’s coordinator and point person
with the FBL program at their school.
In terms of level of formality and engagement of different roles with student teams (see
tables in Appendix G), the programs at MBA2 and MBA5 had the most roles directly connected
with this learning. The level of engagement of the business librarian role varied. At MBA 1, the
business librarian was not engaged with this instruction at all; in two programs (MBA2 and
MBA6), the business librarians were positioned to be available to the students on a discretionary
basis; and in three programs (MBA3, MBA4, and MBA5), the business librarians had a more
direct, formal role in this learning where students were required to engage directly with them.
5.3 Summary of Research Question 4
This chapter reviewed the wide variety of roles that support FBL project courses at fulltime MBA programs. The chapter also examined various aspects of the interaction between

142

roles that provide this support and categorized types of roles by whether they were proactive or
reactive in their engagement with the FBL student teams working on these projects. Some roles
played more of a formal, central place in this learning and others had weaker ties. Some
commonalities included the faculty leads always playing a central formal role, while most of the
career services professionals functioned as “advocate” roles and team advisors in “level 2”
discretionary roles. Beyond these examples, there were no other similarities in specific roles
among the six programs in their level of proximity, engagement, and formal ties to supporting
student teams.

Chapter 6
Discussion
This chapter highlights themes and insights that emerged from this research. This
discussion reviews the strengths of FBL identified in this research and some challenges. The
chapter concludes with a review of unique opportunities presented by FBL for making MBA
education more relevant to the needs of today’s students and for further research.
6.1 Strengths of using FBL Pedagogy
The strengths of FBL instruction identified in this research include giving students the
opportunity to work on a real project at a company, to practice teamwork, and to learn techniques
from the field of consulting. The inclusion of diverse roles in FBL instruction also provides a
unique way for students to learn how to make effective use of knowledge expertise through the
personalized attention of FBL instruction.
6.1.1 Working on Real Business Projects
The respondents identified many benefits of the focused, specialized learning provided in
FBL with its facilitation by diverse roles. One benefit was the connections with the work that
real businesses are doing today. Companies are interested in these student projects because the
students’ work provides a fresh perspective on an actual challenge within a company.
Companies have also found that collaboration with FBL courses was useful way to identify
potential MBA talent. Reflecting on the popularity and success of these projects, one professor
stated that his program had a backlog of companies interested in partnering in FBL courses
(MBA4 Professor).

144

6.1.2 Practicing Team Work
Another benefit of this learning was the opportunity for students to experience intense
teamwork over an extended period. As stated by Edmondson and Nembhard (2009),
"observation and investigation has led to the identification of teams as a fundamental source of
learning and organizational effectiveness" (p. 124). Resolving interpersonal issues within the
teams while they were working on challenging projects was an important part of these courses.
The programs had procedures in place to provide teams with “just-in-time” coaching to address
the issues. Two programs (MBA4, MBA5) had specific advisors assigned to each team who
provided this coaching.
There were differing opinions among the faculty about students being formally graded on
process issues, although all the programs believed that developing team skills was an important
component of FBL. At MBA5, there was no graded assessment of such process outcomes. The
challenges a team might have faced working together did not matter if it successfully produced a
quality deliverable for the project sponsor. Other schools (MBA2, MBA3, and MBA6) felt it
was important for the student teams to be formally evaluated on their team work and included
this as part of their course grade.
6.1.3 Applying Consulting Techniques to FBL Projects
Three out of the six programs reviewed (MBA2, MBA3, and MBA4) emphasized the
positive benefits of incorporating consulting techniques into the student work on these projects.
These techniques involve project based problem solving methods used by management
consulting firms such as McKinsey (Friga, 2009; Rasiel, 1999) that students used in working on
the ambiguous situations in these projects. In those three programs, there were individuals with
experience in consulting who were involved in the curriculum design. This reflects the potential

145

influence of past experience and expertise in the development of “identity narratives” (Ashforth,
Harrison, & Corley, 2008) and the influence of “shared beliefs” (Biddle, 1986) in the design of
FBL courses.
These three programs credited their success with the inclusion of these techniques in their
curriculum. Two other programs, MBA5 and MBA6, did not include guidelines about the
consulting method as part of the instruction. They believed that students should apply what they
knew from prior experience or courses in the MBA program to the project problem. In their
view, any additional assistance and guidance could be provided on an as-needed basis by
different advisors and other support roles.
6.1.4 Receiving Personalized Attention
The structure of FBL project courses were almost completely focused on team meetings
where different advisors provided personalized support. This focused attention was a strength of
FBL. The only constraint was having enough advisors available to provide the necessary
guidance to students. As one librarian said, “….The more teams you have, the more difficult it is
to provide the personalized attention" (MBA5 Librarian).
6.1.5 Working with Knowledge Experts
As suggested years ago by Mintzberg (1973), an important competency of managers is
their ability to make effective use of the expertise at their disposal. Several respondents
discussed how FBL helped students develop their skills in identifying and using available
expertise when working on team projects (MBA2, MBA3, MBA4, and MBA6). These classes
made use of external professionals, non-faculty staff such as librarians, and faculty expertise in a
“just-in-time” fashion. One interviewee noted:
I think we also have a lot of ways of bringing in experts. So for instance, if the students
are going through a process of running a conjoint analysis or a survey we now have a
146

marketing professor who is an expert in the subject who will give assistance at the right
time of year for this project to those students. So I think it enables us to bring in some of
the academic expertise at the point of need vs. just in a completely classroom based
environment which is detached from reality. (MBA2 Career1)
This study provided evidence of how FBL instruction gave students experience in
learning how to effectively use the resources available to them, and how to reach out to and work
with experts. Organizations might provide expertise in all sorts of useful forms. But, if
managers do not know how to connect with as well as effectively make use of this help, such
resources often end up being underutilized, impeding innovation (Kleinbaum & Tushman, 2007).
Providing more focused instruction through FBL courses on effectively making use of experts
and understanding that resource network could also instill skills for coping with factors caused
by organizational change and minimizing potential harm caused by it (Judge et al., 1999).
There has been much written about the usefulness of organizations working to more
effectively “manage” or “enable” their organization’s knowledge (Davenport & Prusak, 1997;
Choo & Riva, 2010). There has also been research on how efforts by organizations to develop
these systems have faced challenges (Davenport & Cronin, 2000; Von Krogh, Nonaka, & Ichijo,
1997; Wilson, 2002). This study demonstrated that providing instruction and offering the
opportunity for business students to practice effectively using experts could be a way to begin
overcoming such challenges. It is possible that the fault lies not with the knowledge
management systems, but rather with the individuals who do not have the skills to effectively
make use of such a system. This research demonstrated how challenged student teams could be
in making use of the variety of expertise offered to them on their student projects. In this study,
it was found that many students were able through FBL to develop skills in this area.

147

6.2 Challenges Facing FBL Pedagogy
This study also identified challenges that programs faced in their delivery of FBL
courses. These included the issue of time and other limitations of working within an academic
format and the potential inadequacy of types and number of staff needed to provide customized
attention. Other factors included contending with the variability of projects reflective of the
changeability of business, the challenges faced in adapting to new roles to support FBL
instruction and adequately communicating learning outcomes to all stakeholders.
6.2.1 Learning within Time Constraints
Time constraints posed a problem to students gaining a meaningful learning experience
from FBL within the tight time frame of a two-year MBA program. A professor at one program
expressed his concern about this:
Everyone here, including our dean, talks about experiential education being really
important … But you know, they take something like 27 courses in their two years at
[business school name]. And the only required experiential course is the one I teach. So
they take a minimum of 1 out of 27 courses that are experiential. I don’t think we’re
breaking the bank here. (MBA2 Professor)
This professor later said that these time constraints and the limitations of what could be
accomplished within them required that that the “….FBL projects are, have to be pretty focused
for nine weeks, part time" (MBA2 Professor). In this program, the professor indicated that
working with business librarians within the nine-week time span of the course often did not
allow the students enough time to work with one. Another program described the extensive
work expected of teams in less than two months. At this program, this was the only course the
MBAs were taking during this time. As one professor said,
They’re working against heavy time constraints because they usually start collecting data
a couple of weeks into the project and they’ve got to have it wrapped up a couple of
weeks from the end because they have to write it all up, so they’ve got about three or four
weeks to imagine, collect, analyze and make sense of that data. (MBA5 Professor)
148

6.2.2 Allocating Credit Hours for FBL Courses
Another challenge was the faculty credit hour allocation (MBA2 and MBA5) and how to
apply this to a course that required such intensive personalized attention for each team. The
level of work required in advising each team was extensive, and presented a dilemma about the
allocation of credit hours to the faculty’s semester teaching requirements. For example, in
instances where a faculty member only worked with one team, it was unclear if that professor
would be given the same number of credits as a professor who was an adviser to several teams.
This was an issue that the programs were debating.
6.2.3 Contending with Capacity Issues
Given the growth and popularity of the FBL courses, having adequate staff to provide
and facilitate adequate support for teams was a challenge. Only three of the larger ten programs
in terms of the number of MBA students (798 to 1867 students) from the top 20 ranked schools
required an FBL course in their curriculum. One respondent described the growing popularity of
this course at his school with potential sponsor organizations and the resulting capacity
constraints. The professor said:
Because now we have like a waiting list of clients that want to submit projects into this
program. And given the size of it that’s a big order because we have 60 plus companies
whose projects -- or 70 companies who are involved in the program and there’s probably
another list of 35 or 40 that didn’t get their projects accepted. (MBA4 Professor)
Another program discussed the increasing demands of FBL. She said,
As the student body has grown over time the number of teams we’re supporting over time
-- I mean there was a time when each librarian might have six or so teams to support.
Now there are a couple of us who have 12 teams each to support…It’s a challenge.
(MBA2 Librarians)
Only in one program (MBA1) did the business librarian indicate that her team did not face these
capacity issues.

149

6.2.4 Making Adjustments based on Negative Student Feedback
In two programs, FBL had been changed to an elective and not a core course in response
to negative feedback from some students. The feedback reflected student resentment at being
required to take the class which they felt did not align with their expectations of their MBA
experience. Change based on student feedback could also affect the types of FBL support roles.
At one program (MBA2), due to negative feedback from students, a requirement for student
teams to meet with an assigned librarian at least once was discontinued.
6.2.5 Working with the Changing Dynamics of Real Projects
Another challenge was providing adequate levels of personalized support for projects
with a changing focus. The changeable focus of projects could affect the workload of roles
assigned to support a team. As one librarian said,
You may have situations where all of a sudden half way through the project the team
goes, ‘Oh, yeah, we’re no longer looking at this, we’re looking at something completely
different.’ …That happens about maybe 20, 25% of the time where all of a sudden you’re
sitting there, and it’s midway through ... and they’ll go, ‘Oh, my God, we have to change
things completely’. (MBA5 Librarian)
This comment describes the types of dramatic shifts that can occur with these projects
and the demands that this placed on those roles supporting them:
I was working with a company this last year that was going through major upheaval. The
CEO had left, there were layoffs -- impending layoffs, the moral in the company was
awful, and so the last thing that the sponsor thought would be appropriate is you bring in
a bunch of students who look like consultants. It made people very nervous. ..their travel
to the corporation was delayed. Furthermore, the project changed quite a bit. It went
from looking at one particular product line in one particular market to how they can do a
better job of implementing an e-commerce solution. So, it was one of these situations
where things change very rapidly, and it was really -- they ended up doing a great job.
They were -- the faculty was very pleased, but their experience, while less than ideal, in
retrospect this is one of those challenges that you overcome, then all of a sudden you go,
‘Oh, actually this was really good. This was a great accomplishment.’ So [this FBL
course] is not clean cut, it’s not simple, it’s not scripted, it’s a reality show that is reality,
as opposed to a reality show that’s scripted, and I think participating in that, from a
librarian standpoint, is fantastic, it is the best thing. (MBA5 Librarian)
150

While this business librarian saw benefits in the face of adversity, another respondent
emphasized how this could be problematic if communication among roles that support FBL
curriculum was not as clear as they could be and the limited resources were ineffectively
deployed. This librarian said, "….Often times the project description that we get, by the time
the students get together with their advisors, it’s changed and we are not informed of that change.
So we might do a lot of work that’s missing the mark" (MBA2 Librarian).
6.2.6 Adapting to New Roles
Some programs faced difficulties as individuals needed to adapt to new roles. Biddle
(1986) refers to this dynamic of individuals having new roles imposed upon them and the
challenges that can result as roles conflict, which he defines as “….the concurrent appearance of
two or more incompatible expectations for the behavior of a person” (p. 82). For example, a
respondent at MBA4 discussed how the library manager faced staff challenges with aligning all
the business librarians in their support of FBL. Business librarian roles that support FBL could
also conflict with the overall university library. Three business librarians (MBA2, MBA4,
MBA5) suggested that the highly engaged work with FBL was not typical in other parts of the
university, and that it could be difficult for the university library administration to appreciate the
demands of this type of work. Extra university-wide library project were often imposed on these
librarians, which made it difficult for them to adequately devote time to their FBL roles. In
comments on the increasing demands of supporting FBL, one librarian stated that their job roles
“haven’t changed…If anything, there’s been additive work coming from the central library…So
there’s not really a recognition from senior leadership about the work load on librarians” (MBA2
Librarians).

151

This study found that the majority of the librarians at the top 20 schools reported to the
central library and not the business school. This could be a factor that inhibited some business
librarians from having more of a formal role in FBL, since their library administrators might not
be familiar with FBL. Of the four programs in which business librarians had a formal role with
FBL, only one reported to the central library administration.
In addition to the business librarians, other positions were contending with changing roles
such as the greater need for logistical administrative support for these courses as well as new
types of team support roles. There were contentions over jurisdictional claim for authority over
various professional roles, as Abbott (1988) had described. In some cases, it appeared that claim
for the overall authority of the course came from the faculty lead (MBA2, MBA3, MBA6),
although in the other programs, the FBL administrator roles shared decision making
responsibilities with these faculty lead roles (MBA4, MBA5).
Abbott discussed this type of sharing and the potential tensions that could occur between
roles. Although the respondents did acknowledge their differences, this study did not expose
any evidence of strong tensions between roles at these two institutions, which suggested what
Abbott (1988) described as a settlement by division of labor. Abbott noted that “….occasionally,
a contest in jurisdiction results in a standoff. Such drawn contests are often followed by division
of jurisdiction into functionally interdependent but structurally equal parts” (p. 73). This study
collected data on the perspective of faculty. Interviewing FBL administrators as well could have
provided additional insights on the division of labor at these programs.
6.2.7 Communicating FBL Project Course Outcomes
The complexity of the design and administration of FBL courses could lead to
misunderstandings of what they accomplished because the outcomes of FBL pedagogy could be

152

difficult to measure. Consequently, it could be a struggle for leaders of these courses to
adequately describe to the school administration what outcomes were achievable. One professor
said,
And the main dean, the head dean had a bunch of strong ideas…He thought it did certain
things and he would tout it for doing things which it didn’t do and couldn’t do. So you
know, this was explicitly educating our managers. We’ve continued that, you know,
when I need, no other course has its teams like I do. (MBA2 Professor)
6.3 Implications
There are implications from this research for business and academic librarians and for the
MBA program curriculum.
6.3.1 Implications of this Research for Business and Academic Librarians
This study demonstrated that learning connected with real experiences was advocated in
business schools: “Experiential learning is a big area of growth for us here” (MBA2 Career1).
In terms of business library support, some programs indicated that their partnership with FBL
curriculum was growing alongside the expansion of FBL courses at their school. Said one
librarian, "….One of the things that’s really remarkable is that the school has expanded the
number of action learning programs that it has, and we’ve been able to sort of shift and move
around work in order for us to support that" (MBA5 Librarian). This respondent added that he
believed all business schools would prefer business librarians to be more involved in their FBL
courses:
I think there is enthusiasm on the part of the [MBA] program folks to have information
support for their teams. There just might not be universal desire on the part of the
libraries, especially if they have smaller staff. (Personal Communication, MBA5
Librarian, 7/7/16)
Biddle’s (1986) theory on the impetus for role changes in organizations suggested that
they could be agreed upon through consensus or imposed on roles through conformity. The data

153

collected in the case study interviews offered evidence that indicated that most business
librarians were consensually adapting to supporting the needs of FBL courses. This was
illustrated in the librarian interviewed from MBA5 who spoke about his team eagerly adjusting
and adapting to new roles in the face of the growth in the number of FBL courses at his program.
The online survey results, however, suggested that this level of engagement was not the norm. It
is possible that other programs could encounter role changes being imposed on them because of
the increased popularity of FBL and this more engaged form of project-oriented curriculum. The
Three Approaches model in this study depicted how business librarians were supporting FBL.
With that categorization, nine of the schools had not changed their model to support FBL and
were only providing reactive on-demand support.
This research contributed to knowledge of practical approaches for implementing the
embedded librarianship model that has gained momentum in academic libraries in the past few
years (Brower, 2011). The models in which business librarians were formally supporting FBL at
four of the six case studies provide detailed descriptions of their embedded approach within their
organizations. These comparative case studies offer a practical resource for librarians. The three
categories of support model: 1) self-service (proactive), 2) embedded (proactive) and 3) ondemand (reactive) could be a useful tool to apply to other areas of academic librarian work. The
model could be used for analysis of cases in which librarians are assuming more proactive vs.
traditional reactive roles (Budd, 2005; Grassian & Kaplowitz, 2009).
6.3.2 Implications of this Research for MBA Program Curriculum
In the area of MBA education, this research provides a detailed comparative exploration
of the mechanics and operational features of field-based learning (FBL) at six top MBA
programs. This study contributes to management education’s understanding of models for its

154

delivery and organization in different programs and with different roles. There is wide
agreement on the advantages of FBL in MBA curriculum (Brown et al., 2013; Datar et al., 2010)
but no comparative descriptions and analysis of the deployment of these courses. An additional
contribution of this review was describing how the courses taught MBAs about making effective
use of diverse expertise to complete a project. Being able to effectively develop networks when
they join an organization and to understand areas of expertise at their disposal are powerful skills
for students to learn.
Another implication for MBA education is the need for development of formal training
requirements for the design and teaching of FBL courses. For example, at MBA2 and MBA4,
most faculty and other support roles had not received formal training on working with FBL. The
AACSB offers a course on experiential learning (MBA2 Professor) and the annual LEPE
conference provides some tips and guidance (MBA2, MBA5, MBA6), but there were no formal
guidelines and educational requirements for those who lead and support FBL pedagogy. As
one respondent said, “I see a gap in the market for sort of how to teach this as a discipline to
other teachers and how to sort of develop these programs” (MBA2 Career1). This individual
spoke of how he learned to advise FBL team projects, "….I think my training was on the job
when I was with McKinsey so I sort of use what I got there" (MBA2 Career1). One program
(MBA5) offered a type of apprenticeship model where more experienced faculty provided
guidance to faculty who were new working with FBL.
This lack of a standard method of training on the FBL approach was an intriguing
omission when considering all the roles that support FBL. The amount of effort expended in
curriculum design and in determining the support roles needed for various sorts of guidance to
student teams reflected an awareness of the variety of expertise that was needed. However,

155

there were differing opinions on which roles should do what in the design and support of
curriculum and what prerequisite courses the students should be required to take before they
embarked on these FBL projects. Several respondents cited the challenges of maintaining a
consistency of practice in terms of how faculty advisors and other supporting roles worked with
different teams. Training requirements or a set of formal guidelines for FBL courses drawn from
research like this study would be a helpful contribution to MBA education.
6.4 Limitations
As seen in Chapter 5, FBL support roles were identified to inform a basic understanding
of the social networks involved in these activities. However, the small sample size of only
collecting data from 21 individuals from the six institutions for the case studies limited the
opportunity for generalization of results and broader understanding of the norms of FBL in MBA
education. A complete social network analysis of this phenomenon would require a larger
sample and gathering additional data from respondents on the perceptions of the levels of
engagement of different roles involved to determine which carry more “social capital” in the
support of a school’s FBL curriculum. Another limitation of this study was that it was designed
to collect data sequentially and did not include the opportunity to return to respondents at the
case institutions to probe further into insights identified after an initial analysis of the interview
transcripts. The study also only reflected the viewpoints of the categories of respondents
included in this study. For example, a group that could be surveyed would be MBA students to
collect information on what they think of FBL courses and their impact on their development as
managers.

156

6.5 Future Research
The results of this study suggest that there are many avenues for future research with
FBL that include:
1. Explore Roles in Greater Depth
In this study, the business librarian role was explored in greater depth than the other
roles. Although this research led to a greater appreciation of the business librarian role as one of
the knowledge experts who support FBL, the interviews revealed that it was the faculty, and not
the librarians, who referred to business librarians as experts. The role business librarians play in
FBL as experts in secondary data identification and collection could be explored further. The
social network model could be used to identify where business librarians see their role in relation
to other facilitators and how connected they are to student team project support. Future research
could also further explore all the FBL facilitator roles as experts who support student teams and
the extent to which teams make use of this expertise.
The results from this dissertation showed how FBL offers a unique way to teach MBA
students about effectively working with knowledge experts for assistance with projects. A future
study could investigate student team interactions with these FBL expert contributor roles and
how this practice helps students become more adept knowledge workers. A possible other
method of examination of MBA students would have been to elicit the perspectives of students
who had taken FBL courses as well as those who had not and collecting data to explore whether
participating in this type of experiential learning had a positive impact on students’ postgraduation work experiences.

2. Expand Perspectives
Expanding the study sample beyond the top 20 U.S. full-time MBA institutions to all 50
in the U.S. News & World Report list would allow further exploration of the norms of FBL
curriculum structure and facilitation among different business schools. Other types of
institutional rankings of MBA programs could also be used to identify a larger sample. For
example, expanding beyond just U.S. schools by referencing the schools listed in the Financial
Times’ Global MBA Ranking (Financial Times, 2017) would provide a potential sample for an
international, comparative analysis of FBL curriculum.
Another approach for expanding perspectives on FBL support could be to gather
observations from other parts of the university beyond the business school. For example, in this
study, two business librarians shared that they believed that the central library administration did
not appreciate the heavy workload required to support the FBL projects. Consequently, it would
be helpful to interview senior library administrators to obtain their perspectives on FBL at their
institution’s business school and how their business librarians support this type of instruction.
At business schools there are other positions that were not examined in this dissertation.
Understanding the views of the FBL administrators would offer alternative insights, since the
data showed that professors believed that it was their role to be the primary designers of FBL
curriculum. Research could be designed to see if FBL administrators share that view and to
discern other characteristics of how they perceive their role. It would also be helpful to
interview business school deans to explore how their backgrounds from business practice or
academia influenced how FBL is deployed at their program. Given their core leadership role of
the business school as described in Chapter 5, these individuals are responsible for directing their
school’s strategy. Conducting research to gain an in depth understanding of their views on the

158

choices their school has made about its FBL offerings could offer a useful complement to this
research.
In addition, it would be helpful to explore the perspectives of the companies and
organizations that have sponsored FBL projects. These sponsors could offer unique insights into
this pedagogy’s goal of giving students the opportunity to experience solving real business
problems. It would be valuable to better understand the sponsors’ perspectives on the successes,
failures, and challenges they have experienced while working with the student teams, and also to
elicit their impressions of how these projects should be structured, supported, and evaluated.
3. FBL Outcomes Metrics
The findings of this dissertation highlighted the importance of outcome measures in this
area of MBA learning. As reported in Chapter 4, the respondents indicated that grades did not
adequately account for the value proposition of FBL. Different outcome measures are needed,
although as this study found, the outcomes of FBL can be difficult to measure. Student grades
were primarily focused on the student team final report or the teams’ presentation to the project
sponsor. Some schools included process learning as part of the grade, although respondents
reported misgivings about the effectiveness of their evaluation methods. For example, low
grades on these projects might not account for the potential of positive process learning
outcomes offered by learning from failure. Research has shown that this can potentially lead to
success (Cannon & Edmondson, 2005; Edmondson, 2011; McGrath, 2011; Sitkin, 1992).
One approach to creating new metrics would be conducting a comparative analysis of the
measures that have been used to examine the return on investment (ROI) of the MBA. For
example, Rubin and Dierdorff (2009) conducted a study on the alignment of MBA curriculum
with managerial competencies. It would be important to determine which measures identified

159

might be relevant to FBL curriculum and additional measures that might need to be developed.
Areas unique to FBL might include an assessment of whether schools charge project sponsors a
fee for this work and its impact on curricular outcomes, and documentation of the extent
sponsors change their project focus while teams are working on them. This could be used to
evaluate how a change in the focus of a student project affected not only the support role
structures, but also the student team outcomes.
Another area related to outcome measures would involve assessing the value proposition
of FBL to the project sponsors. This approach could explore the extent to which the sponsoring
companies actually adopted the recommendations of the MBA students.
Ultimately, a large longitudinal study could gather data on the various near-term, midterm, and long-term outcomes of FBL. Such a study could include a control group of MBA
programs. This would be of tremendous value to MBA education and the current concern about
the relevance of the MBA degree in the 21st century business environment (Datar et al., 2010;
GMAC, 2013). A longitudinal study could demonstrate the long-term value of FBL in MBA
programs and result in a group of outcome measures that could be used by others focused on
learning through practice.
6.6 Conclusion
In this study, FBL was shown to bring the ever-changing issues facing today’s business
into the teaching of business schools, and to give MBAs the opportunity to practice what they are
learning in a robustly supported environment from a diverse range of experts, including business
librarians. The rich data uncovered by this dissertation on FBL project curriculum reveals
details on an important focus of business school pedagogy and how business librarians as well as
other roles participate in it.

160

The FBL projects help to prepare students for the diverse real demands of managerial
work. Each school had their own model for the grouping of roles providing customized support
to guide these team projects. Schools varied in the structure of their courses, the definition of
roles, and levels of role support engagement, with some roles more proactive than others. In
conducting this research and reviewing the literature, it appears that no other researchers are
studying the curriculum structure of FBL, the roles that support it, and their theoretical constructs
that were the focus of this study. The findings of this dissertation provide an opening to new
avenues of research in the disciplines of both library science and management education. As
higher education institutions continue to consider how to bring more immersive experiences into
their programs, this research offers new insights for decision makers, instructors, librarians, and
instructional designers to consider as FBL pedagogy continues to evolve and takes a more central
place in today’s academy.

Appendix C: Summary of six case studies
The following are summaries of the six programs examined as case studies and how they
provided support for FBL. The data included in these summaries was derived from the website
review as well as from interviews conducted with respondents from these institutions.
MBA Program 1 (MBA1)
School Background Information
Brief overview of the full-time MBA program. This two-year, full-time program was
located in a major metropolitan area. The core curriculum included two full-term courses and
eight half-term courses taken in the first year with electives in the second year. Most students
completed an internship in the summer between the first and second year.
Business librarians function. This school had a business library located in the business
school with four business librarians. The head librarian reported to and received funding from
the central library. Business librarian duties included providing reference assistance for students
with their work on class research projects or, as part of students’ job search process, researching
background information on companies or industries for interviews and career exploration. This
library had recently created a “Starter Guide” that was posted to all the core course pages in this
school’s course management system. This guide served as an introductory guide for the MBA
students highlighting the key resources they needed to know about in the business library.
Career services function. Career services professionals had roles coaching students as
well as identifying companies to recruit their graduates. Most of the individuals in this
department specialized in specific industry sectors. This career services department also
included an individual responsible for their “video department” creating videos for students with
tips for job searches and examples from the field of the work experiences of alumni.

198

Faculty function. The faculty members at the school were a mix of tenured, tenuretrack, and adjunct faculty. Field-based learning courses were often led by adjunct faculty. In
addition to the full-time MBA program, this school had other versions such as an Executive
MBA program and an accelerated MBA option.
School’s Approach to Experiential Field-based Learning
Field-based learning (FBL) was not required at this program and was offered in several
elective classes. FBL was required at this program about 12 years ago until student complaints
about being required to take an FBL course led to the course being removed from the core course
load. One interviewee indicated that this also might have occurred because of the intensive
workload on faculty to lead these sorts of courses. She also indicated that she believed there
were fewer of these types of courses in the elective offerings now than there used to be. Of the
FBL courses in this program, many had an entrepreneurship character. This researcher was
unable to identify any norms about deliverables and modes of evaluation of these projects.

199

Learning Support and Guidance for FBL
The librarians were not formally connected to FBL. When invited, they would give
presentations to an FBL class for about a half hour. The librarians would focus these
presentations on sources available to help students with research on the real-world projects they
had been assigned in these courses. The librarians would create a LibGuide that they posted in
the school’s course management system of recommended resources. The librarian indicated that
students contacted the librarians when they needed help. There was no formal structure for the
librarians to meet with student teams for FBL projects. The librarian indicated that they typically
would only meet with one member of the student team to provide assistance. She estimated that
with these classes, they would provide assistance to 25% of the teams. They had never
conducted a survey, but she assumed that students did not contact the librarians for assistance
because the LibGuide included most of the information needed by the students. “They’re kind
of happy and if they get stuck they come to us,” said the librarian. In general, librarians do not
work very closely with MBA students on these projects.

The business librarians did not

received information on the number of student teams and the students in those teams.
The career services area did not have any direct role with FBL. Instead, the career
services staff helped students promote what they had learned from the FBL course as part of their
job search process. Faculty members were responsible for developing and managing the courses.
No other specifics were identified from the interviews conducted of other roles involved in FBL.
A review of this school’s website indicated that alumni also often played supporting roles on the
FBL projects. This program also recently created a role that reported directly to the dean in
charge of identifying partnerships for the school such as sponsors for FBL student projects.

200

Organization of FBL and Models of Delivery
Very little on the specifics of the organization behind the structure of this learning was
located for this program. The only central organizing concept was that a unified label had been
assigned to this specific type of course at this school. The interviewees did indicate, however,
that experiential learning was an important initiative for the school that originated from the
dean’s office.
Outcomes of FBL on Students and Graduates
Both interviewees thought outcomes from these courses were good. The career services
professional indicated that he had definitely seen the benefits of students doing these courses and
getting jobs. He also felt these courses were helpful in terms of adding new skill sets to student
resumes and obtaining practical experience in a skill area that was valued in companies that
students were considering for jobs. The respondents from an information perspective could not
identify any specific examples they had seen at their school where FBL project learning had
provided significant outcomes.
MBA Program 2 (MBA2)
School Background Information
Brief overview of the full-time MBA program. This full-time MBA two-year program
was located in a rural setting. The entire first year included required courses with the courses
grouped by half semesters or quarters.

An FBL course was a required class in the second half

of the spring semester. This program also had a “global immersion” requirement that could be
fulfilled by taking one of the two globally oriented FBL elective courses. Students typically only
took electives in their second year. Between their first and second year, students completed an

201

internship at a company or organization. According to one interviewee, this program had the
same curriculum for a long time. This school had only a full-time, two-year MBA program.
Business librarians function. This school had a business library that was located
between the engineering and business schools and was funded by and reported to both schools.
Despite this reporting arrangement, this library’s staff was also involved with a lot of work with
activities of the central university library. There were six librarians. Although the team worked
together, half of them technically were business librarians and the other half were engineering
librarians.
Career services function. Career services professionals had roles in coaching students
and identifying companies to recruit their graduates. Most of the individuals in this department
specialized in specific industry sectors or functional areas such as consulting or marketing, and
they had work experience in their area of specialization. For example, one had been in
investment banking and the other in the consulting and entertainment sector. One of the
respondents spoke about making use of their network of professional contacts as part of the job
searching and networking assistance to MBA students. One interviewee was also an alumnus of
the program.
Faculty function. Tenured, tenure-track, and adjunct faculty taught courses in this
program. A tenured faculty member led the FBL course, although adjunct faculty members
served as the faculty coaches for each team.
School’s Approach to Experiential Field-based Learning
The faculty respondent said that his school had been doing experiential field-based
learning projects since the 1970s. The primary job of the faculty member currently leading the
core FBL course was designing the structure of the course curriculum and managing the faculty

202

advisors to coach each team. This faculty member’s subject discipline was in decision science.
There were nine faculty advisors. The lead faculty member hosted a weekly lunch meeting with
all of the advisors to check on their progress and “to keep them running the course in a similar
way because our students are very sensitive to differences in that way” (MBA2 Professor).
This was a required course in the second part of spring term (nine weeks) in the first year.
All the students worked on projects in teams of five; this meant that in a given course, there
would be 55 - 60 teams. Students were able to choose their own teams. Approximately 100
potential projects were presented from the sponsors to the students, who selected about half of
the possible projects. Each team had a faculty advisor, also called “faculty coach,” who would
be their principal faculty member for the course, meet with students weekly to coach them
through the process, and grade their work. All projects required quantitative and qualitative
research elements and were generally marketing projects. This school did not charge sponsors
for the student work which could include both American and international projects.
There was a kick-off meeting for the FBL course at the end of March. Librarians were
introduced at this time. The MBA students received their project assignments at the end of
February, and some started working with their librarians as soon as they received their projects.
The teams were assigned to a librarian but were not required to meet with their librarian. The
faculty member did not think that all projects lent themselves to needing assistance from the
librarians. He said that only 15 to 20 teams needed this kind of help, but those that did really
gained a lot from a librarian’s assistance.
In addition to their PowerPoint deliverable to the client, students were required to write a
team reflection paper on what they had learned not only from the project itself but the process of
working with their team. Teams were not only graded for their presentation to the sponsor but

203

also on how they worked together as a team. Each team collaboratively wrote a debrief report on
their work together in addition to each student writing an individual reflection paper.
The current faculty lead had redesigned the required FBL course to include “consulting
methodology” that incorporated the type of techniques for solving and working on complex
problems used by the leading management consulting firms such as McKinsey & Company and
Boston Consulting Group. There were a number of interim deliverables required of project
teams such as a one-page description of the problem, a work plan, and drafts of interim
deliverables. There was an elective winter term class on the consulting method and problem
solving that an estimated 25% of the MBA class attended. The faculty member felt that this
course was great preparation for the required FBL course, although many students did not think
it was necessary, particularly those who had previously worked in consulting.
This program also offered two global FBL courses. They were team-based courses that
were supported by business librarians and other roles. One of the respondents said that students
typically would conduct most of their research before travelling to the country where the project
was based:
[This course]…is a second year elective that they can sign up for. This is usually [with]
companies [who] pay to have a student team come and do consulting work for them.
There’s no cost to the student even though they might be flying somewhere else in the
world. And they usually are three or four weeks in phase one, which is mostly secondary
research on campus, and then there’s a three week in country piece of consulting which
will be done at the client site usually. And then finally the other piece of experiential
learning [that]…is somewhere between sort of a tourist trip and a class in that students
will go to a foreign country accompanied by a professor. There will be pre-work for
them to do to understand the culture and the topic areas that they’re to learn about, and
then the professor will take them on a series of visits to both companies and some cultural
sites as well. They really get an immersive experience of what it’s like to be a business
leader in that particular country. (MBA2 Career1)

204

Learning Support and Guidance for FBL
There was an administrative director for the required FBL course program who was
responsible for identifying viable projects that met the course’s goals. The director had an
assistant who helped with managing the logistics for these projects, and she worked very closely
with the faculty lead on the administrative aspects. The faculty lead was responsible for
curriculum design, and was a faculty coach for five student teams. Every team had a faculty
coach, and some faculty advisors would coach more than one team. On an as-needed basis, this
school hired experts from the faculty and the community to advise student projects. One career
services professional also served as a faculty coach for a student team, and had also served as a

205

coach for one of the global FBL courses. He was the only person in the career services
department also serving this role.
Six librarians supported FBL teams with one librarian assigned per team. The library
director supported some teams, and some librarians supported as many as 12 teams. One
librarian would review all FBL course project descriptions and then assign teams to different
librarians. For about 2 years, all the student teams were required to meet one time with their
librarian; however, this was no longer required because the program felt “requiring too much
stuff was taxing the students” (MBA2 Librarians). Librarians also made Libguides to support
teams. Librarians were also assigned to teams for the second year global FBL elective course.
They typically supported 12 of these teams in the fall term of the second year.
Organization of FBL and Models of Delivery
The current faculty member who was head of the core FBL course was in charge but
there was no official person to whom he reported. He was a tenured professor who had been at
the school for many years. He wrote an annual report on the course for the dean. He did so only
because he felt it was the right thing to do and because he was managing a budget for the course,
although he was under no obligation to do this. At his institution, faculty had a great deal of
autonomy. In 2014, the school designated an established place in the business school where the
administrators of the core FBL course as well as the two global FBL elective courses were
located. This brought together the administration of three business school experiential learning
project offerings in one place. Only administrative staff members, and not faculty, were
assigned to this new location.

206

Outcomes of FBL on Students and Graduates
Everyone interviewed felt the FBL course was beneficial to most students. Said one
respondent:
So five fantastic, five real disasters and in the middle, they almost all do really good work
for a real person and I think they learn a fair amount about client management… getting
out of yourself to listen to what her problem is and what she is struggling with, right, and
kind of, I don’t know the right psychological terms, but getting enthused by working with
her and helping her and helping them and that company or that organization or whatever,
and coming up with ideas and supporting them with good thinking and good data. And if
we’re really lucky, even having them change, even have them adapt, adopt our
recommendations. (MBA2 Professor)
Librarians distributed surveys to determine whether student experiences with librarians were
positive or negative. However, in this program, there had not been any systematic efforts in
gathering data on the information related outcomes of student work with the FBL course.
MBA Program 3 (MBA3)
School Background Information
Brief overview of the full-time MBA program. This two-year full-time MBA program
was located in a large city. The curriculum was structured so that all the core courses were
scheduled in the fall semester of the first year. The fall courses were organized within three
blocks. Some courses such as economics spanned one block, while others spanned two. The
FBL course was the only course to span all three blocks. The only additional required courses in
other semesters were the FBL elective course in the spring semester of the first year and a
leadership course required in the second year of the program. Between the first and second
years, these students typically completed an internship in a company or organization.
Business librarians function. The business library was located within the main library
with a team of five business librarians who reported to the university librarian with a dotted line
reporting to the Business School as well. The business library received its funding from the
207

business school. The team worked together to provide reference support for job searches and
student research projects. Each librarian also served as a liaison to different programs or
departments such as the full-time MBA liaison or the liaison to the career services department.
Career services function. Career services professionals had roles coaching students and
identifying companies to recruit their graduates. Most of the individuals in this department
specialized in specific industry sectors or functional areas such as consulting or marketing. The
head of the career services department reported to the same person as the Associate Dean for
FBL project courses.
Faculty function. Instruction was provided by tenured, tenure-track, and adjunct faculty.
In addition to the full-time MBA program, this school also had other types of MBA programs
such as an evening MBA program for working professionals in which all classes were scheduled
in the evenings or weekends and an accelerated MBA program. The school also had a Bachelor
of Business Administration (BBA) program.
School’s Approach to Experiential Field-based Learning
In this school, FBL projects were required in both the first and second semester in the
first year of the full-time, two-year MBA program. In the fall semester course, an FBL project
was combined with course work based on the consulting method. The project for this course was
a simulated case study in which student teams separately applied the methods they had learned in
class to solve the client’s problem as if it were a real business. In evaluating work along the
way, the teaching team took on the personas of a business professional from the fictitious
company in evaluating the work of student teams.
The teaching team for this course included the lead faculty member who was also the
Associate Dean for FBL at this school, a communications faculty member, and the business

208

librarian who was the liaison to the full-time program. Students were assigned to teams which
they worked with in this class and other classes throughout their fall semester. Mid-way through
the course, the students presented their recommendations for this project. As a final learning
experience, students were assigned to 30 different teams for a one-day intensive experiential
activity in which the team was given a simulated company problem to solve in four hours. At
the end, the teams were expected to present their team’s recommendations.
In the spring semester, the MBAs were required to take another FBL course. They were
able to choose among six course elective options in different topics that focused on projects with
actual clients. For example, one elective course focused on the financial valuation of a
prospective business deal while another focused on market opportunity and promotion analysis.
Most of the teams presented their findings as part of a team exercise and also at a one-day event
at the end of the semester. The submissions were judged by faculty and staff, including business
librarians from other areas in the business school, alumni, and business professionals from the
community.
Many of the projects included one client project per student team. The students bid on
the potential projects. In other cases, the project was structured to allow either multiple teams or
the entire class to work on the same project. This second type of format allowed the class to see
the different approaches and eventual recommendations to solving the client’s problem from
each team.
Guidance for gathering information was included as part of the instruction and structure
of deliverables in the core fall class. The business librarian was part of the teaching team and
provided instruction based on frameworks designed for the course and readings called “briefs,”
which were written with the Associate Dean for the program. The business library director also

209

supported some teams. Structure was built into the program so that all teams scheduled
appointments with one of the business librarians for guidance. The full team was required to
meet with the librarian at least once.
The deliverables for the core course included a final slide deck and interim deliverables
that demonstrated the teams’ work plan. The majority of these deliverables were graded by the
lead faculty member but some, particularly the final team presentation, had different components
evaluated by all three members of the teaching team. The business librarians provided input on
the secondary research aspect of these presentations. When student teams presented their
classmates were given the opportunity to evaluate the team presentations through a ranking
system. At the end of the course, each team completed an evaluation form in which they
identified the strengths and challenges they faced in their work together. The lead faculty
member would review this material for additional insights in the grading process.
In the elective FBL courses, the deliverables included a presentation which was graded
by the lead faculty. The faculty decided what other deliverables were required from the teams
during the semester. Some of these classes mixed classroom instruction with field-based project
work, while others completed most work outside of the classroom.

210

Learning Support and Guidance for FBL
In the case of the core FBL course, the lead faculty, communications faculty member,
and business librarian were the teaching team in which all played formal support roles. Each
team was assigned a second-year MBA coach who would provide advice as needed, particularly
with issues involving team dynamics. These second-year MBA coaches had received additional
training to provide this support.
Alumni and other business professionals were also often available as needed for guidance
to students. This was the case with other faculty in the program as well. For example, those
with marketing expertise might be contacted by teams for assistance with a particular part of
their project in that area. Alumni, business school staff, and faculty also served as presentation
judges when student teams presented their recommendations. Career services professionals did

211

not play a formal role in this learning, beyond working with students on career goals and the
development of skills of interest to employers.
The business librarians taught a business intelligence workshop which was required in the
core FBL course. They also met with student teams, created together detailed resource guides
for the student projects, served as presentation judges, and evaluated final presentations with a
specially designed rubric for scoring information-related components. The librarians also
summarized observations of the team’s work on research and shared it with the faculty as part of
the evaluation process.
Organization of FBL and Models of Delivery
Organizationally, the leader of the program was the Associate Dean who was responsible
for overseeing all the FBL courses at the school. This individual reported to the Vice Dean for
Programs who then reported to the Dean. The Associate Dean’s assistant and another staff
member assisted with the administrative and logistical aspects of this program. In this smaller
school, assistance came from other staff and faculty areas as needed. The Associate Dean had
been a professor in academia for over 20 years but had also worked in consulting. The Associate
Dean was also responsible for the design and teaching of the FBL curriculum in the core course
and working with the faculty who taught the FBL elective courses to assure that their courses
included references to the consulting methodology and problem solving content taught in the fall
core FBL class. This role was also responsible for the coordination of identifying potential
project clients.
Most of the clients who provided projects paid fees for the project work of the MBA
students. In some elective courses, clients were not charged although this was changing. This
program was the newest program in the study, having been established in 2009. It had taken a

212

few years to determine what the best structure was for the FBL course. The establishment of a
formal Associate Dean leadership role in 2012 for this program helped the school implement the
current structure that was “still a work in progress” (MBA3 Professor).
Outcomes of FBL on Students and Graduates
The interviewees related how difficult it was to accurately assess the outcomes of this
type of learning since the real student learning could only be tested after the students graduated
and were in the workforce. Respondents reported that a number of students who returned from
their summer internships acknowledged how the course had helped them. Some alumni had said
the same.
A form included in the fall semester core FBL course evaluation materials asked students
about their experience with the business intelligence instruction, work in the area of BI
throughout the course, and their skills in business information gathering. This form was
distributed to each class for the past three years with a response rate each time between 90 to
100%. In all surveys, over 70% of the MBAs said these skills had increased. The other two
options were “stayed the same” and “gone down.” Very few said “gone down” although in those
instances, the students comments indicated that with greater awareness of the resources available
and the need to effectively gather information, they realized that they knew a great deal less
about information gathering than they thought they did.
MBA Program 4 (MBA4)
School Background Information
Brief overview of the full-time MBA program. This program was a two-year, full-time
MBA program located in a major city. Core classes were held in the first year and elective

213

classes in the second year, with students typically completing an internship in the summer in
between those years.
Business librarians’ function. There were three business librarians who also assumed
standard reference duties for student career and class research projects. The librarians were
located in the business school, reported to the central library, and were co-funded by the central
library and business school.
Career services function. Career service professionals had roles in coaching students as
well as identifying companies to recruit their graduates. Most of the individuals in this
department specialized in specific industry sectors or functional areas such as consulting or
marketing. Career support positions were organized by different sector verticals focused on
career advising and corporate outreach in those sectors.
Faculty function. Instruction was provided by a combination of tenured, tenure-track,
and adjunct faculty. In addition to the full-time MBA program, this school also had other types
of MBA programs such as an evening MBA program for working professionals in which all
classes were held in the evenings or weekends.
School’s Approach to Experiential Field-based Learning
This school had offered some form of FBL project learning since the 1967. Every MBA
student was required to work on a FBL project. Most MBA students completed the FBL course
in their second year to complete this six month requirement. They could begin in the fall or
spring. There were typically 65 teams, each with 4 to 6 students, which held weekly team
meetings with the client and faculty advisor. There was one faculty advisor for every one to
four teams. Of the 18 to 20 advisors, a third were academics and two-thirds were adjunct faculty

214

or lecturers with business experience. The program had recently structured the schedule so that
students worked on these projects on Wednesdays.
The professor interviewed for this study said that “….the quality of the research is quite
good” and that the business library was very active in supporting the secondary research
component of this FBL course. The student team work was graded by their faculty advisor.
Evaluation was based on peer assessment, the quality and quantity of research, team work and if
the recommendations added value to the client.
The majority of the students completed the main FBL course, although they also had the
option of a business creation course in which they could start their own business. A few students
completed this requirement by doing an independent study. The program also offered a
specialized field elective for students who were interested in consulting in their first year. This
self-selected group included about 20 students across four projects that were sourced by the
students who were solving a business problem for real clients.

215

Learning Support and Guidance for FBL
The roles other than the faculty team advisors who supported these projects included the
team effectiveness advisor who collected a personality profile of team members and coached
them on teamwork issues, and a communications faculty member who advised the teams on
writing and presentation skills. There were also various workshop presenters who described
tools and methods appropriate for these projects such as interviewing for primary data and
conjoint analysis. Attendance at these workshops was not required; it was left up to the teams to
determine if they thought the subject would be helpful to their project. This school also had
alumni mentors who were recent graduates and who were available as needed as resources for
teams.
Three business librarians supported students working on these projects. A librarian was
assigned to each team, which was required to meet with that librarian early in the course to
review sources relevant to their project. Each librarian created a project-specific LibGuide of
resources for the teams. The business library director also supported some teams. After the
librarians met once with their teams, the teams often returned for help with their research. The
business library also had a coordinator position that served as the liaison with the FBL course.
Organization of FBL and Models of Delivery
The academic director for the FBL course designed the curriculum. He had been in the
position for two years and reported to the Academic Dean for Field Studies Programs who
reported to the Academic Dean for the business school. (There was also a “non-academic”
Dean). The structure of his predecessor’s role was similar to his. He had been in academia for
20 years, switched to work at a major U.S. consulting firm for 20 years, and had just recently

216

returned to academia. This program also had a director of the FBL course who was responsible
for the administrative, non-curricular parts of the program and team project logistics.
Companies paid a fee to participate in the FBL core course. Fees differed depending on
the size of the company or organization. The faculty member shared that over the past five
years, the program was better organized, and that they now had a waiting list of clients that
wanted to submit projects to this program. A new head librarian of the business library started
three years ago. Since that time, she had been working to better integrate the business librarians
in the FBL course. This school also had a resource bank of examples of past successful projects,
as well as guidelines and video lectures on a variety of topics that students could review to
support their work.
Outcomes of FBL on Students and Graduates
The respondents said it was difficult to evaluate the outcomes of this type of learning.
They had received ad hoc feedback from students who returned from internships and alumni who
felt the learning offered value and prepared them well for facing work demands. The faculty
lead indicated that the program had been growing and had become very popular with potential
sponsors for projects in the past five years. This, he believed, indicated that the learning had
positive outcomes and that their graduates appreciated the practical knowledge. It was assumed
there were also positive gains in the information skill area, although the librarian spoke of her
frustration in helping students on these projects. The librarian was unsure if the MBA students
always “got it.” She said she wished the business librarians could be more integrated to provide
instruction on these skills, but indicated that it had not been part of the library’s culture in the
past. She was hoping that eventually, she could change this but was still new in her role at this
school.

217

MBA Program 5 (MBA5)
School Background Information
Brief overview of the full-time MBA program. This two-year, full-time MBA program
located in a smaller city offered the core courses in the first year and electives in the second year.
They typically completed an internship in the summer between those years. Students who
completed the core FBL class in the spring of their first year worked on the course exclusively
for seven weeks.
Business librarians’ function. Of the nine librarians in business library, six supported
the FBL project teams. All programs at their school have some type of FBL project required
course experience except for the part-time MBA program. For almost all of these FBL courses, a
librarian was assigned to each team in that course. The school was very focused on action
learning, and there were few times in the year when the business librarians were not supporting
project teams for an FBL course in one of the business school’s programs.
Career services function. Career service professionals had roles coaching students as
career coaches, as well as identifying companies to recruit their graduates. Most of the
individuals in this department specialized in specific industry sectors or functional areas such as
consulting or marketing.
Faculty function. Instruction was provided by a combination of tenured, tenure-track,
and adjunct faculty. In addition to the full-time MBA program, this school also offered other
types of MBA programs such as an evening MBA program, executive MBA, part time MBA,
global MBA, and weekend MBA. The school also had a Bachelor of Business Administration
(BBA) program.
School’s Approach to Experiential Field-based Learning

218

The required FBL course in the full-time MBA program always took place in the first
year of the full-time MBA program in the second part of the second semester. For those seven
weeks, the MBAs worked exclusively on this course. Many of these projects were outside of the
United States. The MBA students were assigned teams, and were able to bid on projects.
Membership on a team was dependent on the student’s interest in that project. The degree of
difficulty varied with the projects and there were limitations on the amount of work that could be
accomplished given the time constraints. Typically, there were approximately 80 team projects
each spring.
The faculty graded projects and overall team performance, with a major focus on the
quality of the final client deliverable. They did not grade the project on the quality of the team
interactions. This FBL course started in 1992 in the full-time MBA program. They included
FBL project courses in other MBA programs but organized them differently.

219

Learning Support and Guidance for FBL
There was a managing director of the FBL course, who had assistance from various roles.
Students were assigned to groups of four to six team members, with each assigned two faculty
advisors, and some assigned coaches. Each team also had a communications faculty member
who supported them. Some advisors were full-time faculty and some adjuncts. Each team was
also assigned a second-year MBA student peer advisor. The two full-time faculty advisers
assigned to each project team were called the “travelling advisor” and the other the “nontravelling advisor” (MBA5 Professor). The travelling advisor was the liaison to the organization
sponsoring the project. Typically, both faculty advisors were tenure track, although one tended
to have more experience with the FBL course. There were many formal roles to support the
course because of the large number of projects. For example, there were administrative roles in
the program dedicated to finding projects for the students.
The career services department did not have a formal role with the FBL course, although
they trained 50 second-year MBA students to serve as peer career coaches and used an
experiential learning and role playing approach in this training. This exemplified how this school
broadly espoused action learning in many facets of its MBA experience. The school also had a
learning officer who observed the work of teams and whose job was to be alert to the tacit
learning taking place, and to try to codify and assess lessons learned to share with the teaching
group for this course.
Business librarians were assigned to each team and had a formal role with the curriculum
through team meetings. There were five and a half business librarians supporting teams from the
FBL course. They were very much engaged and familiar with the planning for the FBL course.
Typically, each librarian supported from 14 to 18 teams. The business library director also

220

supported some teams. Librarians would attempt to meet with all their teams the first week of
the project. After that time, they scheduled meetings with teams as needed. In some cases, they
might not hear again from teams that did not need much secondary research. Approximately,
25% of the teams needed very little librarian support, 25% needed a high level of support and the
remainder were somewhere in between. When projects shifted midway, students often returned
to their business librarian for help in finding new data.
Organization of FBL and Models of Delivery
There was a faculty committee that reviewed all project proposals from sponsors to
determine which proposals were acceptable for student bidding. Some projects were removed
before the student bidding process because the committee believed they were not viable. After
this culling process, there would be approximately 200 projects available for student bidding.
Since companies knew that there was a 50% chance that students might not select their project,
they worked harder to create “….a good project compelling to MBA students” (MBA5
Professor). There was no charge to sponsors for these projects but they were asked to cover
student costs. The school had a fund for projects from nonprofit organizations to cover these
costs.
To provide guidance and consistency in FBL facilitation, there was an apprenticeship
model for leadership and advising roles within the FBL project course. This was a distinctive
feature of this program in which there was a group of experienced faculty who had been working
with the course for years and who would coach faculty and others new to this pedagogy. The
professor mentioned that these individuals’ knowledge often prevented problems from occurring
with sponsors, student team dynamics, and other issues that could emerge with these projects.
There was also a faculty director for action-based learning. This was a recent development at

221

this school. Having a person “in charge of action-based learning across all programs. We
haven’t had that before” (MBA5 Professor).
All roles that supported the FBL course gathered together at end of the course for a
debriefing meeting to share lessons learned. There also had been many task forces over the years
to examine the FBL course’s effectiveness, evaluate the program, and determine what to change
and make better. As one respondent commented, “….we’re forever looking at ourselves”
(MBA5 Professor).
Outcomes of FBL on Students and Graduates
This school surveyed alumni who had taken the FBL course and found the feedback to be
favorable. The professor agreed that outcomes of this learning were difficult to assess, but given
the program’s growth, longevity, and popularity with students and project sponsors, he believed
these were indicators of good outcomes. The librarians received positive feedback on their
research support for these projects. The business librarian felt that “….we’re building students
who appreciate and understand the complexity of the information landscape” (MBA5 Librarian).
MBA Program 6 (MBA6)
School Background Information
Brief overview of the full-time MBA program. This full-time, two-year MBA program
located in a large city had a fairly flexible structure for required courses. The core courses were
bundled into the students’ first year fall semester. Students who wanted to take an elective in
their first fall semester had that option if they had prior experience that warranted an exemption
from a required course. For most students, electives were only taken in the spring semester of
the first year and in the second year. Between the first and second years, the MBA students

222

typically completed an internship at a company or organization. This program promoted itself as
a program that offered students flexibility in their choice of courses.
Business librarians’ function. The business library was located in the main library, and
reported to and was funded by the main library. There were six business librarians who provided
reference services for the students in the business school for both career and course research
support.
Career services function. Career services professionals had roles in coaching students
and identifying companies to recruit their graduates. Most of the individuals in this department
specialized in specific industry sectors or functional areas such as consulting or marketing. The
MBA career management office, organized by industry verticals, included seven advisors. For
each industry, there was an advisor for students and one who served as the employer contact
person or relationship manager.
Faculty function. Instruction was provided by tenured, tenure-track, and adjunct faculty.
In addition to the full-time MBA program, this school also had an executive MBA program and a
Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) program.
School’s Approach to Experiential Field-based Learning
The school had several FBL course opportunities. The primary and most popular course
was an elective taught for over 20 years by the professor interviewed for this study. The course
focused on team meetings, and there was no classroom learning. There were no regularly
schedule times for the team meetings. In addition to meeting with the professor each week in
person or by phone for about 45 minutes, each team was required within the semester to meet
with two “area of expertise” faculty who were experts in an area relevant to their project. Most
of the projects for the main elective FBL course were based in the U.S. The clients were called

223

“hosts”; 40% of the host organizations had worked with this course in the past. The course was
offered in the fall and spring with approximately 35 teams with 4 to 6 students in each team.
The professor believed that of the courses the school offered “….if not the biggest, we’re one of
the biggest" (MBA6 Professor).
In this course, the program attempted to limit the team interaction with the host. The
professor believed that by keeping the student teams at a distance, the teams were more likely to
offer a fresh outlook in their recommendations. One student per team was the host contact.
Students chose the projects, most of which lasted a semester. Some projects, however, lasted one
to two years, with a different team completing a part of the project work each semester. The
professor said that for the past three years, he had also offered a version of this course in San
Francisco. His role included weekly meetings by phone, with an introductory session, and
observation of the final project presentations at the end of the course in San Francisco.
Part of the structure of the FBL course was a “mid-project review” about five to six
weeks into the project when the team met with the host to review the project’s progress. After the
project was complete, the professor evaluated the work and awarded the grade for the course
work to the team, and not the individual students. Included in this was an intra-team
participation evaluation. Typically, the final deliverable was a 25 to 35 minutes PowerPoint
presentation to the host. Deliverables could also include other forms depending on the project.
In the past these had included a pitch book for a real estate project in Costa Rica and a
spreadsheet tool of the factors a company must consider for an international expansion.

224

Learning Support and Guidance for FBL
If several teams were working on a project in the same area (such as brand loyalty
programs or social media promotion), the professor of the FBL course would arrange for the
teams to meet and share what they had learned. The formal roles supporting this FBL course
were the occasional peer student help, the professor leading the course, the area of expertise
faculty available on demand, and the associate director for the FBL course. Librarians did not
have a formal role with the FBL course or any other FBL type courses. Teams were not
required to meet with a librarian. However, the professor of the FBL course often recommended
that the teams meet with a librarian. The professor valued the expertise of the librarians, but felt
it was the students’ responsibility to reach out to the librarians for this support.
Organization of FBL and Models of Delivery

225

Administration of the FBL course was the responsibility of the lead faculty member who
advised all teams and the FBL course associate director who was responsible for most of the
administrative and logistical support. The faculty advisor met with all 35 teams once a week.
Since the logistics could be quite complicated with the varied schedules of team members, the
associate director helped to arrange these weekly team meetings. There was never an occasion
when all the students in the course met as a group. Each semester there were approximately 180
students. The program charged project hosts a fee for this project work, which was deposited in
a general fund. However, the program did not charge hosts that were alumni of the school who
provided projects or non-profit organizations. This FBL course was created 20 years ago as part
of a new curriculum in the school with a requirement for field-based projects. The FBL course
was part of the core curriculum for five years, and then was changed to an elective.
Another FBL elective course cited in the interviews at this school was their 1.5 credit
global consulting practicum course. This included students from other non-U.S. MBA programs
and was managed by the school’s marketing department. The course used adjuncts to teach this
course, which included travel to another country. There were also outside consultants that taught
in this course, which had a much larger budget and more staff involved with administration.
Outcomes of FBL on Students and Graduates
Similar to other programs, the interviewees related how difficult it was to accurately
assess the outcomes of this type of learning because the learning would not really be tested until
the graduates were in the workforce. In general, the respondents believed that the practical
application of the skills that students acquired while working on real projects was helpful. The
faculty member interviewed at this school said that the course was also a great way to connect
alumni with the school. Since there was limited involvement of the business librarians with this

226

FBL elective course, the interviews offered little to evaluate the information related outcomes of
this pedagogy.

Survey Question 16 - Is there any additional information you would like to add about experiential
field-based learning projects and the role of business librarians at your school?
Had to answer "don't know" to all "who assists" questions. The students come to the libraries for help when they need it, but beyond
that we are not involved in the program enough to know how every student gets assistance.
As the solo business librarian I worked closely with the MBA+ program and Texas Venture Labs programs. The position has always
supported these programs. It is not included separately in the evaluation but I do mention work I do for them in the narrative.
it is extremely interesting; it is one of our biggest success stories enabling us to partner and collaborate with faculty and students; it has
contributed to librarians being seen as part of the student teams and their community; it has greatly increased our visibility and value
This is a core role for us. Expectations placed on the librarians by the programs we support can be difficult to meet due to timing of
expected consultations. Some programs also have difficulty placing the required library consultation at the best time for the team.
Rather than have timing that maximizes the team's needs, the consultation is scheduled during the best time for the program. Even if
that might mean the night before a major exam. This relationship, across multiple programs, is a work in progress and ever-improving.
No formal process. Students contact members of the reference team, or our head of reference through email. In response, the staff
responds. Head of reference makes videos of recommended resources. We do not do anything as involved as itemized here
I don't really see how most of the categories above relate to a librarian's usual role - also it's unclear what defines an "experiential fieldbased learning project". I talk to various classes that are working on real-world projects - startups, consulting, etc. - are they all
"experiential field-based"? So my answers to these questions are relatively uncertain.

Appendix F: LEPE conferences
In three (MBA2, MBA5, MBA6) of the five case study interviews with professors
discussing the history of FBL in their programs, a group called Leaders of Experiential ProjectBased Education (LEPE) was mentioned as a body that meets every year to discuss trends in this
form of pedagogy in MBA programs. When the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth
University hosted this conference in 2014, they described it as providing “an opportunity for
project-based learning leaders from top-tier MBA programs to gather and collaborate. In
addition to both benchmarking and sharing of programmatic design and execution, this year's
LEPE conference will provide opportunities to hear from subject matter experts on how adults
learn, how team dynamics affect performance, and other training to help us better design our
courses, manage our project teams, and take experiential learning to a new level” (Tuck School
of Business, 2014).
In the process of doing research for this dissertation, two other organizations focused on
professional development and training for this type of learning were identified. One was the
World Institute for Action Learning (WIAL) which focuses on training programs at companies
not MBA curriculum. The other organization that does have a business school focus was the
Experiential Learning Association meeting at the annual Eastern Academy of Management
conference but their programming on experiential learning is not focused exclusively on MBA
programs.
LEPE appears to be the only group focused exclusively on the leadership support for this
type of learning at the top U.S. MBA programs and thus relevant to the focus of this
dissertation’s research. LEPE has existed since 2009. Table F.1 lists the schools that have
hosted the conference each year.

In 2014 the attendees at the conference were from the following schools: Chicago Booth;
Boston University School of Management; Fisher College of Business; The Ohio State
University; Haas School of Business, University of California Berkeley, Harvard Business
School, Kelley School of Business Indiana University, Kellogg School of Management
Northwestern University, MIT Sloan School of Management, NYU Stern School of Business,
Ross School of Business Michigan University, Stanford Graduate School of Business, The
Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth,
UCLA Anderson School of Management, UNC Kenan-Flagler Business School, University of
Connecticut School of Business, USC Marshall School of Business (Tuck School of Business,
2014b). This was the latest date a complete list of attendees could be found on the web. Based
on this list and other reviews of LEPE programs found on the internet it appears that four of the
six MBA programs covered as case studies in this dissertation’s research have been regular
attendees at this conference.
In a conversation with one of the faculty member respondents who had attended LEPE
(MBA5 Professor, 8/8/16 personal communication) he shared that his impression was that it was

239

a conference primarily for administrators of FBL programs not faculty involved in this
curriculum, to share best practices in an informal setting. One of the other professors
interviewed also shared this view. "I’ve gone [to LEPE] one year...and most of the people there
are not faculty, most schools don’t have faculty involved in this. They have administrators. So
it’s mostly administrators" (MBA2 Professor). In reviewing the history of these programs with
the interviewees, a development of note was that beyond typical academic conferences that
business school faculty attend such as the Institute for Operations Research and the Management
Sciences (INFORMS) and the Academy of Management, this separate organization was unique
in serving as a forum specifically for the administrators and faculty of these FBL project courses.
