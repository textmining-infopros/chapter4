Masten-Cain, Kathryn. Toward a Grounded Theory of Community Networking. Doctor of
Philosophy (Information Science), May 2014, 252 pp., 16 tables, 2 figures, references, 224 titles.
This dissertation presents a preliminary grounded theory of community networking based
on 63 evaluations of community networking projects funded by the National
Telecommunications and Information Administration’s Technology Opportunities Program
(TOP) between 1994 and 2007. The substantive grounded theory developed is that TOP projects
differed in their contribution to positive outcomes for intended disadvantaged community
beneficiaries based on the extent and manner in which they involved the disadvantaged
community during four grant process phases: partnership building, project execution, evaluation,
and close-out. Positive outcomes for the community were facilitated by using existing
communication channels, such as schools, to connect with intended beneficiaries; local financial
institutions to provide infrastructure to support local trade; and training to connect community
members to jobs. Theoretical contributions include situating outcomes for disadvantaged
communities within the context of the grant process; introducing the “vulnerable community”
concept; and identifying other concepts and properties that may be useful in further theoretical
explorations. Methodological contributions include demonstrating grounded theory as a viable
method for exploring large text-based datasets; paving the way for machine learning approaches
to analyzing qualitative data; and illustrating how project evaluations can be used in a similar
fashion as interview data. Practical contributions include providing information to guide
community networking-related policies and initiatives from the perspectives of stakeholders at
all levels, including establishing funded projects as local employment opportunities and reconceptualizing sustainability in terms of human networks rather than technological networks.

LIST OF DEFINITIONS AND ACRONYMS
To improve the readability of this review, several terms that
emerge throughout the paper are briefly defined in advance, with
references to examples of their use in the relevant literature.
•

Category: An abstraction representing a set of concepts (Corbin & Strauss, 2008, p.

159). Often used synonymously with theme.
•

Community informatics: “A multidisciplinary field for the investigation and

development of the social and cultural factors shaping the development and diffusion of new
ICTs and its effects upon community development, regeneration and sustainability” (Keeble &
Loader, 2001, p. 3).
•

Community network (CN): Locally developed and operated nonprofit organizations

that use information and communication technologies (ICTs) to enhance geographically-based
communities (Beamish, 1995, p. 3; Rosenbaum & Gregson, 1998, p. 3; Schuler, 1996, p. x).
•

Community networking project: A project that incorporates ICT for the purpose of

enhancing communities.
•

Concepts: “Words that stand for ideas contained in data.” (Corbin & Strauss, 2008, p.

•

Conceptual coding: “Deriving and developing concepts from the data” along with

150).

their properties and dimensions (Corbin & Strauss, 2008, p. 65).
•

Constant comparison: “The analytic process of comparing different pieces of data for

similarities and differences” (Corbin & Strauss, 2008, p. 65).
•

Digital divide: The lack of information technology access for certain segments of the

population, which served as a key problem underlying many community networking initiatives
(Servon, 2002, p.1).

x

•

Dimensions: Possible values for conceptual properties. (Corbin & Strauss, 2008, p.

•

Disadvantaged community: For purposes of this study, a community or population

159).

that has challenges accessing or effectively using technology due to conditions relating to
geography, socioeconomics, limited mobility, or a service need.
•

Funding initiative: A set of funded projects that resulted from a call for proposals

from a funding agency; an example is the Technology Opportunities Program (TOP).
•

Grant process: For purposes of this study, the process of an organization applying for

and receiving a grant in order to accomplish some purpose; this involves four phases: partnership
building, project execution, evaluation, and close-out.
•

Grounded theory (GT): “[T]he discovery of theory from data—systematically

obtained and analyzed in social research…[that] provides…relevant predictions, explanations,
interpretations and applications” that are understandable to both researchers and practitioners
(Glaser & Strauss, 1967, p. 1).
•

Information and communication technology (ICT): Technologies that provide access

to information through telecommunications, such as the Internet, wireless networks, cell phones,
and other communication media.
•

Memos: “Written records of analysis” (Corbin & Strauss, 2008, p. 117).

•

National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA): Located

within the Department of Commerce, the NTIA is the Executive Branch agency that is
principally responsible by law for advising the President on telecommunications and information
policy issues. It was the agency responsible for the Technology Opportunities Program (TOP).

xi

•

Positive outcomes: The direct impact on a targeted beneficiary community or

population due to a funded project, commonly considered to be beneficial. “Positive outcomes”
for the community are not always the same as the “desired outcomes” as stated by the project
team. Instead, positive outcomes are often ascertained indirectly, based on a commonly held
view of what would benefit the target community population. An example of a positive outcome
is the creation of volunteer opportunities for local community residents to work on a community
networking project. While volunteering may not have been explicitly expressed as a desired
outcome by either the project team or the community, it can be seen to benefit the local
community – especially the individual volunteers. In contrast, an example of a desired outcome
for the project might be the completion of a project on time and within budget, which may or
may not directly benefit the targeted beneficiary community.
•

Properties: Aspects of concepts (Corbin & Strauss, 2008, p. 159). For example, the

concept “method of impact” in this study has two properties, direct and indirect.
•

Saturation: The full development of concepts in terms of their properties and

dimensions, as well as the relationships between concepts for theory construction (Corbin &
Strauss, 2008).
•

Social capital: Social capital has at least three different conceptualizations. According

to Bourdieu (1983), social capital is “the aggregate of the actual or potential resources which are
linked to possession of a durable network of more or less institutionalized relationships of mutual
acquaintance and recognition” (Social Capital section, ¶ 1). Coleman (1988) describes social
capital as resources inherent in relationships that actors can use to achieve their objectives. These
resources can take three forms: “obligations and expectations, information channels, and social

xii

norms” (p. S95). Putnam (1995) defines social capital as “networks, norms, and social trust that
facilitate coordination and cooperation for mutual benefit” (p. 66).
•

Social exclusion: “A process by which certain groups are systematically

disadvantaged because they are discriminated against on the basis of their ethnicity, race,
religion, sexual orientation, caste, descent, gender, age, disability, HIV status, migrant status or
where they live” (Department for International Development, 2005, p. 3).
•

Social inclusion: “[T]he extent that individuals, families, and communities are able to

fully participate in society and control their own destinies, taking into account a variety of factors
related to economic resources, employment, health, education, housing, recreation, culture, and
civic engagement” (Warschauer, 2003, p. 8).
•

Sustainability: The form in which a project or collaboration continues to exist beyond

the grant period.
•

Technology Opportunities Program (TOP): An NTIA initiative started in 1994 during

the Clinton presidential administration that funded the community networking projects examined
in this study until termination in 2005 by the Bush presidential administration.
•

Theme: A grouping of lower-level concepts under a more conceptual label (Corbin &

Strauss, 2008, p. 159). Often used synonymously with category.
•

Theoretical integration: “Linking categories around a central or core category and

refining the resulting theoretical formulation” (Corbin & Strauss, 2008, p. 65).
•

Theoretical sampling: Continued data gathering based on evolving concepts…to look

for situations that would bring out the varying properties and dimensions of a concept” (Corbin
& Strauss, 2008, p. 117).

xiii

•

Theory: An ever-developing explanation or prediction of some phenomenon (adapted

from Glaser & Strauss, 1967, pp. 31-32). Two types of middle range theories discussed in Glaser
& Strauss (1967) are substantive (empirical) and formal (conceptual).
•

Universal access: A belief that everyone is entitled to a basic level of access to the

information and communications infrastructure (Clement & Shade, 2000, p. 32).
•

Vulnerable community: A disadvantaged community that is identified as the intended

beneficiary of a grant, but is at high risk for being exploited in order to attract grant funding
while the community itself gains no lasting benefit from the infusion of funding.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION
1.1

Prologue
In 1995, I was fortunate enough to live in one of three communities in my state that

decided to try an experiment by giving citizens free access to this new thing called the “World
Wide Web.” Working closely with my stepson’s school system, I joined an exciting communitywide collaboration involving businesses, non-profits, government and others to help write a
successful grant to start up a local community network. About a year later, when I moved to a
rural, impoverished community in a remote location of the state, I pulled together a new
collaboration and founded my second community network – funded through a second round of
the same state grant funding initiative. Having become an activist community network champion,
I was elected to serve on a statewide community network association board where I worked as a
volunteer, tirelessly advocating for community networks in my state—especially those in remote,
rural, and/or economically disadvantaged communities. I believed in the vision of the Internet as
a way to level the playing field between rural and urban, rich and poor, and the educated elite
and the common person.
A decade later, frustrated and puzzled by political and economic situations encountered, I
became a Ph.D. student with the aim of making the world a better place by advancing the
community networking movement. What I found, however, was that the scholarly literature did
not seem to represent the situation “on the ground” for community networking activists or
“champions” like me. Several of us had dedicated a significant portion of our lives to promote
the cause of community networking, particularly in disadvantaged communities – often only to
see the community networks we championed struggle for existence and eventually die. The

1

literature seemed to start with a priori assumptions about what “should be” rather than what “is”;
or the literature focused on criticizing rather than building up community networking efforts. It
just “seemed like” there ought to be ways to leverage information and communication
technology (ICT) to truly transform the lives of individuals within disadvantaged communities. I
suspected that perhaps there were some findings that had simply been overlooked, or just not
brought together in such a way as to make it so. So that’s what I set out to do in my dissertation.
1.2

Overview
In this dissertation project, I examined the literature on community networks to identify

research questions to guide an empirical analysis of evaluations of community networking
projects funded by the Technology Opportunities Program (TOP). Formerly called the
Telecommunications and Information Infrastructure Assistance Program (TIIAP), TOP was a
federal program launched in the mid-1990s during the same period when I was heavily involved
in the community networking movement. The aim of this dissertation was to develop a grounded
theory of community networking that would help inform efforts designed to use ICT to enhance
or even transform the lives of individuals from disadvantaged communities or populations.
1.3

Background for the Research
The National Telecommunications and Information Administration’s (NTIA) Technology

Opportunities Program (TOP) – formerly called the Telecommunications and Information
Infrastructure Assistance Program (TIIAP) – was launched as part of the Clinton presidential
administration’s effort to build out a National Information Infrastructure (NII). TOP was created
as a vehicle for funding community information and communication technology (ICT) initiatives
to help overcome the digital divide, defined as the gap between the “technology haves and have
nots” (Hundt, 1996). Between 1994 and 2007, TOP provided about $230 million in matching

2

funds for 606 projects to nearly 300 grantees, with many of these projects classified as
“community networking” (Williams, 2007). In 2005, the Bush Administration defunded TOP,
with the last approved projects running until 2007 (Williams, 2007). Kate Williams, then a Ph.D.
student at the University of Michigan and now an assistant professor at the University of Illinois
at Urbana-Champaign, received permission to archive materials from the program. As a result,
an archived website (http://www.ntia.doc.gov/legacy/otiahome/top/index.html) was set up, and
the University of Michigan placed, in its Special Collections Library, seventeen boxes of
physical materials from the TOP initiative (http://quod.lib.umich.edu/s/sclead/umich-scltop?byte=5285081;focusrgn=contentslist;subview=standard;view=reslist). Williams (2007)
describes the TOP Data Archive project in detail, along with her hopes for researchers to access
the materials and share findings. That is one of the primary hopes of this dissertation.
Some of the individual projects and the TOP initiative as a whole were evaluated from
time to time (see Frechtling, J., Lockwood, J., Silverstein, G., Somers, L., & Tuss, P., 1999;
Frechtling, J., Silverstein, G., Snow, K., & Somers, L., 2000; Johnson & Johnson Associates,
Inc., 2001). However, to date, there has been no attempt to develop an overarching theory of
community networking from the large cache of data that has been archived from this initiative.
Such a study can help guide policy, standardize case study approaches, improve methods for
collecting and analyzing larger datasets, and “allow us to generalize and confirm trends in
communities” (Williams & Durrance, 2010, p. 5). A theory of community networking may help
inform other community technology initiatives, resulting in improved project success and
avoiding taxpayer waste.
1.4

Research Questions
The purpose of this dissertation project was to develop a grounded theory of community

3

networking, drawn from a limited “cache of material” (Glaser & Strauss, 1967, p. 167):
evaluations conducted of sixty-three (63) TOP-funded community networking projects, curated
as part of the TOP Data Archive Project (Williams, 2007). These evaluations were retrieved from
two sources: electronic documents available via an archived copy of the TOP website accessed
via The Wayback Machine (http://archive.org) and physical documents available as part of the
TOP Dataset archived at the University of Michigan’s Special Collections Library in Ann Arbor,
Michigan. See Appendix A for the complete list of project evaluations that served as data for the
study.
A grounded theory approach, described further in the chapter on methodology, was used
to develop a theory about community networking that emerges from the data. The overarching
research question in this study is: How can community networking initiatives be structured to
maximize positive outcomes for individuals from disadvantaged communities? The following
questions, drawn from the literature, were used to direct data collection and analysis of TOP
project evaluations, and selected concepts emerged and were elaborated upon from the data. The
guiding questions for data collection included:

1.5

•

What opportunities for collaboration were enabled by the community networking
projects between previously unconnected individuals and organizations with differing
levels of resources and/or status?

•

To what extent did conditions prior to TOP grant funding appear to have affected
project outcomes?

Significance of the Study
Federal efforts to build out the National Information Infrastructure (NII) continue to this

day, with a considerable amount of taxpayer support funneled toward such efforts. Over $4
billion has already spent on the Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP), the
NTIA’s successor to TOP (http://www.ntia.doc.gov/other-publication/2013/btop-fact-sheet). As

4

reported in the 19th quarterly report to Congress on BTOP in January 2014: “In 2009 and 2010,
NTIA invested approximately $4 billion in 233 BTOP projects benefitting every state, as well as
five territories and the District of Columbia. The portfolio of projects initially included:
•

123 infrastructure projects totaling $3.5 billion in federal grant funds to construct
broadband networks

•

66 Public Computer Center (PCC) projects totaling $201 million in federal grant
funds to provide access to broadband, computer equipment, computer training, job
training, and educational resources to the public and vulnerable populations

•

44 Sustainable Broadband Adoption (SBA) projects totaling nearly $251 million in
federal grant funds to support innovative projects that promote broadband adoption,
especially among vulnerable population groups where broadband technology
traditionally has been underutilized” (National Telecommunications and Information
Administration, 2014, p. 1)

The allocation of federal funding in BTOP shows that funding for “vulnerable
populations” represents only a small fraction of the total, resulting in political criticism of the
initiative for failing to improve the lives of disadvantaged populations, as well as charges of
interfering with the operation of the free market. As stated by the president of the “nonpartisan,
nonprofit organization,” Citizens Against Government Waste, in response to congressional
hearings about BTOP in 2013 (see http://cagw.org/media/press-releases/house-holds-hearingstimulus-expansion-broadband): “[I]f federally-financed broadband expansion cannot even stick
to its goal of providing access to unserved and underserved communities, it is engaging in the
destruction of private-sector jobs as well as wasting taxpayer dollars. Both offenses are
aggravating; combined, they are inexcusable.”
This study of BTOP’s predecessor, the TOP initiative, may help explain why efforts to
enhance disadvantaged communities appear to have become minimized today – and, more
importantly, what elements are necessary, although perhaps not sufficient, for leading to positive
outcomes for disadvantaged communities. This study is therefore significant for its implications

5

for those who continue to find themselves on the wrong side of the digital divide, for taxpayers,
and for society as a whole in our quest to level the playing field through the use of ICT.
1.6

Expected Contributions
This study is expected to make the following contributions to the body of knowledge:
•

Theoretical: The study develops a preliminary theory that situates community

networking within a specific historical context, providing a deeper understanding of the
relationship between communities, ICT, and policy initiatives. This appears to be one of the first
formal theories of community networking presented.
•

Methodological: The study describes how a grounded theory approach, which is

seldom used in information science research, was employed to examine existing caches of
material. This study shows the value of a qualitative grounded theory approach in tackling some
of the “big data” challenges of today.
•

Practical: The study provides valuable information to guide community networking-

related policies and initiatives, which continue to this day.
1.7

Scope of the Study
As a qualitative study, the intention was to be exploratory and to develop a theory of

community networking intended to spark the generation of hypotheses for further examination. It
was not expected that all relevant concepts would be identified up front or would be developed
throughout the course of this study. As stated in Glaser and Strauss (1967), “accurate description
and verification are not so crucial when one’s purpose is to generate theory” (p. 28). Therefore, a
precise codebook designed for inter-rater reliability was never the aim of this study, nor is one
produced. As stated in Corbin and Strauss (2008), “when constructing a dissertation based on the
findings from a qualitative research study, the researcher should rely on…(a) developing a clear

6

analytic story by sorting through the diagrams and memos, then (b) working out a main outline
that will fully incorporate all important components of that story” (p. 280). The analytic story
describes the points at which a specific federal grant initiative, the Technology Opportunities
Program, could have done better in achieving positive outcomes for disadvantaged communities.
The story begins with an understanding of community networking, one of the means through
which the TOP initiative engaged with communities.

LITERATURE REVIEW
2.1

Overview
This section provides an overview of the literature to be examined, a working definition

of community networks, and a description of the scope of the literature review.
2.1.1

Literature Reviewed
Community networks (CNs) are locally-developed and operated non-profit organizations

that use information and communication technologies (ICTs) to enhance geographically-based
communities. This literature review examines CN research in the U.S. from 1993 to 2008, during
the William Clinton and George W. Bush presidential administrations. It examines underlying
theoretical assumptions, the empirical evidence, and methodologies employed in nearly ninety
(90) scholarly works on community networks. This research bridges the fields of library science
and information science as community networks were envisioned as a promising way for
libraries to remain “relevant” in the information society by helping communities leverage
information and communication technologies (ICT) in the information age.
2.1.2

Community Network Definition
Community networks “connect, via electronic communications or virtual space, people

who also share a common geographic space such as city or neighborhood” (Virnoche & Marx,
1997, p. 88) in order to facilitate local information exchange and to increase communication on
an ongoing basis (Beamish, 1995; Virnoche & Marx, 1997). Organizationally, CNs “are usually
nonprofit, volunteer-based organizations which are based in a particular geographic area…[and]
usually provide a basic level of access to the Internet” (Keenan & Trotter, 1999, Introduction
section, ¶ 4). Potentially, community networks facilitate civic participation (Gregson, 1997;

8

Schuler, 1994, 1996, 2004), address the informational needs of a community (Durrance &
Pettigrew, 2002), and revitalize, strengthen, and expand existing geographically-based human
networks (Venkatesh, 2003). One of their most visible features is a community website
(Rosenbaum & Gregson, 1998). Most CNs have the common features described by the
Association for Community Networking (AFCN) in 1997 (Kubicek & Wagner, 2002):
•

Grassroots operation: operated by and for local community

•

Universal access mission: promote equal access to the media

•

Low cost: services provided at little or no cost

•

Information and communication: address everyday information and communication
needs

•

Community building: strengthen local community cohesion

•

Geographically-based: community served is based on geographical proximity

Arriving at a precise, universally agreed upon definition of a community network has
proven challenging because CNs can serve many different purposes and have different
characteristics. Community networks are sometimes referred to as community information
networks (Grigsby, Shuffstall, & Goetz, 2002), community information systems (Unrah,
Pettigrew, & Durrance, 2002), or community electronic networks (Sullivan, Borgida, Jackson,
Riedel, Oxendine, & Gangl, 2002). For this paper, a CN is defined as a locally developed and
locally operated non-profit organization that uses information and communication technologies
(ICTs) to enhance a geographically-based community. Thus, a CN has several distinct features: a
physical sense of place, represented by a virtual space (usually a website), with a local nonprofit
organizational structure.
2.1.3

Scope of this Review
This review includes the empirical research literature on community networks that were

9

established in the United States following the National Information Infrastructure initiative
begun by the Clinton-Gore Administration in the United States (Gore, 1993). Although the
history of community networking begins earlier (Kubicek & Wagner, 2002; Servon, 2002), peerreviewed scholarly literature from 1993-2008 forms the main corpus of work reviewed. The
review also draws on relevant non-peer reviewed popular and scholarly literature from outside
the United States because several influential concepts relevant to the development and research
of CNs in the United States originated from this literature. Since government and the nonprofit
sectors in the United States also played important roles in CN development, relevant literature
from these sectors is also occasionally referred to.
Empirical research conducted on CNs located outside the United States is outside the
scope of this analysis because the social, political, and cultural contexts of other societies are
deemed significantly different from the American context. Also outside the scope of this analysis
is research on CNs that (1) were established prior to 1993; (2) are considered to be “virtual only”
(based on non-place-based criteria, such as interest or group membership); (3) are managed by a
single or a few individuals; (4) are managed by non-community members; or (5) operate
primarily for commercial or government purposes. Research on other forms of community ICTs
such as community technology centers and cybercafes is also outside the scope of this analysis.
2.2

A Brief History of Community Networks
This section describes the historical context in which community networking emerged. It

chronicles community, government, and academic involvement with community networking and
describes efforts to institutionalize community networks, as well as their ultimate decline.
2.2.1

Community Initiatives
The community networking concept appealed to proponents of democracy who viewed

10

the virtual world as an opportunity to enhance political participation and civic engagement.
Howard Rheingold’s 1993 populist book The Virtual Community helped launch this “democratic
technology movement” (Agre, 1997, p. 242). Drawing from his personal experience with the
Well, an early online community, and from observations of the Usenet and Bulletin Board
System (BBS) culture, Rheingold (1993) contended that “the same many-to-many
communications capabilities of CMC [computer mediated communication] formerly reserved for
the elites could catalyze the emergence of a formidable, far more populist kind of social
organization” (p. 111).
Doug Schuler, founder of the Seattle Community Network (SCN) and former chair of
Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR), positioned community networks as a
“participatory medium” for increasing civic engagement (Schuler, 1994). Civic engagement is
defined as the “development of social trust that facilitates collective social action toward
achieving common social goals” (Kavanaugh & Patterson, 2002, p. 327). Schuler provided the
manifesto and how-to manual for community networks in his 1996 book New Community
Networks: Wired for Change (Carroll, 2005). Drawing on his experience with the Seattle
Community Network (SCN), Schuler (1996) outlined the social and technological architectures
for community networks and provided guidance for developing, sustaining, and evaluating
community networks (p. 381). He explicitly called for CN advocates to build an “infrastructure
for democracy” (p. 381) as part of the NII. Contending that “government support and protection
for an infrastructure for democracy is the most critical, basic, and pressing role of government in
a democratic society” (p. 381), Schuler suggested that universities and libraries partner with
communities to use the new technologies to promote civic engagement and to build a global
network for all.

11

Involvement of libraries in community networking as part of community building was
championed by Bajjaly, a faculty member of the University of South Carolina’s College of
Library and Information Science and founder of the MidNet community network (Bajjaly, 1999).
Bajjaly touted the potential of community networks to “reignite a spirit of cooperation and
belonging that we thought was lost forever” (p. 6) by providing opportunities for individuals to
develop friendships and trade ideas and for institutions to establish joint efforts and to share
resources (Bajjaly, 1999, p. 9). With libraries seldom part of community building proposals and
missing from vision statements of other organizations serving the community (de la Pena
McCook, 2000), community networking was seen as an opportunity for libraries to become an
active part of community building efforts.
2.2.2

Government Initiatives
The Santa Monica Public Electronic Network (PEN) was an early attempt by government

to leverage ICTs to support sociopolitical goals in a particular community (Servon, 2002). PEN
was created by the Santa Monica, California city government in 1989 (Rogers, Collins-Jarvis, &
Schmitz, 1994). The free service, which operated on public access terminals, aimed to improve
information access, city service delivery, resident communication, and sense of community; to
diffuse a new communication technology; and to equitably distribute communication among all
residents (van Tassel, 1996). One of PEN’s most celebrated achievements was the success of
Santa Monica’s homeless population’s using PEN to lobby for access to showers and lockers
prior to job interviews (Rogers et al., 1994). “PEN provided an opportunity to establish
information-exchange relationships with higher status [‘homed’] individuals” (Rogers et al.,
1994, p. 406) and helped abolish the stereotype that the homeless did not want to find jobs.
Rogers et al. (1994) conclude that PEN encouraged diverse opinions on contentious issues and

12

partially overcame barriers of distance, socioeconomic status, physical appearance, gender, and
“social network distance” (p. 409). PEN helped pave the way for the idea that community
networks might be useful in achieving public policy goals.
Although electronically-based community networks had existed in some form since the
1970s, significant events in the 1990s greatly contributed to their development and growth
(Kubicek & Wagner, 2002). In 1990, Tim Berners-Lee of the European Organization for Nuclear
Research (CERN) created the hypertext-based World Wide Web (European Organization for
Nuclear Research, 2008). In 1991, then-Senator Al Gore sponsored and shepherded the passage
of the High Performance Computing and Communication Act (Library of Congress, 2008). The
Act led to the funding and release in 1993 of Mosaic, the first graphical user interface to the
World Wide Web (European Organization for Nuclear Research, 2008).
The technological advancements of the Internet, coupled with the earlier success of PEN,
enabled the Clinton-Gore administration to introduce community networks as an instrument of
public policy as part of their National Information Infrastructure (NII) agenda, which was
launched in 1993 (Gore, 1993; Servon, 2002; Virnoche & Marx, 1997). The main purpose of the
NII, informally referred to as the “Information Superhighway,” was to increase American
competitiveness in the global economy, but it was also widely expected to yield “unprecedented
opportunities to advance our social progress and improve the living standards and quality of life
for all Americans” (National Information Infrastructure Advisory Council, 1996, Benefits of the
Information Superhighway section, ¶ 4). A central concern of the administration was to ensure
that all Americans could access the NII (Gore, 1993).
Principles underlying the development of the NII included private investment, protection
of competition, open network access, flexibility, and ensuring universal service to prevent a

13

society of haves and have nots (Gore, 1993). The Clinton-Gore administration charged the U.S.
Department of Commerce’s National Telecommunications and Information Administration
(NTIA) with addressing the issue of the digital divide, the gap between those connected to the
NII and those who were not (Servon, 2002; Wresch, 1996). The NTIA’s first step to combat the
digital divide was to obtain data on the extent of the digital divide. The Census Bureau’s Current
Population Survey (CPS) was expanded to include questions about computer and modem
ownership and usage, in addition to existing questions about telephone ownership and usage. The
Census Bureau was asked “to cross-tabulate the information gathered according to several
specific variables (i.e., income, race, age, educational attainment, and region) and three
geographic categories -- rural, urban, and central city” (National Telecommunications and
Information Administration, 1995, Background section, ¶ 4). A series of written reports entitled
Falling through the Net examined the nature and extent of the digital divide, including the
characteristics of and risks for those who remained unconnected (National Telecommunications
and Information Administration, 1995, 1998, 1999, 2000).
The Telecommunications and Information Infrastructure Assistance Program (TIIAP),
later renamed the Technology Opportunities Program (TOP), was created as a vehicle for
funding community ICT initiatives to help overcome the digital divide. Between 1994 and 2004,
TOP provided matching funds for 606 projects to nearly 300 grantees, with one-third of these
projects classified as “community networking” (National Telecommunications and Information
Administration, 2008). Adhering to similar principles, state and local initiatives were undertaken
throughout the United States (Strover, Chapman, & Waters, 2004).
2.2.3

University Initiatives
University scholars often joined with community practitioners and leveraged government

14

funding to support community networking. The Blacksburg Electronic Village (BEV) was
established in 1993 as a collaboration between Virginia Tech, the city of Blacksburg, and the
telecommunications firm Bell Atlantic (Cohill & Kavanaugh, 2000). Much of the research on
CNs involves BEV initiatives, which included innovative applications designed to enhance
learning, civic participation, socialization, economic development, entertainment, consumer
information, and medical service (Carroll, Rosson, Cohill, & Schorger, 1995; Carroll & Rosson,
1996; Carroll & Rosson, 1998; Carroll & Rosson, 2001; Carroll, Rosson, Isenhour, Van Metre,
Schafer, & Ganoe, 2001; Cohill & Kavanaugh, 2000). Some researchers were from Virginia
Tech, while others, like Cohill and Kavanaugh, were staff of the community network. BEV
researchers fueled enthusiasm for CNs by widely touting BEV’s successes in connecting most of
Blacksburg’s residents to the Internet and facilitating online participation by various user groups,
most notably senior citizens. BEV served as a demonstration project of community networks
under the Clinton-Gore administration (Carroll, 2005).
Recognizing early on the potential of CNs to expand the role of the library in the
information age, Joan Durrance of the University of Michigan’s School of Information and
Library Science spearheaded the Community Networking Initiative (Bajjaly, 1999). Drawing
from her experience working with information and referral (I&R) databases, Durrance viewed
CNs and libraries as natural partners based on their shared interest in providing community
information (CI), which “helps people cope with problems of daily living and facilitates
community participation by bringing people and organizations together” (Durrance & Pettigrew,
2002, p. v). As early as 1994, Durrance was teaching community networking classes at the
University of Michigan. CNs were well positioned to capitalize on “what librarians do so well-identifying, organizing, and providing access to information needed by citizens” (Durrance,

15

Hansen, & Knox, 1995, Developing Community Networking Experiences at UM-SILS in
research section, ¶ 5) and could transform “physical communities into information communities”
(Pettigrew, Durrance, & Unruh, 2002, p. 900). Libraries were encouraged to participate in
community networking efforts to make community information available online which would
also help justify their continued public funding (Bishop, Tidline, Shoemaker, & Salela, 1999;
Pettigrew, Durrance, & Vakkari, 1999).
In her master’s thesis at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Beamish (1995)
examined the status of community networking initiatives in the United States. She called for
further research to identify better ways to design CNs, leverage volunteer energy, and achieve
sustainability toward reaching goals of ensuring access to the “information highway,” enhancing
democratic participation, and strengthening communities.
2.2.4

Efforts to Institutionalize Community Networks
By 2000, several organizations had been created to serve the interests of community

networks. The Organization for Community Networks (OFCN) was created circa 1997 as a
central repository for community network information and resources (Organization for
Community Networks, 2013). Created in 1997 primarily as an advocacy organization, the
Association for Community Networking, summarizes the state of affairs of community networks
in the following paragraph:
Over the past two decades a wide variety of projects have been launched to bring the
benefits of electronic networks to citizens, students, government agencies, small
businesses, libraries, schools, and non-profit groups. There are currently more than 150
active, identified community or civic networks, and they have taken many forms and
offer a wide variety of services. The result has been the beginning of a new grassroots
movement in the United States. (Association for Community Networking, 2008,
Community Networks section, ¶ 1)

16

This flurry of grassroots community technology activity was not limited to the United
States. Community networking initiatives were launched across the globe, including Canada
(Clement, Gurstein, Longford, Luke, Moll, Shade, et al., 2004; Graham & Shade, 1996; Keenan
& Trotter, 1999), the United Kingdom (Day, 1999; Myles, 2004), Italy (De Cindio, 2004; De
Cindio, Gentile, Grew, & Redolfi, 2003), and Australia (Schauder, Stillman, & Johanson, 2005;
Stillman & Stoecker, 2005). To unify these global efforts, Gurstein (2000, 2007) launched a new
field called “Community Informatics,” defined as "a technology strategy or discipline which
links economic and social development efforts at the community level with emerging
opportunities in such areas as electronic commerce, community and civic networks and
telecentres, electronic democracy and on-line participation, self-help and virtual health
communities, advocacy, cultural enhancement, and others" (p. 1). CI includes activists, scholars,
policy-makers, digital artists, and media commentators who combine “an interest in the
potentially transforming qualities of the new media with an analysis of the importance of
community social relations for human interaction” (Keeble & Loader, 2001, p. 3). The
Community Informatics Research Network (CIRN) was formed in 2003; annual meetings of CI
adherents have been held in Prato, Italy since 2003; and the Journal of Community Informatics
(JCI) was launched in 2004. In addition, several community informatics programs have been
instituted at American universities (Bishop & Bruce, 2005), with “7 of the 57 library and
information science programs in the United States and Canada” offering CI courses (Williams &
Durrance, 2010, p. 5).
2.2.5

Decline of Community Networks
At their peak in the late-1990s, there were estimated to be 250-300 CNs in North

America (Kwon, 2005). However, Kubicek and Wagner (2002) report that there had been no

17

significant increase in the numbers of CNs and that few of those that were established early on
still existed. Schweitzer (2003) notes that over 50% of the community network websites
identified at the Organization for Community Networks (OFCN) website (http://www.ofcn.org)
were either no longer active or had not been updated in over a year. It appears that the OFCN
community network list has not been updated since 2001 (Organization for Community
Networks, 2013). Sites, such as the University of Michigan’s “Community Connector” site,
which provided links to the various community network websites around the world, and the
Association for Community Networking (AFCN) appear to be defunct.
A common reason attributed to the decline of community networks was the assessment of
the Bush-Cheney administration that continued funding of CNs was no longer necessary given
the evidence provided by the NTIA studies. NTIA reports had been renamed from Falling
through the Net to A Nation Online indicating a shift in policy from focusing on those left behind
to an assumption that everyone was already connected in some manner (National
Telecommunications and Information Administration, 2002, 2004). This reflected the Bush
administration’s “sustained faith in market imperatives to address the digital divide” (Warf,
2013, p. 4). Data showed increasing Internet access and computer ownership across all
demographic groups, thus allowing the administration to proclaim that the digital divide problem
has been solved (National Telecommunications and Information Administration, 2002). In line
with this philosophy, the Technology Opportunities Program (TOP) was ended despite
objections from advocacy organizations such as the Benton Foundation (Leslie Harris &
Associates, 2002).
Compounding this trend was that empirical evidence indicated that computers and
Internet access could not ameliorate the causes of the digital divide or help disadvantaged

18

communities realize their economic development goals (Strover et al., 2004). There was little
evidence to support the hopes that CNs could ensure digital equality, increase civic engagement,
and develop an informed citizenry. There seemed to be a widening gap between the visions of
the proponents and advocates of CNs, on the one hand, and the practical reality on the ground.
To help understand this gap, it is useful to examine some of the key concepts underlying
community networks.
2.3

Key Concepts
This section presents a review of some of the key concepts underlying the community

networking literature – communities and networks, place and space, and consumer and civic
models.
2.3.1

Communities and Networks
Although the term “community” is intended to engender positive connotations, the term

is quite complex and often contested. In sociology, Tonnies and Durkheim formulated the most
developed views of the community concept (Brint, 2001).
Tonnies describes a dichotomy between “real and organic” Gemeinschaft (community)
and “imaginary and mechanical” Gesellschaft (society) (Tonnies, 1988, p. 33). Gemeinschaft
presumes low numbers of people located far from centers of power who share common beliefs
and ways of life. Frequent social interaction occurs continuously between concentrated, trusted
ties held together through strong emotional bonds. In contrast, Gesellschaft presumes high
numbers of people located near centers of power who have little in common. Infrequent social
interaction occurs intermittently and only temporarily between dispersed ties that are held
together through rules and regulated competition (Brint, 2001). Tonnies perceived an
evolutionary transition underway from Gemeinschaft to Gesellschaft.

19

In contrast, the well-known early sociologist Durkheim conceives of community as a set
of “variable properties of human interaction” rather than as a physical entity or social structure
(Brint, 2001, p. 3). This approach allows for a finer distinction of the different structural and
cultural aspects of community and a recognition that “community-like relations can be found in
all sizes of physical places” (Brint, 2001, p. 6). These relations are characterized by dense and
demanding ties; social attachments to and involvement in institutions; ritual occasions; small
group size; perceptions of similarity with physical characteristics, expressive style, way of life,
or historical experience of others; and common beliefs in an idea system, a moral order, an
institution, or a group.
The community studies tradition, which includes the study of “physical places,” “elective
communities,” and community “structural characteristics” (Brint, 2001, p. 5), has remained at the
descriptive level, failing to produce useful generalizations. Key findings are that “communities
are not very community-like” (Brint, 2001, p. 6), that physical locale is no guarantee of sociality,
and that hidden power structures reinforce social inequities. Thanks to the work of Barry
Wellman 1 and others who “brought enclave communities into touch with the dispersive
possibilities of modern transportation and communication systems,” sociologists now tend to
study social networks and relationships rather than community structures (Brint, 2001, p. 6).
Social network analysis reveals that, in reality, communities consist of “loosely bounded,
sparsely knit networks of specialized ties” more indicative of Gesellschaft instead of the

1

Wellman is one of the main social network researchers in the community ICT area. He contends that through the
Internet, people can link to the people they choose, no matter where they are, resulting in “networked individualism”
as the primary mode of social organization (Wellman, Quan-Haase, Boase, Chen, Hampton, de Diaz, et al., 2003).
Wellman’s work is focused on Canada and is thus out of scope for this paper. However, interesting research has
been generated by the “Netville” studies in Toronto, conducted from 1997-1999 (Hampton, 2003) and by the multiyear Canadian Research Alliance for Community Innovation and Networking (CRACIN) project (Clement,
Gurstein, Longford, et al., 2004).

20

idealized “tightly bounded, densely knit groups of broadly based ties” of Gemeinschaft
(Wellman, 1999, p. xiii).
Drawing from science and technology studies (STS) and social network theory, Arnold
(2007) conceptualizes community networks as “a-modern hybrids” (Abstract section, ¶ 1). The
innovative feature of the community network sociotechnical assemblage is that it “brings
together ‘community’ and ‘network’ as both ontological concepts and as empirically observable
phenomenon" (Arnold, 2007, Abstract section, ¶ 1). Instead of asking how CNs can maximize
what is good in a community, an a-modern question asks how CNs change what is seen as good
(Arnold, 2007). Instead of theorizing a CN “as a public good infrastructure supporting
Gemeinschaft community” (Arnold, 2007, Conclusion section, ¶ 2), [a CN should be seen as] “a
resource for building private assets” (Arnold, 2007, Conclusion section, ¶ 2).
Evidence supporting Arnold’s “a-modern hybrid” conception can be seen in Srinivasan’s
(2007) Tribal Peace project, which was designed in conjunction with members of 19 Native
American Indian reservations in California. Srinivasan’s participatory design approach allows
tribe members to build “ethnomethodological information architectures” (p. 725), private cultural
assets of their own choosing in cyberspace that help reconnect these disparate “villages.” The
result is an a-modern hybrid “conflation of binaries” (Arnold, 2007, Abstract section, ¶ 2) of
social/technical, community/network, and hierarchy/heterarchy.
2.3.2

Place and Space
Some see geographically-bounded physical “place” as increasingly irrelevant or a barrier

to overcome in favor of becoming part of a virtual “space” within the broader world community.
Others see place as fundamentally relevant and as an asset to strengthen. Community networks

21

value both the “proximate” and the “virtual” (Baker, 2000, p.104); they attempt to strengthen
place by becoming part of virtual space (Howley, 1998).
Many writings tout the increasing irrelevance of place and the ability to transcend it in
the information age. For example, de Sola Pool (1990) predicts that distance will cease “to be a
barrier to communication” (p. vii), while Cairncross (2001) writes of freedom from the “fate of
location” with regard to communication and provision of business services (p. xiii). Schuler
(2000) states that traditional communities are “exclusive, inflexible, isolated, immutable,
monolithic, and homogeneous” and can now be replaced, thanks to increased mobility and
communications that de-emphasize geography, by new communities that are “inclusive,
fundamentally devoted to democratic problem solving, outer-directed as well as inner-directed”
(p. 175).
Gieryn (2000) rejects the notion of place as irrelevant, abstract, or virtual, or as merely
context. "Place," a physical, named, unique spot in the universe, is, according to Gieryn, the
"interpretive frame" for any serious sociological examination. Place serves to reinforce
differences and hierarchy, to dominate over nature, to facilitate collective action, to either engage
or estrange, to instill social norms, and to evoke a sense of identity and memory. For example,
Bohland, Puckett, and Plymale (2005) illustrate how place matters in the life of communities in
Appalachia; not only is Internet access limited due to geography, but non-technological issues
play a significant role as well. These include local political power bases; discomfort with public
access sites like libraries and schools; gender roles; language differences; and the oral tradition.
Williams (2005) points out that jurisdictions drawn along geographical boundary lines
commonly serve as the basis for political representation, planning, and resource allocation.
“[P]lanning and funds flows are channeled according to those boundaries and political battles are

22

often fought within these jurisdictions” (Williams & Durrance, 2010, p. 1). Measures of the
digital divide, for example, are based on geographically-oriented census data (National
Telecommunications and Information Administration, 1995, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2002, and 2004).
Such data help prioritize funding for various government-funded initiatives, including
community networks. Virnoche and Marx (1997) contend that “since the focus of computer
community networking is at the county, city, town, or neighborhood, we use the local level as a
defining analytical characteristic of geographic space” (pp. 86-87).
Community networks provide a hybrid between place and space. Participants of a
community network are joined together via the common bonds of a geographically-defined
“place” as a starting point, with ICTs extending this physical place into virtual “cyberspace.”
Thus, CNs rearticulate "local identity through a global information infrastructure" (Howley,
1998, p. 405) by making local information and resources available on-line while using “the
global medium of the Internet to accomplish their goals” (Longan, 2005, p. 849). Thus, CNs
simultaneously serve local needs of communities while incorporating these same communities
into the broader global information society.
Baker (2000) notes that in Washington, DC, for CNs where a strong geographical sense
of community exists, ICTs enhance the flow of social, political and educational information.
Efforts “to establish a virtual regional community without an underlying recognized
geographical component” failed (p. 130). Baker concludes that CNs will only be successful if “a
core concept of community” (p. 130) already exists that can be augmented by the CN. CNs
cannot create community, but communities can create CNs.
2.3.3

Consumer and Civic Models
Virnoche (1998) observes two divergent models of CNs: consumer and civic. Consumer

23

models tend to be top-down, government-led approaches that emphasize job creation and
computer literacy, whereas civic approaches tend to be bottom up, grassroots initiatives that
emphasize democratic participation and civic engagement (Virnoche, 1998). Loader and Keeble
(2004) suggest there is a mismatch in both vision and language between consumer and civic
approaches. Self-interest prevails in the consumer model, with individuals-as-consumers
engaging in mutually beneficial exchanges and competing with others for scarce resources.
Public interest prevails in the civic model, with individuals-as-citizens weighing the pursuit of
their own self-interest against that of the greater good. Under the consumer model, championed
by a “fast moving capitalistic computer industry” (Virnoche, 1998, p. 202), the Internet may be
used for private profit generation, with one-way broadcast information as the norm. Under the
civic model championed by a “technointellectual liberal computer culture” (Virnoche, 1998, p.
202), the Internet is viewed as a public preserve dedicated to promoting the values of equal
access and democratic participation facilitated by two-way interactivity.
The contrast between the Seattle Community Network (SCN) and Blacksburg Electronic
Village (BEV) illustrates the differences between the citizen and consumer models in a concrete
fashion. SCN is an example of a CN explicitly based on the citizen model (Schuler, 2005; Silver,
2004). Run by volunteers, without funding from the Technology Opportunities Program (TOP),
the primary emphasis of SCN has long been on community activism (Schuler, 2005). While
BEV’s chief advocates point out that BEV includes several opportunities for interactive citizen
involvement (Carroll & Rosson, 1996; Kavanaugh, 2002; Kavanaugh, Carroll, Rosson, Zin, &
Reese, 2005; Kavanaugh & Patterson, 2002), Silver (2004) contends that BEV adheres to the
consumer model. BEV has placed a strong emphasis on providing quality broadcast content and
has received considerable government and corporate funding. Silver contrasts BEV directly with

24

SCN. The conceptualization of SCN as an exemplary citizen model of a CN in contrast with
BEV as an example of the consumer model provides a useful illustration of the tension between
the two models. It also suggests that CN advocates are guided by different theoretical
assumptions about the relationship between communities and ICTs.
2.4

Theoretical Frameworks of Community Networks
In this section, theoretical frameworks of community networks in the scholarly literature

are conceptualized along two dimensions: view of technology and underlying values. There are
three main views of technology: technological determinism, social constructivism, and
sociotechnical interaction. Three underlying values dominate the CN literature: grassroots
development, social capital building, and community information. However, it is important to
note that there is considerable overlap in the CN literature of these concepts.
2.4.1
2.4.1.1

Views of Technology
Technological Determinism
Technological determinism is at the heart of the community network concept.

Technological determinism assumes an ICT will cause “direct effects” through adoption and use
(Kling, Rosenbaum, & Sawyer, 2005, p. 13). Three perspectives on technological determinism
have been offered. Technological utopianism contends ICTs will result in positive social change
and that new technologies will eventually be accepted and seen as indispensable. Technological
dystopianism or anti-utopianism contends that ICTs will result in social change that is harmful to
society (Bellamy & Taylor, 1998; Kling, 1996). Technological skepticism emphasizes the
uncertainty and unpredictability of technologically-driven outcomes. Technological utopianism
underlies most of the CN research, with community networks widely viewed as agents of
positive social change.

25

However, there are some skeptics. Schuler (1996) contends that CNs are vehicles for
resisting informational capitalistic attempts to transform public service institutions into marketoriented operations and to commodify information to trade for profit. Schuler (1996) expresses
concern that the NTIA’s requiring matching funds for the TIIAP grants will inevitably favor the
interests of corporate partners who provide the matching funds and who have ICT products to
sell, which may or may not reflect what users really want or need. Hearn, Kimber, Lennie, and
Simpson (2005) posit that community technology initiatives are often a response to the supply of
ICTs, which favor industry-led approaches.
2.4.1.2

Social Constructivism
In contrast to technological determinism, social constructivism privileges the role that

social forces play in societal outcomes. Social shaping of technology (SST) contends that
technology is not an external, independent force that changes society from the outside. Instead,
SST positions technology as inextricably shaped by social forces, such as science, technology,
economics, and the state (MacKenzie & Wajkman, 1999). Rather than assuming that intrinsically
superior technologies will prevail, SST contends that technological change is subject to pathdependency, where early actions can have long-lasting impacts. Another social constructivist
approach, social construction of technology (SCOT), analyzes both technological change and
continuity; recognizes that technology results from socio-technical development rather than
causes it; analyzes actors as well as structures; and conceives of technological development as
occurring within a seamless web of social, technical, scientific, and political factors (Pinch &
Bijker, 1984; Bijker, 1995).
In line with social constructivist approaches, Venkatesh (2003) asserts the need for
“robust, theoretically informed accounts of community network development as socially

26

embedded and socially constructed artifacts” (p. 345). He contends that community networks are
"molded, intentionally or otherwise, by social processes" (Venkatesh, 2003, p. 340); power
interests coalesce "to secure particular technological outcomes" (Venkatesh, 2003, p. 340); some
community constituents may be more influential than others; actors often have vested interests
and motives for behaving in certain ways; and a community's social needs are prioritized in
accordance with the community's values (its policy agenda).
Historical narratives describing community network development indicate the implicit, if
not explicit, employment of social constructivist approaches. For example, Bowden, Blythe, and
Cohill (2000) and Carroll and Rosson (2003) recount the history of the Blacksburg Electronic
Village, Schuler (2005) describes the history of the Seattle Community Network, and Silver
(2004) contrasts the histories of BEV and SCN. The trajectories of both BEV and SCN are
similar, with a burst of local content creation and enthusiastic users early on, tapering off to outof-date content, mostly external links, and inactive users. Patterson (2000) proposes that the
Blacksburg Electronic Village be evaluated from a social constructivist perspective by exploring
how people came to use BEV, rather than its competitors, for meeting their needs.
2.4.1.3

Sociotechnical Interaction
Socio-technical perspectives are premised on the belief that “social systems and technical

systems are open, integrated, and interdependent” (Howley, 1998, p. 407). Technical system
changes affect the surrounding social system and social system changes affect the technical
system. Venkatesh and Shin (2002) examine Urban-Net, an advanced (“fourth generation”)
community network in New York, as an interorganizational sociotechnical network. They
portray Urban-Net’s development as a dialectic between dominant economic interests of the
resource rich who wish to exploit technology and social goals of serving the resource poor who

27

cannot afford the technology. The dialectical view analyzes how a social system “develops along
certain lines, how this trajectory is maintained or reproduced, and how its character changes over
time” (p. 180).
2.4.2
2.4.2.1

Underlying Values
Grassroots Development
One of the identifying features of community networks is their grassroots development.

Community networks are built and managed by members of the local community. Thus, theories
of human-computer interaction and participatory design underlie the technological design of
community networks by placing an emphasis on the community network user (Carroll, 1991;
Howley, 1998). Howley (1998) notes that both human-computer interaction and the CN
movement share goals of creating functioning and relevant systems for diverse users. Howley
contends that incorporating HCI approaches can enhance equity, access, and participation in
CNs. HCI helps overcome the techno-elite bias that favors an emphasis on technical “efficiency
and elegance,” (p. 404) which overwhelms and alienates novice users by putting the emphasis on
system-centered, as opposed to user-centered, design. A user-centered perspective, by contrast,
promotes collaboration and negotiation among various, often competing, stakeholders, such as
community residents, local government, businesses, schools, social service and communitybased organizations. The goal is to encourage active involvement in CN development, rather
than passive reception. This serves to safeguard against “hollowing out” local content and
communication in favor of instantaneous access to the global Internet.
Participatory design involves users as part of the CN design team. Participatory design is
“an approach to the assessment, design, and development of technological and organizational
systems that places a premium on the active involvement of workplace practitioners (usually

28

potential or current users of the system) in design and decision-making processes” (Computer
Professionals for Social Responsibility, 2009). Gurstein (2003) suggests that participatory action
research involving full participation of end users alongside the designer would be more likely to
yield true “effective use,” where the local community determines the "uses" to which ICTs
should be directed. The main reasons touted for participatory design include improving system
knowledge, reducing resistance, and establishing realistic expectations (Bjerknes & Bratteteig,
1995). The Scandinavian approach emphasizes a more politically-oriented perspective – to
increase “democracy by giving the members of an organization the right to participate in
decisions that are likely to affect their [lives]” (Bjerknes & Bratteteig, 1995, p. 74).
Based on an “institutionalist approach to artifact design,” Venkatesh and Chango (2007,
p. 469) propose that stakeholders, such as community-based organizations who advocate for the
disadvantaged, can better ensure that a CN will result in reconfiguring the prevailing social order
by “designing the conditions of design” (p. 467). They contend that without a more activist
approach from the point of design, it is likely that the community network will merely reinforce
existing power structures.
2.4.2.2

Social Capital Building
The term “social capital” is used throughout the community networking literature as a

way to explain and measure the value of community networks in community life. “Social capital
refers to all the social links that people have, their social networks, and the tendency within those
networks for people to do things for each other” (Ellis, Oldridge, & Vasconcelos, 2004, p. 168).
However, social capital has multiple meanings deriving from different conceptions. Bourdieu’s
(1983) conception underlies much of the discourse on the digital divide and social exclusion,
where CNs are positioned as instruments for addressing the inequality evidenced by a lack of

29

ICTs and Internet access. Coleman’s (1988) conception underlies discourse involving
community building and social inclusion, where CNs are viewed as instruments for connecting
people to needed resources. Putnam’s (1995) conception underlies the discourse involving CNs
as tools for promoting civic engagement and democracy.
2.4.2.2.1

Bourdieu: Empowerment and Social Exclusion

There is a common belief that having access to the Internet can translate into an improved
quality of life, including “valued goods, services, and life outcomes” (Dimaggio, Hargittai,
Neuman, & Robinson, 2001, p. 312). Therefore, not having ICTs and Internet access represents a
new form of social inequality. This dichotomy between the “technology haves and have nots”
(Hundt, 1996) has been widely labeled the “digital divide” (Norris, 2001; van Dijk & Hacker,
2003; Wresch, 1996). However, it is increasingly recognized that the digital divide problem is
more complex than simply one of infrastructure and access (Selwyn, 2004; Van Dijk, 2006).
Thus, the more comprehensive term, social exclusion, is increasingly being used along with the
term digital divide.
Originating in France, “social exclusion” refers to a rupture in the social bond between
society and its citizens, where society provides a livelihood and citizens fulfill certain obligations
toward society (Silver & Miller, 2003). The concept was recast by the European Union (EU) to
mean the inability of citizens to enjoy a basic standard of living, which then prevents
participation in society’s major social and occupational opportunities. In Britain, the emphasis on
reducing social exclusion led to attempts to measure poverty in relative terms, specifically as
“deprivation from goods, services and activities which the majority of the population defines as
being the necessities of modern life” (Gordon, Levitas, Pantazis, Patsio, Payne, Townsend, et al.,
2000, p. 5). Individuals can be excluded from income and resources, labor market, services, and

30

social relations (Gordon et al., 2000). The international development community recast social
exclusion as systematic group-based discrimination, asserting it as the major cause of poverty
and a major impediment to “the efficient operation of market forces” throughout the world
(Department for International Development, 2005, p. 5). Social exclusion has its roots in
neoliberalism, which privileges privatization, deregulation, and downscaling social programs
except for those most needy (Portes, 1998).
A classic Marxist, Bourdieu presents social capital as largely negative (Everingham,
2003). It is a benefit of exclusive group membership, a “credential” entitling a member to credit
and excluding those who do not belong to the social network. Bourdieu’s (1983) conception of
social capital, with social class as the unit of analysis and its emphasis on exclusion, is useful in
explaining structural inequalities, such as those observed in digital divide and social exclusion
research (Everingham, 2003, p. 112). Social capital “is the product of investment strategies,
individual or collective, consciously or unconsciously aimed at establishing or reproducing social
relationships that are directly usable in the short or long term” (Bourdieu, 1983, Social Capital
section, ¶ 4). Thus, like other forms of capital, social capital is an investment, eventually
expected to yield a future return (Everingham, 2003) and it has two elements: the social
relationship enabling resource entitlement and the quality and amount of resources (Portes,
1998). The proposed remedy to the exclusion described in digital divide research often involves
government intervention to ensure “digital equality” or “universal access” by all individual
citizens to the Internet (Sawhney & Jayakar, 2007), thus moving them from the “have nots” to
the “haves.”
The term “empowerment” is closely related to the concept of social capital in Bourdieu’s
conception. Mehra, Merkel, and Bishop (2004) contend that “the internet has tremendous

31

potential to achieve greater social equity and empowerment and improve everyday life for those
on the margins of society” (p. 781). One hope of proponents of community networks is to
demonstrate that “the right mix of information technologies [will] help level the playing field and
bring everyone into the Information Age” (Virnoche & Marx, 1997, p. 94). Even evaluations are
intended “to empower the target of the evaluation” (Patterson, 2000, p. 73).
Williams and Alkalimat (2004) use the term “cyberpower” to refer to the extent to which
individuals, groups, or institutions use ICTs to wield power. However, as Mehra et al. (2004)
caution, “if we continue to regard the use of the internet as separate from the social realities of
disadvantaged user communities, then true empowerment of individuals in such groups via the
use of the internet will never be gained” (p. 799).
2.4.2.2.2

Coleman: Community Building and Social Inclusion

In contrast with Bourdieu’s emphasis on social capital as a means of exclusion, Coleman
views social capital as largely positive, because it advances both self-interest of individuals and
the organizations to which individuals belong (Everingham, 2003). For Schuler (1996),
community networks can advance social goals, such as building community, stimulating
economic development, and enhancing local decision-making, with “their immense potential for
increasing participation in community affairs” (p. 25) as their most important aspect. These
concepts of community building and social inclusion align most closely with Coleman’s
conception of social capital, defined as the resources that accrue to individuals as a result of their
relationships in networks. By acting as part of a collective with some degree of closure,
individuals are able to achieve their own self-interests that they would not be able to attain on
their own, while also benefiting the group. Coleman identified three forms of social capital: those
based on expectations of reciprocity, those based on norms and sanctions, and those based on

32

information provision. In contrast with other forms of capital, such as physical, financial, and
human capital, social capital is an inherently public good, as the individual who generates it does
not necessarily receive its benefits. This results in underinvestment of social capital, which may
explain declines in other types of capital (Coleman, 1988).
The term “community building” is often used as a synonym for social capital (in
Coleman’s sense) in the CN literature. Virnoche and Marx (1997) defines community building as
“involving residents with community issues and events, as well as with one another…[based on]
a belief in the importance of social cohesion obtained through involvement and communication
about shared interests or concerns” (p. 92). Community building is strategic, comprehensive,
community-driven, asset-based, and customized to neighborhood; it reinforces values, builds
social capital, and is linked to the broader society (de la Pena McCook, 2000, p. 10). The
assumption is that the Internet will strengthen a sense of community via connecting virtually
(Virnoche & Marx, 1997). Grigsby et al. (2002) contend that “grassroots planning, training and
community participation are critical for helping people not only access or use IT, but for using it
to build community capital and improve the quality of their lives” (p. 2). Several researchers
point to the opportunity for community building via stronger collaborations between community
networks and community-based organizations, such as libraries (Bajjaly, 1999; Bishop, Bruce,
Lunsford, Jones, Nazarova, Linderman, et al., 2004; de la Pena McCook, 2000; Kranich, 2001),
rural development organizations (Grigsby et al., 2002; Shuffstall, Alter, Bridger, & Sager, 2007),
and social service organizations (Bishop et al., 2004; Rideout & Reddick, 2005) – particularly
with regard to reaching underprivileged populations.
Warschauer (2003) defines social inclusion as “the extent that individuals, families, and
communities are able to fully participate in society and control their own destinies” (p. 8). This

33

view assumes that we are in a new networked information economy where ICT access
determines who is marginalized and who can participate in information era imperatives of
“identity, language, social participation, community, and civil society” (p. 9). To facilitate the
use of ICTs for positive social change and social inclusion, rather than focusing on access to
equipment and facilities, it is critical to look at “effective use,” what people do or can do with
ICTs (Gurstein, 2003).
In his concept of “networked individualism,” Wellman (2001) extends the concept of
social capital to the network level, contending that “network capital” “makes resources available
through interpersonal ties” (p. 27) and that “social capital [is] a product of personal community
networks as well as of formally institutionalized groups” (p. 28). Foth and Brereton (2004)
contend that community networks can serve as potential bridges between virtual and physical
public spaces, thereby fostering “network social capital” and neighborhood identity. Acevedo
(2007) contends that network capital serves “as a measure of the differentiated value in the
Information Age that communities structured as social networks generate on the basis of
electronic (digital) networks for themselves, for others and for society as a whole” (p. 2).
Jankowski, Van Selm, and Hollander (2001) caution that community networks will most
likely be found to enhance social capital in communities already high in social capital without
improving communities that are poor in social capital. Similarly, Foth and Brereton (2004)
predict that community networks are more likely to succeed in well-established communities that
are already rich in social capital. Simpson (2004) refers to this phenomenon as the "selfreinforcing virtuous cycle" of high social capital communities in contrast with the "vicious
cycle" of "uncivic communities" with diminishing social capital (p. 14). Cordell and Romanow
(2005) go even further, suggesting that social capital should be a prerequisite to community ICT

34

investment. They argue that scarce public funds should be “directed to those place-based
communities that already show evidence of strong positive social capital” or to virtual, rather
than place-based, communities “where the pay-offs are greatest” (p 17).
2.4.2.2.3

Putnam: Civic Engagement and Democracy

Putnam’s conception of social capital as key to a functioning democracy is widely
referenced in the community networking literature, as it is in the development literature
(Everingham, 2003). Putnam (1993) extends the benefits of social capital from individuals and
groups to the level of society. Key features of social capital in Putnam’s (1995) view include
“networks, norms, and social trust that facilitate coordination and cooperation for mutual
benefit,” such as civic associations and civil society (p. 66). “A dense network of secondary
associations located in civil society” is necessary for an effective democracy (Everingham, 2003,
p. 112).
The term “civic engagement” is often used as a synonym for social capital (in Putnam’s
sense) in the CN literature. The assumption is that “as civic engagement increases, so does
quality of life in the community” (Kavanaugh & Patterson, 2002, p. 327). Carroll & Rosson
(2003) assert that community networks can contribute to social capital by providing
opportunities for personal growth and development, externalizing community self-perceptions
and values, attracting attention and participation from beyond the geographic community, and
attracting new residents. Kranich (2001) compares CNs to libraries in their capacity to “create
channels of communication for public dialogue” (p. 88). Oxendine, Borgida, Sullivan, & Jackson
(2003) suggest that “community electronic networks may represent a potentially significant
technologically based approach to the problems of civic and political non-involvement” (p. 693).

35

However, Putnam (1995) himself doubts that electronic forums will be able to serve as effective
substitutes for traditional civic associations, like bowling leagues.
Originally, the Blacksburg Electronic Village (BEV) was formed to bridge the rural
isolation digital divide, but now that nearly everyone in Blacksburg is online, the focus has
shifted to building community social capital by supplementing community communication
(Kavanaugh & Patterson, 2002). Schuler (2005) encourages community networks to facilitate
information exchange between individuals to create “bonding social capital” and among
communities to create “bridging social capital,” terms coined by Putnam (2000). Bonding social
capital brings like people together, whereas bridging social capital brings together people who
are dissimilar. While often necessary, enhancing bonding social capital can be negative due to
the closing off of new ideas, while the enhancement of bridging social capital leads to more
positive outcomes (Putnam, 2002).
Related to the concept of civic engagement is that of democracy. Agre (1997) views
community networking as a “democratic technology movement” consisting of grassroots
activists who support a number of democracy-related projects while contesting development of
the global information infrastructure. Promoting public discussion and debate is one of the main
aims of community networking (Beamish, 1995). A fundamental value of American democracy
is that everyone be given equality of opportunity (Riedel, Dresel, Wagoner, Sullivan, & Borgida,
1998). CNs accomplish equality of opportunity to the Internet by ensuring universal low-cost
access to publicly provided information, developing a virtual public space, enabling open
communication and interaction, and promoting a high degree of political participation (Bellamy
& Taylor, 1998). CNs ideally further enhance democracy by making it possible for all citizens to
use the Internet to interactively communicate rather than to passively receive information,

36

drawing on the special interactive properties of the Internet, including: permitting individuals to
initiate communication and be selective and autonomous information users; supporting intuitionrich, personal, and immediate connectivity that encourages matter-of-fact, conversational virtual
communities that cannot be controlled by politicians, media tycoons, and bureaucrats; and
providing unlimited access to global information resources (Bellamy & Taylor, 1998).
2.4.2.3

Community Information

Community networks and libraries share an emphasis on providing information of value to
local communities. Open information access is high valued by libraries, as articulated in the
American Library Association’s mission “to enhance learning and ensure access to information
for all” (American Library Association, 2008). Durrance and Pettigrew (2001) trace the
provision of community information as a key library service to the 1970s. They contend that, in
the 1980s, libraries helped develop “community networks that provide citizens with equitable
access to the Internet for obtaining [community information] and communicating with others”
(Durrance & Pettigrew, 2001, p. v), including making library databases available on the Internet.
Bajjaly’s (1999) “The Community Networking Handbook,” an American Library
Association publication, describes how libraries can develop synergies with community
networks, with CNs viewed as separate entities from the library. Public library community
network initiatives focus on community information, but may involve interactive online
discussion opportunities as well (Durrance, Pettigrew, Jourdan, & Scheuerer, 2001). There are
several models of public library community network initiatives, including: library as primary
stakeholder, library as web host, library as information architect, and library as gateway
(Durrance et al., 2001).
Researchers in library and information science have been primary champions of

37

promoting community networks as vehicles for linking people and organizations with
information. Durrance and Pettigrew (2002) describe the complementary roles of libraries and
CNs in providing community information, which is defined as information that “helps people
cope with problems of daily living and facilitates community participation by bringing people
and organizations together” (p. v). They explain that some individuals have problems expressing
their information needs and “navigating the local human services web” (Durrance & Pettigrew,
2002, p. 140). Dervin’s (1999) sense-making theory helps identify the barriers that people face
when seeking information. Sense-making contends that, throughout their lives, individuals
encounter knowledge gaps that can only be bridged by “making new sense of their situation”
(Pettigrew, Durrance, & Vakkari, 1999, p. 396) through information seeking. Wilson’s (1997)
revised information behavior model posits that this information gap is due to intervening
variables (demographic, psychological, role-related, environmental, and source-related) between
the context of an information need and successful information seeking.
In common among all these conceptions of community networks is that they can be
effective in filling gaps between citizens and a better way of life. The next section examines the
empirical evidence available to support or refute these claims.
2.5

Empirical Research
This section synthesizes findings and conclusions from books and research papers on

community networks in the United States. This section is organized to reflect some of the goals
of community networking: grassroots design, empowerment, political participation and civic
engagement, community building, and community information, recognizing that these categories
are not mutually exclusive. The section concludes with a section on evaluation studies.

38

2.5.1

Community Networks and the Grassroots
This section investigates the claim that community networking represents a grassroots

effort to integrate ICTs into communities. Community networks “offer a unique vision of
grassroots technology development” (Carroll & Rosson, 1996, p. 69).
2.5.1.1

The Techno-Elite
The conception of CNs as being built by the grassroots has its skeptics. Vaughan and

Schwartz (1999) note "paradoxically, in designing a community information network the person
who is intended to benefit most from the system, the average citizen, is least involved in the
process" (p. 588). Similarly, Merkel, Xiao, Farooq, Ganoe, Lee, Carroll, et al. (2004) note there
are few studies where community members actively contribute or drive community ICT design.
Instead, CN development is typically undertaken by those who are already "ICT-literate" and
that, more often than not, the user is not meaningfully included (Vaughan & Schwartz, 1999). To
combat this, drawing on Rogers’ (2003) diffusion of innovation theory, Vaughan and Schwartz
(1999) identify target users for two focus groups to help optimize the website design of
HoosierNet, an Indiana CN. One group included innovators, skilled computer users who had
volunteered for HoosierNet. The other group included early adopters, individuals who were
active in the local community and who also volunteered for HoosierNet. The authors found that
their assumptions about user website navigation and content needs were often incorrect and that
meaningful category names were essential.
The Blacksburg Electronic Village (BEV) illustrates various technological innovations,
including incorporation of MOOs (multi-user domains object-oriented) (Carroll & Rosson, 1998;
Carroll et al., 2001), applications for senior citizens and schools (Cohill & Kavanaugh, 2000),
and history databases (Carroll et al., 1995; Cohill & Kavanaugh, 2000). By 1996, BEV was

39

touted as “one of the most advanced community network projects in the U.S.” (Carroll &
Rosson, 1996). Silver (2004) chronicles how BEV and the Seattle Community Network (SCN)
were developed, along with motivations and rewards of the developers. However, he also notes
that most of Blacksburg’s residents were already connected to the university in some way (85%,
according to Cohill & Kavanaugh, 2000), making them among the techno-elite. Carroll and
Rosson (2003) acknowledge that design trade-offs in community network features cause “both
desirable and undesirable consequences for members, groups of members, and other community
institutions” (p. 384). Such trade-offs include designing interfaces that cannot be maintained by
host organizations, excluding non-participants, undermining face-to-face meetings, promoting
the passive and asocial activity of web browsing, reducing proportion of local content, increasing
Internet-related health risks of depression and obsession, and altering existing communication
patterns and power relationships that can lead to conflict (p. 386).
2.5.1.2

Disadvantaged Individuals
There are specific problems with increased user involvement in systems design

particularly for those who are disadvantaged. Kavanaugh, Reese, Carroll, and Rosson (2005)
point out that “participatory design is rarely used for people with disadvantages in education,
such as below poverty line groups, or others who typically have low computer literacy” (Sociotechnical implications section, ¶ 4) because, for them, learning to use ICTs “is still a daunting
task” (Socio-technical implications section, ¶ 5). Also, they tend to use the Internet for seeking
and purchasing consumer products, as backed up by Mehra et al.’s (2004) study, which describes
how low-income individuals use the Internet for buying or selling things needed in daily life
such as cars, houses, and computers. Shiffer (1999) laments the difficulty in attaining a critical
mass of users for CNs in Milwaukee and Buffalo despite the potential of CNs for enhancing

40

distressed urban communities. He suspects the lack of critical mass is due to a dearth of relevant
content, one of the design trade-offs mentioned by Carroll and Rosson (2003).
2.5.1.3

Non-Profit Organizations
There are problems with involving non-profit organizations who serve the disadvantaged

in CN design as well. Based on their participatory work with non-profit organizations, Merkel,
Clitherow, Farooq, Xiao, Ganoe, Carroll, and Rosson (2005) contend that community ICT
initiatives, such as Pennsylvania’s Civic Nexus project, usually lack resources like time and
money to develop and sustain robust applications. Community groups often fail to see the
centrality of information technology (IT) to their missions, fail to engage in long-term IT
planning, rely too much on volunteers instead of paid IT staff, and are resistant to changes in
their practices (Merkel et al., 2005). Based on their work with a community network in rural
Potter County, Pennsylvania, Grigsby et al. (2002) conclude that the development of
organizational capacity and human capital is more important than money in using ICTs to
address community problems. They identify local extension agents as key “change agents” for
diffusion, working in conjunction with local community leaders, government and technology
partners, and local residents.
Based on their longitudinal work with Urban-Net in New York, Venkatesh and Chango
(2007) note that community-based organizations (CBOs) are less resourced and less tech-savvy
than public (government) organizations. When CBOs and public organizations come together in
civic networking initiatives, the natural tendency is for the more powerful public organizations to
try to maneuver community networking goals to suit their own interests, rather than the interests
of the disadvantaged who are represented by the CBOs.

Summary
To summarize, despite the best intentions of CN designers, in reality, there are several

issues involved with grassroots CN design:

2.5.2

•

Underprivileged individuals often lack even basic skills in ICT usage, and their
Internet use tends to be for consumer-related purposes

•

Since organizations involved in CN initiatives have limited resources, they are not
able to easily attract technologically-savvy individuals to design and maintain the
applications and infrastructure

•

The amount of relevant local content correlates with the level of grassroots
development

•

Ensuring effective community network design will likely involve building coalitions
between the techno-elite and those who are less techno-savvy to improve local
capacity

•

Even if such coalitions come to pass, there will likely be a need for safeguards to
ensure desired outcomes for those who are most disadvantaged

Community Networks and Empowerment
This section investigates the claim that community networks can help overcome the

digital divide, thereby contributing to community empowerment and an improved quality of life.
This claim is related to the form of social capital described by Bourdieu (1983). “In casting the
digital divide as an important national problem, scholars, policymakers and the public recognize
the tremendous potential of the internet to improve everyday life for those on the margins of
society, and to achieve greater social equity and empowerment” (Mehra et al., 2004, p. 782).
2.5.2.1

A More Equitable Social Order
Schuler (1996) places community networks as a cornerstone of his theory of civic

intelligence, “the capacity of society to consciously adapt to its environment and shape a future
environment that is healthy, equitable and sustainable” (Schuler, 1994, Abstract section, ¶ 2).
Bajjaly (1999) defines community networking as “a process designed to achieve the necessary

42

electronic information access objectives in order to improve the quality of life and the economic
development of a community” (p. 6). However, in a review of a number of CN initiatives,
Beamish (1999) notes that while CN projects assume that “technology will automatically
improve the lives of low-income residents and their neighborhood” (p. 364), it is often unclear
what residents will use the CN for, and there is an “alarming” lack of evaluation data supporting
these utopian claims (p. 364). Carroll and Rosson (2001) acknowledge that even the impact of
the Blacksburg Electronic Village on the economy of Blacksburg is unknown.
In their field research with Boulder Community Network (BCN), Virnoche and Marx
(1997) note that CN advocates cling to the utopian idea that the right mix of technologies will
level the playing field, despite findings from the social movement literature that “it is very
difficult to mobilize people who lack general resources and whose energies are channeled into
meeting day-to-day sustenance needs” (p. 94). As a Boulder (Colorado) Community Network
staff member shared, low-income single working parents “did not ‘choose’ this form of
empowerment and [it is] presumptuous to assume that they even wanted the technology”
(Virnoche & Marx, 1997, p. 93). Bishop et al. (1999) attribute this to “more immediate and grave
survival needs” (p. 365) facing this population.
In an analysis of the existing literature that deconstructs the concept of social capital,
Pigg and Crank (2004) suggest that ICTs have “the capability to contribute to enhancing and
extending social networks, providing access to resources that can be mobilized for action,
enhancing solidarity in social groups, and supporting mechanisms of enforceable trust and
reciprocity in transactions” (p. 69). They make an analytical distinction between communication
(affective) and information (cognitive) aspects, concluding that there is evidence that some
components of social capital are created via the Internet’s communicative functions. However,

43

there is little empirical evidence to show that the Internet’s information functions are creating
social capital. “It is likely that content, per se, is not the driving force” (p. 66).
Mehra, Merkel, and Bishop (2004) examine the every day computer and Internet usage of
low income, mostly African-American, participants engaged in the Community Networking
Initiative, a partnership between Prairienet, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and
the Urban League, to provide computer training and distribution. They note that the “have not”
category of the digital divide rhetoric is an inadequate representation of how people use
technology. “[P]eople adopt technology in a series of stops and starts, often dictated by events
and changes in their lives” (p. 786), with networks of family and friends heavily influencing
adoption and technical problem resolution. Usage depends on the extent to which individuals
understand what ICTs can do for them. And even when communities articulate specific goals,
these are often not considered in digital divide initiatives (Srinivasan, 2007).
Looking back on the Seattle Community Network, which he founded, Schuler (2005)
concludes that the lack of agreement on shared goals has likely doomed the movement. Yet, he
still holds out the belief that “civil society – through democratic discussion and action – must
ultimately transform…the dominant forces in our society” (p. 40).
2.5.2.2

Public Access Sites
One of the methods used by CNs to level the playing field is to make public access

terminals available for Internet access by all citizens. Based on their census of public access sites
in Toledo, Ohio, Williams and Alkalimat (2004) examine four different types of public
computing sites: government, commercial, university, and community. As a result of public
spending, government sites, including public schools, libraries, and government offices, are
randomly located “in the same proximity to rich and poor” (p. 108). Market demand drives

44

location of commercial and university sites, with their being closer to upper-income groups and
students. Community sites, which include churches, private schools, civic organizations, and
hospitals, follow a U-shaped pattern, located near high- and low-income areas, but not the
middle.
Pigg (2001) finds that only three of the 22 CNs in the Missouri Express community
networking initiative had public access terminals. And when they do exist, there are still many
barriers to their use. Based on surveys, interviews, and focus groups from residents of a lowincome neighborhood in the Urbana-Champaign area served by Prairienet, Bishop et al. (1999)
find that, despite an expressed enthusiasm for the idea of using CNs, the ability of residents to
take advantage of public access terminals is limited by transportation, safety concerns, child care,
access hours, and need for technical support. Through survey, field visits, document analysis,
observations, and interviews, Strover et al. (2004) find similar barriers in 36 Texas CNs,
including location, hours of operation, transportation, childcare, support staff, language,
connectivity and technical problems. In their review of community informatics projects
worldwide, Loader and Keeble (2004) find that the socially excluded make little use of public
access sites.
Marks (2005) describes the importance of libraries and the potential for community
networks to improve the quality of life for deaf people living in rural areas. However,
inaccessible websites, language and cultural differences, and historically lower income and
education levels among the deaf are formidable barriers. Another barrier is that, due to their
lower numbers, disabled individuals are often the last user groups whose needs are built into
library budgets.

45

2.5.2.3

Funding Requirements
Venkatesh and Shin (2002) describe the social shaping of Urban-net (a pseudonym), an

inter-organizational network designed to connect non-profit organizations in economically
distressed communities to a central advanced telecommunications “backbone.” Because of an
“implied threat” from the funders to pull funding if an insufficient number of organizations
signed on, the CN developers employed a “mall model” of diffusion that relied on enlisting
powerful “anchor tenants” first. In the absence of “provisions…requiring the resource rich to
assist the resource poor to get connected” (p. 182), applications to serve the needs of the poor,
the elderly, the disabled, and ethnic groups were not developed.
In an examination of five rural broadband projects in New York, Venkatesh, Nosovitch,
and Miner (2004) note that system planners suffered from a lack of technical expertise and useful
prototypes; experienced considerable project delays, scope changes, staff turnover, and
ambiguous costs; and did not understand their political role between the telecommunications
company and targeted beneficiaries. With resource-poor community-based organizations and
small businesses failing to unite, the end result was that the CN merely reinforced existing power
structures. Venkatesh and Owens (2006) suggest that educational institutions produce a
“reflexive designer” who employs social learning and uses solidarity with others to achieve
social equity goals.
Based on interviews, archival data, surveys, content analyses, and participant
observation, Shin (2007) chronicles how A-Net, a network set up to provide broadband and
video to 80 institutions serving low income and underserved communities in New York, shifted
away completely from public benefit goals to private for-profit goals that were oriented almost
exclusively toward telemedicine. The telemedicine focus came from the influence of the CN’s

46

founder, whereas the self-sufficiency requirement in the grant funding led to the focus on the
CN’s making money.
The Texas state agency that funded CNs, the Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund
(TIF), also had a requirement for CNs to achieve self-sustainability (Strover et al., 2004). The
result was that the most successful CNs were those with the partnerships with the strongest
school systems, which also received significant funding from TIF. Texas’ grant guidelines
limited CNs in several other ways. These included requiring partnership with and location of
equipment only at certain sites, such as educational institutions and libraries, that may not be
willing to reach out to or are not frequented by targeted beneficiaries and that may not buy-in to
the CN mission; difficulty explaining bureaucratic and accounting requirements for pursuing and
administering the projects; political pressure to spend grant funds on non-community-defined
goals; and disallowing use of funds for marketing. Other impediments to success include
problems with the technology; failure to collect usage and demographic data; and CNs’ focusing
on direct-to-individual instead of indirect-to-individual programs (via community-based
organizations). The most popular public access programs were in community centers, libraries,
and schools that had ongoing social programs and available support staff; laptop and digital
camera personal loan programs; and computers located for agency staff use (Strover et al., 2004).
2.5.2.4

Summary
To summarize, the evidence identifies several issues with CNs serving to empower

disadvantaged communities:
•

ICT adoption and usage changes over time in response to everyday needs and social
network pressures

•

The connection between how a CN will help one achieve a better quality of life
remains unclear

47

2.5.3

•

Public access sites are underutilized by intended disadvantaged users due to
numerous barriers which are not addressed by CNs

•

Requirements imposed by funders often constrain, rather than enhance, the
effectiveness of CNs

•

Ensuring that community networks will reach targeted beneficiaries will likely
involve some sort of enforcement mechanisms between the resource rich and the
resource poor

Community Networks and Community Building
This section investigates the claim that community networks can enhance community

building, the form of social capital described by Coleman (1988). Community networks “offer
opportunities for community institutions to collaborate and build partnerships…that might be
overlooked by the commercial sector” (Kranich, 2004, p. 292).
2.5.3.1

Social Relations
Contractor and Bishop (1999) describe three stages of how ICTs impact social relations:

substitution, enlargement, and reconfiguration. Substitution involves using the new ICT to
accomplish more efficiently the same communication tasks done previously. Enlargement
involves using ICTs to sustain or deepen ongoing relationships. Contractor and Bishop contend
that most ICT effects have involved substitution and enlargement, which only serve to deepen
“the digital divide between those who have social and knowledge capital and those who don’t”
(p. 151). To effect positive social change, CNs must reconfigure relationships by establishing
new positive connections and weakening negative relations.
There is evidence that CNs can facilitate interpersonal network reconfiguration by
fostering and supporting new positive connections within geographical communities and
promoting community information sharing through these new relationships. The MUSIC project
in Newark that spanned several low-income housing developments fostered several new “on-theground” relationships (Shaw & Shaw, 1999). These included bonding between older women and
48

younger girls when braiding hair, ride-alongs to the airport between university researchers and
low-income residents, putting on a talent show, and the formation of a boy scout organization
(Shaw & Shaw, 1999). The MUSIC project also appears to have also led to some social
mobilization. For example, an annual parade was rescheduled because it conflicted with the
funeral for a murdered local girl who had been memorialized online (Shaw & Shaw, 1999).
To facilitate network reconfiguration at community level, Contractor, Zink, and Chan
(1998) describe their planned piloting of a “communityware” tool called PrairieKNOW (Prairie
Knowledge Networks On the Web), which is designed to identify who knows or has certain
resources within a community. The tool is based on asset mapping (Kretzman & McKnight,
1993). Community asset mapping has also been used in working with community technology
centers (CTCs), another community ICT intervention launched during the Clinton-Gore era
(Pinkett, 2003; Servon, 2002).
2.5.3.2

Community Network Building
The evidence suggests that activities involved in creating and operating community

networks themselves may foster network reconfiguration and thus constitute a form of
community building. Longan (2005) observes that community building tends to revolve around
building the CN, instead of building the community itself, with technological aspects of CNs
obscuring the needs of the community. However, Bishop, Bruce, Lunsford, Jones, Nazarova,
Linderman, et al. (2004) turn the act of community network building into a positive. They
describe the Inquiry Page project, a web-based tool aimed at fostering collaboration for the
purpose of mutual learning and inquiry, a concept that is rooted in the works of Dewey. The
collaboratively-developed Inquiry Page consists of digital curricula and action plans, discussion
forums, workshops, partnerships, and ideas. The researchers report that the collaborative Inquiry

49

Page project “makes more productive use of the diverse and sometimes conflicting knowledge
held by the teachers, students, university researchers, librarians, parents, and community activists
who are both creators and users of Inquiry Page infrastructure and resources” (Bishop et al.,
2004, 4 Open process for ICT capacity development section, ¶ 2).
Drawing from his examination of three Washington, DC, area CNs, Baker (2000) notes
that planning CNs by communicating only virtually is easy, but keeping up the motivation and
commitment necessary to implement CNs is much harder and requires face-to-face interaction to
build relationships that will endure. Kavanaugh et al. (2005) describe that in their work with
senior citizens in Blacksburg, the most tangible benefits were the relationships that developed
between senior citizens and younger people who worked together on participatory design
projects.
Schuler (2005) contends that “a community network in and of itself can provide an
occasion for shared work and, hence, help build community” (p. 34). He suggests that since
computer use is individual, rather than community-oriented, perhaps a useful measure of a CN’s
value is by having its volunteers go on to serve their communities in other ways as many
volunteers at the Seattle Community Network have.
2.5.3.3

Interorganizational Relations
Ohio’s Trumball County Community Network project (Watson, 2001) maintains inter-

organizational linkages among schools industry, and government rather than individuals. In their
study of three public library-community networks, not-for-profit organizations report that CNs
helped them provide their services more efficiently and effectively, improved staff computer
knowledge and skill, and enhanced organizational visibility (Durrance & Pettigrew, 2002;
Pettigrew et al., 2002).

50

Venkatesh, Nosovitch, and Khan (1999) survey nonprofit participants in New York’s
effort to link community non-profit institutions (e.g., libraries, schools, government, and social
services) via high-speed community network backbones. The surveys identify gaps in knowledge
between the expertise needed and that available. The researchers suggest that university-based
technology transfer programs can play a leading role in reducing knowledge barriers and
diffusing the technology so as not to exacerbate technology gaps.
Kubicek and Wagner (2002) suggest that CNs would do well to develop new community
applications that enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of civic groups and non-profit
organizations. Shuffstall et al. (2007) suggest the use of community development techniques to
engage local leaders and organizations to create new linkages that connect rural communities.
2.5.3.4

Summary
Overall, there is evidence to suggest that CNs do contribute to community building. To

summarize, the evidence shows that:

2.5.4

•

Face-to-face interaction is important when implementing CNs

•

CN building itself provides opportunities to supplement and reconfigure social
relationships through skill building and working with new people

•

Concentrating on reconfiguring social relations, particularly at the interorganizational level with nonprofits, is a promising direction for CNs

Community Networks and Civic Engagement
This section investigates the claim that community networks can enhance civic

engagement, related to the form of social capital described by Putnam (1995). “Comparable to
libraries, community networks…create channels of communication for public dialogue”
(Kranich, 2004, p. 292).
2.5.4.1

Blacksburg
Residents in the Blacksburg, Virginia area served by the Blacksburg Electronic Village
51

(BEV) were subjects for a number of empirical studies that assess the extent to which the CN
increases civic engagement. Based on surveys administered in 1996 and again in 1999 of
randomly selected, non-student, households in the Blacksburg area, Kavanaugh and Patterson
(2002) find 1) No change in community attachment and involvement even though BEV access
increased (there was near universal Internet access by Blacksburg area residents in 1999); 2)
Increased use of the Internet to communicate with family members, informal social groups and,
to a lesser extent, with members of formal social groups and local friends; and 3) A subset of the
population are early adopters who tend to use the Internet more for civic engagement and social
capital building activities than later adopters. Kavanaugh and Patterson (2002) provide two
explanations for their findings: 1) that Putnam (2000) was correct in his contention that
successful CNs like BEV are outcomes of, rather than catalysts for, “communities with already
high levels of social capital, community involvement, and community attachment,” or 2) that
social capital erosion can be restored through CNs awakening “a latent capacity for civic
engagement” among “individuals of higher social and economic status, with high demands for
their time and attention” (Kavanaugh & Patterson, 2002, p. 341). The authors hope for the latter,
reasserting that an important role that CNs can play is helping Americans transfer “social capital
building communication behaviors” (p. 342) learned online to offline activities.
Based on one-on-one interviews and online surveys conducted in 1997 and 1999 of
community leaders and senior citizens actively engaged in social networks with an online
presence, Kavanaugh (2002) finds that the Internet strengthens existing social networks and
information exchanges, facilitates development of weak ties across groups, and increases
community involvement for those who are already active in their communities and who also
score higher in education and newspaper readership.

52

Based on surveys of Blacksburg residents in 2001 and 2002, Kavanaugh et al. (2005) find
that the Internet strengthens social involvement for those with high levels of education and
community involvement. They also find that being members of each other's social networks
provides built-in norms of reciprocity, rules, and roles that carry over into the online community”
(Discussion section, ¶ 1). Community social relationships “are reinforced and strengthened not
only by more face-to-face interaction but also by more online interaction” (Discussion section, ¶
2). Based on surveys, questionnaires, and interviews of Blacksburg area residents, Carroll (2005)
finds that existing community activism in Blacksburg is the best predictor of Internet use for
civic activity, whereas non-community activists use the Internet for other goals.
2.5.4.2

Minnesota
Riedel et al. (1998) conducted a mail survey of residents of Grand Rapids, Minnesota, to

generate baseline data for the community in the early stages of introducing the GrandNet
community network, a cooperative effort between the local school district, an area community
college, county human services, a development corporation, and the public library. The results
show that, despite residing in a small rural community, Grand Rapids residents are highly
educated, tend to be “ahead of the technology curve” (p. 380), and are dedicated to the
democratic ideal that computer resources should be available to everyone. The best predictors of
likely use of GrandNet are prior GrandNet use, positive attitude toward computers, and
involvement in local community activities and politics. After controlling for political, social, and
technical capital, socioeconomic status differences disappear entirely.
Sullivan et al. (2002) administered mail surveys in 1997 and again in 1999 to residents of
two rural communities: Grand Rapids, a community served by GrandNet, by then a TIIAPfunded CN; and Detroit Lakes, a community whose Internet access was supplied by the

53

competitive marketplace. Sullivan et al. find that “political capital,” a measure of “the political
intensity of one’s social network” (p. 873), is linked to computer use and attitudes in Grand
Rapids but not in Detroit Lakes. Thus they conclude that extant “political capital” may be critical
to CN development and growth and therefore CNs are likely to succeed only in a community
with actively engaged citizens.
Borgida, Sullivan, Oxendine, Jackson, and Riedel (2002) use a historical analysis along
with focus group results from these same two Minnesota communities to assess whether each
community views Internet access as a public or private good. They conclude that Grand Rapids
residents take the perspective that the digital divide is a communal problem requiring a public
response, whereas Detroit Lakes residents believe that Internet access should be addressed by the
private sector.
2.5.4.3

Other Sites
A number of other studies challenge the contention that CNs are effective tools for

generating new political participation and civic engagement and building social capital in the
sense of Putnam (1995). Based on surveys following training sessions with 24 individuals who
volunteered to create political projects for a local community network, Gregson (1997) finds that
political interest and prior Internet experience are the best predictors of willingness and ability to
use the community network to promote political participation. Individuals with high political
interest appear to benefit the most from training, whereas those with both high political interest
and Internet experience are ready to go. However, “People [with] no interest in either the Internet
or political participation will not suddenly become politically active merely because a
community network begins offering training” (Conclusions and Suggestions for Further Study
section, ¶ 6).

54

It has been disheartening for community networking advocates to find that those who
access networks for information do not necessarily wish to participate in civic affairs (Bellamy &
Taylor, 1998). However, this is consistent with extensive literature review findings of Robbin,
Courtright, and Davis (2004) that ICTs appear to reinforce, rather than reinvent, political
behavior, with elites and organizations gaining the most benefit (p. 463). Exacerbating this
problem is the fact that it has been much easier to secure funding for economic or workforce
development-related applications than it has been for social or political applications, resulting in
the marginalization or exclusion of democratic applications (Bellamy & Taylor, 1998). Bellamy
and Taylor suggest that instead of trying to replace representative democracy with direct
democracy, community networking advocates could promote using ICTs for enabling "new
forms of popular deliberation and direct participation" (p. 115) that can provide strategic
guidance to elected officials.
Rosenbaum and Gregson (1998) note that board members representing 24 of 28 Indiana
CNs made little mention during their interviews of plans for interactive features to facilitate
political and civic engagement. A website content analysis conducted on Indiana’s CN websites
revealed that only a few CNs had developed local discussion forums (Rosenbaum, 1998). This is
consistent with Beamish’s (1995) findings that, despite their purported goal of enhancing
democratic participation, community networks failed to provide opportunities for public
discussion and debate or opportunities to interact with government officials.
Pigg’s (2001) website content analysis of 22 Missouri CNs showed very little evidence of
attempts to create a public sphere. In a website content analysis of 40 CNs, Tonn, Zambrano, and
Moore (2001) find little evidence to support CNs building social capital. In a website analysis of
six CNs, using their own social capital model, Chewar, McCrickard, and Carroll (2005) conclude

55

that CNs provide weak support in building social capital. In interviews with 70 CN activists from
five CNs, Longan (2005) finds that CNs do not generate communicative mobility capable of
bringing about social change. In a review of 75 CN websites, Horning (2007) finds that CNs do
not promote strong democracy, however, CNs do have useful, local content conducive to social
capital generation.
2.5.4.4

Summary
Overall, there is little evidence to support the contention that CNs transform non-civically

engaged community residents into active community participants. To summarize, the evidence
shows that:

2.5.5

•

CNs are more likely to be established and used in communities where civicallyengaged early adopters can champion them

•

Early CN adopters and the most enthusiastic CN users are more likely to already be
civically engaged, and they view CNs serve as an additional outlet for civic
engagement

•

CN websites show little evidence of promoting civic engagement or strong
democracy

•

For those not inclined to be civically engaged, CNs and the Internet are used to
reinforce existing social relationships and for purposes other than civic engagement

Community Networks and Community Information
This section investigates the claim that community networks provide useful information

about and for communities. “Community networks can be the local entrance to the Internet as
well as to [local] information and communication services” (Cisler, 1994, p. 24).
2.5.5.1

Information Content
Based on a website content analysis of 24 CN websites in Indiana, Rosenbaum (1998)

finds that while the websites have useful and usable technical infrastructures, they lack deep
local content and services (Rosenbaum, 1998). This aligns with findings about BEV and SCN

56

which show active local content creation early on, tapering off to outdated content, mostly
external links, and inactive users (Bowden et al., 2000; Carroll & Rosson, 2003; Patterson, 2000;
Schuler, 2005; Silver, 2004). Additional barriers to the usefulness of CN websites include poor
retrieval, poor interface design, poor organization, out-of-date or inaccurate information,
questionable authority, missing information, dead links, language, security, specificity, and
nonanticipatory systems (Durrance & Pettigrew, 2002).
Through a series of studies, Kwon and her colleagues systematically assess the
assumption that users understand the community information goals of CNs (Kwon, 2005; Kwon
& Onwuegbuzie, 2005; Kwon & Toms, 2002; Kwon & Zweizig, 2006). Using questionnaires
and surveys from current and former users of an unspecified CN in the Midwest, they show that
the CN is used mainly as an affordable means of accessing the Internet rather than for accessing
community information. This is particularly true among those with no alternative means of
access, who also happen to be of lower socioeconomic status (Kwon, 2005; Kwon &
Onwuegbuzie, 2005; Kwon & Toms; Kwon & Zweizig, 2006). However, consistent with Riedel
et al. (1998), favorable attitude toward the CN was a significant predictor of CN use by
individuals with alternative means of accessing the Internet. This suggests that users who support
the local community information goal of CNs are those more likely to use the CN, even when
they can access the Internet through other means (Kwon & Zweizig, 2006).
2.5.5.2

Information Use
In a series of works, Durrance and Pettigrew chronicle the history of community

information, going back to the 1970s, and summarize results of their 1998-2000 study of how the
public uses networking community information (Durrance & Pettigrew, 2001; Durrance &
Pettigrew, 2002; Pettigrew et al., 1999). They find that community networks can 1) overcome

57

geographical and digital divide barriers involved in asking for information, 2) increase non-profit
effectiveness and responsiveness, 3) improve searching, 4) enhance respect for librarians’ skills,
and 5) “contribute to community building, foster civic engagement, create a sense of
community” (Durrance & Pettigrew, 2001, Benefits of Community Networks section, ¶ 5). Four
community networks are highlighted as exemplars of successful CN-library partnerships:
Tallahassee FreeNet, Darien (Conn.) Community Information Network, Three Rivers Free-Net,
and NorthStarNet in Chicago (Durrance et al., 2001).
Durrance and Pettigrew (2002) use Dervin’s sense-making methodology (1999) to
determine how individuals use community information systems and how barriers often get in the
way within the context of the situation at-hand. When people are blocked from accessing useful
community information, they experience a reduced quality of life. Barriers to accessing
community information within low-income communities, for example, include fragmented social
service information, uncoordinated service delivery, and uncoordinated resource sharing
(Contractor & Bishop, 1999).
Baker (2000) concludes that, in light of increased competition from commercial Internet
service providers, community networks can no longer be simple information and connection
portals targeted at individuals to remain viable. Instead, CNs should focus on their ability to
enhance political, education, and social information flows in geographic communities.
Community networks, working in close conjunction with public libraries, can and already have
helped citizens access community information (Durrance & Pettigrew, 2002).
2.5.5.3

Summary
Overall, there is evidence that CNs are helpful in connecting citizens to information, but

there are some challenges. The evidence shows that:

58

2.5.6

•

Community networks begin by providing good local content, but over time fail to
keep the links and content updated on their websites

•

There is a lack of recognition that a primary CN aim is to provide local content; Most
users use CNs as an inexpensive Internet access point rather than for the local content
on their websites

•

A promising niche for CNs appears to be in improving information flows between
community organizations and institutions, particularly in partnership with libraries

Meta-Level Evaluation of Community Network Initiatives
The empirical evidence examined for this literature review includes four evaluations of

the community network literature, some of which extend beyond the United States. The
evaluations organize the literature based upon CN goals, provide recommendations for future
evaluation, and offer interpretations of what is happening with CNs.
Based on a review of 14 published CN evaluations and 84 CN websites, Gregson and
Ford (1998) find that it is difficult to evaluate CNs because they all have different goals.
Providing information and access are top goals for CNs, followed by technical literacy,
community building, communication, economic development, and education/lifelong learning.
Civic participation is further down the list, with social services provision identified as a goal only
by three CNs. The authors recommend further exploratory studies, involving more stakeholders
in evaluation, triangulation of data, goals-based evaluations, actionable evaluations, coordination
of evaluations, and built-in assessment tools.
O’Neil (2002) examines 30 community ICT evaluations conducted between 1994 and
2001 and finds they fall into five major theoretical areas: strong democracy, social capital,
individual empowerment, sense of community, and economic development opportunities. O’Neil
presents a table listing different indicators identified in her review and calls for researchers to be
explicit in what they are evaluating, since specific factors contributing to the effectiveness of
community ICT initiatives are still unclear. Recommendations for evaluation include
59

determining the evaluation’s purpose and research questions up front, making explicit one’s
assumptions and underlying theoretical framework, involving stakeholders in evaluation design
and implementation, obtaining quantitative data, triangulation, and compliance with human
subjects regulations.
Loader and Keeble (2004) evaluate a broad array of community informatics initiatives
around the world, including community networks in the U.S. They organize the literature based
on the typical components of community informatics projects: access, computer skills, economic
opportunity, civic participation, and diversity. In the course of the review, they identify “five
thematic ambiguities” in the literature:
•

Communities can engender social control as much as social capital

•

Despite the aim of social inclusion, the articulate middle-class tends to more
effectively use ICTs

•

There is a mismatch between top-down techno-enthusiasts and grassroots community
advocates

•

Technology alone will not bridge the digital divide because it also requires selfconfidence in technological ability and perceived relevance

•

It is difficult for community ICT projects to be both innovative and sustainable over
the long-term

Barriers to the underserved identified by Loader and Keeble (2004) include:
•

Locating public access sites in libraries and schools

•

Emphasizing ICTs for education and literacy

•

Failing to demonstrate relevance of ICTs for disadvantaged groups

Borgstrom, Drucker, and Sparrow (2005) present a meta-analysis of the three formal
evaluations conducted of the NTIA’s TOP initiative by Frechtling, Lockwood, Silverstein,
Somers, and Tuss (1999); Frechtling, Silverstein, Snow, and Somers, (2000); Johnson and
Johnson Associates, Inc. (2001). Borgstrom et al. (2005) specifically focus on projects that fall
60

into the categories of community economic development, urban asset mapping, and rural
resource management, while acknowledging the other project categories of arts and culture,
education, human services, lifelong learning, public safety, social services, telemedicine and
health, and workforce development. The formal TOP evaluations recommended that future
projects include requiring comprehensive community needs assessments, technical feasibility
studies, stakeholder involvement in planning and operations, integration of technology into
existing activities, and collection of outcome data. From “the full spectrum of TOP projects” (p.
107), Borgstrom et al. (2005) identified two key elements for success: 1) building strong social
networks, as well as technical and 2) being realistic about the time needed to assemble,
implement, and evaluate the effort.
Meta-level evaluations of community networks show that:

2.6

•

Community networks have different goals, which makes evaluation challenging

•

Stakeholders are not sufficiently involved in CN development, operations, or
evaluation

•

Innovative technological aspects of CNs may not be addressing locally-driven needs
“on-the-ground”

Methodologies
This section describes the main methodologies employed in the scholarly literature on

community networks in the United States where data collection occurred. Scholarly works that
do not include empirical evidence, such as those that are mainly conceptual in nature or that
proposed evaluation frameworks without supplying evaluation results, have been excluded from
discussion in this section.
Of the community networking studies that involve empirical evidence, the most common
modes of observation are qualitative field research (which includes focus groups, participant
observation, and action research), survey research (which includes surveys and interviews), and
61

unobtrusive research (which includes document review, website content analysis, and
historical/comparative review).
Combining qualitative and quantitative measures is common and desirable in community
networking research (Beamish, 1995; O’Neil, 2002). Qualitative research is good for exploratory
studies of new phenomena, such as community networks, since it provides a holistic and
naturalistic view of a dynamic situation. And it is a good complement to quantitative measures,
which produce numbers that may be more reflective of an entire community, rather than just
individuals impacted by the community networking initiative. Quantitative methods are useful in
giving a sense of expected outcomes, but they offer “few benchmarks for interpreting measures”
(O’Neil, 2002, p. 91). Quantitative measures may show how many people are using a community
network, but not for what purpose or to what effect (Beamish, 1995).
2.6.1

Survey Research
Survey research, including interviews and surveys, is useful for collecting data about a

population that is too large to observe directly (Babbie, 2004). Research on individuals in
Blacksburg and surrounding Montgomery County, Virginia, was gleaned from several surveys
and interview instruments administered at different points in time, with age and income among
the demographic variables captured. Between 1996 and 1999, Kavanaugh (2002) conducted oneon-one interviews with community leaders and senior citizens who belonged to groups with an
online presence. Online questionnaires were distributed in 1996 and again in 1999 to members of
a local school board mailing list, yielding a 20% and 7% response rate, respectively (Kavanaugh,
2002). Kavanaugh and Patterson (2002) compared results from a telephone survey of
Montgomery County residents in 1996 with the same survey of non-student Blacksburg city
residents in 1999.

62

Several studies of the Blacksburg Electronic Village (BEV) relied on data supplied by a
single questionnaire, entitled Experiences of People, Internet and Community (EPIC), that had
been distributed to a stratified sample of 100 households drawn from an initial pool of 1250
households (Carroll, 2005; Kavanaugh, Carroll, et al., 2005; Kavanaugh, Reese, Carroll, &
Rosson, 2005). The survey instrument was adapted from previous BEV research group
instruments as well as the HomeNet study (Kraut, Lundmark, Patterson, Kiesler, Mukopadhyay,
& Scherlis, 1998). Half of the sample were from Blacksburg; half from elsewhere in
Montgomery County, Virginia. Education and Internet use were also variables considered in the
stratification. Surveys were hand-delivered in Fall 2001 and $25 was paid for each completed
survey. Twenty households were selected for in-depth interviews. The survey was administered
to the same households a year later. In Round 1, there were 156 individual respondents, and in
Round 2, there were 143 respondents (after replacing for dropouts). Key constructs in the survey
included “collective efficacy” and the relationships between Internet use and community
involvement in terms of membership, belonging, activism, and social Internet use.
Forty percent of 1000 Grand Rapids residents who were randomly selected from the voter
registration rolls and the local phone book responded to a 15-page questionnaire sent out by
Riedel et al. (1998), along with a cover letter from the mayor. These results established the
baseline data for further research in Minnesota. Borgida et al. (2002) and Sullivan et al. (2002)
relied on the same survey results for their studies in Minnesota. A mail survey, focusing on
various measures of social capital, was conducted in 1996 of 2000 randomly selected households
in Grand Rapids and Detroit Lakes, Minnesota, yielding a 40% response rate in each community.
A followup in late 1999 was expanded to include residents of Itasca and Becker counties,
yielding a response rate of 64% from 2791 households. Elements of Kraut et al.’s (1998)

63

HomeNet survey and the UCLA Loneliness Scale were added to the followup survey.
Kwon and her colleagues examined survey results from users of a CN that had been
launched as “a community service of a Graduate School of Library and Information Science at a
large Midwestern university” (Kwon & Zweizig, 2006, p. 87). A questionnaire was mailed in
March 2001 to a random sample of 1000 adult current and former users. Just over 400 responses
were used from surveys returned in the first round (Kwon & Onwuegbuzie, 2005; Kwon &
Toms, 2002; Kwon & Zweizig, 2006). A second round of surveys sent to these users, resulted in
just over 200 responses, which were used in Kwon’s (2005) study. Kwon and her colleagues
used these results to develop a community network use model (CNUM). A variety of
quantitative approaches were used to analyze the survey results, including multiple regression
(Kwon, 2005; Kwon & Toms, 2002; Kwon & Zweizig, 2006) and structured equation modeling
(Kwon & Onwuegbuzie, 2005). Demographic variables captured included gender, age,
education, and income.
Venkatesh et al. (1999) received 85 completed surveys from a sample of 150 non-profit
organizations to be served by the Syracuse MetroNet, one of New York’s Diffusion Programfunded community networks. One survey elicited user needs; while the other elicited information
about the supporting human and technology infrastructure. Venkatesh et al. also interviewed
leaders of eight Diffusion Program networks. Shin (2007) conducted in-depth interview with
project team members and community development representatives involved with A-Net, a
broadband community network in New York.
To determine the usefulness of community information provided at public librarycommunity network sites, Pettigrew et al. (2002) conducted an on-line survey with 197 adult
community network users and 87 staff members of three CNs: Three Rivers Free-Net in

64

Pittsburgh, PA, NorthStarNet in Chicago, and CascadeLink in Portland. Durrance and Pettigrew
(2001) interviewed citizens, local organizational representatives, and public library staff in the
communities of these same three public library-community networks.
Longan (2005) conducted face-to-face interviews in 1998 with seventy (70) community
networking activists from five community networks about what they thought was driving the
community networking movement. The five CNs were Austin Free-Net, Blacksburg Electronic
Village, Charlotte’s Web, Metropolitan Austin Interactive Network, and Seattle Community
Network.
2.6.2

Field Research
Field research, including focus groups, participant observation, and action research,

allows for a richer understanding of behaviors and attitudes best observed in their natural setting
(Babbie, 2004). Community networking activities provide a good opportunity for field research.
Vaughan and Schwartz (1999) conducted two focus groups: one “innovator” group
consisting of five volunteers (of 14 named) with HoosierNet and one “early adopter” group
consisting of seven officers of local associations (of 15 invited). They had focus group
participants develop prototypes and participate in usability studies as well. Using a participatory
design approach, Gregson (1997) trained 24 volunteers (17 from a high school American History
course) how to use the Web for political purposes.
Two studies involved participants of Prairienet’s Community Networking Initiative
(CNI), which provided computers, training, and Internet access to over 700 predominantly
African-American, low-income families. Over the course of a year, Merkel used an ethnographic
approach to interview and observe 11 participants (Mehra et al., 2004). They used the constant
comparative method (Glaser & Strauss, 1967) to analyze the data. Over the course of six months

65

in 1998, Bishop et al., (1999) conducted 26 interviews (with a total of 34 CNI participants). They
also conducted focus groups with 116 adults and 48 teenagers who participated in a two-day CNI
training and received a computer upon completion, and conducted a followup phone interview
with 35 of those participants (40 could not be reached because of disconnected phones or having
moved).
Action research is a favored approach for examining community networks. In action
research the researcher studies a system while collaborating with system members to change it in
a positive direction. O’Brien (1998) provides a useful summary of the history and principles of
action research. Many community networking researchers have been actively involved in
developing the community networks they study.
Carroll (2001) explains that the Blacksburg Electronic Village provides an example of
how diverse community settings are helpful for incubating human-computer interaction
technologies via rapid prototyping and formative evaluation. BEV researchers describe various
efforts to develop BEV systems, including capturing BEV’s history (Carroll et al., 1995);
MOOsburg, a multi-user domains object-oriented system representing Blacksburg; and the
community network website in general (Carroll & Rosson, 1996, 2003).
Action research has also been employed with the Seattle Community Network (Schuler,
2005); in rural Centre (Merkel et al., 2004; Merkel et al., 2005) and Potter counties (Grigsby et
al., 2002; Shuffstall et al., 2007) of Pennsylvania; in east central Illinois’ Prairienet, with the
PrairieKNOW communityware (Contractor & Bishop, 1999) and Inquiry Page projects (Bishop
et al., 2004); in Trumball County, Ohio (Watson, 2001); and in San Diego County’s Tribal Peace
initiative among Native American communities (Srinivasan, 2007).

66

Participant observation was the primary method employed with Boulder Community
Network (Virnoche & Marx, 1997; Virnoche, 1998). Virnoche embedded herself as an unknown
participant observer who became very active within the organization.
2.6.3

Unobtrusive Research
Unobtrustive research methods, such as document review, website content analysis, and

historical/comparative review, involve “studying social behavior without affecting it” (Babbie,
2004, p. 313). Much of the evidence supporting CN studies comes from examining data available
from CN websites or from other historical evidence. Schuler’s (1994) sampling of earlier
generation community networks, such as Berkeley Community Memory, Cleveland Free-Net,
Big Sky Telegraph, and Santa Monica Public Electronic Network (PEN), provides an example of
this approach. Beamish’s (1995) master’s thesis from M.I.T. is another and involves describing
some of these earlier CNs as well, including the Cleveland Free-Net, Heartland Regional
Network, Buffalo Free-Net, Hawaii FYI, and Santa Monica PEN.
Beamish (1999) and Shiffer (1999) highlight projects that emphasize technology use
among low-income groups. Based on historical evidence available from websites, Baker (2000)
analyzes and compares three Washington DC area community networks based on their key
actors, innovation factor, opportunities and barriers, and policy outcomes/assessment. Venkatesh
and Shin (2002) examine a number of public documents to describe the development of UrbanNet in New York from a dialectal perspective.
Using more formalized data collection instruments, Horning (2007), Tonn et al. (2001)
and Chewar et al. (2005) conduct website content analyses of 75, 40, and 6 websites respectfully.
These analyses are specifically aimed at identifying elements conducive to social capital
building.

67

Silver (2004) uses a “constructivist studies of technology” (p. 301) approach to compare
the development of Blacksburg Electronic Village and the Seattle Community Network. He
draws from three various historical sources: online archives of the CN development teams;
popular accounts in the news media and magazines; and three written works: Schuler (1996),
Cohill and Kavanaugh (1996), and Schorger’s (1995) Ph.D. dissertation, A Qualitative Study of
the Development and First Year of Implementation of the Blacksburg Electronic Village. A
fourth source of material is from oral histories with key players.
In Missouri, Pigg (2001) examines the websites of the 22 Missouri Express community
networks along several dimensions, including communication structures, local content, database
usage, and public sphere functions.
2.6.4

Multiple Methods
Many community networking studies involve the use of multiple research methods,

particularly those involving regional community networking initiatives.
Beginning in June 2002, Strover et al. (2004) compiled a database of Texas’ 36
Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund (TIF)-funded community network leaders and
participants, analyzed 200 responses to a mail survey, and conducted multiple field visits to the
36 communities to conduct 210 interviews, observe operations, and gather documents.
In Indiana, data collection involved site visits to eight CNs, surveys of CN board
members, and a website content analysis of 24 of 28 Access Indiana-funded community
networks (Rosenbaum, 1998; Rosenbaum & Gregson, 1998).
In New York, five of the state’s 22 funded community networking projects (one
urban/suburban and four rural) were part of a two-phase study of Next Generation Community
Network design that began in June 1996 and concluded in 2000 (Venkatesh & Shin, 2002;

68

Venkatesh, Nosovitch, & Miner, 2004). Phase 1 involved interviews with planners form the
communities. Phase 2 involved collecting data from engineering, marketing, sales staff as well as
program selection committee members (Venkatesh & Shin, 2002; Venkatesh et al., 2004).
2.7

Theoretical and Methodological Critique
This section summarizes the critique of community networking scholarly research with

regard to theory and method.
2.7.1
2.7.1.1

Theory
Hidden Assumptions and Varying Goals
One of the biggest problems with community networking research is that rarely are the

theories and assumptions of the researcher made explicit (O’Neil, 2002). Yet the goals of
community networking vary, often as a reflection of these implicit theories, values, political
interests, and ideologies (Gygi, 1996; O’Neil, 2002; Schuler, 2004). In many cases, community
networking goals are not explicitly articulated at all (Beamish, 1995, 1999), and when they are
articulated, they are not readily converted into quantifiable, measurable objectives (Gregson &
Ford, 1998). Compounding this is the fact that the literature about communities and ICTs
generally is fragmented across disciplines (Kling, 2000; Pigg & Crank, 2004). Lack of clarity of
theoretical underpinnings and community networking vision makes it difficult to evaluate the
extent to which community networks have achieved their aims.
2.7.1.2

Poor Definitions
Community networking research tends to treat “community” too simplistically, glossing

over differences within communities (Howley, 1998). “Community has been a kind of question
in the United States, as well as an answer…[with] discussions of community…marked with
unacknowledged tensions” (Kling, 1996, p. 436). Postill (2008) contends that community

69

informatics research, as well as Wellman’s “networked individualism,” has overly depended on
the troubling concepts of “community” and “network.” “Community” is a term that plays well in
the public rhetoric, but “its empirical referent is seldom specified or, indeed, specifiable” (Postill,
2008, p. 415). Use of the term community often results in conflating “cultural categories with
actual social groups” (p. 415).
Social network analysts invoke the term “whole network” that requires identifying the
boundaries of a network in order to research (Wasserman & Faust, 1994). However, the network
idea was fundamentally meant to connote unboundedness, cutting across enduring groups and
organizations (Postill, 2008). The danger is that drawing boundaries first instills assumptions that
limit one’s thinking.
The term “community network” is often not well-defined either (Schuler, 2004).
Community networks are sometimes included with the term “online community,” leading to
contradition and confusion (Dimaggio et al., 2001). The key distinction is that community
networks aim to strengthen ties within an existing local community by creating a web presence
rather than to create an entirely new virtual community in cyberspace (Sawhney & Jayakar,
2007).
2.7.1.3

Technological Utopianism
The community networking literature is predicated on the normative assumption that

community networks and the Internet will make a positive difference in people’s lives
(Dimaggio et al., 2001; O’Neil, 2002). However, it is unclear especially what low-income
communities would use Internet access for (Beamish, 1999). Community network writings have
a “celebratory tinge” and the community networking concept is rarely challenged (Sawhney &
Jayakar, 2007, p. 187). Instead, the literature focuses on how to overcome implementation

70

challenges (Sawhney & Jayakar, 2007), while potential consequences of CN use are not
addressed – even in evaluations (Carroll & Rosson, 2001).
Often ignored are the broader social, cultural, and political issues embedded within the
“web of computing” (Kling & Scacchi, 1982). For example, the cultural issues of “place,” such
as those facing Appalachia described by Bohland, Puckett, and Playmale (2005), are usually
glossed over in U.S. community networking literature. Such issues include local power structures
controlling the allocation of computers and Internet access, traditional gender roles being
challenged since the Internet plays more to the literacy strengths of women, religion possibly
portraying technology as demonic, and even the influence of local language. Schuler (1996)
suggests the development of local social and political models for community networking in
addition to existing technological models.
Community networking assumes that the “new” features of the Internet can only help to
create a vibrant public sphere for promoting democracy. However, “the public sphere is, and
always will be, a much larger phenomenon than an Internet discussion forum” (Agre, 2002, p.
311). Community networking research ignores longstanding knowledge about electronic citizen
democratic participation, including that the government provides the information it chooses at
the price it chooses, with limited or no influence by citizens, and with ICTs merely providing
more sophisticated market research capabilities and opinion shaping techniques (Bellamy &
Taylor, 1998).
2.7.1.4

Lack of Critical and Contextual Perspectives
It is widely assumed in community networking that “universal access” to the Internet,

providing equal opportunity across all social strata and geographical regions, is a positive
(Sawhney & Jayakar, 2007). This is predicated on the assumptions of a “technological

71

imperative” (Chapman, 2004) that “technology and its architecture are givens” (Agre, 1997, p.
242), that access is scarce, and that equitable distribution is the answer (Agre, 1997). Rarely does
anyone question whether disadvantaged social groups will have “equal opportunity to escape
these technologies” (Virnoche, 1998, p. 217).
In their evaluation of the literature, Loader and Keeble (2004) conclude that community
informatics needs to incorporate “a more critical evidence based perspective” (p. 36) that
recognizes that the ambiguous relationship between ICTs and communities “is shaped primarily
through a complex interaction of social, political, commercial and political factors…[producing]
both intended and unintended outcomes” (p. 36). This complex interaction necessarily involves
different stakeholders. In a content analysis of 269 articles, Houston and Erdelez (2002) examine
the interests of the various stakeholders involved in digital divide research, concluding that:
•

Those who are already connected (the “haves”) tend to marginalize the existence of a
digital divide and advocate for market-based solutions

•

Those in the digital industry, assisted by government, promote digital goods and
services in order to maximize profit

•

“Educators and others who wish to change Internet content, interfaces, and uses to
reflect the needs and wants of the ‘unconnected’ appear at this time to have no
ulterior motives beyond a genuine desire to improve the human condition” (p. 105)

However, Stoecker (2005) challenges this latter point. He suggests that academics,
including himself, may have the most to gain by community informatics initiatives, such as
community networks, as entire careers can be made by designing and studying them. He asks
whether community informatics initiatives actually detract from their stated goal of building
communities and suggests that rather than creating new ICT-based initiatives, it might be more
appropriate to integrate with ongoing community efforts not centered around technology. “It may
be that our fascination with the technology is distracting us from our concern for the community”

72

(p. 16); “technology is too often the place where we start, when it should be where we end up”
(p. 18).
The concept of social capital, which underpins much of the CN research, also has a
celebratory tinge. For example, Woolcock and Narayan (2000), in their report to the World
Bank, convey their enthusiasm about using the concept of social capital to provide richer
explanations of economic development from an interdisciplinary perspective. However, some
writers are skeptical of how the social capital concept has been applied to communities and ICTs.
Everingham (2003) contends that invoking Putnam’s notion of social capital relies on western
values and allows international financial institutions like the World Bank to shift “responsibility
for poverty onto the poor themselves” (p. 109). Similarly, Stoecker (2005) speculates that
community informatics projects may be serving capitalist elites by encouraging communities to
produce globally competitive homogenized goods, quieting discontent, integrating the poor into
the system, and establishing the means to blame the poor for their own poverty if they fail to take
advantage of new technologies. When community informatics researchers use the concept of
social capital to refer to leveraging community social exchange relationships for purposes of
economic development, this represents another example of how the capitalist economy directs
community development instead of empowering the community to develop its own path to
sustainability (Stoecker, 2005).
Dimaggio et al. (2001) contend that Internet research in general has focused too much on
individuals, while ignoring how the Internet itself evolves as a result of struggle among powerful
political and economic actors. Robbin and Courtright (2002) contend that “the digital divide is a
potent resource whose symbolic properties and communicative power have activated a wide
array of participants in the policy debates about how to create a more just society.” Stevenson

73

(2009) provides a detailed account of a struggle among powerful actors using language of the
digital divide. Using critical discourse analysis to examine the NTIA’s Falling through the Net
reports, he carefully demonstrates how the digital divide rhetoric furthered the neoliberal agenda
by framing the problem as one of technology access that can be blamed on individuals instead of
on “new social relations of production” related to class (p. 11). Stevenson illustrates how this
struggle further played out between the proprietary Gates Foundation Library program with its
provision of nearly 50,000 PCs in 11,000 public libraries and the free and open source software
(FLOSS) movement.
2.7.2

Method
This section summarizes the critique of community networking scholarly research with

regard to methods.
2.7.2.1

Narrow Range of Methodologies
Riedel et al. (1998) contend that, with the exception of the research on the Blacksburg

Electronic Village, community networking research suffers from applying too narrow a range of
methodologies that fail to include baseline data and that “lack adequate controls, longitudinal
data, or utilization of multiple methodologies” (p. 378). Wellman & Gulia (1999 ) note that
anecdotal accounts of online communities far outweigh survey research about interpersonal
connections, detailed ethnographic accounts, and time-budget studies of what people spend their
time doing online. Longitudinal studies of changes in inequality need to be conducted, and
research needs to move beyond single case studies toward more systematic studies of how the
Internet is used collectively (Dimaggio et al., 2001).
2.7.2.2

Operationalization of Concepts
Some concepts in community networking research have not been adequately

74

operationalized. For example, Kwon & Onwuegbuzie (2005) operationalized CN “Use” as the
total hours or frequency of use online. However, they suggest that more direct measures might be
more useful, “such as the number of e-mails received or sent, the number of visits to affiliated
local information provider sites, and the amount of information sought or found” (p. 1541).
2.7.2.3

The Scholar-Designer
Wellman and Gulia (1999) raise concern about the involvement of academics in systems

design generally, as undoubtedly scholar-designers who have been heavily invested in action
research want the community networks they’ve worked on to be successful.
2.7.2.4

Shortcomings in Evaluation
Community networking research has failed to identify meaningful outcomes for

evaluation (Beamish, 1999; Gregson & Ford, 1998; O’Neil, 2002). Strover et al. (2004) suggest
that such measurable outcomes of community networks could include computer literacy and job
placement. For example, there are no studies that evaluate how many jobs were actually obtained
through the provision of hundreds of public access sites throughout the country (Beamish, 1999).
In a two-year study of community information provision and use, Durrance and Pettigrew
(2001, 2002) provide examples, best practices, and benefits of how CNs in partnership with
libraries help with information dissemination, but they conclude that evaluating impact on users
and communities is impossible because of a lack of “tools.” Durrance and Fisher (2005) follow
up by providing a “guide to identifying user-centered outcomes” that includes a community
network user survey based on Dervin’s sense-making methodology; however, they fail to share
the results of their survey of 197 CN users to demonstrate the usefulness of their instrument.
2.7.2.5

Limitations in Generalizability
Kwon and Onwuegbuzie (2005) report that despite attempts to recruit all user groups for

75

their studies, most study respondents were registered community network users. By default, such
users are already more likely to use the community network to access the Internet than
unregistered users. Blacksburg Electronic Village researchers routinely note that individuals in
their studies tend to be more affluent and educated due to the fact that roughly 85% of
Blacksburg resident are affiliated with Virginia Tech (Kavanaugh & Patterson, 2002). Brown
(2008) notes that household Internet diffusion studies may suffer from under-representing “a
large segment of society, namely low income households” (p. 398).
Since community networks emphasize different aspects in different communities,
generalizing findings from one study to another is difficult (Kwon & Onwuegbuzie, 2005).
Replication of studies in different sites is suggested as a potential remedy for this (Kwon &
Onwuegbuzie, 2005). Patterson (2000) calls for comparing data across communities and
evaluating community network initiatives at the level of the community. “Not until evaluators
are able to compare different cases are they truly able to create a general theory of community
computer networking that can be generalized to all such initiatives” (p. 73).
2.8

Areas for Further Research
This literature review suggests that one of the most promising contributions of

community networking, as distinct from the Internet generally, involves providing opportunities
for collaboration between previously unconnected individuals and organizations with differing
levels of resources and status. Examples include connections made between the techno-elite and
the non-technologically-savvy with regard to grassroots design; between resource rich and
resource poor organizations with regard to community empowerment; and between libraries and
other organizations with regard to local content creation and maintenance.

76

One potential way to examine community networks is using a deductive, top-down
approach. Social network theory provides one especially promising theoretical basis for such an
examination. As Williams and Durrance (2008) contend, the roles of strong and weak ties
(Granovetter, 1975) with regard to establishing and sustaining community technology are not
well understood and present a particular policy challenge and opportunity. Structural hole theory
(Burt, 1992) and betweenness centrality (Wasserman & Faust, 1998) are other potentially useful
social network concepts for examining phenomena such as the cross-boundary collaboration that
community networks appear to have fostered.
Another way to examine community networks is using an inductive, bottom-up approach.
Since community networks started being “built” in 1993, a considerable treasure trove of data
and case studies has built up as well. A grounded theory approach (Glaser & Strauss, 1967)
would start with the data and work its way up to building theory. This literature review suggests
that conditions that existed prior to receiving grant funding may impact success and also that
transformation may occur when unequal partners connect. A grounded theory examination of the
community networking projects that were funded through the Clinton era’s Technology
Opportunities Program (TOP) may help discover concepts important in further developing theory
around these observations.
Library and information science (LIS) has been and continues to be positioned at the
intersection of information, technology, and communities. As Patterson (2000) suggests, future
research should compare individual case studies that represent the considerable investments
made in community networking on the part of LIS researchers and practitioners over the last 15+
years. Insights from such a study may transcend immediately-observable impacts, revealing
unintended consequences (both positive and negative) that extend beyond the lifetimes and

77

boundaries of the community networks themselves. The goal of such a study will be to develop a
generalizable theory of community computer networking initiatives aimed at answering the
question: How can community networking initiatives be structured to maximize positive
outcomes for individuals from disadvantaged communities?
In the next chapter, I describe the methodology employed for comparing community
network evaluations from the NTIA’s Technology Opportunities Program to create such a theory
of community networking.

CHAPTER 3
METHODOLOGY
For this study, I employed a grounded theory approach to develop a theory of community
networking. This section provides an overview of grounded theory and then describes the
specific processes followed in the study.
3.1

Grounded Theory

3.1.1

An Inductive Research Approach
Grounded theory (GT) was presented in the well-known 1967 book by Glaser and Strauss

entitled The Discovery of Grounded Theory: Strategies for Qualitative Research. Spawned by
their collaborative work on dying patients, Glaser and Strauss’ (1967) grounded theory was a
response to an “embarrassing gap between theory and empirical research” (p. vii). GT is defined
as “the discovery of theory from data—systematically obtained and analyzed in social
research…[that] provides…relevant predictions, explanations, interpretations and applications”
that are understandable to both researchers and practitioners (Glaser & Strauss, 1967, p. 1). Thus
GT’s main purpose is to construct theory from any kind of data using an inductive, bottom-up,
data-driven research approach rather than validating an existing theory using a “logicodeductive,” top-down, theory-driven research approach.
Employing GT can yield development of either substantive theory, developed for a
specific, empirical subject, or formal theory, developed for a formal, conceptual area (Glaser &
Strauss, 1967). GT provides guidelines for how to analyze piles of collected qualitative research
data, rather than just how to collect it. It offers pragmatic middle-range theory building that falls
between minor hypotheses of everyday life and all-inclusive grand theories that strive for
“universal explanations of social behavior” (Suddaby, 2006, p. 633), and it yields research that

79

“fits, works, is relevant, and is readily modifiable” (Glaser, 2010).Table 3.1 summarizes the key
differences between the more traditional logico-deductive research method and grounded theory,
according to Glaser and Strauss (1967).

Core Techniques
Consistent across the various books about grounded theory are the following core

techniques: 1) constant comparison, where data are simultaneously coded and analyzed for the
purpose of generating theory, 2) conceptual coding, where concepts, along with their properties
and dimensions, are identified from the data, 3) theoretical sampling, where the selection of data
to analyze is based on the theory being constructed, and 4) saturation, when properties of
concepts supporting the emerging theory have been fully developed (Corbin & Strauss, 2008;
Glaser & Strauss, 1967; Suddaby, 2006).
Coding is the act of “deriving and developing concepts from data” (Corbin & Strauss,
2008, p. 65). Concepts are abstractions about what is going on. Concepts have one or more

80

properties or dimensions. Categories are ways of grouping concepts together. Available
evidence, facts, or data fit different concepts. Theoretical sampling of material to be analyzed is
based on “concepts derived from data” (Corbin & Strauss, 2008, p. 65) with the purpose of
discovering all relevant categories and their properties in order to close gaps in the emergent
theory (Glaser & Strauss, 1967). Theoretical sampling is to be done until saturation occurs –
when “no additional data are being found whereby the [researcher] can develop properties of the
category” (Glaser & Strauss, 1967, p. 61). The saturation point is determined by “a combination
of the empirical limits of the data, the integration and density of the theory, and the analyst’s
theoretical sensitivity” (Glaser & Strauss, 1967, p. 62). Unlike traditional sampling, which aims
to identify the distribution of incidents across a set of concepts, theoretical sampling aims to
identify the set of concepts themselves. Thus, after coding a number of times for the same
concept, if an incident does not point to a new concept, then it does not need to be coded.
Whereas in traditional sampling all identified incidents are to be coded. Throughout the research
process, the analyst writes theoretical memos that create a record of data explored, properties and
dimensions of concepts identified, comparisons made, questions asked, stories told, and
paradigms about “the relationship between conditions, actions/interactions, and consequences”
are elaborated (Corbin & Strauss, 2008, p. 118).
3.1.3

Misconceptions, Misuses, and Mistakes
Several misconceptions about GT, drawn from Glaser and Strauss (1967) and Suddaby

(2006), are outlined in Table 3.2. These include the belief that GT takes too long for dissertation
research. Glaser (2010) contends that GT is an excellent approach for dissertations since it “takes
one from data collection through several stages to a theory and in a scheduled amount of time
ensures a finished product that can comply with a deadline.” On July 27, 2013, I conducted a

81

search of the Proquest Theses and Dissertations Abstracts database to see how often GT has been
employed in information science dissertations. Of the 2127 dissertations coded with a subject of
“information science,” only 46 included the term “grounded theory” in the abstract, representing
about 2% of all information science dissertations. This lends support to the notion that many
doctoral students, at least in information science, avoid undertaking grounded theory studies.
Table 3.2
Misconceptions vs. Reality about Grounded Theory
Misconception
Any research grounded in data is GT.
GT is better than other methods.
Anyone can do GT.

GT takes too long for a dissertation
or thesis.
GT is exciting.
Grounded theorists can just as easily
conduct logico-deductive research.
GT is specifically for symbolic
interaction qualitative research.
Literature should not be read until
AFTER data have been collected and
analyzed.
GT involves presenting raw,
undigested data, such as interview
excerpts.
GT can be used to test hypotheses.

Rigid formulaic coding rules or
software alone can be used to
analyze the data.

Reality
Only research the follows the grounded theory methodological
package is GT.
GT is no better or worse; it is just one of the many methods
available to researchers.
Successful GT researchers must be able to conceptualize data,
tolerate confusion and resulting set-backs, and wait for
“conceptual sense making to emerge from the data” (Glaser &
Strauss, 1967, p. 838).
GT provides a total package from data collection to theory in a set
amount of time (scoped by structural conditions like theory type,
material cache, geography, or kind of group), making it very
desirable for dissertations and theses.
GT can produce highly motivating and relevant findings, which
are made possible through often tedious constant comparisons.
Because of their natural inclinations, successful grounded
theorists often do not easily conduct traditional hypothesis-testing
research.
GT is a general method for use with any data (quantitative or
qualitative) or epistemology; however, all steps should be
followed, with theory emerging rather than being forced.
Any reasonable research agenda requires a clear research question
and awareness of existing literature – especially in well-trod
areas.
GT is not about the data per se; it’s about abstracting subjective
experiences represented in the data into theoretical statements
about causal relations; interviews are rarely the only data.
Doing so represents “methodological slurring”: using GT’s
interpretive ontology (that actors construct their own reality) to
analyze realist assumptions (that variables are concrete, objective,
and measurable).
GT requires interpretation by the researchers, not just coding;
while software can help organize and code data, it is not good at
creative thinking or interpretation.

82

Table 3.2 (continued).
Misconception
It is important to conduct GT
perfectly, identifying a clear
saturation point.
Grounded theory is easy.

Reality
GT is an inherently messy practical approach for understanding
complex social processes; saturation depends on empirical
context and researcher experience.
GT requires an intimate, extensive, ongoing relationship between
researcher and empirical site; it is not easy at all.

There have been numerous examples of the misuse of grounded theory. Table 3.3 lists
these misuses, along with how my approach avoided these misuses.

Typical Misuses of Grounded Theory and This Study’s Approach
Typical Misuses
Saying you are using GT when you
have not even read the seminal text of
Glaser and Strauss (1967).
Saying you are using GT to develop
theory, when all you are doing is
describing.
Failing to distinguish whether you’re
using GT for coding or for theory
generation.
Using GT to justify failure to know
the literature.
Using GT to disguise poor
methodological skills.

My Approach
In addition to Glaser and Strauss (1967), I have also read Strauss
(1987), Charmaz (2006), and Corbin and Strauss (2008).
The explicit aim of this study was to develop a theory of
community networking that is grounded in the data, based on the
understanding that “accurate description and verification are not
so crucial when one’s purpose is to generate theory” (Glaser &
Strauss, 1967, p. 28).
While coding was employed, the aim of this study is to generate
theory.
The questions guiding my research were drawn from a thorough
literature review of community networking.
This method supplemented my exposure to research methods
used previously, such as interviews, surveys, and website
content analysis.

Common mistakes made in using grounded theory include: 1) using theoretical sampling
for the wrong reasons, such as articulating initial research questions, establishing population
distributions, identifying negative cases, creating a complete dataset, and achieving
generalizability and 2) conducting theoretical sampling too early may result in premature closure
of analytical categories, redundant categories, over-reliance on overt statements to check
categories, and unfocused or unspecific categories. For this study, the data available for
theoretical sampling was limited to a finite “cache of archival material” (Corbin & Strauss, 2008,
83

p. 155) – specifically, all the project evaluations that I was able to procure from the NTIA’s
Technology Opportunities Program. It was from this cache that theoretical sampling occurred.
Admittedly, this did not represent the ideal situation for GT since theory generation was limited
by the existence of a limited number of “comparative materials” (Glaser & Strauss, 1967, p. 168)
available from this now-terminated federal initiative. But, as stated in Corbin and Strauss (2008),
“a researcher can do a high-level analysis on whatever data he or she has” (p. 150). In my view,
GT presents an exciting potential approach to analyzing the ever-growing existing caches of
material in our digital age in the pursuit of “neglected discoveries” (Swanson, 2011).
Drawing from this cache of material, I applied theoretical sampling according to the GT
principle of letting “questions about a concept serve as a guide for what incidents to look for in
the next set of data” (p. 150). I did not hesitate to return to previously analyzed data when I
thought I may have overlooked something or needed to look at data from a different conceptbased perspective. However, because of the limited available data, it was expected that there
would be gaps in the analysis. Even though I fell short of developing a complete theory, I concur
with Corbin who says generating concepts alone “is a useful research endeavor…[as] concepts
provide a language that can be used for discussion and debate leading to the development of
shared understanding and meanings…to build a professional body of knowledge and enhance
practice” (Corbin & Strauss, 2008, p. ix).
3.1.4

Best Practices
Glaser (2010) identifies three characteristics GT researchers need: “an ability to

conceptualize data, an ability to tolerate some confusion, and an ability to tolerate confusion’s
attendant regression” (Types of Grounded Theory section, para. 2). GT researchers eschew the
irrelevance produced from following “approved formal methods” that rigidly dictate

84

“preconceived problems, concepts, and format methods of data collection and the processing of
it” (Glaser, 2010, Types of Grounded Theory section, para. 5). Instead of striving for
“objectivity,” the GT researcher strives for “sensitivity” – the “ability to pick up on subtle
nuances and cues in the data that infer or point to meaning” (Corbin & Strauss, 2008, p. 19),
which is often honed from accumulated experience.
In common among the various grounded theory books I’ve read are a set of best practices
for GT, which I followed:

3.2

•

Remain in close, ongoing interaction with your data

•

Be creative, flexible, and open to twists and turns in your analysis

•

Follow core GT techniques of theoretical sampling and constant comparison

•

Describe your methodology and provide illustrations of your coding and category
creation techniques

•

Demonstrate theoretical sensitivity: openness to new data interpretations (emergence
vs. forcing)

•

Select appropriate methods for your research questions based on your epistemological
assumptions

Process
Corbin and Strauss (2008) best describe how I employed grounded theory. Instead of

presenting a step-by-step recipe, their book “presents a set of analytic techniques that can be used
to make sense out of masses of qualitative data” (p. ix), with researchers selecting which
techniques to use and in which ways. In the preface, Corbin acknowledges that “grounded theory
has evolved into many different approaches to building theory grounded in data” (p. viii). She
confesses to having become disillusioned with the idea that “theory construction is the only way
to develop knowledge” (p. ix). She contends that doing qualitative research is something you just

85

have to feel your way through and that “multiple interpretations can be constructed from one set
of data” (p. ix).
Figure 3.1 provides a graphical overview of the GT process employed in the course of
this study. Rather than following a series of steps in rigid sequential order, grounded theory
involves repeated and simultaneous iterations of the following activities, which are described
next in more detail. As the figure illustrates, theory constructing (integration) is the main aim of
the other activities:
•

Data gathering (collection)

•

Conceptual coding (comparison)

•

3.2.1

Data Gathering (Collection)
Data used for GT analysis can be from a variety of sources in order to stimulate

generation of categories. Analysts are encouraged to include any materials relevant to the subject
since “all slices of data are relevant” (Glaser & Strauss, 1967, p. 75). Data may be collected
yourself or by others (secondary data); may be of any type, including library documents,
interviews, field notes, reports, etc.; and may be limited based on structural conditions, such as
kinds of groups (but not number or to what extent), caches of material, or geographical region to
study.
The data collected for this study are secondary data: a “cache of material” that includes
all the evaluations I could locate from the Technology Opportunities Program (TOP) Data
Archive project (Williams, 2007). The archive has both virtual (available through the Internet
Archive) and physical (at the University of Michigan’s Special Collections Library) components.
On June 27, 2013, I downloaded from archive.org 34 evaluations completed in 1998 and 1999 on
TOP projects. On July 17 and 18, 2013, I visited the University of Michigan Special Collections
Library and retrieved 23 project evaluations that were available in hard copy. Documents were
removed, one at a time, from one of 17 boxes of material archived from the TOP initiative. Each
page was individually photographed. And then the individual images were reassembled into
complete evaluation documents and saved as Adobe Acrobat (.pdf) files. One of the boxes
containing evaluations, Box 7, was not able to be retrieved from storage in time for my visit. I
submitted a request to University of Michigan Special Collections Library staff to retrieve the
remaining 6 project evaluations in Box 7 for me. On 10/31/13, the remaining evaluations were
received. Appendix A provides a complete list of the 63 evaluations that make up the cache of
material from which I sampled.

3.2.2

Conceptual Coding (Comparison)
The most well known method for coding concepts when following GT is the constant

comparative method presented by Glaser and Strauss (1967). This involves comparing incidents
for each concept with the aim of generating conceptual properties: dimensions, conditions,
consequences, and their relationship to other concepts and properties. Charmaz (2006) describes
initial and focused coding, which involves quickly coding word-by-word, line-by-line, incidentby-incident, comparing data with data. She suggests using gerunds to convey action, staying
close the data, keeping open to new concepts, and recoding using the most significant or frequent
codes. Glaser (2005) proposes “theoretical coding” involving the use of any of 18+ “coding
families” to relate substantive codes to each other as hypotheses (e.g., 6 Cs: causes, contexts,
contingencies, consequences, covariances, and conditions). Strauss’s (1987) axial coding
involves creating dense texture of relationships around a category axis to sort, synthesize, and
organize.
According to Corbin and Strauss (2008), identifying the data’s meaning is more
important than the process: “The best approach to coding is to relax and let your mind and
intuition work for you” (p. 160). Rather than being two separate steps, as described in the second
edition of Strauss and Corbin (1998), Corbin (Corbin & Strauss, 2008) contends that open and
axial coding, described below, “go hand in hand” (p. 198):
•

Open coding involves analyzing data for concepts: Use techniques, such as those
outlined in Table 3.4, to start with freely brainstorming about concepts in the data,
along with their properties and dimensions, remaining “open to all possible meanings
in the data” (p. 52), without trying to group the codes.

•

Axial coding involves analyzing data for context, process, and theoretical integration:
Continue to ask questions and compare in order to group lower-level concepts under a
more conceptual label – a category or theme; and then link categories together to
construct the theory. Corbin and Strauss (2008) introduce an analytical tool called
“the paradigm,” in which the analyst looks for key words that specify:

88

•

Conditions: why, where, what happens, when, and how

•

Inter/actions and emotion: individual or group responses to events

•

Consequences: outcomes of inter/actions

• Technological, informational, social
• Sensitizing, theoretical, practical, and guiding
• Constant: literal description; incident with incident
• Theoretical: abstract; identifying properties & dimensions from own
experiences or using metaphors to understand underlying meaning
1) scan the document to identify seemingly significant words or phrases
2) list all possible meanings of the word or phrase
How narratives are organized suggest what is deemed most important
Words like if, in case, before, after, when, or since can identify shifts in events or
perceptions
Look at opposites or extremes of a concept to identify its properties
Rely on personal experience to identify other possible meanings
Terms like “never” or “always” may indicate personal assumptions or bias
Understanding the meaning of words used, as reflected in “in vivo” codes
Indicators of emotion often follow action or inaction
Metaphors and similes can help paint a better picture for understanding
A case that doesn’t fit the picture can draw attention to alternatives
Asking questions such as “So what?” and “What if…?” can get at meaning

Source: Corbin & Strauss, 2008, p. 69

I started out by extensively coding four project evaluations as data memos using
Microsoft Word tables (see Appendix B). The coding technique I used was to lift a quote from
the evaluations, identify the “trigger words” that made me think the quote was significant, and
describe conditions, interactions, and consequences in relation to what was described in the
quote. Then I identified concept, properties, and dimensions embedded within the quote. I then
assembled all the identified concepts, properties, and dimensions, along with identification of
their source evaluation, into a single spreadsheet and sorted them by concept/property. From this
89

list of concepts and properties, along with my sensitivity to the four evaluations assessed, I came
up with a list of themes. The aim of this exercise was to become familiar with the range of data
contained in the evaluations, to narrow down the area for further exploration aimed at theory
development, and to identify other evaluations to look at further for purposes of theoretical
sampling. Again, since the aim of this dissertation was to develop theory, it was not necessary to
look at ALL of the evaluations – only those that might illustrate new concepts or properties
relevant to the emerging theory (Glaser & Strauss, 1967, p. 28).
When it came time to code more evaluations as a result of theoretical sampling, I began
using Microsoft Excel instead of Word. I created a worksheet with a row for each of the
available evaluations and columns listing the emerging concepts. In the cells, I typed or pasted in
relevant quotes or notes. Using Excel made it possible for me to easily view all the evaluation
data for a particular concept together in a single glance. As I continually went back to review my
data, I organized the concepts and properties into categories to make them fit better within the
context of my emerging theory and categories.
3.2.3

Memo Writing (Elaboration)
An important task in developing grounded theory is the writing of memos. Memos were

first introduced in Glaser and Strauss (1967) as an attachment to field notes as a way to provide
“an immediate illustration for an idea” (p. 108). Memos should be written regularly from the
start of a project and should be written “in close conjunction with the data collecting and coding”
(Strauss, 1987, p. 109). Memos are partial, preliminary, and provisional (Charmaz, 2006, p. 84).
With memos “you stop and analyze your ideas about the codes in any – and every – way that
occurs to you” (Charmaz, 2006, p. 72). Some guidelines from Strauss (1987) and Charmaz
(2006) for writing memos include:

90

•

Keep data and memos separate

•

Do not hesitate to interrupt coding to write a memo, so you don’t lose the idea

•

Write spontaneously, in your own style

•

Give specific titles to memos

•

Bring raw data or quotes into memos

•

Use to define codes/categories and properties, describe processes, identify gaps, ask
questions, identify conjectures to check out

•

Feel free to modify memos

•

Make categories as conceptual as possible, as these will form basis of emerging
theory

•

Indicate category “saturation” in memos, when appropriate

•

Use for self-reflection

•

Be flexible in your memo writing style

In the process of elaboration “concepts must be linked and filled in with detail to
construct theory out of data” (Corbin & Strauss, 2008, p. 103). Throughout the study, I wrote
process memos to elaborate upon concepts, properties, and dimensions and to describe the
process undertaken. I used memos to describe themes; present challenges and questions; expose
my biases and assumptions; articulate my emerging theory; and suggest areas for future inquiry
or even later research. In essence, memos served as field notes to record my grounded theory
journey. I found it useful to track significant examples from the data that helped elaborate the
emerging concepts and properties that I was coding in my Excel spreadsheet. In this way, memos
served as a set of synthesized data and notes to myself upon which I built the emergent theory.
Appendix C contains the process memos I wrote. I started out planning to write a new memo
each day, but since my work on any particular topic was spread out over a period of days or
weeks, I found it more useful to keep “running” memos to continually build upon. Thus, instead
91

of attaching specific dates to memos, I labeled them with the category being developed, along
with the timeframe for the analysis. Thus, the memo titles changed as my categories became
more focused toward the emerging theory, and I eventually dropped the timeframes since there
was so much overlap during the analysis period. In the end, the 9 memos in Appendix C
represented a fairly faithful record of my analytical journey – although you will see, at a certain
point, I simply quit writing memos and turned to crafting the dissertation itself.
3.2.4

Theoretical Sampling (Saturation)
Theoretical sampling is driven by the concepts and gaps identified in memos. The aim is

to seek and collect more pertinent data (statements, events, or cases) to elaborate and refine
concepts and their relationships for the emerging theory. Ideally, this is done until saturation is
achieved – when no new properties emerge. This will provide a sense of the range of variation. It
is important to not make up hypothetical “what if” data; grounded theory is about staying close
to real data. Saturation should not be confused with seeing the same patterns repeat. Instead,
saturation occurs when comparing new data neither sparks new theoretical insights nor reveals
new concept properties.
Since I worked from a limited cache of material that represents only some of the projects
included in the TOP initiative under study, saturation occurred when comparisons among the
available documents failed to reveal new concepts or properties relevant to my developing
theory. I continually looked through the evaluations to see if any contained new concepts or
properties, but I did not rigorously code each evaluation, since that is not required of using
grounded theory for the purpose of theory development. Thus, theoretical sampling, for the
concepts and properties of interest to my emerging theory, was reached in this study.

92

3.2.5

Theory Constructing (Integration)
In grounded theory, the discovered theory is not treated “as a byproduct of the ‘main

work’ – making accurate descriptions and verification” (Glaser & Strauss, 1967, p. 185). The
theory IS the main product. Theory is defined here as an ever-developing explanation or
prediction of some phenomenon (Glaser & Strauss, 1967, pp. 31-32). Concepts and properties
that emerge from the data, along with the general direction of relationships between them, drive
the generation of theory. The resulting theory should be relevant and fit the data. However, it is
not necessary to present and state all data in exact detail.
In the process of integration, the analyst links related concepts that make up a category or
theme. Then the analyst links themes by identifying a core theme and linking other themes
around it. In crafting the theory, the analyst works to reduce terminology and to generalize,
resulting in parsimony and a clear scope. The theory itself is written using abstract themes to
cover many concepts and properties or to write formal propositions. Grounded theory has both
positivist (assumptions of an objective reality) and interpretive (assumptions of multiple socially
constructed realities) aspects (Charmaz, 2006). The theory generated can also be either
substantive or formal. A substantive theory is developed for a specific empirical area, whereas a
formal theory is developed for a more conceptual area (Glaser & Strauss, 1967). For this study, I
developed a substantive theory of the TOP initiative and disadvantaged community outcomes,
and also a formal theory of any funding initiative and disadvantaged community outcomes.
Figure 3.2 shows the relationships between theory, themes, concepts, properties, and
dimensions that evolved throughout the grounded theory process. I started in the middle by
examining the evaluations to identify concepts, the properties of those concepts, and then
different dimensions, or ranges of values, of the properties. Key concepts of interest were

93

identified and elaborated upon by identifying their properties until saturation occurred.
Throughout the process, broader categories were developed to link concepts together, and
categories were linked together to develop more coherent themes. Themes were linked together
to generate theory. The key principle was to remain immersed in the data and to be open to twists
and turns in the evolving theory. The Results section describes the final substantive theory that I
developed, along with the concepts, properties, categories, and themes that were derived from
the data along the way.

Ensuring Quality of the Research
Corbin and Strauss (2008) outline the following conditions for ensuring high quality

research: philosophical and methodological consistency, clarity of purpose, self-awareness,
qualitative research training, sensitivity for the topic and participants, a willingness to work hard,
an ability to relax and get creative, an awareness of the implications of methodological decisions,
and “a desire to do research for its own sake” (p. 304). I believe that these conditions were met.
94

It is important to understand that the aim of this particular study was to generate theory –
not to test it. “Integration is the final step for researchers whose research aim is theory building”
(Corbin and Strauss, 2008, p. 274). This involves rereading memos to fit categories together,
developing the story line, and “just plain thinking” (p. 274). Therefore, a codebook aimed at
achieving generalizability and inter-rater reliability was not created as part of this study. Instead,
the trustworthiness of the study’s results is based on the following criteria, as described by Edge
and Richards (1998, p. 345):

3.4

•

Credibility (internal validity): the provision of “a credible version of what happened,
both in terms of description and interpretation”

•

Transferability (external validity): the production of “understandings of one situation
which someone with knowledge of another situation may well be able to make use
of”

•

Dependability (reliability): ensuring “that the inevitable changes in the situation being
investigated, in the participants, and in the emergent design of the research itself are
properly documented, so that the decisions made and the conclusions reached are
justifiable in their own contexts”

•

Confirmability (objectivity): “providing evidence which confirms the presence of the
data according to the perspective, standpoint, or value-system espoused by the
researcher.”

Summary
In this chapter, I described grounded theory, detailed the grounded theory process

followed in this study, and outlined plans for ensuring quality of the research.

CHAPTER 4
RESULTS
This chapter presents the results of the grounded theory process described in Chapter 3.
Sixty-three (63) project evaluations from the Technology Opportunities Program (TOP) served
as the data for this study and are referred to as “TOP evaluations.” See Appendix A for
information about each project, including the project name, project number, year of evaluation,
full document title, and evaluation author(s). Throughout this section, direct quotes from the
TOP evaluations are used whenever possible and are indicated inside quotes. All evaluations are
referred to as TOP evaluations, even if they occurred when the program was officially called the
Telecommunications and Information Infrastructure Assistance Program (TIIAP). While the
presentation of results suggests a linear analytic process, it was actually quite iterative, allowing
immersion in the data while remaining open to twists and turns in the evolving theory, as
described in the Methodology chapter.
The overall research question was: How can community networking initiatives be
structured to maximize positive outcomes for individuals from disadvantaged communities?
The following questions, drawn from the literature review, guided the initial examination
of the data:
•

What opportunities for collaboration were enabled by the community networking
projects between previously unconnected individuals and organizations with differing
levels of resources and/or status?

•

To what extent do conditions prior to TOP grant funding appear to have affected
project outcomes?

96

4.1

Coding and Categorization from Seed Evaluations
To initialize the research process and provide direction for the further collection of data,

four Technology Opportunity Project (TOP) evaluations (described in Table 5) were examined
closely with an eye toward providing insight into the guiding questions above. These four “seed”
evaluations were selected because they represented several different aspects of the projects, such
as: early/late timeframe during the TOP initiative, urban/rural population, new/enhanced
infrastructure, and centralized/distributed population. Throughout the rest of this chapter, the
seed projects are referred to by their acronyms, as shown in Table 4.1: LAFN, RUN, TSN, or
TVN. Appendix B contains the detailed data memos I wrote up while coding each of the four
seed evaluations.

The concepts and properties identified from these four evaluations helped shape subsequent data
collection and theory formation. These concepts and properties are presented in this section,

97

organized into categories, to illustrate the analytical process undertaken during the course of this
study.
The line-by-line reading and open coding of the four seed evaluations yielded a robust set
of nearly 200 concepts and properties. Throughout the course of analysis, these concepts were
organized into the following categories: project collaborations (history and stability, shared
purpose, and investment), project design (intended beneficiaries and needed resources, barriers,
and indicators), and transformative potential (outcomes, community involvement, and skill
building opportunities). In the sections below, quotes from the seed evaluations that illustrate the
categories are presented using quotes, and the concepts and properties, as originally coded from
the seed evaluations, are presented in tables. Other than organizing the concepts and properties
into the categories below, no further effort was made at refinement; they remain in their raw
form as originally captured during analysis. The tables of concepts and properties are presented
in this section to assist the reader in understanding how the grounded theory approach was
employed in this study.
4.1.1

Project Collaborations
Each TOP project involved a collaboration of partners that were assembled as a project

team in order to carry out the funded project. Collaboration project features included the
relationship among partners before and during the grant, shared purpose established for the
project, and investment in the project by collaborators. Table 4.2 lists the concepts and properties
derived from the seed evaluations that relate to features about project collaboration.

4.1.1.1

History and Stability
In some projects, the grantee organization assembled a project team consisting of

organizations they had already collaborated with or were connected to in some way already – or
at least the lead organization had a history of collaboration. In others, either the lead organization
was new to collaborating and/or the collaboration itself was brand new, forged in order to pursue
the TOP grant opportunity. Some collaborations remained solidly in place throughout the project
evaluation period; others were less stable.
•

LAFN: Founded in 1988 as a volunteer-run organization, the Los Angeles Free-Net

(LAFN) had been in existence for several years by the time the TOP grant was awarded in
1994… “The LAFN President, a clinical professor of medicine at the University of Southern
California and former Chief of Staff at both Encino Hospital and the Tarzana Regional Medical
Center, was the founder of the LA Free-Net and remains a driving force behind its growth and its
evolution.” This quote illustrates the existence of a “community network champion,” a single
person who took an especially active role in promoting the community networking effort.
Champions were often mentioned in the TOP evaluations, but were seldom explicitly named.
However, their organizational affiliations usually were identified. In this project, “the grant
recipient organization was the Los Angeles Free-Net Division of the H.O.P.E. Unit Foundation,
an organization offering counseling and education for people with cancer housed at the EncinoTarzana Regional Medical Center” Four new partners, with no explicitly-mentioned ties to the
founder or to the Encino-Tarzana Regional Medical Center, also participated in the project.
These health- and education-related organizations (El Camino Community College, California
Lutheran University, South Coast Air Quality Measurement District Headquarters (in
conjunction with the City of Hope National Comprehensive Cancer Center), and the USC-

100

Kenneth Norris Jr. Comprehensive Cancer Center) were selected based on a process of
“graphical analysis,” to serve “as external nodes in the network by providing space for the framerelay equipment.”
•

RUN: The Jefferson County Public School system, the grant recipient for Project

RUN, recognized early on “the need for overall community involvement in school improvement
[with] more than $41 million…contributed to the district through more than 1,100 partnerships
over the past 10 years”… JCPS assigned paid staff to work on the project who “during the
planning process… learned that other local organizations were in the process of developing their
own networks.” JCPS brought in as partners the City of Louisville, the Louisville Free Public
Library, the Louisville Science Center, Bellarmine College, and the remote rural Pike County
School System. Interestingly, “Pike County was the home of the Kentucky Governor at the time
the project began.” It is not clear from the data whether or not JCPS had ties to any of these
specific organizations prior to the TOP grant. The collaboration appeared to be fairly stable
throughout the project, while weathering some challenges: “There were delays in approval of
various aspects of the project by the school system, which were related to an internal political
situation. The city network also experienced delays at various times along the way. Typically,
when one partner experienced problems, the others have taken responsibility to try to keep the
project moving ahead.”
•

TSN: The Tri-State Network experienced a dramatic change in collaborators from the

very start – changing from being led by an educational consortium to an economic development
organization that, in turn, handed over the reins to a university. This final partnership remained
intact throughout the project period. The original proposal for the Tri-State Network was
“developed and submitted by the Tri-State Education Initiative Consortium (TSEIC), a 501-C-3

101

not-for-profit organization of 30 school districts organized to work cooperatively to enhance and
broaden the capabilities of their respective education systems” in the states of Alabama,
Mississippi, and Tennessee. However:
After the grant was awarded, TSEIC decided against involvement and responsibility for
the project and returned the award to the U.S. Department of Commerce because they had
reservations about their capabilities for managing a complex project with such a large
economic development component. Officials in the State of Mississippi Department of
Economic and Community Development (MDECD) convinced Commerce to fund the
project through them instead. Mississippi State University (MSU) was contracted to take
over project operations with Johnson Controls World Services, Inc., as the onsite
subcontractor. MDECD had little involvement in the project’s operations beyond
garnering the support of the Yellow Creek site that housed the network hub.
•

TVN: As one of the few “later era” TOP projects, the 2004 evaluation of the Tribal

Virtual Network (TVN) did not follow earlier evaluation formats for the TOP initiative.
Therefore, it was not clear from the evaluation just who the partners were in the project.
However, according to the original abstract:
The University of New Mexico's Arts of the Americas Institute will work with a
consortium of Native American communities to provide broadband Internet connectivity
to five tribal museums and culture centers…The tribal consortium involved in this project
includes the Pueblos of Zuni, Jemez, and Pojoaque, the Indian Pueblo Culture Center of
Albuquerque, and the Jicarilla Apache Nation.
(http://ntiaotiant2.ntia.doc.gov/top/details.cfm?oeam=356001068)
Based on information gleaned from reading the evaluation, the relationship between the
University of New Mexico (UNM) TVN staff and the members of the consortium was not a
close one “For each community, 2-3 persons were identified by the UNM Tribal Virtual Network
staff to respond to the survey…Of the fourteen mailed surveys, ten were returned. Upon followup, it was determined that the four individuals who did not return the surveys were more
administrative and had little involvement with the technical aspects of the TVN.”
4.1.1.2

Shared Purpose
For some projects, the foundational or uniting purpose is clear. For others, the sense of

102

shared purpose seemed weak – or even non-existent.
•

LAFN: In the case of the Los Angeles Free-Net (LAFN) the original purpose was “to

help him [the founder] set up an online resource to facilitate the exchange of medical information
between physicians and the general public.” It did so by offering “special interest group bulletin
boards, access to local, state, and federal legislative information, special K-12 interactive
education programs, medical bulletin boards, electronic mail, and other services.” The TOP
project represented a logical expansion of LAFN/s services by providing “a low-cost
communications infrastructure that would allow toll-free access to the Los Angeles Free-Net
(LAFN) and the Internet from most parts of Los Angeles County,” thereby making LAFN a
general purpose access network for the Los Angeles region.
•

RUN: The uniting purpose for one aspect of Project RUN was that “The school and

the city realized that they could merge their efforts and thus avoid duplication of effort and cost”
since both the City of Louisville and the Jefferson County Public School System were
undertaking large infrastructure projects designed to benefit students and residents. As an
additional part of the collaboration, “The Louisville Chamber of Commerce brought together
representatives from the city, county, and state governments as well as local big
business…[They] called their vision, ‘A Community of Access,’ and decided to focus on three
service areas: health, distribution, and telecommunications.” Making this shared vision a reality
involved negotiations among the key players. “For each section of the cable, the partners had to
decide whose budget would be used to install and later maintain it. Working this out in advance
took time and careful negotiation, but it was worth the effort in the end.”
•

TSN: The Tri-State Network (TSN) represents a case where the project’s purpose of

economic development and the focus of the original lead organization, the Tri-State Education

103

Initiative Consortium (TSEIC), were in such conflict that TSEIC withdrew from the project.
“Conceived as an economic and community development project, the primary objective of the
$600,000 TIIAP demonstration project was to implement a community-based advanced
telecommunications infrastructure that would support economic development efforts focusing
upon Tishomingo County and impacting the surrounding region… After the grant was awarded,
TSEIC had second thoughts about their capabilities to oversee a project with such a strong
economic development focus.” The new grantee, the Mississippi Department of Economic and
Community Development (MDECD) was more aligned with this goal as it was “interested in
sponsoring the grant for the economic development gains it would bring to the region.”
•

TVN: In the case of the Tribal Virtual Network (TVN), a shared common purpose

among project collaborators did not appear to be established. The University of New Mexico
(UNM) had a vision that was apparently not shared by its partner, a consortium of 5 tribal
museums and cultural centers. The UNM’s vision stated in the project abstract was that “The
Access Grid connecting the sites will allow the museums to develop web-based exhibitions and
databases; cultural and arts education programs in traditional languages for the tribal members;
and cultural education programs for the public.” However, a sense of disappointment was
expressed in the evaluation that:
Consortium members are most frequently using the AG [the Access Grid] for the
monthly meetings, however, some have used it to present health education to other
members’ communities... UNM TVN staff expressed the opinion that it is likely that
consortium members have not assimilated the technology into their typical duties…[and]
some members may not have an adequate vision for the future use of the technology.
4.1.1.3

Investment
TOP grant funds required one-to-one matching contributions in order to show that the

collaborations were invested in the effort. This means that for every dollar requested, the

104

collaboration had to put up a dollar – whether in cash or some other means. The seed evaluations
demonstrated a range of investment strategies and corresponding levels of commitment.
•

LAFN: Not only did Tarzana Regional Medical Center serve as “the original site and

current home of the LAFN,” it also provided “a no-strings grant of $50,000…room in the
computer center…[and] 80+ phone lines.” Space for the frame-relay equipment was provided by
the four other partners in the project: El Camino Community College, California Lutheran
University, South Coast Air Quality Measurement District Headquarters (in conjunction with the
City of Hope National Comprehensive Cancer Center), and the USC-Kenneth Norris Jr.
Comprehensive Cancer Center – which also provided “15 free telephone lines.”
•

RUN: “Most of the federal share went to the cost of the fiber; all the groups involved

contributed staff time and in-kind contributions.” As the awardee, the Jefferson County Public
Schools invested most heavily in the project by contributing a considerable amount of staff time.
“The Executive Director of Educational Technology serves as the TIIAP project director…The
Voice and Data Communications Specialist serves as the project coordinator…The 12 resource
teachers of the Computer Education Support Unit provide training and ongoing daily support to
users…A consultant with expertise in networking will serve as the project evaluator.”
•

TSN. Mississippi State University managed the project and provided in-kind

resources and staff time from seven university units. The National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA), through the Tri-State Education Initiative (TSEI) and the Tri-State
Education Initiative Consortium (TSEIC) it had established in the region, provided funding,
facilities to house the network hub and server, K-12 curriculum development materials, technical
assistance, and the original technology infrastructure on which the project was expanded. Thus,

105

the TSN was able to leverage previous investments made in the region – particularly in the
Yellow Creek site – by the federal government.
•

TVN. It is not explicitly mentioned in either the abstract or the evaluation what the

specific contributions were of the partners to the project. Therefore it is difficult to ascertain the
perceived level of investment by partners in the project.
4.1.2

Community Networking Project Components
It was observed in the seed evaluations that while project collaborations served as one

level of network, their purpose was to connect intended beneficiaries with needed resources
using information and communication technologies (ICT). For analytical purposes, I will refer to
these arrangements as “community networking projects.” Note that a “community networking
project” is distinct from a community network (CN) as defined in the literature review. In the
literature review, a CN is conceptualized as a formal “locally-developed and operated non-profit
organization.” However, in the community networking projects included in this study, only a
few, such as the Blacksburg Electronic Village (54-40-95052) and the LA Free-Net (06-4094026), were formal CN organizations. Most of the TOP projects did not include, or intend to
develop into, formal non-profit organizations. However, all projects involved the incorporation
of ICT for the purpose of enhancing communities, or intended beneficiaries, in some fashion.
Therefore, for purposes of this study, a “community networking project” is defined as a project
that incorporates ICT for the purpose of enhancing communities.
This section provides examples from the seed evaluations of the various components of
community networking: intended beneficiaries and connections, barriers encountered, and
measurement indicators.

106

4.1.2.1

Intended Beneficiaries, Connections, and Resources
Viewed typically as lower-resourced actors in need of assistance, most TOP projects

characterized intended beneficiaries in terms of disadvantage or things they lacked. Intended
beneficiaries were expected to benefit from ICT-enabled interventions that connected them to
resources such as information, plans, services, or solutions. Table 4.3 lists the concepts and
properties extracted from the four seed evaluations that relate to intended beneficiaries and
connections to needed resources that were expected to be made through ICT-enabled
interventions.

LAFN: In the LAFN project, the intended beneficiaries were all LA residents, who

were deemed a disadvantaged population was based on the geographical boundaries of the local
telecommunications system. “The majority of [19 million] Los Angeles residents were
discouraged from using LAFN resources because the connection required a long distance
telephone call.” This deprived them of LAFN’s “communication, education, and information
services [offered] via interactive computer and telecommunications technology.” An example of
how such ICT-enabled interactivity was envisioned to connect intended beneficiaries to needed
resources was LAFN’s plan “to reinstate one of the original services offered through LAFN, Ask
the Doctor, which allows users to anonymously receive answers to medical questions from
experienced physicians. Ask the Doctor had been discontinued prior to the TIIAP award due to a
lack of participation on the part of physicians. The network now has a large base of doctors who

108

use the system and LAFN administrators are in the process of resurrecting this service using an
online chat forum.” The hope was that the ICT-enabled chat forum would create a direct
connection between residents (lower-resourced actors) and doctors (higher-resourced actors).
While the specific “Ask a Doctor” feature had not been implemented by the time of the
evaluation, “LAFN has…facilitated a great deal of networking and communication among the
local medical community…LAFN regularly hosts realtime online chats with experts in the health
field. In the 3 years since the program began, 11 Nobel laureates have participated.” Thus,
medical professionals (the higher-resourced actors) were benefiting from the connections
fostered through the ICT intervention.
•

RUN: In addition to its primary intended beneficiaries of the Jefferson County school

system and Louisville municipal partners, Project RUN targeted two disadvantaged
communities: an impoverished urban enterprise zone and a remote rural county. The primary aim
of Project RUN was to link selected government, public, and private organizations in Jefferson
County to “a 17-mile fiber optic network.” However, to demonstrate the ability to connect all
area students and citizens to the new network, “the district decided to build a demonstration
network in the Enterprise Community, which has a high level of poverty,” and they extended the
project to “reach out to Pike County, a very rural area at the other end of the state…[by
installing] teleconferencing classrooms.” While not much was written about the specific ICTenabled interventions instituted to enhance the Enterprise Community, teleconferencing “gave
the Louisville Zoo the opportunity to educate students who could not normally come to the zoo
and built a much stronger link between the zoo and Pike County. Also, it gave the incentive to a
few classes to visit the zoo.”
•

TSN: The Tri State Network was primarily intended to benefit a remote region of a

109

tri-state area of Mississippi, Alabama, and Tennessee. “The grant was awarded to help alleviate
rural isolation and a lack of telecommunications resources and infrastructure in the northeast
corner of Mississippi. The primary objective of the project was to implement a community-based
advanced telecommunications infrastructure that would support economic development efforts
focusing upon Tishomingo County and impacting the surrounding region.” ICT-enabled cultural
activities were established to help achieve TSN’s economic development aims of recruiting
business and industry to the region. “A prototype for a comprehensive cultural/education
network for schools and the community was initiated with a linkage to the Smithsonian Museum
of Natural History in Washington, D.C…” The result was that “electronic communication and
information technology…made possible the interaction between school children in Mississippi
and museum scientists and curators at the National Museum of Natural History.”
•

TVN: The Tribal Virtual Network targeted five Native American tribes, which are

“grappling with a variety of issues having to do with maintenance of their cultural heritage” and
sense of identity. The ICT intervention was the Access Grid (AG), Internet, and software to
“enable museum officials to access professional training online.” However, the training needed
in order to use the AG was not readily available, and the intended beneficiaries were not able to
effectively use the ICT intervention. “While most of the responding members did not attend the
first AG training, most attended the training in Chicago and found it beneficial…Members
indicated a desire for more AG training. In particular, troubleshooting, designing and setting up
an AG room…Community members lack sufficient knowledge to use the equipment and further
community based training is needed.”

110

4.1.2.2

Barriers
The seed evaluations often described barriers getting in the way of the community

networking project’s ability to achieve positive outcomes for the intended beneficiaries.
Concepts and properties related to barriers are shown in Table 4.4 and include issues relating to
hardware, software, training, hours of operation, and trust.

LAFN: The biggest barrier to success for LAFN involved challenges dealing with the

existing telecommunications providers. “Project administrators had several problems working
with local telephone companies, describing them as amorphous organizations in which it is hard
to determine anyone’s responsibility.”
•

RUN: In project RUN, it was noted that “The political and legal aspects of the project

rather than the technical produce the main problems.” Specific barriers to use of the
telecommunications equipment at Pike County included scheduling and usage challenges.
111

“Scheduling time for the necessary connections is very complex. Some classes had to be
cancelled because of snow days during the winter months and then had to be rescheduled. On
two occasions, the hookup was delayed…[It was] difficult to get students to use the
teleconferencing equipment appropriately, such as speaking up, pushing the buttons to speak,
and interacting with people at the other site.”
•

TSN: TSN encountered significant project coordination and information sharing

challenges. “The large number of components and players involved in the project created issues
of coordination and organization…Changing key players midstream was a significant issue in
both the organization and execution of the project goals…Furthermore, the broad scope and
multifaceted organization of the project made it difficult for area residents to know whom to
contact with which questions or concerns…” The project also encountered what appears to be
outright obstruction. “To expedite the establishment of the TSRC, NASA offered temporary
space for the hub at the Tishomingo County Educational Complex near Iuka. The hub and
officers were set up there, with the hope and design that they would be moved to Building 1000
at the Yellow Creek site as soon as it became available. Unfortunately, this did not happen.
Essentially, this involved building a system “from scratch,” which delayed the full operation…
Project staff…had a difficult time accessing several federal databases containing information
about the project site that was needed for the architectural survey…NASA was not the only
organization unwilling to share data… MDECD directed the project staff to limit the GIS data
available to the general public and economic developers from around the country.”
•

TVN: The TVN was riddled with barriers, including infrastructure, equipment,

training, staffing, and space. “Some members noted that not having the equipment in their
communities when they attended training hampered the transfer of the knowledge and

112

skills…Over half of the members mentioned infrastructure barriers such as equipment problems,
needing larger rooms for training and reliable internet connections…Also, the gap between
attending training and obtaining the proper equipment served as a barrier…Lack of time and
frustration were also noted as barriers…Two key positions for the TVN, the program coordinator
and technical support, were vacated and not filled for several months.”
4.1.2.3

Indicators
The evaluations included several indicators for measuring project outcomes, as shown in

Table 4.5. Project success can be based on such things as training attendance, ICT usage,
assimilation, or sustainability, for example.

LAFN: An indicator of success for LAFN was the legitimacy and traction it gained as

a TOP-funded project. “TIIAP funding not only was critical for implementing the network, but
113

it validated the network in the eyes of the community. Universities and community
organizations were found to be more willing to work with a network that has received a seal of
approval from the Department of Commerce.”
•

RUN: Project RUN used time to completion as a measurement indicator. “The project

has received two extensions. At the time of the site visit, it was considering asking for a third…
The project took longer than anticipated.”
•

TSN: Sustainability of the telecommunications network beyond the grant period was

a primary indicator for TSN. “Network operations were smoothly transitioned to the Tishomingo
County school system.” Another important indicator was trust in the project leadership, given the
region’s history. “The local economy had been devastated by a series of abandoned federal
initiatives; the community was very reluctant to support the TIIAP initiative. However, once the
communities came to understand that this project was being carried out by a local state university
rather than a federal agency, the atmosphere changed. Project staff worked hard to reward the
community’s trust by providing opportunities for citizens to improve their economic and
educational opportunities.”
•

TVN: Attendance at trainings and community and consortium use of the Access Grid

was an indicator for TVN. “According to a 2003 NEH Project Performance Report, over 300
community members from each of the five tribal communities attended these workshops…[Yet,]
community use of the new technology has been minimal…Consortium members have not
assimilated the technology into their typical duties.”

Often, a purported goal of community networking projects was the achieving of positive

outcomes – particularly for individuals from disadvantaged communities or populations.

114

Concepts and properties from the seed evaluations related to positive outcomes are shown in
Table 4.6. Reported outcomes from the evaluations are described in this section as well as two
aspects of community networking projects that appear to be particularly important factors in
contributing to positive outcomes: the direct involvement of community stakeholders and
technology skills-building opportunities connected to employment.

Reported Outcomes
The four seed projects resulted in varying types of success, ranging from very little

evidence of positive outcomes to significant success of the project.
•

LAFN: Project evaluators deem LAFN a huge success. “The most important outcome

of the grant was that it enabled LAFN to become L.A.’s most significant presence on the
Internet. LAFN has come to be viewed as a gateway to the larger ISPs, serving an important role
in exposing people to the Internet [and] absorb[ing] some of the burden of training new users that
is often faced by the larger ISPs…The LAFN project is clearly a success in that has managed to
expand network access to a degree far beyond what the project planners anticipated.”
•

RUN: RUN was successful in installing a considerable amount of fiber optic cable,

but it was acknowledged that “more cable needs to be installed before the full benefits of the
system can be realized.” However, the outcomes for “quality and effectiveness of new
applications and services” were less clear. “It was expected that the ‘education process’ would be
greatly transformed by the facilities and services provided by the project. No details about what
would be evaluated were included.”
•

TSN: Despite numerous obstacles, TSN was reported to have been a success as

demonstrated by “the tremendous level of community support that was garnered in an initially
reluctant population. Community members became involved in all aspects of the project. The
116

educational aspects of the project in particular should establish lasting impacts on the county’s
teachers and students. And the economic development supports and resources developed through
the project have encouraged local industry to take advantage of worldwide commercial
opportunities available via the World Wide Web and persuaded businesses and industries to
locate in the area. An important factor in the project’s success was the multi-discipline
collaboration that occurred between campus groups that typically do not work with each other.”
•

TVN: Evaluators for TVN reported very limited positive results. “One community is

using the video editing with youth, and there have been TVN sponsored diabetes education
programs for the elders in the communities. One consortium member has plans to market the
usage of the AG [Access Grid] to groups within the community for distance education and
teleconferencing.”
4.1.3.2

Community Involvement
A main form of engagement by the intended beneficiary communities in the four seed

projects, when it occurred, came in the form of community volunteers.
•

LAFN: Volunteer engagement presented a very direct way for the community to be

engaged with LAFN. The network had volunteers serving in all areas – including as mentors,
webmasters, content management, training, user registration, and technical support. “Much of the
success of LAFN is directly attributable to the dedication and enthusiasm of its volunteers.”
•

RUN: Instead of bringing stakeholders onto the project, the RUN project director

became involved in the community – at least for the project’s primary goal. Louisville Chamber
of Commerce brought together representatives from the city, county, and state governments as
well as local big business to look for niches in which the city could stand out as a means of
attracting further growth and development…The TIIAP project director served on the

117

telecommunications committee of this endeavor…as a member of the planning committee that is
implementing the statewide telecommunications system and electronic network.” However, for
the project’s other two goals, it was not clear whether stakeholders from the targeted Enterprise
Community or remote Pike County were involved in the effort.
•

TSN: While community engagement in the project at first seemed non-existent, under

the project leadership of Mississippi State University, community members became heavily
involved as volunteers. “During its 3-year existence, the Tri State Initiative has also incorporated
the efforts of over 150 professional facilitators and trainers and a volunteer work force that has
donated more than 25,000 hours of their own personal time to its projects.”
•

TVN: Based on the evaluation, members of the tribal consortium communities

appears to be most involved in TVN as passive recipients of the Access Grid technology and
associated training rather than as active participants.
4.1.3.3

Skills Building Opportunities
Staffing for TOP projects appeared to provide many opportunities for technology skills

building. The four projects differed in the extent to which intended beneficiaries were
encouraged to engage in these activities.
•

LAFN: Volunteers gained valuable experience in helping LAFN. “Volunteers report

that they are motivated to work with the network primarily by the intrinsic rewards their
assistance offers. They feel that they are providing a worthwhile community service and they
recognize that the assistance they provide is critical to the network’s success… [and] intrinsic
rewards of their efforts have increased as the network expanded…”
•

RUN: All the staff positions on project RUN appear to have been filled by staff of the

Jefferson County Public School system. “The Executive Director of Educational Technology

118

serves as the TIIAP project director… The Voice and Data Communications Specialist serves as
the project coordinator… The 12 resource teachers of the Computer Education Support Unit
provide training and ongoing daily support to users.” There is no mention of volunteers.
•

TSN: Project staff from Mississippi State University gained valuable skills from the

TSN project. “The experience of generating high-quality, creative products and events under
pressure, using leading-edge software and hardware was nevertheless considered beneficial by
the project team because it increased their knowledge about technical systems and the time
requirements necessary to produce quality results… Despite these difficulties [with
understanding LATA lines], and despite the fact that the network nodes in Tennessee and
Alabama ultimately received only minor use, the project director felt that the out-of-state nodes
were worth installing because they provided an opportunity to learn about the issues involved in
interstate telecommunications.” The evaluators also noted that “The evaluation detected a
substantial amount of volunteerism among residents of the tri-state project area. This is an
untapped resource that holds potential promise for not only expanding the program, but also
entrenching the technology in the social fabric of the community.”
•

TVN: A suggestion from one of the survey respondents suggests that an opportunity

exists within TVN for paid staff to be trained from within the target community. “Need for basic
backup training for assistants to the techies – at present if the one tech is unavailable AG system
cannot function.” However, there was no indication that this suggestion was acted upon.
4.2

Identification of a Core Theme
From the original list of concepts and properties derived from the four seed evaluations,

followed by reading additional evaluations to get a sense of breadth, a set of themes emerged.
After reflecting and elaborating on the various concepts, properties, and themes through the

119

course of writing memos (included in Appendix C), the axis around which the themes seemed to
organize was that of grants as the connecting thread – before, during, at the point of evaluation,
and after TOP. What seemed most important was how the collaborations between grant partners
evolved over time and the collaborations’ level of commitment toward addressing the needs of
the intended beneficiaries. The sections that follow describe the phases in the TOP grant process
and the related themes (without any further refinement) that emerged from the data. Analysis
includes information from TOP evaluations beyond the seed evaluations, with direct quotes
indicated in italics.
4.2.1

Prior to the TOP grant award: Collaboration features.
The evaluations pointed to the significance of aspects about project teams as they were

forming prior to the awarding of the TOP grants, as described in Table 4.7. Such aspects include
the strength and nature of prior relationships.
Table 4.7
Themes Related to the Proposal Phase
Theme
Acceleration of what was happening anyway
Collaboration challenges – agreements
Collaboration features – levels of partners, pre-existing
Existing vs. new
Extremes: e.g., Columbia & Harlem; Yale & New Haven – town vs. gown
Legitimization of partnership (especially when previous “bad blood”)

Several projects noted the importance of clear written agreements among partners no
matter who the intended beneficiary was: students, families, service organizations, and/or
businesses. In the Western Brokering Project (08-50-94067), “Staff found that legal contracts
and other special arrangements with state agencies and local institutions would [help] ensure that
all students had access to the equipment, library and computer resources, and the Internet that
they needed to participate in distance learning programs… [and it was critical to] facilitate joint

120

agreements and contracts in writing between all parties.” This project, among many others, also
noted that “it would have been useful…to conduct some sort of needs assessments…” The
Middle Schools Online project (24-40-94063) noted that a key lesson learned was to “prepare
formal agreements with participating schools and families…[to] insure that all stakeholders begin
the process with common expectations.” Similarly, a key lesson learned for the Grace Hill
Neighborhood Services project (29-40-94082) was to “Develop formal agreements with other
agencies that will be using agency computers.” In Biz-Pathways Minnesota’s Virtual
Entrepreneurs’ Network (27-60-01024) “there is a clear understanding that MRP [Minnesota
Rural Partners, a rural development council] created this project, recruited partners to it and must
continue to play the role of lead partner…”
An important feature of the collaboration was the underlying shared purpose with regard
to why the particular set of partners chose to work together. Often it was not clear exactly how
the collaboration would benefit the intended beneficiary community. Theoretical sampling to the
point of saturation yielded five types of shared purposes: workforce, clients, consumers, personal
connection, and topic of interest. Here are some examples:
•

Workforce: In projects such as the City Heights Community Technology Center (0660-01048), Biz-Pathways (27-60-01024), NebWorks (31-60-98021), and SmartCities
(29-60-94059), the promise of ICT to cultivate a workforce was the binding thread
between partners.

•

Clients and/or K-12 students (recipients of non-profit services): In projects such as
Plugged-In (06-60-95039), L.E.A.P. (09-40-94002), Grace Hill Neighborhood
Services (29-40-94083), St. Louis WhizKids (29-60-03001), and Metro Chicago
Information Center (17-60-01040), collaborating organizations not only served the
same demographic population, they even shared many of the exact same people on
their caseloads.

•

Consumers (recipients of for-pay goods and services): A shared set of consumers,
often based on a geographical region, formed the basis of partnerships centered
around:
o Education: Western Brokering Project (08-50-94067)
121

o Medicine: Mobile Community Health Information Network (01-60-95002)
and NetWellness—Ohio Valley Community Health Information Network (3940-94081)
o Telecommunications infrastructure: OneNet (40-40-95113), Project InterLinc
(31-60-95010), and TSN (28-40-94069)

4.2.2

•

Personal connection: LAFN had partners who shared connections with its founder. In
RUN, Pike County may have been included because it was the home community of
the Kentucky governor.

•

Topics of interest (objects of study or work): In the case of TVN (35-60-01068),
Indian artifacts were the shared interest between the University of New Mexico’s Arts
of the America’s Institute and the five tribal cultural organizations that made up the
consortium. For the Coastal Monitoring Network (06-60-01015), the oceans were the
shared topic.

During TOP Grant Period: Interaction Methods
As shown in Table 4.8, there were different underlying assumptions about and means of

interacting between the project collaborators and the intended beneficiary community.
Table 4.8
Themes Related to the Active Grant Period
Theme
Assumption that connecting “disadvantaged” outliers to the “advantaged” center (bridging) is better than building
on internal strengths (bonding)
Clients as indirect beneficiaries
Consumer/user involvement
Direct (people to tech) vs. indirect (people-serving organization to tech)

Theoretical sampling to the point of saturation on methods of interacting with intended
beneficiaries revealed direct methods, indirect methods, and both direct and indirect methods.
The Women’s Opportunities Resource Center Electronic Commerce Initiative (42-60-01053)
was directly used by the women entrepreneurs it was intended to benefit; whereas the Providence
Community Resource Network (44-60-99019) shared neighborhood level information to
providers that then served the intended beneficiary, residents in the West End/Elmwood
Opportunity Zone. The Choices Bank Project (30-60-01045) provided an advanced directives

122

portal that could be accessed either directly by severely ill or injured people and those who care
for them or indirectly through institutional providers, such as hospitals, clinics, aging, hospice,
and nursing programs. In some cases, projects changed from providing services and benefits
directly to indirectly. For SmartCities (29-60-94059), “instead of recruiting and building a new
organization, we chose to accomplish our mission by working with and through existing
organizations.”
4.2.3

At Point of Evaluation: Impact on Intended Beneficiaries
The themes shown in Table 4.9 indicate significant problems in the effective evaluation

of outcomes for disadvantaged communities.
Table 4.9
Themes Related to the Point of Evaluation
Theme
Existing community demographics – no attempt to measure change for participants
Impact/outcomes data not collected, no baseline data
Varying infrastructure needs & capabilities at start affected success
What does not get done – focus groups/assessment for low-income

There seemed to be a general lack of concrete outcome indicators at the community level
– even when such indicators had explicitly been planned. For TSN’s remote communities, about
1500 baseline phone interviews were conducted in the region early in the project, but a planned
follow-up survey of “about the project’s effects and impacts” was not done. And “there has been
no attempt to document or evaluate project impacts on end users at the expansion sites in
Alabama and Tennessee.” In Idaho Public Television’s DTV Datacast Planning Grant (16-6099006), the goal “greater public awareness of public TV DTV possibilities and the issues
involved in providing data services to those rural areas” was dropped. In Harlem’s LEAP project
(09-40-94002), “there were plans to conduct two focus groups to assess the uses of technology in
low-income communities and the accessibility of technology to low income clients. However,
123

these did not occur.” A quote from the Plugged In project (06-60-95039) sums up the challenges
to evaluation at the community level, “Counting people who got jobs, improved test scores, or
went to college as a result of involvement is not only difficult to do, but impossible to attribute to
any one program. Staff are comfortable telling the stories of frequent users, how they use
Plugged In’s services, and quoting the users’ views of impacts, but they are unwilling to boast of
achievements and make claims of impact that are difficult to substantiate.”
4.2.4

Toward End of TOP Grant: Sustainability
Sustainability of the community networking efforts beyond the grant period were

discussed in most of the project evaluations. The themes indicated in Table 4.10 suggest several
possible sustainability outcomes: some project collaborations were likely to simply “end” when
the grant funding ended; some showed a likelihood of continuing in either their current or a
related form as “spinoffs”; other projects seemed to completely “morph,” continuing in new
directions or with different partners.
Table 4.10
Themes Related to the End of the Grant Period
Theme
Abandoned efforts (competing, spinoffs)
Capacity building: strengthened ability for future collaborations & grants
Collaboration challenges – sustainability
Networking benefits: communication, information access, new lasting collaborations
Partners changed after project ended
Original plan changes: purpose, partners, funding, users

Three of the four seed collaborations seemed likely to continue in some capacity. The
strongest continued collaborations were to build upon co-developed infrastructure, while explicit
commitments to serve disadvantaged communities appeared to be weak.
LAFN seemed to be in a stable position, with plans to keep expanding. “Current
projections show that user fees will fully cover all operational expenses associated with

124

maintaining the network and possibly expanding the user base and the range of services
provided… LAFN management are also actively seeking grants to help underserved community
segments utilize the network.
The partnership to build up Louisville’s infrastructure in project RUN was continuing.
“The school district and its partners will continue to install fiber optic cable. In 5 years, the
district hopes to have a LAN in all local schools and about 100 of the 150 schools on fiber optic
cable.” More vague were “future ideas in which the zoo and Pike County may participate…”
Conspicuously, the Enterprise Community was not mentioned in future plans.
Spinoff collaborations involving Mississippi State University boomed as a result of its
success in the TSN project. “A beneficial part of the project was the establishment of ties by
MSU to the Smithsonian, NASA, and the U.S. Department of Education. The continuation of
these ties and the development of future projects with these agencies has been an added benefit
from the project.” The project also resulted in “strengthened ties between MSU and the
Tishomingo County Special Municipal Separate School District.” MSU became heavily involved
in “educational and training activities outside the university using distance learning
technologies…[and a] new Center for Education and Training [was established as] a mechanism
for interdisciplinary ventures.” MSU’s relationship with the Smithsonian Institution National
Museum of Natural History led to several spinoff ventures. The project “put MSU’s School of
Architecture on the map by securing their reputation with state agencies and within the
architecture community.” However, a key part of the TSN initiative was halted: “The Attorney
General ruled to disallow the project to compete as an Internet service provider (ISP).” This
signaled an awareness that taxpayer funding of infrastructure projects might unfairly compete
with the private sector – a point of contention that continues in the current day with the

125

Broadband Technology Opportunities Program (BTOP), the NTIA’s current program to build out
the National Information Infrastructure (http://cagw.org/media/press-releases/house-holdshearing-stimulus-expansion-broadband).
There was no indication that the TVN collaboration between University of New Mexico
and the five tribes would continue since “use of the TVN technology in the community is
minimal.”
Several projects completely changed direction or morphed at or near the end of the TOP
grant period – often leaving key collaborators out of future plans. In the case of the Mobile
Community Health Information Network (01-60-95002), “Additional funding has been secured
for the system, but it will not be administered under the same project director. Continued support
for users outside of the USA Hospital System is questionable since there is currently no formal
mechanism for it. The considerable effort invested in developing sound relationships between the
USA hospitals and the individual community health centers may be lost unless the centers are
kept alongside the hospitals in moving forward with the technology.”
The Western Brokering Project started with a goal to provide distance education among
existing educational institutions to underserved and placebound students throughout 15 western
states. However, “just as Brokering Project staff were beginning to investigate strategies for
long-term sustainability, the Western Brokering Project staff were given the opportunity to work
on the development and implementation plans for the new Western Governors University
(WGU), a virtual university operating entirely at a distance and offering other institutions’
courses and programs as well as developing its own programs. Staff were able to transfer their
experience and lessons learned through the Brokering Project to WGU… Had that opportunity
not come along, staff speculate that the Brokering Project would have (1) become more closely

126

aligned with the WICHE [Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education] Student
Exchange Programs (SEP), and (2) attempted to adapt distance education to existing exchange
strategies.”
4.3

Theory Components
Weaving back and forth between coding and analyzing the data (the 63 TOP evaluations),

a pattern emerged about how disadvantaged communities were treated throughout the grants
process. The same types of populations were mentioned again and again as being the intended
beneficiaries, but these communities were not always active participants in the community
networking project collaborations designed to assist them, numerous barriers prevented the
introduced information and communication technologies (ICT) from being effective, and
evaluation data demonstrating project outcomes at the community level seemed scarce. In the
final analysis, despite the ICT interventions, individuals from these populations or communities
often showed little evidence of having their lives enhanced or transformed – despite a lot of grant
money spent on these transformation efforts. Thus, there were four major components at play
here: the grant process, community networking interventions, “vulnerable” communities, and
evidence of positive outcomes.
4.3.1

The Grant Process
Partial funding for each of the Technology Opportunities Program projects occurred as

the result of a grant process. The grant process can be defined as the process of an organization
applying for and receiving a grant in order to accomplish some purpose. My understanding of the
typical grant process is drawn from my experiences with grant writing, beginning with
community networks in 1995 and continuing to this day in my university role in grant proposal

127

development. The typical grant process, from the perspective of the organization applying for
and receiving the grant, involves the following four phases:
1. In the partnership building phase, the lead organization assembles a team of
individuals and other organizations that can contribute knowledge, manpower,
money, or other resources designed to achieve a specific goal. The primary outcome
of this phase is commitment to a shared purpose among the partners and an action
plan for carrying out the project.
2. During project execution, which occurs when the grant is awarded, the action plan is
carried out. However, sometimes the scope of the project is revisited and possibly
modified in order to maximize the possibility of “success.” The outcome of this phase
may include changes to the project.
3. During evaluation, the overall success and impact of the project is assessed through
the development and measurement of specific indicators.
4. Upon close-out of the project, barriers, lessons learned, and evidence of success from
the project are reported. The main outcome of this phase includes plans, if any, for
sustainability.
4.3.2

The Community Networking Intervention
The intervention employed during the Technology Opportunities Program was

community networking, defined, for purposes of the analytical section of this study, as the use of
information and communication technologies (ICT) to enhance communities. Community
networking interventions in TOP projects included Internet access, training, hardware, various
software applications, and other innovations that were designed to help disadvantaged
communities gain access to things like services, skills, and information. Rather than describing
the technological aspects of the different types of proposed interventions, this analysis focused
on the relationship, fostered by TOP grant funding, between the proposed intervention and its
intended beneficiaries. Of specific interest was which specific community networking projects
showed the most promise for leading to positive “transformative” outcomes for enhancing the
lives of its intended beneficiaries – particularly for individuals in disadvantaged communities.

128

4.3.3

Vulnerable Communities
While conducting theoretical sampling to the point of saturation, types of intended

beneficiaries included communities or populations that were disadvantaged due to:
•

Geography (i.e., remote and/or rural communities)

•

Socioeconomics (e.g., low income; high levels of unemployment; low education
levels; unskilled, outdated, or obsolete workforce; high racial/ethnic diversity)

•

Limited mobility (e.g., “place-bound” individuals, such as the severely ill, injured, or
handicapped; students who have to be educated at home; mothers with young
children; prisoners)

•

Service need (e.g., individuals who require social services intervention such as AIDS
patients, the mentally ill, at-risk youth, ex-offenders).

Disadvantaged communities or populations are particularly susceptible to utopian claims
that technologies can level the playing field (Virnoche & Marx, 1997). Vulnerable communities
(VC) is a term coined in this study to denote disadvantaged populations or communities that are
often repeatedly targeted for intervention, particularly in grant proposals. What makes these
populations or communities vulnerable is the potential for exploiting them in order to attract
grant funding while they themselves gain no lasting benefit from the infusion of funding. Thus,
the VC construct contains three parts: 1) disadvantage, 2) identification as an intended
beneficiary in grants, 3) at risk for receiving little or no lasting benefit from grant funding.
Three of the four seed evaluations suggest the existence of vulnerable communities:
•

The Tribal Virtual Network (TVN) project involved a consortium of Native American

communities. As indicated by the number of available grant opportunities (83 of them, according
to http://www.rlnn.com/types-grants-native-americans), Native Americans are often specifically
identified as disadvantaged, although it is unclear from this TOP evaluation whether the five
tribal museums and culture centers targeted for this community networking intervention had
repeatedly been identified in other grants.
129

•

In Project Rural Urban Network (RUN), there were two suspected VCs. This first was

an Enterprise Community, “an inner-city area that is experiencing a high level of poverty.” By
definition, Enterprise Communities are explicitly and aggressively targeted for intervention
through “public-private partnerships with financial institutions, governments, community
organizations and other partners…” (Enterprise, 2014) A second VC was remote rural Pike
County. “Pike County is in the Appalachian Mountains, at the opposite end of Kentucky from
Louisville… largest county in the state, but the population is only 72,000… Three
teleconferencing centers were already located in the Louisville area and one was installed in Pike
County as a part of the TIIAP project. (Pike County has two additional teleconferencing facilities
that were funded through other sources.)” The fact that such a sparsely-populated region received
three grant-funded teleconferencing ICT interventions is a strong indicator of a vulnerable
community.
•

The most clear example of a VC among the seed evaluations was the Tri-State

Network (TSN). “Tishomingo County ranks 46th out of the 82 counties in Mississippi with a per
capita income of $10,446…The federal government spent billions of dollars on failed ventures
over the years at the Yellow Creek site in the northeast corner of Tishomingo County… As a
result of these failed ventures [1975, 1982, 1995], the economy of the region has experienced
tremendous up and down cycles in which the economy temporarily booms as thousands of
people move to the area and new hospitals, schools, cultural facilities and highways are built, and
then the economy suddenly crashes. Consequently, residents in the area are very hostile toward
the federal government and suspicious of any new initiatives” In this case, harm had historically
befallen the VC as a result of repeated interventions.
There was evidence of potential VCs in nearly all of the TOP projects. Of particular note,

130

however, were several projects that exemplified the “town and gown” phenomenon (McGirr,
Kull, & Enns, 2003). The Plugged In project (06-60-95039) served “East Palo Alto…a diverse
and underserved community” and former U.S. “leader in per capita murders,” which is located
next to “Palo Alto…home to Silicon Valley executives and Stanford University professors.”
Connecticut’s L.E.A.P. National Youth Center Networking Project (09-40-94002) served New
Haven, “one of the poorest cities in the country [which] meets the eligibility requirements for
Community Empowerment Zone status. The city has high unemployment and much drug-related
gang activity. The high school dropout rate is around 50 percent. At the same time, the city has
resources such as Yale University. Many of the L.E.A.P. senior counselors are Yale students,
who value participation in such an effort.” The Harlem Environmental Access Project (36-4094057) “serves the communities surrounding Columbia University, [which] rests on the edge of
Harlem and other neighborhoods that constitute the New York City Economic Empowerment
Zone... The project was an attempt to ‘lower the barrier between traditional ‘haves’ and ‘havenots’ of the information world.’” These communities, located near major research institutions,
represent particularly “convenient” populations for research.
4.3.4

Evidence of Positive Outcomes
One of the most promising aspects of community networking was to leverage ICT to

make people job-ready and to connect them to actual jobs. This was particularly the hope of TOP
projects, since they were funded through the Department of Commerce. Each of the following
TOP projects demonstrated positive outcomes with regard to enhancing employment
opportunities. Other noteworthy aspects of these projects are their connections to educational
institutions, the level of investment made by the intended beneficiaries, and their varying levels
of impact – at individual, neighborhood, city, and even state level.

131

The El Puente program (06-60-01048), which offered free evening computer classes
either in English or Spanish by the San Diego City Heights Community Technology Center,
illustrates the value of using local schools to connect to the community and how individual
investment can yield great dividends. “Personal interviews were conducted with four women and
two men – four Hispanics, one Asian, and one African American – who, upon completion of the
El Puente program received a free computer for use in their home…Four of the six respondents
discovered the El Puente classes through flyers their children received at school…One woman
received a promotion because of her newly acquired computer skills, while two others
confidently applied for and accepted jobs requiring computer skills…Another woman is planning
to return to college to obtain her teaching credential…Still another woman is in the process of
moving from ‘Welfare to Work’ and has recently enrolled in an insurance billing course...[An
injured construction worker] seeking job rehabilitation…now has hope for the future [and] uses
his home computer to send out his resume.”
The Grace Hill Neighborhood Services project (29-40-94083) employed a unique
approach to investing primarily at the neighborhood level. Serving “11 low-income area
neighborhoods in or near St. Louis, the project was designed to strengthen and expand…the
Member Organized Resource Exchange (MORE)…a community-based network of services that
can be exchanged like currency [allowing] neighbors to earn and save ‘time dollars’ when they
volunteer their services to one another…A debit card provided residents with computerized
access to a bank account, [with] over 500 residents using the cards to manage their financial
resources.” Unfortunately however, “the bank holding the clients' accounts [was] acquired by an
out-of-state bank [which] subsequently decided to end its participation in the debit card project.”
The project also contributed to workforce opportunities at the state level. “Funding was used…to

132

help the Missouri Department of Labor and Industrial Relations develop and implement MO
Works, an online database containing information on job opportunities… to develop a
comprehensive online resource bank of services available…”
At the city level, the Kansas City Area Development Council’s (KCADC) SmartCities
project (29-60-94059) developed a replicable model to aggressively facilitate partnerships that
were focused on job creation through the leveraging of technology. “Through the KCADC’s
partners, the project began to take shape as a comprehensive attempt to re-train the area’s
unemployed. The local community college, Metropolitan Community College (MCC), learned
that there were over 40,000 employees serving 21 major companies in the call center field… The
partners developed a customer service call training center at MCC to provide hands-on education
in this growing area [and] KCADC subsequently approached Sprint to develop a call center in
the downtown area, where jobs were needed, using the graduates of the MCC program…
According to a front page article on the Sprint Call Center in the Washington Post (Havemann &
Vobejda , 1998), 6 months after opening its doors, 85 percent of former welfare employees
remained on the job, compared with just 33 percent of suburban recruits.
These projects highlight the positive outcomes facilitated by three types of connections:

4.4

•

Communication: leveraging existing communication channels, such as children’s
schools, to connect with intended beneficiaries

•

Financial: engaging local financial institutions to provide the financial infrastructure
to facilitate trade within the community

•

Employment: connecting training to actual jobs.

Substantive Theory: The TOP Initiative and Disadvantaged Community Outcomes
Based on examining the TOP evaluations, I have developed the following preliminary

substantive (empirical) theory about the Technology Opportunities Program: TOP projects differ
in their contribution to positive outcomes for intended disadvantaged community beneficiaries
133

based on the extent and manner in which they involve the disadvantaged community during four
grant process phases: partnership building, project execution, evaluation, and close-out. During
partnership building, the project team often failed to communicate with and engage members of
the disadvantaged community to arrive at a shared purpose. During project execution, when
faced with formidable barriers to serving the disadvantaged community, the project team often
made changes that resulted in reducing the disadvantaged community’s likelihood of benefitting
from the project – such as changes in purpose, partners, geographical boundaries, or target
audience. In addition, opportunities were overlooked for engaging members of the disadvantaged
community as volunteers and employees. During evaluation, the project team often either failed
to put in place or dropped measurement indicators to assess the impact on disadvantaged
communities. During close-out, “success” of the effort was usually defined by the project’s
sustainability, rather than sustainability of and commitment by the collaboration toward
continuing to strive to enhance the lives of individuals within the disadvantaged community.
4.5

Formal Theory: Grant-Funded Projects and Disadvantaged Community Outcomes
Extending the substantive theory to a more conceptual level, I propose the following

formal theory about funding initiatives and disadvantaged communities: All grant-funded
projects differ in their contribution to positive outcomes for intended disadvantaged community
beneficiaries based on the extent and manner in which they involve the disadvantaged
community during four grant process phases: partnership building, project execution, evaluation,
and close-out. The value of a formal theory is its potential transferability from the specific
domain of empirical study to another domain. While TOP provided empirical evidence for the
substantive theory, the formal theory might be applied to other grant-funded initiatives that seek
to achieve “broader impacts” that help disadvantaged communities. For example, the formal

134

theory would suggest that a funding initiative for monitoring urban forest health in an
impoverished urban area would have an increased chance of positively impacting the target
community (as measured through an indicator like tree survival rate) by directly involving that
community in all phases of the grant process: establishing a shared purpose between
collaborators and the community for the project, creating job opportunities for local residents
(e.g., volunteers, skills training, or paid jobs working on the project itself), assessing community
impact using measures meaningful to the community, and developing plans for selected
continued collaborations once the project grant ends.
4.6

Summary
In this chapter, I described the results of the grounded theory process followed. Coding

and categorization from four seed evaluations led to the identification of a core theme relating to
the phases of the grant process around which the components of the evolving theory emerged.
All the while, I stayed immersed in the data, sought out new cases to compare, developed and
linked concepts, and attempted to create a coherent story from what the data were telling me. The
substantive and formal theories presented here are the ultimate result of that process.

135

CHAPTER 5
CONCLUSION
In this dissertation, I employed a grounded theory approach to develop a theory about
community networking, based on a finite cache of material – 63 community networking project
evaluations from the NTIA’s Technology Opportunities (TOP) initiative, which ran from 1994
until it was defunded in 2005. I developed two theories of the relationship between the project
team pursuing funding and positive outcomes for disadvantaged communities: a substantive
(empirical) theory specifically pertaining to the TOP initiative and a formal (conceptual) theory,
which extends to other funding initiatives:
•

The substantive theory is: TOP projects differ in their contribution to positive
outcomes for intended disadvantaged community beneficiaries based on the extent
and manner in which they involve the disadvantaged community during four grant
process phases: partnership building, project execution, evaluation, and close-out.

•

The formal theory is: All grant-funded projects differ in their contribution to positive
outcomes for intended disadvantaged community beneficiaries based on the extent
and manner in which they involve the disadvantaged community during four grant
process phases: partnership building, project execution, evaluation, and close-out.

Table 5.1 summarizes the extent and manner of disadvantaged community involvement,
which can vary from project to project during each phase of the grant process.

5.1

Research Question
The primary research question of this study was: How can community networking

initiatives be structured to maximize positive outcomes for individuals from disadvantaged
communities? The grounded theory developed in the course of this study suggests that positive
outcomes for individuals from disadvantaged communities are maximized when the project team
explicitly engages with the disadvantaged community throughout all phases of the grant process,
including partnership building, project execution, evaluation, and close-out.
5.2

Limitations of the Study

5.2.1

Limited Coverage and Variability of the Dataset
One limitation of the study is the limited cache of data used as the dataset. Of the 606

TOP-funded projects, only 63 evaluations could be located for this study. Some of those could
not really be characterized as formal evaluations, but they provided insight nonetheless. Of the
63 “evaluations,” only 25 were completed after the year 2000. In contrast with the evaluations
completed by Westat in 1998 and 1999 (titled as “Case Study Reports” in Appendix A), the later
evaluations were not standardized, making direct comparisons more challenging.
5.2.2

Too Much Data in Each Evaluation
Another limitation of the study is that, even though the dataset consisted of only 63

evaluations, the total number of pages was estimated at nearly 2000, making it impossible to
capture all the salient information.
5.2.3

Personal Bias
Without question, my training and background let me to filter out certain bits of

information, while focusing on others. The notion of vulnerable communities resonates with my
personal experience as a community networking champion for a remote, rural, impoverished

137

county. One of the complaints expressed by local residents in my community was that the
county’s demographics were often used in order to get grants that benefitted other regions
instead. Thus, I acknowledge that the vulnerable community (VC) construct represents one of
my own long-held concerns and potential biases. It is this sensitivity to vulnerability of
disconnected places that has underscored much of my doctoral work. However, while proponents
of total objectivity in academia may find this “weakness” particularly unacceptable, my “insider”
status affords me a level of insight into disadvantaged communities that is not often seen in
academic research.
5.2.4

Incomplete Theory
The theory developed is preliminary and incomplete – but at least it is a start. Once again,

I am encouraged by Corbin and Strauss (2008): “The moral here is to work within the limits of
the time, energy, and money…[remembering] that doing qualitative analysis is an art as well as a
science” (pp. 273-274). Completing the theory would entail operationalizing the key concepts
described in each grant phase, such as shared purpose, employment opportunities, measurement
indicators, and sustainability. Once operationalized, these concepts could be used to develop a
set of hypotheses that could be tested. For example, during project execution, one of the
important observations of this study is that the community networking project itself contains
employment-related opportunities for the disadvantaged community that are often overlooked –
ranging from volunteering to job-related training to paying jobs. A hypothesis could then be
“TOP communities that included paying jobs for community members experienced a greater
reduction in unemployment and/or a greater increase in per capita income (over time) than TOP
communities that did not include paying jobs for community members.” Admittedly, a challenge

138

with this kind of hypothesis is knowing what time range to look at, and understanding that
several different variables can contribute to such a change.
5.3

Contributions of the Study
This study makes several significant contributions to theory, method, and practice.

5.3.1

Theoretical Contributions
Contributions to theory include situating the outcomes for disadvantaged communities

within the context of the grant process; introducing the “vulnerable community” concept; and
identifying other concepts and properties that may be useful in further theoretical explorations.
5.3.1.1

Situating Disadvantaged Community Outcomes within the Grant Process
In the substantive grounded theory developed from empirical data from the National

Telecommunications and Information Administration’s (NTIA) Technology Opportunities
Program (TOP), it is notable that specifics about the community networking intervention
employed are absent; it is almost as if the technology itself were irrelevant. Such a theory is
consistent with a social informatics approach. Social informatics studies examine “the design,
uses and consequences of information technologies [taking] into account their interaction with
institutional and cultural contexts” (Kling, 1999, 1.0 Introduction). A social informatics approach
views with skepticism the extent to which disadvantaged communities will actually benefit as a
result of community networking interventions employed through an inherently political grant
process. This might also provide some insight into why the BTOP initiative, described in Chapter
1, has minimized its investments in “vulnerable populations.” Achieving lasting positive
outcomes, such as project sustainability, for disadvantaged communities is very difficult. One
way to hide the likely lack of positive outcomes (which does not look good politically) would be
to reduce the number of efforts that really try to achieve these goals. A socio-technical

139

interaction network (STIN; Kling, McKim, & King, 2003) might prove useful in representing
this. While creating a STIN is outside the scope of this study, a theoretical contribution of this
study is positioning it within social informatics, a field which has not yet reached maturity.
5.3.1.2

The Vulnerable Communities Concept
Another theoretical contribution of this study is introduction of the concept of a

“vulnerable community” (VC). A VC refers to a community that is at risk for exploitation via the
grant process. These are communities that are: 1) disadvantaged, 2) often identified as intended
beneficiaries in grants, and 3) at risk for receiving little or no lasting benefit from grant funding.
An unintended consequence of the grant process, vulnerable communities are at risk of being
created when project teams fail to engage closely with disadvantaged communities throughout
the four grant process phases.
5.3.1.3

Other Concepts Relevant to Grants Aimed at Disadvantaged Communities
A formal codebook was not developed in this grounded theory study as is permissible

(Borgotti, n.d.), since the aim was theory generation, rather than verification. However, Table 5.2
presents other concepts and properties identified from theoretical sampling employed in this
study that may be useful in further theory development or refinement – and which may serve as a
starting point for future codebook development.
5.3.2

Methodological Contributions
This grounded theory study contributes methodologically by demonstrating GT as a

viable method for information science researchers in tackling problems of the data deluge;
providing visual representations of the process and approaches used; paving the way for machine
learning approaches to analyzing qualitative data; and illustrating how project evaluations can be
used in a similar fashion as interview data.

Use in Information Science for Tackling Problems of the Data Deluge
This project demonstrates the usefulness of employing grounded theory in the field of

information science, where it has seldom been used. This is particularly important in this era of
“big data,” also known as the data deluge or data overload. Much information has already been
collected on initiatives involving community ICT. Rather than creating and collecting more data,
this project showed grounded theory to be a particularly powerful method for examining finite
caches of secondary data – with the aim of developing theory from these caches, rather than
merely describing their contents.
5.3.2.2

Visual Representations of the Grounded Theory Process
This study presents, in Figure 3.1, a visual model for the process I used to conduct

grounded theory for theory development, along with a visual representation, in Figure 3.2, of the

141

approach I used to identify and elaborate upon concepts, properties, dimensions, themes, and
theory. These approaches may be useful to other researchers.
5.3.2.3

Preparation for Machine Learning Approaches
The data memos I used in this study (see Appendix B) allowed me to focus on threads

that might not have stood out using more quantitative approaches, such as content analysis. The
memo format also allowed me to identify specific “trigger words” to possibly use later for
developing natural language processing or machine learning approaches to analyzing large
caches of qualitative material.
5.3.2.4

The Eyes of Others
In essence, the TOP project evaluations served the same role as a set of interviews,

enabling me to view the data through the eyes of those who had been entrusted to assess each
project’s impact. This approach differs from the process of meta-evaluation in which the already
synthesized findings contained in evaluations are even further synthesized. Instead, this approach
allows for the surfacing of neglected or overlooked findings mentioned in evaluation reports
regardless of their quantitative occurrence – as long as the findings relate to the theory under
development.
5.3.2.5

Longitudinal and Comparative Analysis
Thanks to the careful preservation of data from the TOP initiative by Kate Williams

(Williams, 2007), this study was able to examine a 15-year initiative involving many multi-year
case studies – providing a rare opportunity for analyzing data over time and across cases.
5.3.3

Practical Contributions
The study provides valuable information to guide current and future community

networking-related policies and initiatives from the perspectives of policy makers and funders,

142

higher education administrators and educators, and disadvantaged communities and their
champions.
5.3.3.1

Policy Makers and Funders
By breaking down the grant process into different phases, this study has exposed several

potential “weak spots” at each phase where communities might be exploited, rather than
effectively served, by funded project teams. It is hoped that such awareness might lead to more
effective oversight, guidance, and safeguards to ensure that the intended beneficiaries of grant
funds are indeed the ones who benefit.
For example, funders should ensure that, in the grant proposal, all project team members
have defined and agreed upon a shared purpose that has involved members of the disadvantaged
community (partnership building phase). Once the grant has been awarded (project execution
phase), funders should approve any changes to the project, such as its purpose, partners,
geographical boundaries, or target audience. The goal of such approval is to ensure there are no
changes that might negatively impact the disadvantaged community’s likelihood of benefitting
from the project. In addition, funders should encourage project teams to include opportunities for
volunteering and employment by members of the disadvantaged community. Funders should
make sure that grant proposals include measurement indicators designed to assess the impact on
disadvantaged communities – and that the proposed evaluation measures are carried out
(evaluation phase). Mechanisms for continued reporting of long-term measures even beyond
funding periods are encouraged, such as engaging members of the disadvantaged community in
data collection efforts. Funders should welcome the honest presentation of barriers to success,
challenges, and outright failures from the projects – along with plans for sustaining, dissolving,
or reconstituting the project team assembled to carry out the funded project (close-out phase). All

143

too often, project teams feel pressured to present only positive results and elaborate schemes to
ensure project sustainability – even if the project has failed to truly produce positive outcomes.
Sustainability of the specific project is of less importance than the sustainability of the
partnership – even if the partnership goes in different directions. Additionally, with
disadvantaged communities, positive results can sometimes only realistically be reported at the
individual level – and often only after long periods of time. Policy makers and funders should
enhance methods for encouraging this kind of honest and longitudinal reporting. Thus, the notion
of sustainability should be broadened to include continuation of the grant partnership in the
same, changed, or new forms (such as spin-offs and derivations) for the purpose of shared
commitment to enhancing the lives of individuals within the disadvantaged community. Success
should also be reported down to the individual level – particularly in disadvantaged communities
where large-scale changes are very difficult to achieve.
5.3.3.2

Higher Education Administrators and Educators
The “town-and-gown” phenomenon noted in this study highlights the heightened

potential for universities to exploit, rather than serve, disadvantaged communities – as charged
by Stoecker (2005). The publish or perish imperative incentivizes universities to focus on
producing innovative research and to educate only the best and brightest. Instead of universities
treating neighboring communities merely as a playground in which to conduct short-term
experiments or studies – leaving when the grant funds run out, it would be worthwhile to focus
on how to actually touch people’s lives in a meaningful way perhaps through longer-term
relationships, such as internships with local organizations.
As another example, universities should strive to serve as partners in the partnership
building phase in efforts to utilize ICT for the benefit of disadvantaged communities.

144

Universities are in a good position to help ensure that disadvantaged communities themselves
have direct representation on project teams assembled ostensibly for their benefit. The digital
divide problem is highly complex with many questions needing further investigation. Embedded
within every disadvantaged community are “champions,” individuals who have demonstrated a
selfless commitment to and investment in their community. Universities would do well to find
these individuals, consider offering them scholarships, and cultivate them as researchers who
remain embedded in their communities – perhaps while serving roles on funded grant projects.
The technology for distance learning is now available – albeit still challenging in some
communities. As one who has lived in a “disconnected” remote, rural community while pursuing
a Ph.D., I can attest to how keenly aware you become of the digital divide when you live it.
Given the opportunity, well-selected individuals from disadvantaged communities can become
productive researchers, teachers, and community leaders in their own right – without having to
leave their home communities. Programs of community informatics present such opportunities
and should be encouraged among the iSchools, in particular. Such programs can also help ensure
that higher education partners remain aware of the pitfalls pointed out in this study at the other
phases in the grant process – including changes during project execution, the tendency to leave
out or drop off disadvantaged community evaluation indicators, and the sometimes misguided
tendency to focus on project sustainability, rather than collaboration sustainability, upon closeout.
5.3.3.3

Disadvantaged Communities and Their Champions
Community champions rarely have the training or luxury of wading through scholarly

literature or evaluations from related initiatives. It is hoped that the theories generated in this
study are digestible enough to be useful to these champions – providing insights into the points

145

during the grant process where opportunities for positive outcomes can get de-railed. Constant
vigilance and engagement, without apology, are critical to successful outcomes.
For example, community champions need to be constantly aware of funding initiatives
involving their disadvantaged communities in order to become involved in partnership building.
This is done through social networking. Community champions do not work in isolation, waiting
for others to contact them and come to meetings they schedule. Instead, they should strive to
have a seat at the table at not only grant-related meetings, but also other meetings going on in the
community. Reading the local papers, attending government meetings, and engaging with public
libraries and schools are a great way to start – and to remain involved. Most funding initiatives
start with existing organizations. Since many funding initiatives are subject to public scrutiny,
even during project execution, community champions who have not been actively included in the
project team can exercise their voice by ensuring that project changes do not undermine potential
positive outcomes for their community and by suggesting qualified local individuals to serve
roles on the grant – whether paid or as volunteers. Champions can help ensure that appropriate
evaluation indicators remain in place by offering to collect and track such data, including
longitudinal, harder-to-obtain measures, such as employment indicators and receipt of
scholarships by local residents. Such steps might even be precursors to becoming community
informatics researchers, teachers, and community leaders, as discussed above in the
recommendations for higher education. Champions can also help ensure that, upon close-out,
closer engagement with the disadvantaged community, success stories even at the individual
level, and new ways of looking at sustainability, are among the lessons learned and reported to
funders. Community champions would do well to see themselves as positive partners in grant

146

initiatives, rather than as adversaries. After all, grants still follow “the golden rule” – he with the
gold rules.
5.4

Future Directions
Plans for future research include the following – all with an aim toward keeping the focus

on outcomes for disadvantaged communities:

5.5

•

Assessing the fit of the grounded theory by conducting a more quantitative content
analysis of the TOP project evaluation dataset

•

Situating the grounded theory within the framework of a sociotechnical interaction
network (STIN)

•

Assessing the effectiveness of different collaborators (such as institutions of higher
education) in relationship to disadvantaged communities

•

Testing and verifying the theory against a different secondary dataset, such as
Broadband Technology Opportunities Program evaluations

•

Developing machine learning methods for identifying indicators related to
disadvantaged communities and their treatment in funding initiatives

•

Mapping disadvantaged communities from the TOP initiative, adding to the map as
additional funding initiatives targeting disadvantaged communities are examined; the
aim will be to see which communities are most often targeted in grants

•

Helping obtain funding for and conducting additional studies that will add to the
understanding of how to achieve positive outcomes for disadvantaged communities –
particularly involving ICT; above all, I want to get back to the important work of
making the world a better place.

Epilogue
It has been nearly 20 years since my first exposure to this grand community experiment

called “the World Wide Web. ” Most would agree that that experiment has indeed turned out to
be a transformative success. While the two community networks I helped to found long ago no
longer exist and some would say they were unsustainable, I now understand that does not mean
they were unsuccessful. To the contrary, their lasting legacy lives in the many community
collaborations between organizations, government, business, and citizens that began with the
147

community networking grants invested in them nearly 20 years ago and in the individuals who
benefited from those investments.
As eloquently described in the starfish story, adapted from Eiseley (1969):
A young man is walking along the ocean and sees a beach on which thousands and
thousands of starfish have washed ashore. Further along he sees an old man, walking
slowly and stooping often, picking up one starfish after another and tossing each one
gently into the ocean. “Why are you throwing starfish into the ocean?” he asks. “Because
the sun is up and the tide is going out and if I don’t throw them further in they will die.”
“But, old man, don’t you realize there are miles and miles of beach and starfish all along
it! You can’t possibly save them all, you can’t even save one-tenth of them. In fact, even
if you work all day, your efforts won’t make any difference at all.” The old man listened
calmly and then bent down to pick up another starfish and threw it into the sea. “It made
a difference to that one.” (Starfish story, n.d.)
Scattered through initiatives like the Technology Opportunities Program are stories of
starfish, like me. My engagement in community networking nearly 20 years ago as a volunteer
from a remote, rural, impoverished community certainly transformed me and ultimately led to
this dissertation. The skills I gained as a community collaborator, grant writer, and webmaster
continue to serve me well professionally and personally and also made a difference to the
communities I have served. It is that quest for positive outcomes for disadvantaged communities,
at any level, that drives me still…

“The idea for developing the LAFN originated in 1986 when the current
LAFN President contacted a well-known telecommunications visionary
at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, [the founder of
Cleveland Free-Net] to help him set up an online resource to facilitate
the exchange of medical information between physicians and the
general public …After 8 years of effort by a dedicated team in Los
Angeles, the Los Angeles Free-Net was inaugurated on May 10, 1994. It
was, at the time, one of nearly 100 free-nets in existence…” (p.7).

“plans are underway to reinstate one of the original services offered
through LAFN, Ask the Doctor, which allows users to anonymously
receive answers to medical questions from experienced physicians. Ask
the Doctor had been discontinued prior to the TIIAP award due to a lack
of participation on the part of physicians. The network now has a large
base of doctors who use the system” (p.8).

articulated benefits, but disadvantaged community benefits are not
clear. This supports my driving concern that “benefits to the
disadvantaged” is used a way to attract funding, but in terms of
actually showing or providing benefits, grant recipients tend to fall
short. The actual benefits accrue to the already powerful and wellresourced (rich get richer).
An advantage of using evaluations for GT is that they already
include a notion of change over time – that’s specifically what they
look at.

opportunity to experience real-life applications to what they had been
studying. It gave the Louisville Zoo the opportunity to educate
students who could not normally come to the zoo and built a much
stronger link between the zoo and Pike County…Also, it gave the
incentive to a few classes to visit the zoo. In fact, at least one of the
classes was put on a video, which was shown on a TV station in West
Virginia. On the basis of the video, a class from West Virginia took a
field trip to the Louisville Zoo, and drove right by the Cincinnati

The original proposal was developed and submitted by the Tri-State
Education Initiative Consortium (TSEIC), a 501-C-3 not-for-profit
organization of 30 school districts organized to work cooperatively to
enhance and broaden the capabilities of their respective education
systems. After the grant was awarded, TSEIC had second thoughts
about their capabilities to oversee a project with such a strong
economic development focus. With approval from TIIAP, the project
was reassigned to the State of Mississippi Department of Economic
and Community Development (MDECD). Mississippi State
University (MSU) was contracted to manage project operations with
Johnson Controls World Services, Inc., as the onsite subcontractor.

The complexity of the Tri-State Demonstration Project presented
many challenges to those involved. The large number of components
and players involved in the project created issues of coordination and
organization. Another related frustration involved dealing with new

deadlines. During the implementation stage, crossing LATA1 lines
across states was reported to be the biggest and most unexpected
difficulty the project team had to deal with (p3)

these intentions, the initial implementation efforts concentrated on
Tishomingo County, Mississippi. Later, the focus expanded to
encompass Alcorn and Prentiss Counties, also in Mississippi.
Ultimately, project administrators and team members were advised to
further enlarge the scope to once again include areas in Alabama and

After the grant was awarded, TSEIC decided against involvement and
responsibility for the project and returned the award to the U.S.
Department of Commerce because they had reservations about their
capabilities for managing a complex project with such a large
economic development component. Officials in the State of
Mississippi Department of Economic and Community Development
(MDECD) convinced Commerce to fund the project through them
instead. MSU was contracted to take over project operations with
Johnson Controls World Services, Inc., as the onsite subcontractor.
MDECD had little involvement in the project’s operations beyond
garnering the support of the Yellow Creek site that housed the
network hub. MDECD was interested in sponsoring the grant for the
economic development gains it would bring to the region, but
recognized that Mississippi State was in a better position to manage
the project. The project was reassigned (with approval from TIIAP)
from TSEIC to MDECD. (p7)

Located in the northeast corner of the state, it more closely resembles
a county in the heart of the Appalachian Region than a typical
Mississippi county. It is a rural county, with timber and other
agricultural pursuits occupying a large sector of the economy.
Tishomingo County ranks 46th out of the 82 counties in Mississippi
with a per capita income of $10,446. (p9) The federal government
spent billions of dollars on failed ventures over the years at the
Yellow Creek site in the northeast corner of Tishomingo County… As
a result of these failed ventures [1975, 1982, 1995], the economy of
the region has experienced tremendous up and down cycles in which
the economy temporarily booms as thousands of people move to the
area and new hospitals, schools, cultural facilities and highways are
built, and then the economy suddenly crashes. Consequently,
residents in the area are very hostile toward the federal government
and suspicious of any new initiatives. (p10)

hostility was due to the economic devastation that the Tri-State
Region had experienced over the last 10 years. As explained
previously, the local economy had been devastated by a series of
abandoned federal initiatives; the community was very reluctant to

understand that this project was being carried out by a local state
university rather than a federal agency, the atmosphere changed.

to expedite the establishment of the TSRC, NASA offered temporary
space for the hub at the Tishomingo County Educational Complex
near Iuka. The hub and officers were set up there, with the hope and
design that they would be moved to Building 1000 at the Yellow
Creek site as soon as it became available. Unfortunately, this did not
happen, and the offices of the hub site remained at the Educational
Complex. This in itself meant that Johnson Controls did not have the
transmission lines and telecommunications infrastructure readily
available, as defined by the project had it been established at the
Yellow Creek Site. Essentially, this involved building a system “from
scratch,” which delayed the full operation. (p13)

Changing key players midstream was a significant issue in both the
organization and execution of the project goals….Furthermore, the
broad scope and multifaceted organization of the project made it
difficult for area residents to know whom to contact with which

During the implementation stage, crossing LATA4 lines across states
was reported to be the biggest and most unexpected headache project
staff had to deal with. It took considerable effort to determine the
rules and regulations governing LATA lines, and there were
substantial costs associated with setting up the network across LATA
lines. Despite these difficulties, and despite the fact that the network
nodes in Tennessee and Alabama ultimately received only minor use,
the project director felt that the out-of-state nodes were worth
installing because they provided an opportunity to learn about the
issues involved in interstate telecommunications. (p14)

NASA was not the only organization unwilling to share data. As part
of the project, a GIS user interface was developed to allow network
users to easily access local GIS data from a web browser such as
Netscape. However, MDECD directed the project staff to limit the
GIS data available to the general public and economic developers
from around the country. Therefore, the demonstration that existed on
the website at the time of the site visit was said to represent only a
small portion of what is possible. MDECD’s rationale for reserving
exclusive access to majority of data was that the state would then be
in a better position to sell Mississippi during presentations for
prospective businesses. (p14)

Perhaps the most important indicator of the success and the impact of
the total project is the tremendous level of community support that
was garnered in an initially reluctant population. Community
members became involved in all aspects of the project. The
educational aspects of the project in particular should establish lasting
impacts on the county’s teachers and students. And the economic
development supports and resources developed through the project
have encouraged local industry to take advantage of worldwide
commercial opportunities available via the World Wide Web and
persuaded businesses and industries to locate in the area. (p15) An
important factor in the project’s success was the multi-discipline
collaboration that occurred between campus groups that typically do
not work with each other. (p15).

The TIIAP project fulfilled a great need among the residents of
Tishomingo County for access to the telecommunications
infrastructure and training in its use. Residents are acutely aware that
the use of technology and telecommunications are an important factor
in their abilities to compete in the technological world of the 21st
century. Project staff reported that people often had to be turned away
from town meetings about the project due to a lack of standing room.
The outpouring of volunteers to assist with various project activities
was reported to be phenomenal. Community members not only
provided technical assistance but also went so far as to offer their
extra bedrooms for use by the project staff when they were in town.
(And project training staff had more requests for training sessions
than could be accommodated.) When the demand for training
outstripped the availability of computer systems in the community of
Belmont (population 1,200), for example, over $30,000 in local
contributions were raised in a 2-week period to purchase 25 state-ofthe-art computers for the community’s electronic classroom. (p18)

Several examples of how the Tri-State Network has been used by the
schools were provided, the most notable being a pilot project with the
Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of Natural History called
the Natural Partners Initiative. This collaborative program was
designed to enliven the way science is taught to elementary and
middle school students. Through the initiative, the electronic
communication and information technology provided by the TIIAP
project made possible the interaction between school children in
Mississippi and museum scientists and curators at the National
Museum of Natural History. (p19) Interactive experiences were made
possible through other Internet broadcasts from the National Museum
of Natural History such as “Live from Antarctica,” sessions with
Peace Corps representatives, an “electronic field trip to the live
Marine Ecosystem exhibit, and a “Live from the Stratosphere” session
with atmospheric researchers. These events typically reach about
5,000 students and teachers. (p19)… eight middle school teachers
were selected to participate in the Smithsonian’s Natural Partner’s
Initiative. The teachers were brought to the museum (p22)… an MSU
professor from the School of Architecture spent 5 weeks at the
Museum of Natural History with a group of his students in the
summer of 1997 conducting a 3-D mapping inventory of artifacts and
exhibits in the museum’s archives. The university funded the effort to
make the museum’s collection available electronically to anyone with
Internet access. This endeavor has expanded further with the
Smithsonian using software created for the 3-D mapping project to
create new museum exhibits. (p22)

faculty and administrators can unobtrusively observe student teachers
in the classroom from a remote location. The technology also allows
for more frequent communication between the student teachers and
their colleagues. The interactive technology also allows the schools of
education to place student teachers in more geographically isolated
areas away from the university. (p19)

Through the TSRC and under the direction of the MDECD, economic
development was a major thrust of the project. The TSRC provided
assistance to businesses and industries within the region in a variety
of ways. These included providing technical support and expertise in
1) simple and complex networking, 2) a wide range of
telecommunications technologies, 3) integrated facility management,
4) the Internet and World Wide Web access, 5) web/home page
development, and 6) strategic planning. In addition, major efforts
were expended in providing consulting services and technology
training. These activities included 1) ISO 9000, 2) quality, 3) Stephen
Covey’s “Seven Habits of Highly Effective People,” 4) business
management, and 5) small business administration and
development…A unique “electronic incubation” concept was
developed by the TSRC team that created a virtual business incubator
to foster the development of new small businesses within the
region…A minority consortium incubator concept was also developed
and implemented by the TSRC during the final stages of the
networking project. Additional efforts were directed toward
developing the climate to attract high tech, diversified industries and
businesses that could take advantage of the advanced
telecommunications systems implemented under the networking
project. (p20)… Unfortunately, there is no available documentation of

A beneficial part of the project was the establishment of ties by MSU
to the Smithsonian, NASA, and the U.S. Department of Education.
The continuation of these ties and the development of future projects
with these agencies has been an added benefit from the project. The
positive working relationship between these federal organizations and
MSU helped to break down existing barriers typically encountered
when states deal with federal entities. The cooperative nature of this
project allowed the state government to maintain creative control of
the project while using federal partners as advisors and mentors. (p21)
In addition to the relationships with federal entities, the TIIAP
initiative also strengthened ties between MSU and the Tishomingo
County Special Municipal Separate School District. Tri-state project
staff from MSU were involved in the development of the district’s
1996-97 Educational Technology Plan. Tri-State staff members
helped the school district understand the capabilities of existing
technology, incorporate Tri- State Network Project plans into the
school system’s technology plan, and recognize the need for
additional electronic access including the requirements for additional
phone lines… technological advances stimulated by the TIIAP project
also motivated the school system in Tishomingo County to pursue

The TIIAP initiative had several unexpected effects on the grantee
organization, MSU. Prior to the TIIAP initiative, MSU was only
involved in a limited amount of educational and training activities
outside the university using distance learning technologies. Now, the
university is involved in several such projects…the TIIAP grant
directly led to the establishment of the University’s new Center for
Education and Training. The vice president of the university
suggested that a center be formed to provide a mechanism for
interdisciplinary ventures because he was so impressed with the way
the various university groups worked together on the TIIAP initiative
across departmental and college lines. The TIIAP project also put
MSU’s School of Architecture on the map by securing their
reputation with state agencies and within the architecture community.

• …project staff will need to reformulate project goals to better

• There are three substantial resources within the community
that can be more effectively coordinated with the conduct of
the project…volunteerism…an untapped resource that holds
potential promise for not only expanding the program, but also
entrenching the technology in the social fabric of the
community. Also, substantial resources such as the Tri-State
Education Initiative (NASA's role), along with the Tri-State
Educational Initiative Consortium (the role of regional
educational leaders) need to be brought into the project as
major collaborators and players in any future phases of the
project.
• Paradoxically, communications between project components
and the project management and the community players
should be given the highest priority in all future project

There were many changes in this project – from the original awardee,
partners, and geographical boundaries. What was really going on? Why
this reluctance for economic development? Seems as if it’s only thru
“need” that grants can be awarded, but that it’s only thru achieving
economic purposes that grants can be effectively administered. Those
with the need are reluctant to manage. And those with management
expertise are perhaps reluctant or unable to effectively incorporate the
most needy? Impressive the contributions of and variety of partners –
different levels of government and different sectors. This has a political
component: involvement of attorney general – other one had governor’s
hometown

huge differences is in this project between what was original

capture before (planned) & after (implemented/actual) Add political
component Introduce instability – how many knowingly
induced/introduced/deliberately not avoided (omission/commission)
Community Victim/Target (sacrificial lamb? Sympathetic
communities? Vulnerable communities? Funding attractors? Patsy?)
– a community that: often finds itself (repeatedly and over time)
included in grant proposals to demonstrate high need in order to
attract funding, BUT rarely has any real input into the proposal or
its implementation (the thing that could be varied and have real
impact on the outcome – the dependent variable) AND rarely finds
itself any better off because of the grant (before, during, or
especially afterwards) —I can make this a hypothesis: first, find
these communities, second, quantify/describe level of true local
involvement in proposal or implementation [input from community
could tell you where the hole in the bucket was – if not how to fix it;
especially when repeated]
Typology of CNs – strong founder (self-serving/professional?),
vulnerable community (political), economic – which most likely to
succeed – as defined by…? ; can things change from one type to
another, what can you change (IVs, DVs) – how to transform
disadvantaged community so that you know the funds won’t be
wasted – explicit things to watch for depending on which type
Silver lining: At what expense; time is money, cost benefit analysis,
positive spin; everything is possible with unlimited time & money
Do always decide to move forward with current design, change
design, or drop project; a lot about who is chosen to participate;
must anticipate things not going as planned – always pick the best
people to make silk purse out of sow’s ear when there’s still only so
much time & money; good for Interdisciplinarity teams
Corrupted capitalism: the data made available thru the initiative was
not ‘theirs’ to sell; should not be for exclusive access, should be for
public
Success Indicator vs. Success Contributor: “vectors” for indicators
– Type, Measure, Result
Connection Inequality: the notion that there are various dimensions
of inequality that can 1) be used as connection points (node-node),
2) be bridged (link itself) in order to enabled connection
Missing data: notion that what is missing can tell us much about the
real priorities and intentions – did they ever really intend to find out
that something wasn’t materializing the way hoped?
Community Engagement Recommendations – anything prefaced
with “community” that is specifically called out

Evidence of “after” the grant – continued existence? Benefit to intended
audience – long or short term.
The nature of sympathetic communities may prevent true transformation
197

– they need to remain vulnerable & needy in order to be continuous
sources for attracting funding. While they’re not actively victimized,
they are not actively helped in any meaningful way (at least based on
any notion of local community members) either. It would be interesting
to see how many of these efforts display evidence (all facets) of being a
sympathetic community.
• Study 1: What theory about this type of community?
• Study 2: Which specific communities are continually exploited?
• Study 3: How can you really help these specific communities?
What are the safeguards/funding requirements to ensure
“success”?
It’s curious that so many maps were created – beyond those originally
planned and for all 3 counties. Does that reflect the different priorities of
the different awardees?

Interesting how this contrasts with 06-40-94026. This eval seems to take
a very negative stance, so my codes have a lot to do with barriers.
Whereas other one took a positive stance, so codes had to do with
positive transformation potential – brokering outcomes & service
opportunities, codes I need to go back and use here. Seems like this
project can’t even get off the ground – and it started a lot later, when
Lessons Learned from early rounds should have informed the new
projects. I think it’s the network connections pieces that need to be
called out – there must be strong fabric of multiple connective fibers
that is either already built, or will be built through the grant right up
front, that predicts success or failure.
There seems to be a discounting of community interest. Perhaps it’s
because they’re not interested in what the founders thought they should
be. Instead, they’re interested in video, sound, multimedia. How to
capture this as a concept?

APPENDIX C
PROCESS MEMOS

207

Memo 1: Overview of Evaluations
I have organized the TOP projects based on whether or not I have, or can get from the TOP
archive at University of Michigan, some kind of evaluation document for the project. In total, I
have 67 evaluations of TOP projects – some quarterly, annual, final, etc. I already have 34 of
these evaluations that I was able to pull from the project website:
• 1998: 22
• 1999: 12
I have reduced the list of project abstracts to include abstracts only for those 67 projects. In
reading through these abstracts, I have decided to quickly code them according to the type of
community network they are, with the codes below emerging as I code:
Code
B
C
E
G
LI
M
S
SP
SS

Meaning
Business
Cultural
Education
General
Low Income
Medical
Safety
Special Population
Social Services

I will probably revisit these later. It appears that the classification is breaking down according to:
1) topical – based on the partners
2) population – based on the people being served (for example, for 25-60-01037, I originally
had “D” for disabled, but I remembered that 29-60-00025 was for senior citizens over 55,
and I had tagged that as “general.” I’ve now coded it SP for Special Population. Then I’ll
probably need to add a qualifier for Disabled, Senior Citizen, or Low Income.
An interesting one is 35-60-01068 for tribal museums. Is this based on the various tribal museum
partners or to serve the tribal population? I coded it as Culture, as opposed to SP.
Some projects like 36-40-94057 purport to connect a higher resourced partner like Columbia
University, with lower resourced populations like Harlem, via the Harlem schools. I think I’ll
start coding these as “X: connexion.” This will be one of the main elements I’m looking for –
connection between unequal partners (e.g. resources, power, geography, SES, education
level/access, etc.). But the “X” also denotes using institutional partners (topical) as a way to
reach special populations. This may be more appropriate as a separate category. Then couple it
with the topical/partners & the population. For now, I’m going to code this as LI.
36-60-01018 appears to be another effort that really seeks to benefit the partners in doing their
jobs better, rather than directly benefiting the target population – in this case mothers of at-risk
children. By this, I mean that the technology will be put in the hands of the day care providers,
rather than the mothers. It is assumed that mothers will indirectly benefit. That’s probably an
208

assumption underlying many of these projects – that by giving service providers access to
technology, it will help them do their jobs better – in turn improving the services they deliver. In
36-60-01049, it’s Medicare counselors who benefit.
I need to check if I’m equating Rural with General when coding – and whether that’s
appropriate. I note that there’s much mention of lower income and rural together. This reminds
me of the TIIAP workshop I went to years ago where Al Gore was keynote speaker. I was
always puzzled why inner poor and rural communities were targeted in the same initiative.
Identification of TOP Numbering Scheme
As I’m creating the appendix listing all of the TOP projects with evaluations that will be
included in my study, I’m starting to understand the project numbering pattern. For example, in
the project numbered 53-50-95105.
• 53 indicates the state: Washington (WA)
• 50 indicates the category of project: TBD later (possible choices appear to be 40, 50, &
60)
• 95 indicates the year the project was awarded funding: 1995
• 105 may indicate the next sequential number among all projects funded in that year
(1995)

•

Collaboration challenges – sustainability, agreements
Collaboration features – levels of partners, pre-existing
Original plan changes: purpose, partners, funding, users
Focus on people, not tech
What does not get done – focus groups/assessment for low-income
Specifics on how tech can help with low income issues, such as literacy & learning
Acceleration of what was happening anyway – email, online service delivery
Evaluators trying to focus on technology, but having to report on people instead
Connecting existing organizations – challenges, rewards
Clients as indirect beneficiaries
Networking benefits: Communication, information access, new lasting collaborations
Barriers: lack of time to use new tech (eg video), broken/not working,
Abandoned efforts (competing, spinoffs): community email, govt databases
Consumer/user involvement
Innovativeness
Existing community demographics – no attemot to measure change for participants
Existing goals/direction – no new innovation
Political considerations overriding others
Uncooperative info/svc providers –info sharing

Description
Started 10/13/13
All community ICT projects can be categorized as a primary type.
Possible community ICT project types are based on the initial conditions
spawning the project and include:
• Strong Founder
• Vulnerable Community
• Other/Unspecified
Based on the primary project type, different safeguards or conditions must be
put in place in order to enhance the probability of project success. Categories
of conditions include:
• Degree of community environmental readiness
• Degree of closeness to founder’s area of interest
• Number of changes from initial grant conditions
• Degree of local community involvement in planning and
implementation
Project success is defined by:
• Extent to which goals articulated by the community have been met
• Length of time the network that was created or enhanced by the grant
continued to survive beyond the grant period
• Extent to which services (connection opportunities) provided by the
network were taken over by other entities
• Number, type, and quality of new connections fostered by the
community network
Transformation at the individual/community level is a side effect of
community networking and occurs when:
• Previously unconnected partners connect for a tangible purpose
• A trusted broker fosters the connection (e.g., a university) AND
delivers positive results

211

More Refined Thoughts on Theory
After re-reading chapters 7-12 of Corbin and Strauss (2008), I’ve started to re-read my 4 coded
case study memos and to quickly read through all of the early TOP case studies (1998 & 1999)
that are coded with a “40.” These seem to be those most likely to align with my definition of
“community networks.” As shown in the memo started on 10/26/13 of emerging themes, I started
to write out a list of topics that are covered, and noticed that I’m mainly using nouns to describe
the themes encountered. In deciding to explore further the process surrounding the notion of
“vulnerable communities” I discovered earlier, and in attempting to use verbs instead of nouns,
below are the themes that seem to make sense.
Federally-funded community networking projects: The treatment of vulnerable communities
throughout the grant process.
1. Qualification: Identifying problems facing vulnerable communities to qualify for funding
2. Application: Assembling project teams to apply for funding, sometimes including
vulnerable community representation, sometimes not
3. Start-up: Changing original project design with regard to role of vulnerable communities
4. During Operations: Identifying and addressing barriers facing vulnerable communities
5. Formative Assessment: Connecting vulnerable communities to others
6. Summative Evaluation: Failing to assess impact on vulnerable communities
7. Recommendations: Modifying treatment of vulnerable communities in future funding
Note: I don’t want to lose sight of three broad themes emerging for me: grant funding (lots of
data), tracking transformation (some data), cultivation of champions (likely no data)
What is a vulnerable community.
For purposes of this dissertation, a vulnerable community is a geographically-based community
(established based on geographic descriptors) that is targeted for a specific intervention (in this
case, community networking) in order to enhance it by addressing its perceived disadvantages in
some way.
Substantive theory about the grants process.
What I’m seeing is a general process involving grant funding that will likely apply to any type of
grant:
1. Identifying problem: Making sure the project is eligible and will stand out from the
crowd based on its effort to address specific criteria – in the case of TOP (and many
grants), this requires inclusion of a target population that could be classified as “needy”
2. Applying: Assembling a team, often based on existing connections amongst the key
partners or even with the vulnerable community
3. Starting up: Upon award, re-examining the project plan and making changes in partners,
target beneficiary or coverage area, resources needed, and even in the awardee to ensure
success

4. During the project: Finding out that there are obstacles getting in the way of achieving
the plans laid out, and having to expend time, energy, and funds to address those
unanticipated barriers
5. Identifying potential positive contributions of the project (formative): Looking for the
silver lining in the project that suggests it may have made a positive difference. This is
more an effort to please the funders and perhaps even some “cognitive dissonance” –
particularly in the face of evidence that suggests the project may not have made a dent.
6. Evaluating (summative): An oft-repeated “oops” about failing to collect baseline data,
data about actual outcomes rather than inputs/outputs, and longitudinal data—even data
collected at the start of the project & re-measured at the end to indicate any kind of
change, let alone any plans for continuing to collect data beyond the end of the project.
7. Future: A recognition that more input from the target community should have been
included from the beginning, along with promises to do so next time.
Substantive theory about vulnerable communities.
1. On record as Targeted Beneficiary: It is not uncommon to see the same vulnerable
communities being used over and over again in grant-funded projects. Their inclusion
was successful in the past (best predictor is past behavior), investments (often quite
substantial) have already been made (Concorde Fallacy), and usually there is no one to
speak for that community to get in the way of the vision of the non-community project
team.
2. Left out of Project Team: Members drawn from “vulnerable communities” are not often
seen as part of the actual project team that applies for funding – Why not? perhaps
because they haven’t typically been included in the past and perhaps because it’s hard to
identify people from within those communities who are perceived as being able to
effectively contribute.
3. Reduced prominence in grant: The role first identified for vulnerable communities, such
as being the primary beneficiary, is lessened through actions, upon granting of the award,
such as modifying partners and their roles; primary purpose of the project; location, type,
and quantity of resources to be used; primary area to be served; and even project awardee
[watch for the key word “originally”]. Since the grant has already been awarded, funders
are reluctant to withdraw funding, and would rather repurpose the grant than give the
money back.
4. Presenting of Insurmountable Barriers: The project team has outlined its vision for how
the project should work, but reality sets in that, oh my gosh, there are a lot of things
standing in the way that we didn’t anticipate – and these usually have to do with specific
characteristics of the vulnerable community that were unknown or not taken into
consideration at the time of the application. The community itself then is seen as being
the main obstacle – aligning with Kling’s notion of computerization movements:
uncooperative people are seen as barriers to the new technology. Much of the remaining
efforts of the grant are then targeted to removing these obstacles or addressing these
barriers.
5. Connecting with more powerful “Others” outside the Vulnerable Community: One of the
enduring findings from examining the project evaluations as well as the scholarly
literature, is that these projects themselves offer fertile ground for building “bridging

213

social capital,” enabling members of the vulnerable community to connect with others
who are often affiliated with more powerful or better-resourced institutions. Rather than
simply being tangential artifacts or inconsequential by-products of the project that make
funders and the project team “feel good,” this enabling of connections may, in fact, be the
most promising key to “vulnerable community transformation.” If not directly and
immediately within the current project, perhaps later as the project morphs and evolves
into new forms. An overlooked aspect of this, however, is the notion that perhaps the
more powerful or well-resourced could benefit from the vulnerable community as well;
bridging social capital works both ways.
6. Overlooking locally-defined impacts: Opportunities are missed, or perhaps deliberately
not established, for identifying impacts that the Vulnerable Community itself would like
to achieve, and being realistic about where it is currently. Many communities already
have, for example, strategic plans and baseline and ongoing data that have been compiled
by other service agencies. Rather than reinventing the wheel, why are these already
existing data not incorporated into grant efforts – at the start, during, and after the grant
ends?
7. Repeating the cycle: Despite explicit directions from funders to show evidence of needs
assessment and local community involvement, the cycle starts over with the same
observed phenomena regarding vulnerable communities.
Implications about vulnerable community theory.
It is the pattern of use and abuse of vulnerable communities, often by the same players, that
erodes trust and ability to effect change in these communities. This cycle needs to be broken. But
how? The main remedy is to change the reward structure. Institutions are incentivized to get
grants – free money for doing often fun things that leads to further rewards, such as publications,
commercial products, and fame. When institutions (and certain individuals within them)
repeatedly abuse, or fail to really serve, the vulnerable communities they purport to serve, they
should be penalized, for a period, by being denied the ability to receive, or possible even pursue,
the grants that enable them to keep on reaping these rewards. And those institutions that do
illustrate evidence of positive inclusion of vulnerable communities should be rewarded for doing
so by continuing to receive grants, and being allowed to continue to pursue those grants. Under
the current system, there is no visibility of level of vulnerable community involvement in the
grant process. There needs to be some kind of assessment and indicator for this – not unlike a
credit score. Coming up with an algorithm for this is beyond the scope of this dissertation, but
remains a fruitful area for future research. In the grant selection process, there should be some
weighting for these factors. And then “success” could be predicted and measured, based on the
accuracy of the Vulnerable Community scores.
It’s important to point out that institutions, and the individuals within them, may not be
cognizant of the vulnerable community theory derived from this research. After all, all of us
believe we’re doing good works. Academics have worked long and hard to become experts in
their respective fields, and this expertise is not to be discounted or undermined. Businesses have
likewise worked long and hard and at great expense, often under very competitive conditions.
But the evidence from this research on community networks is clear – interventions at the
community level WILL NOT yield the positive impacts hoped for by the tax paying public if the

214

vulnerable community itself, or at least a credible representative of that community, has no real
say throughout ALL stages of the project – from before it starts until long after it ends.
What are some ways to engage vulnerable communities? Ironically, academics and businesses
have, at their disposal, the most effective ways to do this. Every vulnerable community or
population has individuals within it who are talented or gifted in some way. But they have not
been noticed or presented with the opportunities to connect to something bigger. [discuss concept
of “vulnerable community champion”] Some of these individuals may already be participating
actively in some way within their community – often in a low-paying or volunteer position. Or it
may be a promising high school student who has given up hope in attending college. Academics
should strive to identify such promising students and cultivate them to become college students,
perhaps levying the grant funding to help support their education, supplemented by other means
through the university. Businesses should likewise strive to identify promising employees from
among the vulnerable community. Mentoring new students or employees from the vulnerable
community might be an appropriate outcome from grant projects. It is through connecting these
vulnerable community champions with more powerful institutions that positive individual
transformation, if not full vulnerable community transformation, can occur [discuss concept of
“vulnerable community transformation”]. And it may be that the obvious champions are
already in powerful or influential positions – either within the vulnerable community (such as
director of a hospital or bank) or elsewhere (such as the governor of a state who hails from the
vulnerable community). These kinds of champions might lead the community networking effort
or serve as a high level sponsor, helping the vulnerable community navigate through social
and/or political waters.
The Spin-Off Effect [Spin-Off not Sustainability as the goal]: Another important conclusion
is that sustainability of the network forged by the grant-funded project is not necessarily the right
outcome. One of the great things about our federalist system is the potential for experimentation
at the state or regional level. Many of these community networking projects were just that –
experiments. The greatest contribution of many of the networks forged or strengthened as a
result of TOP funding may, in fact, be their own dissolution – only to have their products taken
over by another entity or coalition. Future research would do well to capture this phenomenon as
well – that of measuring the spin-off impact of funding experiments. The proper unit of analysis
should be the vulnerable community that served as the intended beneficiary – not the community
network as an institution. Recognizing and resisting the artificial “iron cage” forces of
institutionalization (Dimaggio & Powell) that are often built-in to grants under the guise of
“sustainability,” while embracing the process of natural selection (survival of the fittest,
recognizing that adaptation can and should occur), might yield more positive outcomes for
vulnerable communities.

Future research.
• Natural Language Processing: There are clues embedded within the evaluations for
identify each phase of the vulnerable community grant funding phenomena. These clues
come in the form of keywords. In future research, I plan to develop employ a machine
learning approach to train how to identify when these phases occur. For example,
occurrence of the word “originally” often signifies a Phase 3: Startup change.
• Visualization:
Validation.
The notion of vulnerable communities resonates with my own experience as a community
networking champion. I helped found two community networks back in the mid-1990s. The first
community network was from a county adjacent to the state capital where I happened to live
when the World Wide Web and Mosaic were launched. My community was selected as one of
three communities in the state to try out this new thing called “The Internet” – for free. The
second community network was where I moved to about a year later – in a remote region of the
state, a sparsely populated county with low per capita income and little or no political clout at the
state capital 3 hours away. When I moved to this community and fairly quickly became a
champion of pursuing community network funding for the community, one of the complaints
expressed by local residents was that the county’s demographics of poverty were often used by
others in order to get grants that benefit someone else. The local board of directors I had
assembled in order to pursue the grant very quickly decided that the community network grant
we were pursuing would be to serve ONLY the one county. This is a decision I disagreed with at
the time, since I thought more could be accomplished if the county kept the door open for
collaborating with other nearby counties. However, now, with the benefit of this research, I see
that these very real concerns of the local population were indeed quite valid. Collaboration under
the best of circumstances is quite challenging. And collaboration between unequal partners can
often leave the less powerful partners out in the cold.
The notion of vulnerable communities also resonates with my experience in assisting faculty and
graduate students in pursuing research grants. Many RFPs require that researchers address the
216

notion of “broader impacts” or “diversity.” I have found that academics seem to be totally
stumped at how to do this. Most often, they will resort to very general phrases such as “efforts
will be made to engage students or participants from diverse backgrounds,” without going into
either more specifics about the diverse population to be reached, or how to “engage” the
population if outreach is successful. This lack of ability to conceive of why and how to build
bridging social capital between the, ostensibly more powerful academic, and the less
powerful/resourced “other” from a vulnerable community is rather alarming and frustrating to
me. After all, I consider myself to be one of those “others,” having come from a
socioeconomically disadvantaged family in the rural Midwest. But what I did have was parents
and grandparents who were highly educated, so I knew I would be going to college. My peers
often did not have that advantage. With education as the great equalizer, and having been a direct
beneficiary myself of this effect, one of my driving passions has been to figure out how to reach
rural America and pluck out the most promising candidates for higher education. With no
institutions of higher learning nearby, rural children don’t grow up thinking about this as an
option. And with no rural communities nearby, the academic elite don’t seem to have any real
awareness of the hidden gems of very bright and talented potential students that grow up never
darkening the door of a college.
With institutions of higher education often as key partners, the great community networking
experiments that have been fostered by TOP, and now BTOP, have had the potential to help
forge this connection between rural communities and academia. I want to see how well they’ve
done, and figure out ways to improve this.
Memo 4: Problem Identification
Stage 1: Grant Qualification: Identifying problem or need & population/community  is this a
VC?
Identifying vulnerable communities in order to leverage grant funding.
This memo expands and explores the first step in the grant process: qualifying to apply for a
grant by articulating a problem or need, and identifying a population or community that is
intended to benefit from the grant. The analytical task here is to ascertain whether or not the
targeted beneficiary might be considered a vulnerable community (VC) – and what the properties
of a VC might be. My suspicion is that the identifying of a specific VC is seen as more likely to
attract grant funding. Some VCs are more likely to attract grant funding than others. Good
examples of VCs would be anything New Orleans or Harlem.
Questions guiding further data collection to flesh out properties & dimensions of this concept
include:
• What specific populations or communities are identified in the projects?
• (of lesser concern here) What are their identified needs and problems to be addressed?
• Is there any evidence/intuition that the specified populations or communities are likely to
often/repeatedly be targeted for intervention?
• What are the properties that might differentiate a VC from some other intended
beneficiary (non-VC)? Delineate cases according to this concept.

Some project beneficiary descriptions appear to “assume” disadvantage. For example,
Mobile CHIN serves the Mobile, Alabama area, which is assumed to be disadvantaged
due to socioeconomics; whereas the Western Brokering Project covering 15 western
states assumes a disadvantage due to vast distances of these spaces.

The notion of “disadvantage” is kind of an umbrella catch-all. Projects like 1) Kentucky’s
Rural Urban Net lump together urban poor of Louisville with remote rural Pike County,
and 2) Ohio’s rural Appalachian and urban minority populations
Most projects purport to serve the disadvantaged indirectly by providing technology to
organizations that are already set up to serve the disadvantaged. Such organizations,
presumably, should already have metrics in place to measure their success. [Question] Is
anyone capturing baseline and ongoing data from these organizations? Or is it always
collected “new,” specific to the TOP project?
I notice that the word “underserved” seems to be synonymous with “disadvantaged.” I
may need to explore this a little further, and refine if necessary.
Palo Alto has vivid description of the digital divide – Silicon Valley execs & professors
vs. East Palo Alto diversity. See p. 4. Reminds of the Fort Wayne BB conference – the
problem facing urban planners is what to do with the servants? Don’t want them too
close, but they need to be close enough in order to work for the elite. Added new
Property for whether a specific contrasting Digital Divide Community is described.
Other indicators of “disadvantage,” but that likely co-occur with low SES: high
unemployment, high crime, and low access to technology & Internet both at home and in
school (Baltimore).
Present how many provide indirect to agencies. Shows a big difference between my lit
review and the empirical data, I think.
Might be good to add whether or not VC input was included prior to the grant.
Berkeley specifically mentions “lack of opportunities” – provides a good quote. Oregon
addresses “brain drain” of rural, formerly prosperous regions in changing industry –
causing lack of employment opportunities locally. This underlying notion of “lack of
employment opportunity” is a good one as the united reason for disadvantage that TOP
aims to address. Coos Bay, OR: Brain drain due to industry loss; increasing elderly &
Native American; lack of employment; high poverty & unemployment; limited access to
computers at home; limited access to technology and other educational resources in
schools; great distances between communities; fewer opportunities for teacher
professional development and collaboration.
Austin points out a new angle of being disadvantaged – not valuing poor people’s time;
with the proposed solution of making info available online that would help alleviate that.
Austin vs. East Austin: "intent of leveling the playing field in computer and Internet
access and skills with other neighborhoods in Austin."
Vivid description of health care underserved area in Washington Virginia Mason
Separate out what is truly a characteristic of the population (e.g., low SES) vs. an
institutional causal factor (e.g., industry loss). These may indicate continued
victimization of VCs. For remedy, new jobs don’t need to be high pay – just enough to
support living in the specific community. Allow people to choose with their feet.
Method of reaching: Direct to (vulnerable) community members or Indirect to teachers,
health care providers, etc.
New Orleans Freenet & Baltimore: do all low SES have the same characteristics?: High
Unemployment; Low Per Capita; High Crime; High Illiteracy; Low graduation; Low
Computer & Internet Access at Home; Low Computer & Internet Access at School; low
per-pupil expenditures – addressing these individually, even tracking them doesn’t make
things better. The bigger thing in common, across both remote/rural and
219

•

urban/poor/ethnic is “lack of employment opportunities locally.” Is this ever defined as
being the very description of “disadvantaged” – lack of local (within commuting distance
& means of transport), decent paying jobs? It is THAT claim of IT to make people jobready AND to connect them to actual jobs that is at the heart of CNs. Part of the poor get
poorer. Coos Bay Oregon describes issues well – industry loss.
BizPathways in MN: good description of shifting economy; how capture people who are
working, just not making as much (low commodity prices)

Future.
• A consistent theme is “turf” (see NERIN project – precursor to 211), and the related
notion that all partners need to get something out of the project – and this needs to be
clearly communicated. Note: This is a great example of a seed project that led to
significant outcomes, but probably didn’t get credit. I need to call these out – as a group.
Needs to be another stage in the process about Remnants (Spin-Offs). The notion of spinoffs ties in with Sawhney, and with my previous work on islands of innovation –
T610/paper2.doc. – do a map of these “islands” (the projects in the study). Also mention
Vannevar Bush.
• Another good word is “organic” (see Palo Alto): “The organization is very organic and
has always worked in an iterative manner, ever changing to meet the needs of the
community and its own longevity.” (p3) Is “artificial” the opposite of organic? “strained
relations among the main partner organizations… largely due to shared goals but
different strategies, and while these issues were never fully understood, nor were they
resolved,” (Austin) is a consistent theme to be followed up on. (Problem, Founder,
Partners, Product/Solution, Barriers, Successes, Lessons Learned).
• Note: When describing these projects, I might want to leave off the actual product and
call it “x,” in order to keep the focus on the community intended to benefit, since that’s
my actual unit of analysis or topic of interest. This will also allow for more abstraction.
Or, might it be an important variable to consider when crafting the theory – that the
“type” of service provided makes a difference in project success, as defined by
community transformation? My hunch is that the product angle has been covered
adequately by others, since it’s the technological one that everyone was looking at (sexy).
• Maybe a good indicator for likely success of a grant might be the number of times a
particular community has been exploited for grant purposes. I’m not sure which way this
would go – a good or bad thing?
• Is this tendency for repeating VCs similar to the “disease model” of our health care
system? Because we’re based on capitalism, we have to treat everything as a commodity,
and therefore, there must be a set of consumers for everything. We need to keep certain
communities “sick” so that there will always be a market for technological innovations.
Just as there need to be sick people to consume medical treatments that have been
developed. Toward that end, add a step about Product in the cycle. Then describe that as
part of step 1: Idea. It would capture both the primary initiator (not necessarily the
awardee?) and the product developed/conceived of. This model makes complete sense,
since this is a DOC grant. The issue comes when the model “harms” a VC, as opposed to
just “failing to transform in a positive manner” or “leave no trace” (Boy Scouts) or “harm
none” (Hippocrates?). For example, in the case of the Johns Hopkins professor who is
called as an expert witness in coal miner black lung claims, he is actually harming the VC

– and likely exploiting them as well. http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/black-lunginvestigation-johns-hopkins-full-statement/story?id=20714454 This is how they pay for
medical students – by providing expert testimony! So it’s not just the evil militaryindustrial complex, it’s the educational-industrial complex. There’s a “sin tax” for the
exploitation – but note that it does not go back to the VC to support a scholarship for
someone coming from a mine family. VCs are experimented on with regard to consuming
new products (technology). Successful products are marketed to/in more profitable areas.
Undesirable products disappear. Necessary but risky products (like coal) are produced by
the VC. Frame it as a market cycle.
Interstate Highway 35 literally separates East Austin from the rest of the city. [is there a lack
of bus routes? Example of structural separation – other side of the tracks]. WVa project also
uses highway to define target area.
Emerging categories of Barriers (disadvantaged): 1) (socio)Economic, 2) Geographic
Future: Impacting success: 1) “lack of referrals the project received from the counties” (WVa
Fairmount) – what would this be called? Not invented here? Falls under partnering?, 2) long
delays experienced in connecting a student to the center via ISDN lines (the word “delay”
keeps coming up

Lane Oregon Council of Governments – flow of important decisions could affect “positive
change” – language of transformation – look for this via NLP
Emerging categories of Disadvantaged: Physical, Geographic (remote vs. rural), Economic,
Institutional? In need of special services (home-bound students; medically home-bound; INS:
in need of services, like the addicted or AIDS);; In legal trouble. Look at what works and
what doesn’t for each category.

Memo 5: Partnerships
Stage 2: Partnerships: Assembling a project team from conception, write-up, start-up, throughout
the project, and beyond  To what extent is the VC included?
Assembling partners ostensibly to address the needs of the vulnerable communities.
This memo expands and explores the second step in the grant process: assembling partners who
can address the identified problem or need facing the population or community that is intended
to benefit from the grant. The analytical task here is to ascertain to what extent the targeted
beneficiary or vulnerable community (VC) is involved in the actual project team make-up
throughout the process – from when the grant idea is first conceived, the proposal is written, the
project starts up, during implementation, and for the future. My suspicion is that if the VC is
included at all, it is only during the write-up and perhaps at start-up. But along the way, there
will be little evidence that a true collaboration between the VC and other partners exists AND
that what was there got dropped – either immediately or as the project went on. My suspicion is
221

that this will be especially true of remote, rural VCs, since the “last mile” problems are often the
hardest in Internet access projects.
Questions guiding further data collection to flesh out properties & dimensions of this concept
include:
• What specific partners are identified in the projects?
• What partnerships exhibit the most durability – prior to and after the grant period?
• What mention is there of the VC with regard to partnering?
• What changes occur throughout the grant cycle – particularly with regard to the VC?

be a synonym for my notion of a VC. What is their real purpose or how do they really

more well-off. But perhaps this is how change occurs – one community at a time thru
highly concentrated effort and the pouring of resources?
21-60-99034 & 22-40-94079 illustrate a different kind of Prior Relationship, which I’ll
call “Solidify.” These are when efforts to form a partnership have been in motion and the
TOP grant is used as one more way to try to get the partnership “solidified.” This is in
contrast to partnerships that are “Existing-Expanded.” These (like El Puente & Plugged
In) have been in place for a while, and are using TOP to go in new directions, enhanced
existing programs, or serve more/different clients [may need to parse this down more]. I
think the key thing to look at is the nature of efforts to solidify or expand – the degree to
which the effort is related to the existing relationship. For example, Metro Chicago was
an attempt to provide a shared network to strengthen efforts between NFPs that already
referred clients to each other. My suspicion is that this would be well-received and likely
to endure – IF it is successful as a result of the TOP grant. If not, then Metro Chicago
might not continue to exist, but the attempt to strengthen that connection might go on. So
this would be an Architectural Choice Point – to use Kling’s vernacular.
What’s emerging then is a decision tree:
o 1) existing relationship: a) no, b) emergent/being forged, c) already in place,
 2) if yes, is TOP grant a) reinforcing or b) changing that relationship;
 if no, proceed
Now, what is the impact of changes to the original grant? These things, I suspect, always
wind up undermining the ability of the VC to benefit. This might be a way to define a VC
– one that is negatively impacted by the change. There is an emerging typology of
changes. Let’s see how prevalent they seem to be.
o 3) were Changes made to TOP grant: If yes, what type
A measurable, or at least identifiable, OUTCOME for TOP projects is whether or not
partnerships will continue – whether or not in their current form (often not).
o 4) Outcome (prospects for future continued partnering – as opposed to

24-40-9604 Middle Schools: is it always the pattern that schools don’t take input from
community beforehand? Just not part of the culture? Or possibly product of Dept of
Ed/universities? That might be worth investigating in future research. What ARE they
teaching education grads? More importantly, what AREN’T they teaching? Will we see
the same thing with university-led projects – no community involvement in planning?
But some nominal community engagement upon award – only with regard to the how to
implement the money in the pre-design fashion rather than whether or not the proposal
served the needs as seen by the community. This is an example of an aggressive,
comprehensive, and enduring approach for addressing a VC. What are the results? Are
lives actually changed? Is anyone looking at that? Or is this just a way to benefit
partners?
Notion of existing ties: broaden (taken on new ventures/directions between existing
partners), deepen (strengthen existing ties through enhanced communication), solidify

25-60-95018: Neat concept – NFP Chamber spin-off dedicated to improving the schools.
Invoking support of local schools is a winning fundraising tool.
St. Louis MORENET (29-40-94083) has the best, more unique VC solutions – which
are consistently undermined. See VC Involvement. Shows that somehow these need to be
flagged and sustained thru special effort. Identify these throughout projects. It’s not
necessarily the partners that seek to undermine, it’s the broader context that is driven by
economics. Somehow these projects need to show their outcomes better! When
something works, highlight it, replicate it, publicize it, and politicize it! It’s this
connection with politicians that seems to NEVER be mentioned. Watch for this. In
looking at VC definition, it would be one often used as a magnet for experimental efforts
– only to be disappointed when the funding (or the spotlight) ends.
St Louis WhizKids shows how community input can catalyze positive change in how
grant funds are used, demonstrable measurable results at individual level. Many positive
lessons learned that may be generalizable to VCs. How many kids actually got jobs?
KC SmartCities changed to facilitate partnerships focused on job creation leveraging
tech. Great model! 1) hire project director from telecom (ATT). 2) The planning trip to
Singapore got the focus right – 3) on welfare-to-work apps, not the infrastructure itself.
Replicable! But – how are VCs incorporated explicitly? 4) Indirectly – thru the
organizations (NFPs, foundations, higher ed) that serve them – all with focus on work. 5)
Decides to forego the “last mile” problem. So this model requires an economic focus –
high impact – focus on 80%—get the jobs in, then that will lift up the people. How is
transport addressed? By bringing jobs into inner city – with Sprint! So also DIRECT
benefit to VC. As training was held in a suburban location, it would have been difficult
for employees to arrange transportation. The Full Employment Council (FEC) provided
transportation to and from training until the 18th and Vine Center opened in 1997.
Employment results (after 6 months, 85% welfare recipients remaining on job than 33%
suburban recruits – over 300 went thru MCC call center training) suggest that, if done
right (overcome the barriers of transport, child care, aptitude assessment fees, job
readiness skills training & re-training), creating jobs for the poor can really work because
they’ll stay with it! Had a good title (SmartCities), simple goal "to be and be known as
the best place in the country to do business electronically,” building on existing strengths
of partners, and excellent focused business leadership. This was an example where a
complete turnabout between proposal and implementation worked out for the better! I
suspect it’s important, as these projects are formed, to consider pre-,during, and postrelationship planning. These should not be seen as isolated one-offs, formed for
immediate gain, but for long-term investment. The extent to which that appears to be the
vision is a likely factor in success. Now, how to get the powerful to invest in VCs – looks
like indirect coalition building, with a plan for direct job creation, is a great way to go.
Choices Bank: some hypos had baseline data; others didn’t.
InterLinc: staff asked to take over existing NebraskaNet, run by public TV which had to
stop due to laws (supposedly). This was kind of weird. Also, villages seemed resistant
and did not embrace public use of tech provided. Public access to the system led to some
misuses. Sites were broken into and terminals were stolen.
Nebworks is classic example of minimizing the inability to reach difficult populations

and “assuming” that there will be a halo effect – in some way (black box) the efforts
made will have a positive impact, but we don’t know exactly how many, how, when, or
in what way. Why was $10,000 spent on IT reference materials for remote areas? Salt on
the wound – can’t ever have internet access, so we’ll let you read about it?
TVN: The disconnect between the project staff and the intended beneficiaries appears to
be so big, and I couldn’t figure out who the partners were, that I looked up the original
abstract. “The University of New Mexico's Arts of the Americas Institute will work with
a consortium of Native American communities to provide broadband Internet
connectivity to five tribal museums and culture centers.” Yet even with such a narrow
focus, they were unable to find broad interest in workshops claiming: “some
…workshops were seen as relevant to only particular sites.” There was no effort to fill 2
vacant positions with or train tribal members as technical backup. This indicates a
“missed opportunity” – another potential useful concept in my emerging theory. And why
on earth did they send consortium members for AG training in Chicago using software,
equipment, and Internet they didn’t have back in their home communities? Blame it on
the VC (very Kling & computerization movements): “Concerning the lack of time
[barrier], UNM TVN staff expressed that it is likely that consortium members have not
assimilated the technology and training into their duties…and…may not have an
adequate vision for the future use of the technology.” It’s funny to see the “positive spin”
[another potentially useful concept] put on this (and others) by the evaluators by
providing one-off instances of use as the closing argument.
Issue of analysis NYCHANIS: web-server data do not indicate number of housing and
community development organizations have used NYCHANIS, making it impossible to
determine how close NYCHANIS came to its goal of serving 50 organizations during its
first year of operation. [another potentially useful concept] Evaluation Tactic: setting a
goal that is, in reality, unable to be measured. [in doing web search for NYCHANIS, I
found out Furman has replaced it, but concept remains – indicating potentially good use
of funds and a positive outcome]. This is an example of “stick to the knitting”—“more
success as a searchable Internet-based data resource with graphing and mapping
capabilities. Has attracted non-employment related users – personal interest. This might
be a “citizen scientist” sort of phenomenon – but rather “data scientist.” Points to
connection between unequals.
ParenthoodPlus (Brandeis): concurrence of participant enrollment with web application
development – a very familiar refrain that the emphasis on the constantly changing
technology detracted from other tasks that would directly support intended beneficiaries.
“The Fund for the City of New York deserves credit for integrating the strengths and
objectives of other, related, projects…in recriprocally beneficial ways...” – this quote gets
at what DOES work – using technology to integrate fragmented efforts. This is part of an
umbrella project. Picks from families who’ve already taken steps to improve. See p. 19
for example of creative program with books & training youth. Training youth to learn
valuable skills seems to be a special highlight of TOP projects. Very thoughtful,
thorough, and well-written report & implications. Draws upon prior Westat evaluations.
Harlem Juvenile Information Network mentions a “Systems of Care” model. Also
suggests the distinction between formative (short-term) and summative (longer-term)

a visual representation of how the NII was fleshing out as a result of these projects.
35-60-01068 TVN appears to be one of the worst types of partnerships – predicated on an
“object of study” model by a research institution. A partnership between a university and
another organization shares a “common population of interest”
NetWellness: Novel: In an attempt to institutionalize NetWellness within the UCMC
community, UCMC education staff have incorporated NetWellness training into four
ongoing medical informatics courses. Maintaining solid communications with partners
was reported to be the most critical and difficult aspect of the NetWellness project,
especially because the partners were extremely varied and geographically dispersed (p.
15).
36-40-94057 HEAP Harlem: similar to MS project, Columbia had bad relationship with
community, which was overcome because of this grant – especially its successor. Is this
because the tech is so compelling? But what really happened is that the goose laying the
golden egg was the schools. The bigger Eiffel project was funded by Dept of Ed.
Environmental Defense Fund & Libraries were dropped (or dropped off) as partners.
There is an acknowledgement of need for legitimacy.

Discussion.
• Show different patterns of project team formation and use that for coding: spoke & wheel;
solid tube (all equal); hierarchy; then show formation & deformation over time (pre-, post-,
close).
• Something I want to keep hold of is the notion that it’s often not the specific projects that
should be sustained, rather it’s 1) the organizations that run them (project owner) or 2) the
websites that are generated as part of the project (sub-project). Grant-funded projects are a
way for organizations to demonstrate their value, gain valuable experience, and perhaps
expand or modify their existing services as a result. Alternatively, a component website may
serve as a lasting legacy for a larger project. An example is clinchpowell.net (TN), the
website for 47-60-99041’s Tele-Democracy Network. The website still exists, but since it
was just part of the larger project, I might have missed the longevity, while searching for
something about the broader effort.
• I wonder if there’s any predictability between Founder Type & Partner Type, such as like +
like is more likely to endure vs. like + unlike. What is it about the nature of these lasting,
enduring partnerships (sustained), as a positive OUTCOME, that helps them accomplish
great things – particularly for disadvantaged communities. Perhaps compare those in
existence prior and those without prior. Look at type of goal, similarity of founder & partner
“type,” evidence of hiring from within the VC, founder, or partner. Is that less overhead is
spent on things like negotiating contracts, changing things up? So another OUTCOME is
“degree to which VC is served or benefits.” Separate that out from any other outcome.

Questions.
• So, what are the real aims of US Dept of Commerce NTIA?
• How is success defined?
• Be sure to plot projects by year
• Does the number of cases change when plot the two different batches of years
• Is the actual important factor whether the Awardee and/or One Partner have a successful
track record of serving the VC?
More musings.
• “Token” communities, like token blacks (similar to the history of affirmative action, hiring).
To make them not be a token, you give them a role. In some cases, VCs appear to be
beneficiaries only in order to get the grant; they are “token” communities in the sense that
they are beneficiaries in name only, without having played any actual part at any stage of the
grant process – from project design, thru implementation & evaluation. There is this notion
that some awardees will only possibly get the grant if they serve vulnerable communities;
however, if they have no successful track record or mission of serving vulnerable
communities, isn’t that risky and likely to fail? Who are they bringing on board that DOES
already serve the VC? The VC is simply an attractor of the funding; as soon as the funding is
received, the impetus to serve the VC is gone.
• I’m starting to see a sea change in my attitude about what’s most likely to lead to positive
community transformation – it’s not the connection of unequal partners as I originally
surmised (although that may be a useful and/or necessary second step); it’s the support of
organizations that are already doing good works, but who need recognition and further
support to maintain – let alone to keep advancing (expand) – and even innovate. It’s the
institutional partnership (or at least of one influential person within the partnership), and its
understanding of and commitment to the VC, that matters most. Without that necessary
condition, other efforts will come to nothing. This may actually be the same thing as the
unequal partners idea, just framed a bit differently.
• I think the lesson is inertia. At whatever level, whether awardee or individual, the change has
to already be in motion. Parenthood Plus worked because it was an individual intervention
targeted at mothers who wanted, and had already made a choice, to make a positive change.
KC SmartCities worked because it was community-wide intervention targeted at a
community that had a vision for being the best – and that recognized to do that, you have to
invest at all levels, and work on integrating rather than trying to become the be all and end
all.
• It’s important to turn the lens onto the institutional arrangements – the partners and their
inherent knowledge and proven commitment to the VC. This is very social informatics vs.
techno utopianism.
• All this can be wrapped into a concluding chapter about Broader Impacts.
• Important things to look at with partnership: what’s the common link between the founder
and the partners? For example, some are competitors (esp higher ed), some are connected via
the founder (eg LA-Freenet).
• In looking at the Common Links, it appears that the strongest is when the primary
constituency (clients) is the same. This would explain why university-led efforts that include

VCs have a hard time being sustained. Universities see their primary clients as college-age
students that can come from anywhere, rather than seeing any need to “cultivate” students
from the surrounding K-12 areas. Or at least the extent to which universities see that
connection will, in my emerging theory, play a role in determining success of their efforts.
The distance between university and community is even further when you understand that for
many universities, research, rather than education, is deemed most important; this limits
shared constituency only to the best and brightest graduate students.
QUEST (25-60-95018) is interesting because it illustrates the pull between Workforce Needs
and the powerful K-12 institutions who see the students as exclusively their domain. K-12
winds up likely to be the ones sustaining the effort. 28-40-94068 illustrates another
struggle/conflict K-12 vs. EconDev over the workforce.
This notion of workforce development is very important – and probably at the very heart of
TOP. Also important is the notion of competition – for control, for resources, for students. In
recommendations, we should look at incentives for collaboration among like-minded
institutions.
And is workforce the strongest type of client? Workforce implies both supply side (a trainee
or student) and a demand side (a business or employer). It may be that the extent that this
equation is part of a proposed project team pursuing a grant is the holy grail – the most
important predictor of success of a community ICT effort! Can I glean that from these data?
Need to add columns for Supply/Demand Level & Success Level (likelihood of sustaining
the partnership). For example, what may be missing in 09-40-94002 LEAP NY youth is no
connection with the demand side. It is when there’s a buyer (or someone to pay for things)
that keeps a coalition together. “Greed is good.” Well, rather, self-interest—at least to a
point. You’ve got to have some tangible incentive for sticking together and sustaining
partnerships – grants and jobs will do it!
The lack of business connections in the NY STEW-MAP project demonstrates a traditional
weakness in the ultimate effectiveness of nonprofits. If networks would include employers,
they would be greatly strengthened.
It appears that the links that are solely based on geography (eg, 28-40-94068 Tri-StateNetwork in AL) are the projects least likely to succeed. Place alone is not strong enough a
binder or call to action. 28-40-94068 in particular seems to be way too fragmented, with econ
dev in charge in name only.
The big players in local communities seem to be K-12 and economic development.
It’s a shame that no individual names are ever mentioned in these projects. I know that
behind each one of them is a person who has poured their soul into this. It’s funny that
academics, the ones who do the evaluations and publish papers, are the only ones who ever
get any credit! I suspect the leaving out of names has to do with attempts to protect
confidentiality, when it’s really publicity that can most help these efforts.
The goal should be to sustain the partnership, not necessarily the specific project. This would
eliminate a lot of the waste that currently goes on! The way current funding goes,
“innovation” is taken to mean new partners, new clients, etc. Instead, it should be new ways
of current partners expanding the things they offer, to whom, and in what ways. This era of
newness for the Internet was a “boom” period. And like other booms before it, too many
things were funded that shouldn’t have been. These led to “bubbles” and “busts.” Those
should be avoided.
Should also look at how well the organization is currently serving its constituents before
giving them a grant. (normative)

228

Community input would probably be – JOBS! And the skills to get real jobs. And a removal
of the barriers to get to the real jobs.
• The two things that will enhance sustainability, both related to money: consumers &
workforce. The sequence (where is communication – ICT specifically):
1. There must be an understanding that there is a connection between learning & consuming
(learning skills  locally available jobs  consuming)
2. There must be jobs that require certain skills
3. There must be no physical/geographic barriers to obtaining those jobs
4. There must be a clear pathway for obtaining the skills for the available jobs
5. There must be a mechanism for connecting people with jobs
6. There should be something desirable to consume
The big changes with Internet: jobs are available locally via computer, but must have the skills &
access/connection to get them
An important thing to keep in mind if I’m trying to develop a theory related to writing a
sustainable grant that impacts vulnerable communities is “what are the goals of the funder.” In
this case, all data tend to support the need for the grant to have partners that will enable
achievement of the economic development goals that one would expect from a DOC grant.
However, for an NEH grant, the goals, and thus the partners required to achieve sustainability,
might be quite different. But, would VCs be enhanced by such grants, or is there a Maslow’s
Needs Hierarchy thing going on here – first cover the basics of food, clothing, and shelter that
need to be achieved thru economic means.

Categories.
Maybe I should look at partnership type (network) categories of:
• Service
• Research
• Employment
• Geography
• Personal
• Consumer
This might be a useful typology for grantsmakers to use in order to more narrowly target their RFPs
– eg allocate so many for each type and experiment with outcomes & sustainability.
Memo 6: Summary of Progress-to-Date
I thought I would take a moment to describe how I’ve executed my grounded theory study so far,
and where it’s taken me. I started out by going thru four case studies line-by-line, pulling out
quotes and analyzing them for Concepts, Properties, and Dimensions, while also taking notes of
insights, items of interest, and possible future directions. The information for these four cases
was captured in four separate “Data Memos.” A general rule of thumb for me: For every page
written in a Data Memo, it took me about one hour of review of the case. I created an Excel
spreadsheet, and captured all the Concepts, Properties, and Dimensions gleaned from the four
cases.
At this point, I re-read the final chapters of Corbin and Strauss, and went back to review and
ponder the contents of these data memos. On 10/26/13, I created a “Process Memo” for capturing
the various Themes or Categories that seemed to be present in the cases. Thinking about
229

Corbin’s notion of “process,” it occurred to me that the process of interest to me for this study is
that of “the grant process” – in particular how “vulnerable communities” are used to attract
funding and then often do not benefit from the results of the funding that is brought in. On
10/27/13, I created another process memo where I started breaking down this notion of
vulnerable communities and the grant process into stages. I’m seeing the “vulnerable
communities” notion as a substantive theory, whereas the “grant process” is a more formal
theory that might be applicable to more than just the vulnerable communities as defined by the
digital divide problem.
On 10/30, I went back to the separate cases (63 of them), to identify properties and dimensions
related to the Step 1 concept of “Identifying populations or communities in need.” I was able to
break this concept down into properties of “Method of Reaching,” “Disadvantaged Type,” and
“Digital Divide Comparison.” Another property that I’m still pondering is that of “Institutional
Causes of Disadvantage.” And I’m still deciding whether or not the explicit notion of
“vulnerable communities” that are repeatedly used to attract grant funding is a useful concept. It
took several days to go thru the cases to code them all along these dimensions. However, I’m
mindful that the purpose of my study is to generate theory, not to test it. So quantifying the 63
cases along each of these dimensions is not my primary aim. Rather, I’m trying to ensure
saturation – that I’ve identified all the potential properties and dimensions for the concepts of
interest.
On 11/5, I modified my Excel spreadsheet to start capturing all of the phases of my emerging
vulnerable communities grants process, with the intent of starting to code all the cases of Step 2:
Assembling the project team. This will have to do with how partners are pulled together – and
specifically the inclusion (or not) of the vulnerable community or VC – the community or
population intended to benefit from the grant – whether directly or indirectly.
Memo 7: Theoretical Sampling Strategy
I’ve been looking in-depth at evaluations for some time now, mainly focusing on the first two
steps of the “grants process”: identifying the population and assembling the team. Specifically,
I’ve uncovered that there seems to be a disconnect between plans laid out in the original
proposal, specifically with regard to vulnerable communities—not only the outcomes, but also
the final project team and its goals. These change as the project encounters seemingly
insurmountable barriers in “reaching” (which can mean many things) the vulnerable community.
Project method.
One variable that I codified for each evaluation was whether the project was direct or indirect
(Project Method), defined roughly as:
• Direct: to be used directly by or directly benefits individual citizens or a specific
population
• Indirect: to be used by or directly enhances operations of organizations who serve the
citizens or a specific population
Difference or change in planned & actual with regard to vulnerable community.

230

Another variable I feel I need to codify for all cases is the level of disconnect with regard to
specific population to benefit between what was proposed and what was observed in the
evaluation. It is those cases in which a specific disadvantaged population was identified that are
of analytical interest to me. These can then be broken down based on the extent to which the
original proposal abstract and evaluation seem to be congruent with regard to intended
beneficiary. What is important here is not as much whether the intended benefits to the VC
materialized (since we already know that results are dismal) but the extent to which intended
benefits to the VC remained in the foreground.
Specifically, I’ll be looking for indicators of expected results (proposal) and actual results
(evaluation) – for the specific population. This is one indicator of significant CHANGE: VC
Intended Benefits Congruence (between Proposal Abstract & Evaluation). Here are the types:
1. High – Intentions toward VC in proposal were pursued as described (although results
may not have been satisfactory or as expected)
2. Mixed – some of the intended benefits were dropped, but some were actively pursued
3. Low (omitted) – no mention was made of intended benefits to VC in evaluation (omitted)
4. None (overtly removed) – VC was removed (when or why?)
Nature of partnership.
Another item of interest is in the TYPE of partnership itself. Why was this particular partnership
formed? What do they have in common? Is there a way to look at this as monolithic (single org)[not of interest to me], vertical (intra/within geog) or horizontal (inter/between geospaces)? Here
are the Partnership Types so far (can be more than one?):
• Geographic
o Same region, city, or even Co-location (in same building or space) – another form
of geographic, just closer in proximity?
• Personal Connection
o Founder
o Political (eg governor’s home county)
• Object of interest
o understanding of social problem (e.g., higher ed + NFP re: poverty?)
o area of work (e.g., oceans)
o area of study (e.g., Native American artifacts)
• Line of work (Same services or line of work, but different clients?)
o (e.g., all educational institutions – possible competitors is the implication due to
no rigid service areas)
o medical providers
o type of business
• Common clients (precisely the same or overlapping people, but different services)—serve
• Common workforce (e.g., schools & businesses who hire them) – train &/or employ
• Common consumers (eg of infrastructure, communication services, banking services,
healthcare) – sell to
For the intended beneficiary, what is the primary underlying reason for the planned and final
partnerships – between the Founder and the Partners? Indicate which cases go where.

231

Columns (end result): If the project is successful, will the intended beneficiary benefit from 1)
having access to enhanced services and/or the ability to overcome barriers (Client), 2) being able
to buy something (like infrastructure itself) with the promise of having a broader consumer base
or competitive edge (Consumer), or 3) having genuine access to enhanced training &
employment opportunities leading to actual jobs (Employee). The first two are Indirect benefits,
whereas the last one is Direct.
Rows: Indicate the basis on which the partnership relationship was established: 1) common
geographic only – the only common thread seems to be where things are, 2) common personal
connection – the partners share a personality who has brought them together, 3) common object
of interest – such as a topic of study for a researcher that aligns with the main service delivered
by providers or the same batch of kids being cultivated to work in a local industry, or 4) common
line of work – such as several institutions that do the same thing but for different regions or sets
of clients and want to leverage technology to do it with less redundancy.
Note: It may be best to stick with describing one direction – ie., what is the relationship FROM
the Awardee TO the Partners. E.g., Awardee A enlisted Partner P because of Reason R –
specifically in relation to VulnerablePopulation V.
AP for V(R)
What are these components in the evaluations: AP for V(R)
And then, what happened (Outcome) with regard to this arrangement of partners? AP for
V(R)O
Note: A & P have types. One of those types is U – University.
AP could also be coded based on the presence of University in the pair. These are possible
values: AU(0,1); PU(0,1)
Partnership table.
Another option:
U0- no university
U1-univ as lead
UP-univ as partner
[earlier note to self: Are these mutually exclusive? What property (predicate) is this?]
This table will help with theoretical sampling, as well as refinement & later testing of theory…
Create a different table for the different “types” (e.g., university role)
Color code the sustainability prospects (O or Outcome) of both the partnership and the project?
Or maybe the sustained benefit to the VC?

Theories (put in discussion):
• Consumer – SCOT or SST & evolution – survival of fittest not necessarily based on best
technology; this was era of computerization movement
• Client – SNA, strength of ties between service agencies
• Employee – Marx? - STIN can show how the organization moves from 1) Consumer:
getting connected to the I/S to 2) Client: getting connected to other related service
providers targeting same clientele (reducing duplication & improved efficiency & info
sharing) to 3) Employee: preparing clients for being prepared workers that can get actual
jobs
The direction and nature of the partnership may matter. So to the Awardee, the type of
relationship may be: Serve, Sell, Teach, Employ, Study. To the partner, the type of relationship
may be: To enhance/provide the same x (service, product, education, employment, research) to
the same population (compete), to provide the same x to different population (cohort), to provide
different x to the same population (complement).

Universities, vulnerable populations, & sustainability.
What’s becoming clear to me is that when a university is involved, the notion of sustainability is
very different than when key players (founder) are rooted within the community. It would be
interesting to compare those initiatives with universities as lead, as opposed to those without
universities and those with universities merely as partners. Universities do not seem to be
incentivized to keep a good thing going. When the research is done, they move on. The
sustainability perhaps needs to become better institutionalized via “community engagement” thru
the educational aspects of the university program. After all, if a professor deemed it worthy to be
engaged in the project at its start, couldn’t the university display an interest and provide the
means for keeping the project going – such as through internships and course projects? Did this
ever happen in the TOP projects? Is broadband for all just a buzz word and passing phase? The
whole notion of sustainability means different things to different project partners. How is this
manifested in these evaluations? What does the future for each of these projects appear to be,
based on what’s in these evaluations? is there a taking advantage of vulnerable communities that
is worse when a university is involved? If so, how might this be prevented, curbed, or overcome?
Look at the cases in the Partnership Table and couple them with their Prospects for Sustainability
(both at Project & Partnership level) – as I’ve assessed them. Code for University Involvement:
As lead, as partner, none. What’s the relationship between universities and VCs?
Reaching saturation.
In quickly going thru the cases where I’ve already coded the partners, I’m finding that there
seem to be two university types that stand out – med schools & community colleges. It’s
probably because they’re vocational. Are universities involved at all when it’s social servicesoriented toward a particular VC? We’ll find out.
I think I need to finish the coding of all cases for partners – and then whether they include
universities. Then I’ll be able to saturate the categories for cases based on whether universities
play a role. So right now, I’m seeking saturation. I want to feel comfortable that, at least in this
dataset, I have covered, for every possible case where universities play a role or are omitted
(which would be at least glancing through all of the cases):
1) the inclusion/treatment of VCs AND
2) the important outcomes (sustainability of partners, project, or VC benefit).
It will be interesting to focus on what (goal/purpose/population) got DROPPED, rather than what
was ACHIEVED, since it’s the achievements that evaluations tend to focus on. And then the
EXCUSE/REASON for dropping. Can be as simple as Barrier (since they’re well-articulated
elsewhere). So is there a correlation between Reason for Inclusion as a Partner, and Reason for
Dropping (e.g., the partners selected did not have a sufficiently strong vested interest in the
outcome; the common thread between Awardee & Partner – or specifically Awardee & VC, or
Partner & VC- was not strong enough. Each of these relationship pairs has properties or
qualities: Reasons for the relationship, Quality (good, bad, pre-existing), Outcomes (such as
severing/dropping or sustaining). These can all be codified.
AP & PA
AVC & VCA
PVC & VCP

234

APVC & VCAP: This is the relationship between the CN partnership as a whole & the VC.
In those cases where universities WERE NOT partners, what role might they have played if they
had been? Could their role perhaps be to ensure that VCs are kept front & center – anticipating
the barriers to be overcome so that research can truly address these issues effectively? The lowhanging fruit is to serve a broad user base that can pay for services. The holy grail is to reach
those who are continually under-served – or not served at all. The poor get poorer because there
are no safeguards in place, and because universities are shirking, or are not even aware of, their
potential role in effecting this naturally widening gap between the haves & have-nots.
Universities & education generally are considered to be the great equalizers. Instead, the
tendency appears to be one of universities being part of the digital divide problem – by catering
to their own needs rather than keeping the VC needs front & center. Future work: I could write
different papers for each type of institutional player in this game, and their role in widening or
closing the digital divide: libraries, social service agencies, economic development
organizations, K-12, etc. Each will have its own self-reflecting to do about
constituents/motivators and natural tendencies. And then reflection on its real commitment to
improving the plight of VCs.
Social network theory implications/applications.
It occurs to me that it might be useful to couch my findings in terms of social network theory –
using terms from physics or the physical world. The term “density” is already used in SNA.
What physical term would describe the quality (good/bad), nature (reason), and product
(outcome) or prediction of continuance (sustainability) of these relationships? How might these
aspects be represented in network diagrams?
