Are scientometric profiles hereditary?
Analyzing scholarly practices of doctoral advisors and advisees in the social sciences
Doctoral mentoring plays an important role in the professional development and
career trajectories of doctoral students, although little research exists quantifying the
relationship between the scholarly practice and performance of doctoral advisees and their
advisors. This dissertation proposes a set of analyses that explore the relationship between
doctoral advisees and advisors in terms of their scholarly practice and performance—
including publication, collaboration and citation patterns—based on massive and
heterogeneous data sources. Economics, Political Science and Sociology are selected for the
purpose of illustrating these relationships in the social sciences. Results show that advisees
are more likely to learn from their advisors by imitating those aspects of scientometric
profiles that are directly transferable, such as reference and collaboration patterns. For
aspects that rely more on individual endeavor of advisees and where they exert less control,
advisees are less likely to inherit from their advisors. Although disciplines investigated in this
study show the general pattern mentioned above, the strength to which advisors and
advisees are related in each aspect of scientometric profiles varies significantly among
Economics, Political Science and Sociology. This study is unique in proposing a framework for
analyzing the relationship between the scientometric profiles of advisors and advisees at a
large scale and should shed light on future research regarding doctoral mentoring and
intellectual capital reproduction of disciplines.

Introduction

Mentorship exists in various contexts, formally or informally. The role that mentorship plays in
protégé performance has attracted attention for decades due to its importance to academic,
business, governmental organizations, etc. The studies of mentorship have been largely
advanced in the context of business and management, both theoretically and methodologically
(e.g. Johnson, Rose, & Schlosser, 2007). Studies of mentoring in the academic context, especially
in doctoral education, have been, however, largely neglected (Johnson et al., 2007; Malmgren,
Ottino, & Amaral, 2010). Yet, graduate education, in particular at the doctoral level, has been
the critical part of scientific advancement: it aims to the development of knowledge and theory
of the field, as well as the preparation of the field’s professoriate (White, Adams, & Forrester,
1996). Of those comparatively few studies dealing with doctoral mentoring (e.g. Brown II, Davis,
& McClendon, 1999; Mullen, 2007), the majority have relied on survey or interview data, and
are therefore of small-scale, homogeneous, and limited generalizability. To address this gap, the
present study focuses on the mentoring relationship in the context of doctoral education, and
investigates the relationship between the scientometric profiles of doctoral advisors and
advisees, based on quantitative analyses on massive and heterogeneous data sources.

1.1

Problem Statement

Doctoral education is big business. The number of research doctoral degrees conferred in the
academic year of 2011-2012 is 51,008, and the number has been steadily increasing for years,
according to the Survey of Earned Doctorates conducted by the National Science Foundation
(NSF) of the United States1. The total number of students pursuing doctoral degrees in the

1

More details about the survey can be found at http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/sed/2012/data_table.cfm.

Retrieved on 07/01/2014.

1

United States is approximately 375,000 (Walker et al., 2008) as of 20082. Of all these students
enrolled in about 400 doctorate degree granting institutions in the United States, 57% of
doctoral students will receive a doctorate within 10 years after matriculation (Economist, 2010).

Doctoral education matters to the advancement of science. Many of those doctoral students
who finally receive their doctorates will assume positions of leadership and responsibility in
their research area, and thus directly shape the development of the discipline. Additionally, they
may also cultivate new doctoral students, who are the next general scholars of disciplines. These
outcomes of doctoral graduates are probably related to the training they received as doctoral
students. Doctoral education, thereby, plays a pivotal role in making an impact on the
knowledge creation of a discipline and shaping the careers of future scholars in a discipline.

Doctoral mentoring is an important part of doctoral education, and has been shown to be
essential for doctoral students (e.g. Paglis, Green, & Bauer, 2006; Sugimoto, 2010). Mentoring
has been identified as one of the two key factors (the other one is financial support) that help
doctoral students complete the doctoral programs, according to the survey results from Ph.D.
Completion Project (Council of Graduate Schools, 2014). In addition, doctoral mentors have also
been demonstrated to play a pivotal role in development of advisees’ professional lives and
career paths in different disciplines (Bargar & Mayo-Chamberlain, 1983; Sugimoto, 2010). The
argument is that, during a doctoral program, students are acculturated to the norms of the
discipline, learn scholarly practices and behaviors (mostly from their mentors) and others that

2

This number is an estimate by the authors, as there is no precise statistics reported on the level of

doctoral enrollment. Since the number of doctoral degrees conferred yearly, and the number of doctoral
student enrollment yearly are close in the past few years, the current number of enrolled doctoral
students might still be close to 375,000.

2

will influence them for a lifetime. Advisors, as guides to these “scholarly journeymen” (Bargar &
Duncan, 1982), thus can have a significant influence on their doctoral students in terms of their
professional development and career paths (Clark, Harden, & Johnson, 2000), and further serve
as critical gatekeepers to the discipline by training those doctoral students.

Yet, the studies on the mentoring relationship between advisors and advisees were largely
neglected, compared with those mentoring relationship in the context of business and
management. This dissertation aims to partially fill the gap by examining the mentoring
relationship in the context of doctoral education. In particular, this dissertation investigates into
the relationship between advisors’ and advisees’ scientometric profiles, focusing on their
publication, correlation, reference and citation patterns.

1.2

Research Questions

For the purpose mentioned above, this dissertation explores two general research questions,
each of which corresponds to a distinct research goal. The first research question aims to
investigate the relationship between the scientometric profiles of advisors and advisees in
selected disciplines, from the perspective of publication, collaboration, reference and citation. In
particular, this dissertation explores this question through the following sub-questions.


What is the relationship between the publication practices of advisors and advisees?
This question aims to understand the relationship between the publication practice of
advisors and advisees in selected disciplines. The null hypothesis here is that there is no
significant relationship between advisors’ and advisees’ publication behaviors. The
research hypothesis here is that there is a significant correlation relationship between
advisors’ and advisees’ publication behaviors.



What is the relationship between the collaboration practices of advisors and advisees?
3

This question aims to understand the relationship between the collaboration behavior
of advisors and advisees in selected disciplines. The null hypothesis here is that there is
no significant relationship between advisors’ and advisees’ collaboration behaviors. The
research hypothesis here is that there is a significant correlation relationship between
advisors’ and advisees’ collaboration behaviors.


What is the relationship between the reference practices of advisors and advisees?
This question aims to understand the relationship between the reference behavior of
advisors and advisees in selected disciplines. The null hypothesis here is that there is no
significant relationship between advisors’ and advisees’ reference behaviors. The
research hypothesis here is that there is a significant correlation relationship between
advisors’ and advisees’ reference behaviors.



What is the relationship between the citation practices of advisors and advisees?
This question aims to understand the relationship between the citation characteristics
of advisors and advisees in selected disciplines. The null hypothesis here is that there is
no significant relationship between advisors’ and advisees’ reference behaviors. The
research hypothesis here is that there is a significant correlation relationship between
advisors’ and advisees’ reference behaviors.

The second question that this dissertation aims to answer is whether these relationships
between advisees and advisors vary by discipline. Three disciplines are examined—Economics,
Political Science and Sociology—for the purpose of between-discipline comparison in social
science (for more details about the discipline selection, please refer to the section 3.5. This
general question contains the following sub-questions:

4



Does the relationship between doctoral advisors and advisees in terms of publication
practice vary by discipline?



Does the relationship between doctoral advisors and advisees in terms of collaboration
practice vary by discipline?



Does the relationship between doctoral advisors and advisees in terms of reference
practice vary by discipline?



Does the relationship between doctoral advisees and advisors in terms of citation practice
vary by discipline?

For the above questions, the null hypothesis is that the relationship between advisors and
advisees in terms of their publication, collaboration, reference and citation patterns is equivalent
among disciplines, while the research hypothesis assumes there are significant differences among
disciplines.

In addition to the above key questions, there are also two secondary objectives by doing this
project: name disambiguation and heterogeneous data integration. Author name disambiguation
has been a renewed interest in both academic and industrial contexts. Various approaches have
been proposed, but no “best practices” have yet emerged in regards to author name
disambiguation (please see section 3.2 for more details on this topic). This dissertation performs
author name disambiguation on Web of Science bibliographic database using a new approach and
with a large dataset. In addition, this project also integrates the ProQuest Dissertation and Thesis
database with Web of Science bibliographic database, which will be the first attempt to connect
these two sources together to-date. The merger of these databases will establish an “integrated
scholar profile” database, including scholars’ information of doctoral mentoring, affiliation history,
publication, citation, collaboration information, etc. The database will be extendable, allowing for

5

the addition of extra profile information of scholars, such as gender, grant funding and patent
information in the future. Therefore, the integrated database from this study will not only provide
the necessary data for the specific research questions addressed in this dissertation, but also
enable subsequent research on various topics related to scholarship and science policy in the
future.

1.3

Significance of Study

This study proposes a set of analyses for the purpose of understanding the relationship between
the scientometric profiles of doctoral advisors and advisees, using massive, heterogeneous
source. The contributions made by this study are various.

This study is unique in quantifying the relationship between the scientometric profiles of
advisees and their advisors on such a large scale. Previous research has performed small-scale
analyses focused on single variables, e.g., gender (e.g. Heinrich, 1995; Turban, Dougherty, & Lee,
2002), race (e.g. Davidson & Foster-Johnson, 2001; Dixon-Reeves, 2003), interpersonal
communication (e.g. Kalbfleisch & Davies, 1993) and mentorship fecundity (e.g. Malmgren et al.,
2010). Malmgren’s and colleagues’ (2010) study on mentorship fecundity, which was defined as
the number of doctoral students that advisors have trained, was one of the first quantitative
studies of publication and mentorship, but was limited to a single discipline (i.e., Mathematics).
This dissertation will incorporate additional features, including publication behavior,
collaboration pattern and citation impact, and will analyze and compare across multiple
disciplines, relying on large-scale and heterogeneous data and thus reaching more reliable and
generalizable conclusions.

This dissertation provides a new angle of understanding university faculty’s role in scientific
advancement. By studying the relationship of advisors’ and advisees’ scientometric profiles, this
6

dissertation will be able to provide empirical evidence about the scientist’s role as a teacher. In
research universities, faculty members do not only have the responsibilities of researching, but
also cultivating the next generation of scholars of the discipline. They mentor doctoral students,
inform the norms of a discipline, and transmit their knowledge and expertise during the process
of mentoring. By addressing the research questions, this dissertation will therefore provide a
new perspective of evaluating a faculty member in the role of teaching, and at the same time
how the research and teaching roles of faculty members interact.

This dissertation produces a large-scale, integrated dataset that is rare yet important to
understand scholars and disciplines from multiple perspectives. To analyze the relationships
mentioned above, this dissertation performs a large-scale author name disambiguation, and
integrates multiple databases together for a comprehensive profile of scholars, known as
“integrate scholar profile database” in this dissertation. The new approach for author name
disambiguation is designed for the Web of Science bibliographic database specifically, and will
be easy to replicate in the future. Additionally, this dissertation develops a new approach of
merging these two databases together, and is also the first attempt in the field to merge
ProQuest and Web of Science. The integration will provide implications for the current trends of
data integration in the era of data-intensive science, an era in which data are in large volume
and multiple data sources can be connected together with appropriate methods to reveal
questions that have been difficult to answer in the past. The integrated database will be the first
data source containing various features of scholars on such a large scale, and the database can
be extended by adding extra features of scholars in the future.

To summarize, this work is critical to quantitatively understanding the relationship between the
scientometric profiles of advisors and advisees, including their publication, reference,

7

collaboration and citation patterns, and thus the advisors’ impact on the career trajectories and
scientific performance of protégés in their professional development. In addition, the technical
problem solved in this dissertation (author name disambiguation and data integration) will
benefit future study on various topics concerning scholarship and science policy. Therefore, this
project will be able to inform policy makers and academic administrators regarding resource
allocation in higher education in terms of cultivating a productive and innovative scientific
workforce. Institutions may get a new angle of accessing faulty members’ scholarships and
scholarly performance, as this project will reveal faculty’s contribution in training future scholars
of a discipline.

Literature Review

This study focuses on the relationship between the scholarly practice and performance of
doctoral advisors and advisees in terms of publication, citation, and collaboration patterns. The
ultimate goal of this dissertation is to provide a framework for the analysis of the relationship
between the scientometric profiles of advisors and advisees, utilizing massive and
heterogeneous data. Therefore, this chapter reviews a set of previous studies related to this
topic.

The first part of this survey concentrates on the roles of scientists: in particular, faulty members
in scientific communities. Merton (1973) delineates the four major roles of scientists: research,
teaching, administrative, and gatekeeper roles. While most previous studies focused on the role
of scientists as researchers, this study concentrates on two major roles of faculty members
(research and teaching), and how these two roles interact with each other. Therefore, this
section of the literature review will introduce some related work dealing with the roles of
scientists, the association between these roles, and the reason for focusing on both roles for the
purpose of this dissertation.

The second part narrows down to the foci of scientists in the role of teaching, by examining
previous studies on mentoring, focusing on student-faculty mentoring in doctoral education.
This part starts by introducing various types of mentoring and definitions of mentoring,
concentrating on the mentoring relationship in the context of academe. Studies on both
negative and positive impact of academic mentoring is presented, as well as the factors that
have already been investigated as facilitating or hindering mentorship. Additionally, this section
also provides theoretical evidence for using the doctoral dissertation advisor as a proxy for a
mentor.

9

The third section reviews previous studies on the publication, reference, citation and
collaboration patterns of scholars via informetric approaches, since this dissertation quantifies
the scholarly practice and performance of advisees and advisors based on these approaches. It
starts with a brief introduction of informetric approaches, followed by research on various
metrics to quantify the scholarly practice and performance: publication, citation, and
collaboration.

The first section provides a survey of current work on author name disambiguation and data
integration. As mentioned earlier, one major contribution of this dissertation is the author name
disambiguation and the integration between Web of Science and ProQuest. This section
summaries current research on these two tasks and provides background information for the
approach used for these two tasks in this dissertation.

2.1

The Role of Scientist

Science is inseparable from human beings (Merton, 1973): scientists are the major component
of scientific world as creative individuals and creators of scientific knowledge (Storer, 1966).
Scientists conduct research and publish to inform the public of their findings (Cronin, 2005),
which fundamentally benefits society.

However, as Merton (1973) summarized in his canonical work on the sociology of science,
research is not the only role that scientists perform. Instead, they simultaneously engage as
teachers, administrators, and gatekeepers. Most scientists are usually not involved in a single
role, but multiple and interactive roles (Merton, 1973). According to Merton (1973), the
research role is the central one for scientists, as scientists create and promote the advancement
of science through research. The other three roles are also important, but ancillary to the
research role. This is because “if there were no scientific investigation, there would be no new
10

knowledge to be transmitted through the teaching role, no need to allocate resources for
investigation, no research organization to administer, and no new flow of knowledge for
gatekeepers to regulate…..” (Merton, 1973, p. 520). Yet, in the daily practice of science,
scientists are heralded as heroes because of their success in scientific knowledge investigation,
but rarely for their contributions as teachers, mentors, administrators, or reviewers (Merton,
1973). A series of reports from the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching
(Boyer, 1990; Glassick, Huber, & Maeroff, 1997) tend to support Merton’s idea of the role of
scientists. Boyer (1990) discussed thoroughly the idea of what counts for “scholarship”, and
claimed that scholarship involved not only “scholarship of discovering knowledge but also the
scholarship of integrating knowledge, the scholarship of applying knowledge and the scholarship
of teaching” (Boyer, 1990, p. 22). If not taking into account all the other forms of scholarship,
the assessment of scholarship for faculty member could be narrowly restricted and thereby
unfair.

Due to the centrality of the research role, this role has been widely investigated by studying, for
instance, publication (e.g. Adkins & Budd, 2006; Fairweather, 2002), citation (e.g.Cronin &
Meho, 2006; Ding & Cronin, 2011), and collaboration patterns (e.g. Newman, 2001b; Newman &
Girvan, 2004). Quantitative analyses of the teaching role of scholars, however, have been largely
neglected, particularly when examined beyond the classroom. Nevertheless, the world cannot
deny scientists’ contributions to the world of science through the process of mentoring, in that
the graduates they mentor are the next generation of scholars and will be the creators and
promoters of scientific knowledge in the future. The teaching role of scientists, across all
disciplines, calls for both “explicit didactics…and tacit instructions through observed example”
(Merton, 1973, p. 521). In the world of science, the mentor-protégé relationship is critical to
both socialization and progress in science. In the normative system of science, scientists should
11

be required to recognize their obligations to train the next generations of scientists, rather than
taking scientific investigation as the only obligation. Scientists should also be recognized for
successful training of outstanding students.

In summary, scientists are not only just researchers but also teachers and, in the case of
doctoral education, doctoral advisors. Attentions should be paid to both roles that scientists
perform and possible interaction between these roles.

2.2

Mentoring

This section is primarily concerned with mentoring, specifically the mentoring relationship that
occurs in the academic context.

Introduction to Mentoring
The origins of mentoring, according to Allen and Eby (2007), and Monaghan and Lunt (1992),
can be traced back to The Odyssey by Homer, where Odysseus referred to his friend, Mentor, as
the mentor to his son. But the mentoring relationship was not studied by scholars until the late
20th century, mainly focusing on three types (Eby, Rhodes, & Allen, 2007), i.e., youth mentoring
(e.g. Kartje, 1996; Levinson, Darrow, Klein, Levinson, & Mckee, 1978), corporate or workplace
mentoring (e.g. Fagenson-Eland, Marks, & Amendola, 1997; Monaghan & Lunt, 1992), and
student-faculty mentoring (e.g. Fagenson-Eland, Marks, & Amendola, 1997; Savage, Karp, &
Logue, 2004). Youth mentoring “represents a sustained relationship between a caring,
supportive adult and youth” (Eby et al., 2007, p. 17), workplace mentoring concerns the
relationship between a less experienced and more experience person with the purpose of
promoting the protégé’s professional growth (Kram, 1985; Kram & Isabella, 1985), while
academic mentoring, more specifically student-faculty mentoring, exemplifies the masterapprentice model in educational environment (Jacobi, 1991).
12

Levinson, Darrow, Klein, Levinson, & Mckee’s (1978) seminal study of mentoring in adult
education and development is usually cited as the influential starting point of scholarly interest
in this area. Levinson and his colleges interviewed 40 successful corporate men regarding the
developmental transition and milestones they have experienced in their life. Levinson et al.
(1978) described the mentor as a life guide, teacher and counselor to “facilitate the realization
of the dream” (p. 98). The role of mentoring was highlighted in their pioneering work, claiming
having a poor mentor is the “the equivalent of poor parenting in childhood” (Levinson et al.,
1978, p. 338). Vaillant’s (1977) work reinforced this idea, noting the most successful men he
studied had all been mentored as children. After that, the critical role that mentors played was
also confirmed by some other studies (e.g. Ainsworth, 1989; Kartje, 1996).

Workplace mentoring has also attracted scholars’ attention, and one of the most influential
studies was Kram (1985). Kram (1985) conducted an in-depth quantitative study on 18 pairs of
mentor-protégé at different career stages in working environment, and provided pioneering
insights for mentorship research. For instance, Kram (1985) pointed out the functions of
mentoring from career and psychosocial perspectives, the different forms of mentorship at
different career stages, and the complexities of cross-gender mentoring relationships. In
addition, organizational mentoring research usually considers the origins of mentoring to be
related to the apprenticeship system: modern mentor-protégé relationship function similarly to
the master-apprentice relationships of the European trade guilds of the 16th and 17th century
(Sugimoto, 2010).

Most studies on academic mentoring started in the field of education, focusing on how mentors
in schools influence their students’ intellectual development and career preparation. For
instance, Chickering (1969) conducted his research on college students and concluded that

13

student-faculty mentoring has significant impact on students’ future performance, such as
intellectual development, academic achievement, career decision and academic selfidentification. This was confirmed by other influential studies (e.g. Astin, 1977, 1993; Wilson,
Gaff, Dienst, Wood, & Bavry, 1975). Additionally, research on this topic has been consistently
reviewed by scholars over time. Pascarella (1980), for instance, summarized the work on
informal student-faculty mentoring. Later, Jacobi (1991) reviewed the related work on
undergraduate mentoring, and at the same time summarized 15 different definitions of
mentoring. Most recently, Allen and Eby (2007) summarized studies on student-faculty
mentoring and noted theoretical and methodological issues in this area, in which they pointed
out that, compared with mentoring in the context of workplace, student-faculty mentoring
needs more attentions from both theoretical and methodological perspectives.

This dissertation concerns the mentoring relationship in the academic context, more specifically,
student-faculty mentoring at the doctoral level. The following sections will cover works related
to this topic.

Defining Mentoring
There has been no agreement reached on the definition of mentoring. As has been claimed in
Merriam (1983), “the phenomenon of mentoring is not clearly conceptualized, leading to
confusion as to just what is being measured or offered as an ingredient in success” (p.169).
Mentoring means different things to scholars in developmental psychology, business and
education. Therefore, no consensus has been reached on “what is mentoring” or “what is a
mentor”, despite continued efforts in this area.

For instance, Jacobi (1991) summarized 15 different definitions of mentoring by scholars from
the field of higher education, management and psychology, and realized that a lack of consensus
14

on the definition of mentoring not only exists among different fields, but also within a single
field. The disagreement on the definition of mentoring and mentor was related to the degree of
emotional intimacy thought to be involved in a mentoring relationship (Eby et al., 2007):
whether mentoring should be an intense, emotionally deep relationship (Kram, 1985; Shapiro,
Haseltine, & Rowe, 1978), or a less emotionally-intense relationship (e.g. Lester & Johnson,
1981; Phillips-Jones, 1982; Schmidt & Wolfe, 1980). Other factors concerned in defining
mentoring include age and duration of the relationship (Levinson et al., 1978). Another
disagreement regarding the definition of mentoring lies in the specific functions provided by
mentors (e.g. Kram, 1985; Zey, 1984). Jacobi (1991) compared different functions as proposed
by scholars and concluded that all functions reflect three primary components of the mentoring
relationship: (a) emotional and psychological support, (b) direct assistance with career and
professional development, and (c) role modeling. Stein (1981) identified 27 critical phrases used
to define a mentor based on survey result from faculty members, including assistance with
dissertation research, assistance in finding first jobs, and educating them about the "rules of the
game" in their profession. This is to some extent consistent with the metaphors in Levinson et
al.(1978): “teacher, sponsor, exemplar, counselor….”, and “coaches, kinfolk (mother, father,
older siblings), gurus, enablers, sponsors, fairy godmothers, godfathers, rabbis, hosts, guides,
exemplars, or teachers” (p. 115) in Kartje (1996).

It is reasonable that the definition regarding mentoring and mentors varies by the context of the
relationship (e.g., youth mentoring, workplace mentoring and academic mentoring), and by the
discipline of scholars who define mentoring, since a mentoring relationship itself differs from
context to context. However, among all definitions, Anderson and Shannon’s (1988) definition
of mentorship as ‘‘a nurturing process in which a more skilled or more experienced person,
serving as a role model, teachers, sponsors, encourages, counsels and befriends a less skilled or
15

less experienced person for the purpose of promoting the latter’s professional and/or personal
development’’ (p. 40) seems to be well-suited as a general definition of mentoring, as it
captures various roles that a mentor may play in different contexts where mentoring happens.

Student-Faculty Mentoring in Graduate Education
The focus of this project is the mentoring occurring in the context of graduate education. As
graduate student mentoring is very different from organizational and youth mentoring in many
aspects (Johnson et al., 2007), this review will primarily cover the literature that applies to the
domain of graduate mentoring.

2.2.3.1 Introduction to student-faculty mentoring
Academic mentoring happens in the academic environment (i.e., colleges and universities), and
usually consists of senior-junior faculty mentoring, and student-faculty mentoring, which
includes mentoring at undergraduate and graduate level. Although there has been a great deal
of research on mentoring in the past couple of decades (Crosby, 1999), the majority of advances
in theoretical and methodological issues has come from the business setting (Johnson et al.,
2007). It is argued, however, that academic mentoring is distinctly different from business
mentoring. Therefore, theoretical, methodological and empirical studies of academic mentoring
are particularly necessary.

Similar to the definition issues of mentoring, student-faculty mentoring also needs more
definitional clarity, since a precise definition is critical for respondents to ensure a common
response frame (e.g. Aagaard & Hauer, 2003; Busch, 1985; Clark et al., 2000; Wilde & Schau,
1991). Efforts have been made toward a standard definition (e.g. Cochran, Paukert, Scales, &
Neumayer, 2004; Cronan-Hillix, Gensheimer, Cronan-Hillix, & Davidson, 1986), and although no

16

consensus has been reached, a frequently used definition comes from O'Neil and Wrightsman
(2001):

We propose that mentoring exists when a professional person serves as a resource,
sponsor, and transitional figure for another person (usually but not necessarily younger)
who is entering that same profession. Effective mentors provide mentees with
knowledge, advice, challenge, and support as mentees pursue the acquisition of
professional competence and identity. The mentor welcomes the less experienced person
into the profession and represents the values, skills, and success that the neophyte
professional person intends to acquire someday. (p. 113)
Other comprehensive definitions towards student-faculty mentoring include Aagaard and
Hauer’s (2003) definition which emphasizes sustainability and continuity, Busch’s (1985) focus
on mutuality, comprehensiveness and congruence, and Rose’s (2003, 2005) Ideal Mentor Scale
(IMS) model. Definitions vary by scholar, but the major components of student-faculty
mentoring can be extracted as follows (Johnson et al., 2007, p. 51):

1) Mentorships are enduring personal relationships;
2) Mentorships are increasingly reciprocal and mutual;
3) Compared to protégés, mentors demonstrate greater achievement and experience;
4) Mentors provide direct career assistance;
5) Mentors provide social and emotional support;
6) Mentors serve as models;
7) Mentoring results in an identity transformation in the protégé;
8)

Mentorships offer a safe environment for self-exploration; and,

9)

Mentorships generally produce positive career and personal outcomes.

17

This section will mainly focus on the student-faculty mentoring happening during the doctoral
education, i.e., doctoral mentoring, which is defined as beginning when the doctoral student is
recruited to a doctoral program and ending when the student transitions to a colleague, friend,
or other status following graduation (Sugimoto, 2010).

2.2.3.2 Dissertation Advisors as Doctoral Mentors
This dissertation will use the doctoral dissertation advisor, i.e., the advisor listed as chair in the
completed dissertations, as the doctoral mentor. In the academic context, the terms mentor and
thesis advisor are often used interchangeably, but sometimes the responsibilities associated
with these roles are distinct, even when they overlap. Therefore, this section aims to provide
theoretical and empirical evidence that doctoral mentors can be approximated with doctoral
dissertation advisors. There are cases in which doctoral students change their advisors during
their doctoral program and cases where the student and advisor have very little interaction.
However, the majority of dissertation advisors, as shown in (Sugimoto, 2010), can still be
counted as the primary doctoral mentors.

Sedlacek, Benjamin, Schlosser, and Sheu (2007) claimed that within academia, most student–
faculty relationships are formalized and tend to start out as advisor–advisee relationships.
Johnson (2007) concurs, but notes that while student–faculty mentoring relationships often
start out as formal advising relationships, research on academic mentoring tends to assume that
mentorships develop informally and unconsciously.

Treating the doctoral advisor as equal to mentor is not unusual. For instance, Bargar and Duncan
(1982) reviewed a series of literature concerning doctoral education and found most doctoral
advisors play the role of mentors. This is confirmed partially by Johnson (2007) finding
similarities between positive doctoral advising and mentoring relationships. Maack and Passet
18

(1994) found that the majority of the women in their study described their doctoral advisor as
their primary mentor, and the guidance from their mentors continues to be important even
when they are being considered for tenure. The following comment from Ross (2002) also
shows the inevitability of an advisor acting as a mentor:

The most obvious candidate to mentor a young scientist is that person’s advisor.
The advisor has an obligation to mentor his or her students and postdocs
because by accepting them into the lab, he or she has made a commitment to
their education and training. Students and postdocs are trainees and although
they will hopefully contribute to their advisor’s productivity, they are also
entitled to guidance that will help them move on to the next step of their
careers. On the other hand, it would be almost impossible for an advisor to fail
to be a mentor to members of his or her lab because much of mentoring occurs
through following a more experienced person’s example. Students learn an
enormous amount simply from observing how their advisor goes about the daily
business of doing science.

In the context of doctoral education, studies have shown that the mentors and thesis advisors
overlap and are sometimes used interchangeably (e.g. Bird, 2001). Bird (2001) believes that
“neither are role models necessarily mentors, though mentors are role models: good examples
are necessary but not sufficient” (p.455). Nevertheless, mentors can be critically important for
professional success and are one of a number of elements that affect the responsible conduct of
research. Heinrich (1991) found that while doctoral advising was ubiquitous, mentoring
relationships were “rare and precious” (p. 519) and did not occur in every doctoral advising
relationship. In terms of expectations, Green and Bauer (1995) surveyed department heads,

19

faculty members and doctoral students: “Are faculty advisors expected to mentor Ph.D.
students they advise?” About 96% of the respondents are affirmative with this (c.f. Sugimoto,
2010).

The discrepancy in the understanding of mentoring and advising may be partially accounted for
by the fact that there is no agreement on a practical definition of mentoring (Johnson et al.,
2007). In the previous studies regarding mentoring relationships, scholars usually interviewed or
surveyed subjects and received answers from respondents based on the definitions that the
scholars determined for their specific study (Sugimoto, 2010). However, there is enough
evidence (e.g. Bird, 2001; Johnson et al., 2007) here to assume that academic advisor serves a
mentor. For further discussions over the relationship between advisors and mentors, please
refer to Johnson et al. (2007) and Sugimoto (2010).

2.2.3.3 Positive impact of student-faculty mentoring
In graduate education, ‘‘the advisor is correctly seen as the ‘significant other’ for the student’s
journey...’’ (Bargar & Mayo-Chamberlain, 1983, p. 420). Within the general realm of the
graduate mentoring, the relationship between a doctoral student and advisor has been cited as
the most critical element in doctoral education by many scholars (e.g. Heinrich, 1991, 1995;
Heiss, 1970; Zhao, Golde, & McCormick, 2007). Likewise, Girves and Wemmerus (1988b)
developed a conceptual model based on Bean’s (1980) and Tinto’s (1975) framework, by adding
student-faculty relationship as one of the two important factors in graduate student degree
progress. They believe that students’ relationships with faculty members are “crucial to the
students’ educational and professional development and ultimately to the students’ graduate
degree progress….can determine success in the students’ academic program as well as in the
students’ professional career” (Girves & Wemmerus, 1988b, p. 165). Phillips (1979) is supportive

20

of this statement, and further called this relationship a “comradeship of extraordinary intensity”
(p. 339) and noted the power and the responsibility of an advisor:

Without the support of the mentor-professor, students cannot advance.
They cannot complete their program nor can they enter the
profession…The professor has the responsibility to initiate the student
into the lore and mysteries of the profession. Students learn about local
(university) politics and national (disciplinary) operations. They learn
who should be respected, who opposed and who ignored. They learn
how judgments of scholarly quality are made. (p. 342)

Waldeck, Orrego, Plax, and Kearney (1997) consider mentoring as an effective way for students
to establish productive connections with professors, and believe that the graduate student’s
road to an advanced degree becomes “unnecessarily anxious and difficult” (p.93-94) without an
advisor. Mentoring relationships also aid in increasing students’ publication productivity
(Cronan-Hillix et al., 1986), developing specific professional skills (Bova & Phillips, 1984),
securing future placement in quality research universities (Blackburn, Chapman, & Cameron,
1981; Cameron, 1978), and making contacts and gaining visibility (Moore, 1982).

In terms of research, graduate students and new faculty who experience intense professional
interactions with mentors has been proven to have greater research productivity and career
advancement compared with their peers (Corcoran & Clark, 1984; Girves & Wemmerus, 1988b).
Other scholars (e.g. Cronan-Hillix et al., 1986; Green, 1991; Reskin, 1979) discovered the
enhanced publication success of protégés due to faculty mentoring in doctoral education. A
series of works (e.g. Kogler-Hill, Bahniuk, & Dobos, 1989; Phillips, 1979) also demonstrated that
the mentoring relationship can benefit the graduate student when mentors provide invaluable
21

information on department politics, regulations, unspoken rules and other faculty. Significant
career advantage has been observed on protégés with successful mentoring relationship with
their mentors (Cameron & Blackburn, 1981; Fagenson, 1992).

Another key value of graduate mentoring usually happens in the process of dissertation, by
creating a “common experience” among members of a discipline (Isaac, Quinlan, & Walker,
1992, p. 242). As Gehrke (1988) noted:

Thus, among mentors and protégés we see something like families
arise. In academia, we see generations of scholars who trace their
communal roots to the same source. In that tracing they find others
with whom they immediately feel a kinship because they share a world
view that has been transmitted across the generations. (p. 193)

As the gatekeeper of the scientific professionals and the “socializing agents of the discipline”
(Girves & Wemmerus, 1988a, p. 171), graduate advisors provide a discipline with the next
generation of scholars who understand the norms and expectations of the discipline. Therefore,
graduate mentoring is important, as Ellis (1992) wrote:

I am convinced that the success of graduate education depends on a student–faculty
relationship based on integrity, trust, and support. I believe that quality graduate
programs have some sort of faculty mentor system in which students can obtain advice,
counseling, and helpful direction in their training . . . Good mentoring represents one of
the important factors in graduate training, fosters long-term competence, and promotes
effectiveness for both scientists and professionals.(p. 575)

22

Student-faculty mentoring is critical to both students (in professional development and career
trajectory) and scientific disciplines (on knowledge incubation and new scholar training), yet
only a few studies with limited data have been conducted. This topic is therefore in great need
of large-scale and comprehensive studies on student-faculty mentoring. To this end, this
dissertation will fill the gap by examining the relationships between advisors’ and advisees’
scientometric profiles on a large scale from various perspectives.

2.2.3.4 Negative Impact of Student-Faculty Mentoring
The positive correlations between mentors and protégés have been widely studied, but the
negative correlations of mentoring have not been explored as much. This is probably because
“these studies focus on the idealized concept of mentoring, in which it is a positive relationship”
(Sugimoto, 2010, p. 26). Therefore, most of the studies of the negative impact of mentoring are
concerned with so called “unsuccessful” mentoring relationship.

Johnson and Huwe (2002) is the only work extensively discussing the dysfunction of mentoring
relationships in graduate education, summarizing that the potential problems between faculty
members and their doctoral advisees are mentor neglect, relational conflict, and exploitation.
Hesli, Fink, and Duffy (2003) surveyed doctoral students from political science and found a link
between a lack of mentoring from faculty and high levels of attrition during the doctoral
program. In addition, studies have shown that when students are not provided with
information, such as “what graduate education entails, what is formally and informally required
of them to obtain a graduate degree, the academic culture (norms, rules, and values) of their
particular discipline, and what accomplishments are necessary in order to be considered
successful”, they tended to “interact less effectively with colleagues, to be less committed to
their programs, and to be less productive” (Campbell, Fuller, & Patrick, 2005, p. 155).

23

Additionally, scholars observed that faculty mentoring does not necessarily correlate positively
with protégé performance. For instance, Weidman and Stein (2003) found that the frequency
and intensity of student-faculty interaction were not significantly correlated with participation in
research and other scholarly activities. The amount of mentoring received in students’ first year
did not contribute positively to students’ research productivity at the end of year two (Paglis et
al., 2006).

In sum, there is little work on the negative impact of student-faculty mentoring, mostly due to
data accessibility. Although non-positive correlation has been discovered in some literature
between some advisor’s features and advisee’s outcomes, it is still limited by the number of
features and size of sample investigated. This dissertation will explore not only the demographic
feature (e.g. gender) but also scholarly behavior (e.g. publication, citation, collaboration and
funding), in a series of disciplines on a large scale, and will thus be able to reveal whether
negative correlations exist, in which dimension, and to what degree.

Student-Faculty Mentoring and Academic Genealogy
Sugimoto (2014) defines academic genealogy in the context of student-faculty mentoring as
“the quantitative study of intellectual heritage operationalized through chains of students and
their advisors” (p.1). The basic assumption of academic genealogy is that, in the case of doctoral
mentoring, the disciplines are propagated through knowledge transfer activities between
advisors and advisees (Abbott, 1999; Turner, 2000). The norms or paradigms used to inform
scholars in a discipline about the appropriate practice can also be transferred in the process of
mentoring (Girves & Wemmerus, 1988a). Therefore, academic genealogy can be studied for
basically two purposes: as a proxy for studying the transfer of disciplinary knowledge, academic
genealogy can also be used to examine interactions between and among disciplines as faculty

24

members “disciplined” in one area move to another (Sugimoto, Ni, Russell, & Bychowski, 2011);
as an evaluative metric, academic genealogy in the context of doctoral education can be used to
quantify the faculty members’ contribution in the role of teaching, by counting the number of
protégés they trained (Malmgren et al., 2010).

Studies on academic genealogy have been conducted in recent years on select disciplines, e.g.
Mathematics (Chang, 2011; Malmgren et al., 2010), Library and Information Science
(Marchionini, Solomon, Davis, & Russell, 2007; Russell & Sugimoto, 2009; Sugimoto et al., 2011),
Chemistry (Andraos, 2005), and Neuroscience (David & Hayden, 2012). Some databases have
begun to provide data for academic genealogies, but the studies listed above have relied
primarily on crowdsourced web data sources, such as the Mathematics Genealogy Project,3
hosted by the Department of Mathematics at North Dakota State University, the Chemistry 4
database by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and the Artificial Intelligence
Academic Genealogy project5 at the Department of Computer Science at the University of Texas
at Austin. Most recently, the PhDTree Academic genealogy Wiki6 tries to index academic
genealogy information without restriction on the discipline. However, as of 10/22/2013 it listed
only 844,200 individual scholars, which is less than 30% of the doctoral graduates indexed by
ProQuest.

These studies and online projects suffer from several limitations due to data. Firstly, most of
them are single discipline projects. Secondly, it will take a comparatively longer time for scholars

to enter mentor and protégé information. Finally, since the data were collected by scholars’ selfidentification, it is hard to control the quality of the data: the scholars may add the wrong
names for advisors/advisees (Sugimoto, 2014).

The ProQuest database, however, harvests the academic genealogy data from the doctoral
dissertation itself: the formal fruit of doctoral education with advisor information indexed in
most cases. Therefore, the use of advisor-advisee relationships based on the ProQuest database
will be able to cover multiple disciplines, with a small chance of incorrect mentorship
information. The mentoring relationships in this dissertation will be displayed in the format of
an academic genealogy network, where each node is an individual scholar, and two scholars are
connected if there was a mentoring relationship between them.

Summary
Student-faculty mentoring is critical to doctoral education, in particular the way in which it
facilitates graduates’ career development and choices. Echoing all the previous studies, it seems
that student-faculty mentoring has been studied predominately from the protégé’s perspective,
via self-report questionnaires of unknown reliability and validity. These studies almost invariably
use cross-sectional designs with small samples, making the generalizability of findings
questionable (Merriam, 1983; Noe, 1988). Most of this research has been qualitative in design,
entailing the administration of a mailed questionnaire or survey (e.g. Atkinson, Neville, & Casas,
1991; Busch, 1985; Clark et al., 2000; Cronan-Hillix et al., 1986; Luna & Cullen, 1998; Wilde &
Schau, 1991). Therefore, there exists a series of issues with the current approach of studying
mentoring relationship in the academic setting.

Firstly, as most current approaches rely largely on survey or interview data, the extant research
on student–faculty mentoring suffers from problems with sampling, self-selection bias, and the
26

probability of social desirability and halo effects in student responses. Survey nonresponse can
be the source of bias in mentoring research (e.g., Merriam, 1983). It is reasonable to assume
that the majority of those who respond to a questionnaire on mentoring are those with
extremely positive or extremely negative experiences to report.

Secondly, the most common variables examined as correlatives of mentoring are demographic,
such as age, gender, and other personal variables (e.g. Aagaard & Hauer, 2003; Cronan-Hillix et
al., 1986; Rose, 2005; Wilde & Schau, 1991), yet little is known about the connection of salient
diversity variables (e.g., race, ethnicity, sexual orientation) and mentorship experiences and
outcomes (Crosby, 1999; Erkut & Mokros, 1984; Ragins, 1999).

Finally, nearly all of the research on student–faculty mentorships involves retrospective surveybased self-reports from the perspective of former undergraduate or graduate students, which
result in a comparatively higher cost and small size of sample for analysis, with one exceptional
study by Malmgren et al. (2010), which concludes that doctoral advisors’ “fecundity” (number of
advisees an advisor has trained) is related to their scholarly performance in the discipline of
Mathematics.

This dissertation analyzes the relationship between the scholarly practice and performance of
advisees and advisors based on massive data from ProQuest and Web of Science. It allows for
quantitative analyses based on large-scale and longitudinal data, and has the potentiality of
advancing student-faculty mentoring research both theoretically and methodologically.

Publication, Collaboration, and Citation

Scholarly practice analysis can be operationalized in various ways, depending on the fields
where the study is conducted. Informetric approaches will be applied in this dissertation to

27

capture the scholarly practice and performance of advisors and advises from different
disciplines, since productivity, impact and collaboration are three major elements examined in
informetrics. Informetrics provides an advantage for operationalizing scholarly practice studies
by enabling large-scale analysis with comparatively low financial cost. This section will introduce
the informetric approaches utilized in this dissertation for the analysis of advisor and advisee
scholarly behavior and performance. It will begin with a brief introduction to informetrics and
proceed to describe common informetric approaches for the study of productivity, impact, and
collaboration.

Informetric Approaches for Scholarly Practice Analyses
In the community of information science, the term informetrics entered into use in the 1980s, as
a general field of study which includes the earlier fields of bibliometrics and scientometrics. It
was codified by the 1989 International Conference on Bibliometrics, Scientometrics and
Informetrics, which is now known as the conference of the International Society on
Scientometrics and Informetrics (ISSI). Since that time, the field of informetrics has expanded,
including areas of research such as webometrics, cybermetrics, and other related areas.

The earliest known terminology related to informetrics is statistical bibliography, which studies
science and technology history by the simple counting of documents (Hulme, 1923). Later, it was
replaced with the term bibliometrics by Pritchard (1969), which refers to the field of studying
the quantitative aspects of the production, dissemination, and utilization of documents.
Scientometrics, derived from the Russian “naukometiria”, is defined as the “study of the
quantitative aspects of science as a discipline or economic activity” (Tague-sutcliffe, 1992, p. 1).
Scientometrics is also the title of the major journal of this this field, originally founded by Tibor
Braun in 1977 in Hungary.

28

Among many definitions of informetrics, the one by Tague-Sutcliffe (1992)—“the study of
quantitative aspects of information in any form, not just records or bibliographies, and in any
social group, not just scientist” (p. 1)—is widely accepted. A new research field related to
informetrics, i.e., webometrics, emerged in the mid-1990s with the development of Internetrelated technologies. Generally speaking, the field of webometrics is the utilization of
informetric methods to inform the study of the World Wide Web (WWW) (Almind & Ingwersen,
1997). Almind and Ingwerson (1997) claim that “informetrics is the research into information in
a broad sense and not only restricted to scientific communication… …webometrics covers
research of all network-based communication using informetric or other quantitative measures”
(p. 404). The term cybermetrics is often used synonymously with webometrics, but is in fact not
identical. Björneborn (2004) defined cybermetrics in his thesis as “the study of the quantitative
aspects of the construction and use of information resources, structures and technologies on
the whole Internet drawing on bibliometric and informetric approaches” (p. 13).

The relationship between these “metrics” mentioned above is revealed clearly in Figure 2-1,
excerpted from (Björneborn & Ingwersen, 2004). The figure further shows the field of
webometrics entirely encompassed by bibliometrics, because web documents, whether text or
multimedia, are recorded information stored on web servers. This recording may be temporary,
as not all paper documents are properly archived. Webometrics is partially covered by
scientometrics, as many scholarly activities today are web-based while other such activities are
beyond bibliometrics, i.e., non-recorded conversation between scholars. Finally, cybermetrics
includes the whole field of webometrics and is thus broader: the former also covers quantitative
measures of the topology and traffic of the Internet (cf. Molyneux & Williams, 1999). To this
end, the term informetrics is adopted in this review in that it is the broadest in terms of
coverage and science studies are now indeed based on information in all forms.
29

(Björneborn & Ingwersen, 2004)

Informetrics is often employed in science studies for the purpose of evaluative and relational
analysis (Borgman & Furner, 2002). Evaluative informetric research mainly focuses on using
indicators (e.g., the Journal Impact Factor and h-index) for scientific performance assessment of
different scientific entities, while relational informetric studies usually explore the relative role
of scientific entities in networks built upon different relations, e.g., citation, co-citation, and
collaboration relationships. This review will cover works related to the study of scientists’
publication, collaboration and citation behaviors.

Scientists as Authors
Informetrics largely relies on bibliographic data, i.e., publication and citation data. It is therefore
not surprising that most informetric research focuses on scientists who publish papers, i.e.,
authors. Scientists are creative individuals and creators of scientific knowledge (Storer, 1966).

30

Scientists publish to inform the world their findings (Cronin, 2005), in which case they become
authors. Not all scientists are necessary authors, and not all authors are necessary scientists. As
Montgomery (2003) mentioned, the process of doing science is a process of communicating. It
almost unlikely that one can do science without communicating, implicitly or explicitly, so these
two things—authors and scientists—are interconnected. This review assumes, at least in
informetric approaches for science studies, authors of scientific publications are representative
of scientists.

Authors, as distinct entities, caught the attention of the informetrics community in the early
1980s. Small (1978), as well as Garfield (1955, 1956), argued that a document is usually cited for
theories, methods, or conclusions, and thus each document could be a concept symbol when
cited. White and Griffith (1981) extended Small’s idea on cited documents as concept symbols
to a higher level of aggregation, i.e., authors. As the indispensable part of scientific activity,
scientists (in this particular case, an author) report their research results related to their subject
areas. White and Griffith (1982) claimed that authors are in fact the “markers of intellectual
space” (p.255): Two co-cited authors have certain kind of subject relatedness, and a cluster of
frequently co-cited authors in fact marks the intellectual structure of disciplines. White and
Griffith’s claim of “authors as markers of intellectual space” set the foundation of author cocitation analysis, co-authorship analysis, and venue-author-coupling analysis.

Price (1963) noticed that the distribution of productivity (in terms of publication quantity)
among scientists is highly skewed. Specifically, he recognized that the universe of scientific
communication is dominated by skewed distributions, and followed Galton’s elitist philosophy in
assuming that there exist only a limited number of people with the talent necessary to become
a scientist (Price, 1963). Price (1963) also noted the relationship between scientists and

31

scientific growth: “using any reasonable definition of a scientist, we can say that 80 to 90
percent of all the scientists that have ever lived are alive now” (Price, 1963, p. 1). He claimed
that this feature seems to be dominant in modern science and made science essentially
contemporaneous.

Although scientists are not necessary faculty members, faculty at research institutions
constitute the major component of scientists (Merton, 1976). When those faculty members
publish, they become authors, which reflects their role as researchers. Informetric approaches
can be utilized to measure their behaviors as researchers.

Publication and Productivity
Publication is the primary approach of disseminating scientific discoveries. Scholars publish their
scientific findings to claim intellectual priority (Merton, 1957), to disseminate their knowledge
to the world and communicate with peers (Borgman & Furner, 2002). In this way, the volume of
publications to some extent displays the productivity of scholars, and the scientific performance
of scholars therefore can be evaluated by assessing their publications. As Bornmann and Daniel
(2009) assert, “identifying high-quality science is necessary for science to progress…” (p. 2). In
today’s world, the importance of scientific performance assessment cannot be overemphasized. Policy makers want to know the performance of scientific entities for the allocation
of scientific resources and Institutions want to know how faculty members performed
academically for the purpose of promotion and tenure. This section will mainly focus on those
studies dealing with the productivity of scholars, especially faculty members in research
institutions.
The examination of scholarly productivity began in the late 19th century and has seen continued
interest. Statistical bibliography, the earliest terminology for bibliometrics, was initiated in
32

Hulme (1923) to describe the process of studying by the simple counting of documents.
Statistical bibliography began with simple quantitative studies (i.e., descriptive statistical
analysis) of literature and cited references, and can be traced back to the 1890s, when the some
statistical studies of bibliography were done in Europe (c.f. Egghe & Rousseau, 1990).

Scholars explored the overall patterns of productivity in various settings. Price, one of the
pioneers of informetrics, noticed that the distribution of productivity (in terms of publication
quantity) among scientists is highly skewed: there exist only a limited number of people with the
talent necessary to become a scientist in scientific communication (Price, 1963). He also sought
to give a more precise estimation of the “skewness” through a square root law of productivity
modified from Lotka’s law, which describes the frequency distribution of publications by authors
in any given domain: the number of authors making n contributions is about 1/n2 of those
making one contribution (Lotka, 1926). Cole’s (1979) work also confirms the concentration of
productivity: 15% of the groups in the natural, biological and social sciences accounted for half
of all papers published. Allison and Stewart (Allison & Stewart, 1974) also found a skewed
distribution of productivity and believed that it can be explained partially by accumulative
advantage (Merton, 1968).

The productivity of faculty members is usually calculated as an indication of reputation, visibility
and advancement in the academic reward system (Fairweather, 2002). The main measurement
of publication productivity is simple: the count of publications and some variants. The more
publications that a scientist has published, the more productive the scientist is believed to be
(Adkins & Budd, 2006; Larivière, 2012; Pudovkin, Kretschmer, Stegmann, & Garfield, 2012).

Factors that may have impact on the publication productivity of scientists have been examined
widely. It has been investigated that the publication productivity varies among scientists,
33

depending on the discipline or area the scientists work in (e.g. Allison & Stewart, 1974; Baird,
1991; Petersen, Wang, & Stanley, 2010). In addition, scholars have found that the publication
productivity of faculty scientists is associated with the context of the academic affiliations where
they work (Crane, 1965), the prestige of the department (Hagstrom, 1971), the academic
position that the scientists hold in the scientific career (Long, 1978), age (e.g. J. R. Cole, 1979;
Diamond, 1986; M. Oromaner, 1977), gender and race (e.g. Fox, 2005; Kaplan et al., 1996; Xie &
Shauman, 1998), collaboration (e.g. Cooke, 1989; Landry, Traore, & Godin, 1996; S. Lee &
Bozeman, 2005; Price & Beaver, 1966), and doctoral origins (e.g. Berelson, 1960; Caplow &
McGee, 2001). This dissertation extends studies of productivity by examining the degree to
which the publication productivity of doctoral advisors is related to the publication patterns of
advisees.

Citation and Impact
In the field of sociology of science, citation is one type of recognition (Small, 2004), or reward
(Cronin, 2005; Merton, 1957) given to scientists for the contribution made to the system of
science (Storer, 1966). In the field of scientometrics, citation is a connection between citing and
cited entities (e.g. Small, 1978). Citation count has long been used as an indication of scientific
impact (e.g. Garfield, Malin, & Small, 1983; King, 2004). Some scholars, however, argue that
citation counts are not appropriate proxies for impact (Walter, Bloch, Hunt, & Fisher, 2003):
they are rather an indication of popularity instead of quality or prestige (Ding & Cronin, 2011)
and should not be used as an indicator of scientific impact assessment (Seglen, 1997).
Arguments over what a citation really indicates are raised by the fact that the motivations of
each referencing action is different, thus simple counting of citations is rough and biased (Ni,
2012). Informetric measurement of scientific impact is mostly based on the citation count for
the evaluation of scholars and aggregates (e.g., citation count and h-index), journals (Journal
34

Impact Factor), and even disciplines (h-b index) (Banks, 2006). This review will examine
literature on the evaluation of individual scholars, focusing on simple citation counts and the hindex.

The citation count of an individual scholar is the aggregate of the citations to papers written by
that scholar. Counting the times that a document was cited appeared in the earliest studies of
bibliometrics (e.g. Cole & Eales, 1917; Gross & Gross, 1927) and is the basis of most citationbased indicators. Generally, the citations that an article received is regarded as the scientific
influence of the article: the more citations an article receives, the more influential it is to the
scientific community (Garfield, 1955). Analogically, the more citations an author receives for her
publications, the more influential the author is. Citation count has been frequently used to
evaluate the impact of scientists. For instance, Meho and Yang (2007) used citation counts of
faculty members in Library and Information Science as an indication of scientific impact. Similar
approaches have been adopted to evaluate the impact of faculty members in psychology
(Endler, Rushton, & Roediger, 1978), business (Brown & Gardner, 1985), and biology (Sonnert,
1995).

However, simple citation counts are often criticized due to their cumulative nature: the citation
count of individual scholars increases by time, and thus will favor more established scholars;
similarly, citation count accumulates with paper quantity so that highly productive scholars
receive more citations (Walter et al., 2003). Therefore, alternative citation-related metrics of
impact assessment are needed.

Of all the indices developed for individual scientific performance evaluation, the h-index has
received the most attention. In Hirsh’s (2005) original paper, he used the publication and
citation data of scientists who received a Nobel Prize, aiming to find a simple and useful way to
35

capture the scientific performance of scholars. As described by Hirsch (2005): a “scientist has
index h if h of his or her Np papers have at least h citations each and the other (Np – h) papers
have ≤h citations each” (p.16569). The h-index received wide reception from the scientific
community, in that it takes into account both the productivity of researchers (number of papers)
and the recognition from the scientific community (citations) (Zhivotovsky & Krutovsky, 2008).
The h-index is now a widely adopted indicator of scientific performance and “has become a
built-in feature of major bibliographic databases such as Web of Science and Scopus” (van Eck &
Waltman, 2008, p. 263). The h-index was widely accepted due to the fact that it is easy to
compute and is a simple indicator capturing both the productivity and impact of researchers’
scientific output (Hirsch, 2005). Glänzel (2006) also recognized that the h-index can be extended
to any level of aggregates, e.g., research teams, institutions, and country, though performs best
when evaluating individual scholars. The h-index also proved to be a robust cumulative indicator
in that an increase in the number of publications will not affect the index (Glänzel, 2006). The hindex is insensitive to database errors in data collection, extremely highly cited and lowly cited
papers (Liu & Rousseau, 2007, 2009; Vanclay, 2007).

Right after the appearance of the h-index, Bornmann and Daniel (2005) asserted that the hindex is a promising measurement of scientific influence of young scholars, by comparing the hindices and expert judgment on the scientific performance of scholars in the field of biomedical
sciences. Additionally, subsequent studies have utilized the h-index for the assessment of
individual scholars. For instance, Cronin and Meho (2006) ranked a set of information scientists
by their h-index scores, and showed that the h-index can be used to express the broad impact of
a scholar's research output over time. During the same year, van Raan (2006) examined the hindex of a group of chemists, and concluded that h-index is comparable to peer judgment. After
these earlier validation studies of the h-index, studies assessing the scientific performance of
36

scholars in different fields began, e.g., biomedicine (Bornmann, Mutz, & Daniel, 2008), business
(Saad, 2006), physics (Schreiber, 2007a), economics (Ellison, 2010), and neurosurgery (J. Lee,
Kraus, & Couldwell, 2009). The h-index has been widely adopted to assess the research
performance of individual scholars (e.g. Cronin & Meho, 2006; Meho & Rogers, 2008), university
departments (e.g. Da Luz et al., 2008; Lazaridis, 2010), countries (e.g. Csajbók, Berhidi, Vasas, &
Schubert, 2007), and journals (Braun, Glänzel, & Schubert, 2005; Vanclay, 2008).

Yet, the h-index has some drawbacks, some of which it shares with other citation-based indices
and some specific to itself. Firstly, the h-index is field-dependent due to differences among fields
in productivity and citation patterns (Hirsch, 2005). Secondly, the h-index is influenced by selfcitations (Schreiber, 2007b). Thirdly, the number of co-authors might have an impact on the hindex but was not taken into consideration in the original h-index (Schreiber, 2008). Finally, it
has precision problems (Rousseau, 2008): it is hard to collect complete publication and citation
records for scholars due to problems like name ambiguity. In addition, the h-index has some
disadvantages specific to itself. For instance, it depends on the duration of the researcher’s
career to compute, and thus is not fair to newcomers of a field. Egghe’s (2006) concern on the hindex is that the actual number of citations is not considered: the number of citations becomes
unimportant once a paper has been highly cited, which, in practice, makes the researcher with
some extremely highly cited papers have a similar h-index value as researchers with moderately
cited papers. For more detailed discussion on h-index and its variants, please refer to Egghe
(2010).

At present, it has been increasingly important to measure the scientific performance of the
scientific community. In fact, many research assessment decisions, e.g., the funding of research
projects, hiring researchers, and awarding scientific prices, rely largely upon the scientific merits

37

of the involved researchers. Therefore, it is crucial to find proper indicators for reliable
assessment of individual researchers’ scientific performances. In this dissertation, the h-index
will be used as one of the indicators for the assessment of impact for both advisors and
advisees, to look at the relationship between the h-index of advisees and doctoral advisors’ hindex.

Co-authoring and Collaboration
Scientific collaboration, mostly operationalized by co-authorship analysis, refers to the
phenomenon that two or more scholars contributed to the same piece of scientific work.
Scientific collaboration can refer to more than co-authoring publication, and it can be
collaboration on other types of work—for instance, collaboration on research grant is also a
type of collaboration. In informetrics, scientific collaboration and co-authorship is often used
interchangeably, probably because co-authoring is the most common way of scientific
collaboration, and easily studied at a large scale recently: major bibliographic database (e.g.
WoS and Scopus) index every author on a publication.

The earliest recorded collaborative scientific paper found was written in 1665 by Hook,
Oldenburg, Cassini and Boyle (c.f. Beaver & Rosen, 1978). Collaborative articles continued to
appear after that, and began to increase dramatically in the 19th century (Beaver & Rosen,
1978). Scientific collaboration was first studied at the individual author level, i.e., how individual
authors collaborate with each other within and between certain scientific communities (Krichel
& Bakkalbasi, 2006; Newman, 2001a, 2001b). With the increasing availability of collaboration
data, studies on scientific collaboration began to extend to different levels of author aggregates
(e.g., research teams, institutions, fields, and countries). For instance, scientific collaboration
among scientific institutions (Thijs & Glänzel, 2010; van Rijnsoever, Hessels, & Vandeberg, 2008),

38

fields (Fox, 2008), and countries (He, 2009; Luukkonen, Persson, & Sivertsen, 1992; C.S. Wagner,
2005) has occupied recent investigations.

Scientific collaboration is an important approach for mapping science. Beaver and Rosen’s
(1978a; 1978b; 1979) pioneering studies on scientific collaboration, the idea of the “Invisible
College” by Price and Beaver (1966), and White’s “authors as markers of intellectual space” (H.
D. White & Griffith, 1982) laid the theoretical foundation for the utilization of co-authorship for
science mapping. In the domain of chemical engineering, Peters and Van Raan (1991) created a
landscape of collaboration by grouping authors based on co-authorship in a set of publications.
Validation from expert judges demonstrated that the co-author clusters were meaningful with
respect to the identification of research groups, the relations within these groups, as well as to
the structure of that domain as identified by groups of authors. Börner, Dall'Asta, Ke, and
Vespignani (2005) worked on a set of 1,036 authors and grouped them into clusters based on
co-authorships, which partially captures the social structure of the topics. However, large-scale
collaboration network analysis for mapping science structure did not begin to flourish until
Newman’s studies on collaboration networks (Newman, 2001a, 2001b), where he proposed an
approach to constructing, analyzing, and interpreting collaboration networks. Following these
studies, Girvan and Newman (2002) analyzed the structure and communities in both social and
biological networks, though their foci are underlying algorithms rather than the social structure
of these domains. This is largely the case for their subsequent research as well (e.g. 2003, 2004a,
2004c, 2005; Newman & Girvan, 2004). Many other scholars have investigated collaboration
through network approaches, but mostly in the field of informetrics (e.g. Leydesdorff & Wagner,
2008; X. Liu, Bollen, Nelson, & Van de Sompel, 2005; Yan, Ding, & Zhu, 2010).

39

To further explore scientific collaboration patterns in science, scholars have examined the
motivation and strategies of collaboration. Within this body of research, the most commonly cited
reasons for research collaboration include access to expertise (D. Beaver, 2001; Katz & Martin,
1997; Melin, 2000), access to equipment or resources (Melin, 2000; Thorsteinsdóttir, 2000),
access to funding (D. Beaver, 2001; Smith, 1958), increase of prestige or visibility (Beaver & Rosen,
1978, 1979a, 1979b; Crane, 1972), encouragement of cross-fertilization across disciplines (Beaver
& Rosen, 1978, 1979a, 1979b), enhancement of productivity (D. Beaver, 2001; Thorsteinsdóttir,
2000), education of students (Beaver, 2001b; Beaver & Rosen, 1978; Crane, 1972; Melin, 2000),
dealing with increasing specialization of science (Bush & Hattery, 1956; Melin, 2000; Smith, 1958),
and for fun and pleasure (Katz & Martin, 1997; Melin, 2000;Thorsteinsdottir, 2000; Beaver, 2001).
Scientific collaboration is suggested to have an influence on citation and productivity (Beaver &
Rosen, 1979a; Bozeman, Lee, Gaughan, & Chompalov, 2003; S. Lee & Bozeman, 2005). In addition,
scientific collaboration seems to be associated with spatial proximity (T. J. Allen, 1977; Katz, 1992;
Kraut, Egido, & Galegher, 1988), organizational mentoring (Bozeman & Corley, 2004; Bozeman et
al., 2003), and also gender (Bozeman & Corley, 2004; Hagstrom, 1975).
In sum, scientific collaboration has been studied for decades and has been found to carry many
positive benefits. Yet, no large-scale and thorough studies have been conducted to investigate
how the doctoral advisor and advisee relationship is related to collaboration, and how advisoradvisee collaboration is related to the future of the scholarly practice of doctoral advisees. This
dissertation seeks to fill this gap.

Summary
This chapter mainly covers literature regarding scholarly practice, focusing on previous
informetric studies on the productivity, collaboration, and citation patterns of scholars. The
number of publications that an individual has is usually regarded as an important indicator of
40

scientific productivity, citation count, and h-index are the two major indicators of individual
scientific impact assessment, and co-author networks are used in informetrics to investigate
scholars’ collaboration pattern.

However, these scholarly practice studies focus on the research role that scholars perform: they
measure scholars’ scientific performance by looking into their research outputs (scientific
publications). The other important role of a faculty member, teaching (mainly in the form of
mentoring in doctoral education), has been largely neglected. Faculty members at research
institutions not only have the obligation of advancing scientific discoveries, but also of training
the next generation of scholars. To fill the gap, this dissertation will focus on mentoring
relationships, investigating whether mentors’ scholarly behavior as a researcher is passed to
their protégés, and whether this varies by discipline.

Name Disambiguation and Heterogeneous Data Integration

One essential task of this study to merge multiple databases: ProQuest and Web of Science, in
order to perform the proposed analyses. Disambiguating author names is a prerequisite task of
integrating these databases. This section reviews previous studies related to author name
disambiguation and heterogeneous data integration.

Author name disambiguation is an important technique with wide applications in
different domains. For example, many bibliometric analysis approaches (such as the
author co-citation analysis (White & Griffith, 1981)) consider authors as the unit of
analysis. These approaches require disambiguated authors and their publications to
prepare input to perform analysis. Failing to disambiguate authors may lead to
extremely biased statistics of authors’ productivity (Strotmann, Zhao, & Bubela, 2009).
Another example is that authors (and people in general) are usually units of
41

information that are of interest in information seeking. Many studied search and
recommendation systems for scholars and experts in different scenarios (e.g., expert
finding (Balog, Azzopardi, & De Rijke, 2006; Xiaoyong Liu, Croft, & Koll, 2005), assigning
reviewers (Conry, Koren, & Ramakrishnan, 2009), forming conference program committees
(S. Han, He, Jiang, & Yue, 2013), predicting or suggesting co-authors (Al Hasan, Chaoji,
Salem, & Zaki, 2006; Sun, Barber, Gupta, Aggarwal, & Han, 2011) etc.)

The Author Name Disambiguation Problem
The author name disambiguation problem is complex in nature due to the ambiguity of
a person’s name and other issues (e.g. the process by which the publication data is
stored and maintained in digital libraries). Although some existing studies reported
over 90% accuracy in related tasks, the representativeness and generalizability of their
datasets and experiments are limited (Kang, Kim, Lee, Jung, & You, 2011). It remains a
challenging but an important unsolved problem in digital libraries. Smalheiser and Torvik
(2009) summarized several challenges in author name disambiguation:

Firstly, the same person may use different names in different articles. For example, in
some countries, name changes caused by marriage and religion is common. This increases
the difficulty of tracking individuals’ publications over time. Author name ambiguity
caused by this reason may also show country and gender bias—name changes can be
more prevalent in some countries compared with others, and it is usually more common
for females to take their male partner’s family names in marriage.

Secondly, different individuals may publish under the same name. This is especially
common for popular names. In addition, the ambiguity of a name naturally increases
when the scope of the problem and the size of the collection enlarge. Therefore, author
42

name disambiguation is usually more important and necessary when the problem of
interest spans multiple disciplines. In addition, Strotmann et al. (2009) also found that
Romanized names of Chinese and Korean authors are extremely ambiguous, indicating
that this issue may also show country bias.

Thirdly, metadata of articles are not necessarily available for disambiguating author
identity. This is common for online academic repositories such as CiteSeer and ArnetMiner,
where metadata of articles are collected online and from different sources. Another typical
scenario is to disambiguate identity of authors based on the bibliographic references listed
by academic articles. In such case, the accuracy of references and the completeness of
information largely depend on the authors of the articles. However, even many
commercial academic databases cannot guarantee complete article metadata. This is
especially the case for old articles.

Lastly, co-authoring among authors from multiple disciplines and different institutions
increases the difficulty of author name disambiguation. This is because co-authorship is
usually considered as strong and precise evidence for disambiguating authors’ identities.
For example, Kang et al. (2009) proposed the “co-author disambiguation hypothesis”: the
identity of an author is characterized by his/her co-authors (in fact, the name of coauthors). But, multi-disciplinary collaboration largely increases the space of co-authors’
names, increasing the chances that two different authors co-author with different scholars
with the same name (which is usually a strong feature that the two authors are the same
individual).

The author name disambiguation problem also shares similarities with many other
problems. For example, citation matching (Giles, Bollacker, & Lawrence, 1998;
43

Lawrence, Giles, & Bollacker, 1999; McRae-Spencer & Shadbolt, 2006) aims at
recognizing the correct article for an occurrence of a citation in an article, or identify
whether or not two citations refer to the same article. Both techniques are based on
approaches for measuring the similarity of two records of articles. In addition, it is also
similar to the problem of address matching (Bilenko, Mooney, Cohen, Ravikumar, & Fienberg,
2003; Tejada, Knoblock, & Minton, 2002) that aims at consolidating different variants for the
same addresses, although addresses and articles consist of different data fields.

Approaches for Author Name Disambiguation
The author name disambiguation problem can be formulated as follows (Ferreira, Gonçalves, &
Laender, 2012): grouping a set of article occurrences into unique authors and their lists of
publications, or assigning a set of article occurrences to a set of known authors. The problem
takes a set of article occurrences as input. Here an article occurrence can be, for example, an
article record stored in an academic database, or references listed by an article, and etc.
Different types of article occurrences provide different information for disambiguation (and thus
the approaches taken may vary as well). For example, academic databases usually provide
regularized and relatively clean article records, with a wide range of data fields other than
author name, article title, and the name of the publication venue (such as author institution,
publisher, etc.). In contrast, references listed by academic articles usually only provide a limited
number of necessary data fields (e.g., author name, article title, publication year, and the name
of the publication venue), and they vary a lot in formats (which makes it difficult to
parse the data fields). Inaccurate data (e.g., typos, incomplete data fields, incorrect
information) is also common among references, which requires techniques to take into
account such inaccuracies.

44

Practically, many author name disambiguation techniques also applied various text
normalizations to preprocess the raw data to account for the high variability of
academic publication information. For example, CiteSeer (Giles et al., 1998) normalized
data by transforming all letters to lowercase, removing hyphens, expanding common
abbreviations such as “conf” and “proc”, removing extraneous words such as “pp.”
“pages”, “in press”, “vol”, “no”, “isbn”, and “etc”. McCallum, Nigam, and Ungar (2000)
reduced dates to four-digit years, and truncated titles and venues to include only the
first 60 characters. Han, Giles, Zha, Li, and Tsioutsiouliklis (2004) stemmed words using
Kroverts stemming and removed stop words when measuring text similarity. These preprocessing techniques are helpful, both to account for different variants of the same
information (e.g., “proc” and “proceedings”) and to reduce the computational
complexity (e.g., reduce the vocabulary size).

Approaches for author name disambiguation vary a lot, but almost all of them are
based on some ways of measuring the similarity of articles. The fundamental step of
performing author name disambiguation is to determine whether or not two authors
who occurred in two articles are the same individual based on the similarity
measurement. The similarity can be measured using either supervised or unsupervised
approaches:

Supervised approaches for author name disambiguation (Han et al., 2004; Tan, Kan, &
Lee, 2006; Tang, Zhang, Zhang, & Li, 2008; Torvik & Smalheiser, 2009; Zhang, Tang, Li, &
Wang, 2007) formulate the problem as a binary classification problem—taking
information of two authors and their two articles as input, determine whether or not
the two authors are the same individual based on trained classifiers. This process

45

requires the existence of training data—ideally disambiguated authors and their
publication lists judged by an expert—to train models for classification.

The lack of large-scale and representative training data is a key practical limitation for
supervised approaches. Therefore, many also explored using automatically generated
highly precise evidence as training surrogates (e.g., consider two authors with the same
email address as the same individual and others as different individuals) (Ferreira,
Veloso, Gonçalves, & Laender, 2010; Levin, Krawczyk, Bethard, & Jurafsky, 2012;
Pereira et al., 2009). In addition, some also adopted active learning approaches to
improve author name disambiguation based on user feedback from running digital
library systems (Li, Wen, Lin, Li, & Lu, 2014; Wang, Tang, Cheng, & Yu, 2011)

Unsupervised approaches for author named disambiguation (Huang, Ertekin, & Giles,
2006; McCallum et al., 2000; McRae-Spencer & Shadbolt, 2006; Pereira et al., 2009;
Song, Huang, Councill, Li, & Giles, 2007; Yang, Peng, Jiang, Lee, & Ho, 2008) rely on ad
hoc similarity measures to determine the closeness of two articles and their authors.
For example, some popular ad hoc measures include edit distance of two articles’
strings and the TF×IDF scores for the unigram tokens of two articles. The process of
disambiguating authors is usually to perform clustering of author occurrences based on
ad hoc similarity measures. The generated clusters represent individual authors and
their publication lists. This approach is usually adopted when no training data is
available, but it still relies on manually labeled instances to evaluate the accuracy of
unsupervised approaches.

Both supervised and unsupervised approaches rely on effective features indicating the
identity of authors to perform author name disambiguation. These features can be
46

summarized into the following categories according to the types of information used
for computing features:

Author name match. Much work (Giles et al., 1998; Han et al., 2004; Lawrence et al.,
1999; McCallum et al., 2000; Pasula, Marthi, Milch, Russell, & Shpitser, 2002) involved
features measuring the match of two authors’ names. Author names appearing in
published English-language articles usually include several different units, e.g., last
name, first name, middle name, and the initials of first name and/or middle name.
Author name match features tend to assign higher confidence to authors sharing more
name units (e.g., it looks more confident to believe that Stephen E. Robertson and S. E.
Robertson refer to the same person, compared with Stephen E. Robertson and S.
Robertson). For example, Pasula et al. (2002) considered matching of first name, last
name, and the number of first name components as features. In addition, some work
also took into account possible inaccuracies in author names (e.g., assign a high
matching score for Smith and Smtih because it looks almost for sure to be a typo) such
as using the Levenshtein or the LikeIt edit distance (Yianilos & Kanzelberger, 1997; P. N.
Yianilos, 1993). Practically, author name match is also commonly adopted as evidence
for generating candidates that require disambiguation. For example, almost all existing
work targets disambiguating authors sharing at least the same last name (and more
common, sharing the same last name and first name initial). This is practically useful
and necessary, because it is extremely inefficient to assess every possible pair of author
occurrences (the computational complexity is O(nn) where n is the total number of
author occurrences), especially when the dataset is large. Yet this makes almost all
existing approaches only restricted to the scenario when two or more authors share the
same name—other cases such as name changes for the same individual are not taken
47

into account because they would be filtered at the very first step of author name
disambiguation.

Email match. Two authors sharing the same email address are almost for sure the same
person (Levin et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2007). Sharing the same email address is a
strong positive feature for grouping authors. However, it is also common for the same
author to use multiple email addresses, e.g., moving to a new institution. Therefore,
different email addresses do not necessarily indicate different authors. In addition,
some work used email match to extract training data for author name disambiguation
automatically (Levin et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2007). This is a cheap way of obtaining
training data. However, it may also involve bias related to article publishing date,
because many old articles do not include author email information (Giles et al., 1998; H.
Han et al., 2004; Lawrence et al., 1999; McCallum et al., 2000; Pasula et al., 2002).
Moreover, the use of an email address is relatively less common in existing studies due
to the fact that many work targets the author name disambiguation problems among
references provided by academic articles, where author email information is not
available.

Coauthor match. Two authors sharing co-authors with the same name are likely the
same person (Ferreira et al., 2012; Ferreira et al., 2010; McRae-Spencer & Shadbolt,
2006). For example, Kang et al. (2011) discussed the “co-author disambiguation
hypothesis”: the identity of an author is characterized by his/her co-authors. Tang et al.
(2012) further considered an extended version of this heuristic called τ -coauthor (the
co-authors co-authored in some other article, or even the co-authors of the co-authors
co-authored in some other articles). Similar to email match, coauthor match is

48

sometimes also considered as a highly precise evidence and has been used for
automatically generating training instances (Ferreira et al., 2012; Ferreira et al., 2010;
Levin et al., 2012). However, practically the identities of coauthors remain unknown,
and we can only make use of coauthors’ names for inference. Therefore, the
effectiveness of coauthor match also depends on the ambiguity of coauthors in the
collection-increasing the size of the collection may increase the ambiguity of coauthors
and reduce the effectiveness of coauthor match features.

Article content similarity. Two authors are more likely the same person if their
occurred articles are related in content (Song et al., 2007; Torvik & Smalheiser, 2009).
For example, two “S. E. Robertsons” from an information retrieval article and an
economics article are less likely the same person (because it is less common for the
same author to publish in completely different domains), which can be detected by
measuring the similarity of the two articles. Article content similarity features are
usually based on words in article titles, which can further be enriched using article
keywords, abstracts, or even full texts when such information is available. Almost all
approaches for measuring text similarity can be applied to assess article content
similarity, such as the number of shared words between two article titles and the
TF×IDF scores between two titles. However, the effectiveness of article content
similarity feature is limited by the amount of text information available (usually only
article titles) and the vocabulary mismatch problem. Thus, author name disambiguation
techniques may benefit from more robust representations of contents such as those
based on topic models. For example, Song et al. (2007) extended the PLSA and LDA
models to represent the distribution of words and names (as “topics”) in articles to
perform unsupervised author name disambiguation.
49

Publication venue similarity. Two authors from articles published in the same
publication venue (or two related venues from the same field) are likely the same
person (Han et al., 2004; McCallum et al., 2000; Tang et al., 2012; Tang et al., 2008;
Zhang et al., 2007). Publication venue similarity features can be considered as a
generalized form of article content similarity at higher levels than words (such as at
topic or domain levels). For example, Yang et al. (2008) measured topic similarity as the
closeness of topics for articles’ publication venues.

Institution match. Two authors with the same name from the same institution are
almost for sure the same person (Tang et al., 2012; Tang et al., 2008; Zhang et al.,
2007). For example, Zhang et al. (2007) described this heuristic as “co-org” relationship.
However, only a limited number of existing works used institution match features,
probably due to the fact that such data is only available in academic databases. In
addition, moving to different institution is common (for almost all authors), thus
applying institution match features may also be risky.

Citation network. Citation network may also help author name disambiguation when
such information is available (McRae-Spencer & Shadbolt, 2006; Tang et al., 2012; Tang
et al., 2008). For example, two authors are likely the same person if they come from
two articles where one cites another (because scholars tend to cite their own work)
(McRae-Spencer & Shadbolt, 2006). In addition, authors from articles with shared
references or citations are likely the same author. Yet the prevalence of using citation
network in author name disambiguation is limited, probably due to the limited data
availability and the relatively high cost of computing features in citation networks.

50

Web page co-occurrence. Author name disambiguation may also benefit from
leveraging external information from the web. Authors from two articles that appear in
the same web page are likely the same person (Pereira et al., 2009; Tan et al., 2006).
Such information is usually collected by formulating search queries to general web
search engines, and then calculating the number of shared web pages among top
returned results. For example, Tan et al. (2006) used article titles as search phrases and
used returned results from general web search engines to perform author name
disambiguation. Pereira et al. (2009) used two types of queries: author name
(unquoted) plus the word publications; author name (unquoted) plus the article’s title
(quoted).

User feedback. Running digital library systems may take advantage user feedback
information to improve author name disambiguation. For example, Tang et al. (2012)
involved user feedback information during author name disambiguation. (Li et al.,
2014) explored three types of user feedback: fully credible (the author him/herself or
the author’s co-authors), credible user feedback (from friends of the author), and
generally credible (from users without explicit relation with the author).

Data and Methods

To quantify the relationship between advisors and advisees in terms of their scientometric
profiles, this study relies on two major data sources: ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
database (ProQuest) and Web of Science (WoS) bibliographic database. The former provides
information for advisor-advisee relationship, and the latter the scientometric profiles of advisors
and advisees, including publication, collaboration, reference and citation practices. To perform
the analyses, these two databases were integrated, using a series of name disambiguation and
data integration solutions. After that, some scientometric measurements were employed to
study the scientometric profiles of advisors and advisees. Multiple statistical and visualization
techniques were utilized in order to answer the research questions. This chapter introduces the
details of the data sources, ways that the heterogeneous data sources were managed and
integrated, and the statistical analysis and visualization techniques employed.

3.1

Data Source

ProQuest Dissertations & Theses and Web of Science are the two main databases utilized in this
study. This section introduces some basic features of the data that makes subsequent analyses
feasible, and how they were processed for the purpose of analyses.

ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Database
ProQuest Dissertations & Theses (hereafter ProQuest) utilized in this study were kindly provided
by ProQuest LLC. for research use. It is the world's most comprehensive collection of
dissertations and theses in English, and the official digital dissertations archive for the Library of

52

Congress, according to its website7. In this study, ProQuest is the major source of mentorship
information needed for further analyses.

Originally provided in the format of Extended Markup Language (XML) by ProQuest LLC., as of
the March of 2012, ProQuest covers over 2.3 million dissertation titles ranging from the year of
1743 to 2012. The majority (90%) of the records are research doctoral dissertations, with a few
master, bachelor and professional degrees. These dissertations were conferred in 1,458
institutions across 66 countries, in 165 ProQuest disciplines and 432 ProQuest Subject
Categories8. Please see Figure 3-1 for a sample dissertation record provided by ProQuest.

Details regarding the ProQuest Subject Categories and disciplines will be discussed in the
subsequent sections.

53

Original files were then parsed using a Java application and stored in MySQL database for the
convenience of subsequent analyses. Each dissertation is identified by a unique number, i.e.,
dissertation ID (DITM_ID is the field name), and supplemented with 13 other features. Deduplicating was performed using the DITM_ID field on the ProQuest original file. That is, if two
records from ProQuest share the same DITM_ID, these two are identified as duplicates and the
record with more comprehensive information was kept. Figure 3-2 displays the diagram of
ProQuest data imported into MySQL. For more detailed descriptions of the data processing and
cleaning work, please refer to Ni (2013).

As mentioned above, dissertation records provided by ProQuest have a list of features, such as
the dissertation author, advisor, discipline, title, abstract, degree year, and keywords. In this
study, each dissertation author is an advisee, and the dissertation advisor is considered as the
advisor of the dissertation author. The disciplinary schema used by ProQuest is different from
that by Web of Science, yet this study needs to integrate these two databases. The details about
the solution will be provided in the following sections.

54

Web of Science Bibliographic Database

scholars’ scientometric profiles. As one of the major tools of scientometric allied research, Web

55

of Science is one of the world’s most comprehensive and commonly used bibliographic citation
index databases, covering publication documents in highly influential journals and conference
proceedings (and books lately) in sciences, social sciences, and art & humanities.

While there are other options of bibliographic databases, Web of Science was selected here for
many reasons. First of all, Web of Science has a longer time period of coverage and covers a
comparatively complete range of core international journals in the world, i.e., journals that are
visible and with high impact in their fields (Yang & Meho, 2006). In addition, the Web of Science
database has selection criteria for journals to be indexed, which insures the quality of indexed
journals. Other alternative databases exist, such as Scopus—which indexes journals published by
Elsevier and journals sending their bibliographic information to Elsevier, but the quality of
indexed journals are not pre-screened and controlled. Therefore, Web of Science is still the most
stable and widely-used bibliographic database for informetric studies, despite some
controversies on its selection criteria (Yang & Meho, 2006), English-language dominancy
(Larivière, 2010), subject classification (Ni, Sugimoto, & Jiang, 2013), and some other concerns
(e.g. Archambault & Larivière, 2009).

According to Thomson Reuters, as of July 2013, Web of Science covers more than 12,000 of the
highest impact journals worldwide (including open access journals) and over 150,000
conference proceeding in more than 250 disciplines, with coverage back to 1900. The Web of
Science data utilized in this study is a subset of the whole Web of Science Bibliographic
Database, and was kindly provided by the Observatory of Science and Technology (OST) at the
University of Quebec at Montreal10, Canada.

56

OST purchased the CD-ROM version of Web of Science Core Collection from Thomson Reuters,
including Science Citation Index (SCI), Social Science Citation Index (SSCI) and Art & Humanities
Citation Index (AHCI), and has put extensive effort into cleaning, processing and managing the
database for further analyses. According to OST, XML source data was transformed into a
relational database stored on a Microsoft SQL-Server (see for Figure 3-3 a diagram of the
database), with which any variable can be linked to any other. Preprocessing has been
conducted on the Web of Science data since OST created the database in 1997. For more details
on what has been done on this dataset, please refer to Larivière (2010). Web of Science provides
for each publication a list of features that were utilized in this study, concerning author, time,
venue, topic, etc.

58

Web of Science indexes 32 types of documents, but only a few of them were selected for
inclusion in the analysis: i.e. article, review article, and reprint. These three types of documents
were selected because they are regarded as the major forms for new knowledge diffusion and
most influential in the advancement of science (Moed, 1996). In this study, publications units of
the selected types (i.e., article, review article, and reprint) account for about 66% of the total
documents in Web of Science. It is known that some disciplines have their own favorite
publication genre, and these selected types of documents might not fully represent all the
scientific contributions of each discipline in Web of Science. Here I acknowledge that the
standards for original scientific contribution might vary by discipline, and there is no agreement
on this yet. Therefore, the subsequent analyses based on the selected documents only might
cause biases in conclusion, which will discussed further in Chapter 5 regarding the limitation of
this study.

Web of Science has its own classification schema of disciplines, called Web of Science Subject
Categories. As noted earlier, there are many controversies on the classification schema of Web
of Science subject categories. OST has worked on the classification of Web of Science subject
categories, and adopted a new classification schema for Web of Science-indexed journals based
on the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) schema from its Science and Engineering
Indicators (NSF-SEI) series12, which is heavily used in NSF-related activities and reports. For this
study, the disciplinary classification of NSF instead of Web of Science was adopted based on the
consideration that: (1) the NSF classification has a hierarchical structure of two levels (discipline
and specialty), which allows analysis at different levels of aggregation; (2) this allows for the
future incorporation of NSF, NIH and NEH (the latter two have disciplinary classifications closely

12

http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind06/c5/c5s3.htm#sb1

59

aligned with that of NSF-SEI ) data for future study; (3) NSF-SEI classifies each journal into one
specialty and discipline, which prevents double counting of publications for disciplines, and (4)
NSF-SEI classifications are closer to the ProQuest classification, which also has two levels of
aggregates (discipline and specialty). OST categorized these journals into two classes: Natural
science and Engineering (NSE), and Social Science and Humanities (SSH). The former includes 8
disciplines and 98 associated specialties, and the latter includes 6 disciplines and 45 associated
specialties. Please refer to Appendix I and II for a complete list of disciplines and specialties in
NSE and SSH.

The Web of Science data provided by OST at University of Quebec at Montreal have been precleaned and processed for a long time. One major challenge in this study is disambiguating
author names, i.e. connecting an individual with her publications correctly. This will be discussed
further in the following sections.

3.2

Author Name Disambiguation

The ambiguity of individual names is common. In the case of scientific publication, the
ambiguity of author names usually refers to the existence of ambiguous links between names,
individuals, and publications in bibliographic databases. For any work dealing with bibliographic
data, author name ambiguity has long been recognized as a fundamental issue (Garfield, 1969).
In general, the goal of author name disambiguation is to associate the correct individuals with
their entire oeuvre, while reducing both false positives (articles that are not written by an
individual but are identified as his/her oeuvre) and false negatives (articles that are written by
an individual but are rejected as being his/or oeuvre).

3.2.1

Causes and solutions of name ambiguity

60

While name ambiguity may exist in different types of database, such as the ProQuest database,
here most attention was paid to the Web of Science bibliographic database, as the problem is
most severe in bibliographic databases like Web of Science. In general, the ambiguity of author
names in bibliographic databases can be caused by several reasons. First, an individual could
publish under different names, including name changes from marriage and/or religious
conversion, using of a pen name, employing spelling variants, or even database indexing errors.
For name ambiguity of this type, the challenge is merging all name variants and associated
publications to the right individual: a process called “merging” by some researchers (Smalheiser
& Torvik, 2009). Second, different individuals may have the same name indexed in bibliographic
databases. The problem is even more severe when the bibliographic database, e.g. the Web of
Science database used here, only indexes the last name and first name initial of authors. For
instance, “John Smith” will be “Smith, J.”, and “Jeffery Smith” will also be “Smith, J.” in Web of
Science13 . In this case, scholars are faced with the problem of “splitting” (Smalheiser & Torvik,
2009) publications among individual authors with the same name. The ambiguity of author
names can also be caused by the missing of some important metadata in the bibliographic
database, such as author names and affiliations.
Efforts have been made by industry, government, and academia, e.g. the ORCID14 project and
ReseracherID15 project, to identify unique authors, but the issue remains unsolved. Relying on
such a registry system for author name disambiguation sounds reasonable, realistic, and
technically feasible, but this endeavor neglects the realities of human participation. Projects like
ORCID and ResearcherID rely largely on author self-identification and attribution of articles, and

13

Web of Science started to index author full names for publications since 2008.

15

14

61

thus could be biased towards those authors who are alive, willing to participate, and can recall
their publications correctly over a long period of time. More concerns and discussion on
establishing such a registry system can be found in Dervos, Samaras, Evangelidis, Hyvärinen and
Asmanidis (2006) and Smalheiser and Torvik (2009). On the other hand, some studies perform
author name disambiguation manually, which is unfeasible on large-scale data. If we consider
the fact that there are about 9,600,000 unique author names (in the format of Last Name – First
Name Initial) in Web of Science associated with about 50,000,000 publication units, then we can
imagine how hard it will be to manually identify the authors and their associated publications.
Therefore, automatic approaches for author name disambiguation are necessary and critical to
all scholarship related studies.

The ultimate goal of author name disambiguation is to attribute the documents to the
individuals who authored them. Considering the causes of author name disambiguation, the
major task of author name disambiguation can be divided into two parts: splitting process
(disambiguating two authors with the same name) and merging process (merging the same
author known under different names) (Smalheiser & Torvik, 2009).

Research approaches to author name disambiguation are diverse and constantly being revised.
However, most rely on techniques from machine learning (Mitchell, 1997). In general, most
machine learning approaches for author name disambiguation fall into one of the two machine
learning paradigms: supervised or unsupervised. Supervised approaches take as input a set of
training examples consisting of pairs of articles that are labeled as either positive (author match)
or negative (not author match); unsupervised approaches do not use labeled training examples.
In general, the unsupervised approach is more frequently used than the supervised approach,
since generating the training dataset for the latter is tedious and time consuming (Smalheiser &

62

Torvik, 2009). Supervised approaches, however, usually perform better because they are tuned
specifically to the data based on real instances: for example, many studies have used various
features to determine the relative importance and interactive effects of features, such as a coauthor, venue, title word, cited reference and affiliation. This dissertation will therefore employ
a method of the supervised learning approach. Please see the next section for a detailed
introduction to the method used for author name disambiguation for this dissertation.

3.2.2

Disambiguating Web of Science Authors

The Web of Science database includes records of scientific articles. Each article includes one or
more authors. Due to the ambiguity of persons’ names, it is necessary to identify and create
groups of article authors who are the same person. The complexity of the problem comes from
multiple factors. First, due to the limited digitalization of scientific literature and some other
reasons, the majority (about) of publication records in Web of Science do not have full author
names indexed. In addition, the conventions of storing persons’ names can be different, e.g.,
middle name initials are sometimes included but may also be ignored in some database records.
Finally, some common names are in nature more ambiguous than others, e.g. Smith, Lee, and
Wang.

In order to provide the correct link between individual scholars, names and publication records
in Web of Science, this study developed a new supervised-learning approach, since no existing
method and code can be directly applied. Figure 3-4 shows the pipeline of the author name
disambiguation approach applied in this study.

Firstly, by iterating all the authors of literature in the database, candidate author pairs are
generated based on last name, first name initial, first name (if any), and middle name initial (if
any) of authors. A candidate author pair includes two occurrences of authors in different articles
63

that are possibly the same person. Candidate generation will be further explained in details in
Section 3.2.2.1.

Secondly, multiple features are extracted to measure the degree of match between two
authors’ occurrences in candidate author pairs. The features include: the degree of match
between the two authors’ names in the database; the degree of match between the two
authors’ affiliations; the similarity of the two articles’ contents; the similarity of the two authors’
co-authors; the similarity of the two articles’ references and citing articles. Section 3.2.2.2
introduces these features in detail.

Thirdly, a binary classifier is trained based on a subset of the candidate author pairs in which
each author occurrence has an email address provided in the database (so that it is can be easily
judged through email that whether two authors are the same person or not). Then, the trained
classifier is applied to disambiguate the rest of the candidate author pairs without author email
information. Section 3.2.2.3 evaluates the effectiveness of the classifier.

Finally, the predicted same author pairs are grouped together into individual author groups,
which will be explained in the following section.

Candidate Generation

The database includes records of author occurrence in articles. A record of author article
occurrence can be characterized as a triple (article_id, author_sequence, author_name). I
iterated all the triples and generated possible candidate pairs that may potentially be the same
person. Figure 3-7 shows an example of candidate generation: the left figure shows all possible
candidate pairs for the 8 occurrences given in the right figure.

Two author occurrence triples are considered as a candidate pair if the two authors’ last names
and first name initials match with each other, unless any of the following exist:

65

(1) The two authors’ first names both exist and do not match. For example, in Figure 3-5,
“Elinor Ostrom” and “Ellis Ostrom” are not paired as a candidate.
(2) The two authors’ middle name initial both exist and do not match. For example, in
Figure 3-5, “Elinor L. Ostrom” and “Elinor K. Ostrom” are not paired as a candidate.
By generating candidate author pairs, the problem of author name disambiguation is converted
into a binary classification problem. Assuming there is a binary classifier that can predict
whether two author article occurrences are the same person, it would be able to identify each
unique authors and their articles in the database.

Feature Extraction

Each candidate author pair includes two author article occurrence triples. I extract various
features to measure the likelihood that the two authors are the same person. The features can
be categorized into five groups: author name match; article content similarity; author affiliation

66

and address similarity; co-author similarity; and co-citation and co-reference similarity. Table 3-1
through Table 3-5 explain the five categories of features in detail.

Table 3-1 shows features measuring the degree of match between the two authors’ names. The
match of last name, first initial, and middle name initial are considered separately. Different
degrees of match are also considered, e.g. full match, partial match, and characters matched
(e.g., edit distance).

Table 3-2 introduces features measuring the similarity of two articles in topic. The topicality of
the two articles is determined by article title words, keywords, and venue. The article abstracts
are not considered when measuring topic similarity among authorships, because more than 50%
of articles in Web of Science are missing an abstract.

Table 3-3 lists the features used for measuring the match of the two authors’ location and
affiliations. Since authors may move to new places, it may be risky to conjecture that two
authors with distinct locations and affiliations are different persons. However, two authors with
the same location and affiliation may be a positive feature indicating that they are the same
person. This category of features considers the match of affiliation, country, city, and states.

Table 3-4 shows features measuring the similarity of the two authors’ co-authors in their
articles. Here co-authors are identified by their last names and first name initials. Table 3-5 lists
features measuring the similarity of the two authors’ references and citing articles in terms of
the overlap of references and citing articles.

After feature extraction, each author article occurrence pair is represented by a vector of
feature values, which will be used for training classifiers and classification.

3.2.2.3

Classification

In order to classify author-article occurrence pairs, I need to train a binary classifier based on the
features introduced in the last section on some training dataset. The training dataset should
include labeling of the article occurrence pairs, i.e., whether each pair is the same person or not.
In order to reduce the labor of human annotation, I adopted a simply intuitive approach. In the
copy of the Web of Science database used in this dissertation, 8.6% of the article authors
(12,803,719 authors in total) have email information. For this portion of authors, it is easy to
judge whether two authors are the same person by whether their email addresses match each
other. Although it is true that author email addresses may change, it provides large amounts of
training resources without the need of any human labor.

I train SVM classifiers for candidate author pairs based on this subset of authors. Different
classifiers are trained for training samples of the three disciplines separately. Table 3-6 shows
the effectiveness of the classifier on the training dataset using 10 fold cross validation. Here, the
effectiveness of classification is evaluated by: overall accuracy of both positive and negative
cases; precision, recall, and F1 score of the positive cases; precision, recall, and F1 score of the
72

negative cases. It shows that the classifier achieved satisfactory effectiveness on candidate pairs
of all the three disciplines. The overall accuracy of the classifier is as high as over 93% for all
three disciplines. It should be noted that the majority of the candidate pairs are not the same
person (i.e., negative cases). Therefore, simply rejecting all candidate pairs can also achieve very
high accuracy scores (“Baseline (Always Reject)” in Table 3-7). It shows that our trained
classifiers can outperform the baseline by identifying about 65%-70% of the positive candidate
pairs (“Recall (Positive Cases)”) with about 75%-80% precision (“Precision (Positive Cases)”).

Table 3-7 further compares the effectiveness of different categories of features on the
classification task. It shows that author address and affiliation match features are the dominant
feature of the five categories of features. Classifiers solely using author address and affiliation
match features can already retrieve about half of the positive candidates with over 70%
precision. In comparison, the other four categories of features can also judge positive
candidates with 60% - 70% precision, but they are limited in recall (ranging from 20%-50%).
Considering most of the authors in the databases do not have full names, author name match
features are helpful limitedly.

73

In conclusion, results in Table 3-6 and Table 3-7 show that the trained classifiers can effectively
judge whether candidate author pairs are the same person or not. Each of the five categories of
features can effectively contribute to the classification in different ways.

Grouping Authors

The classifier predicts for each candidate author pair a score of whether two authors are the
same person. This section further describes the procedures of generating author article clusters
based on the binary classification results. Here author article clusters are defined as mutually
exclusive groups of article authors where a) the article authors within one cluster are the same
person, and b) each article author can only belong to one cluster.

When the binary classification results are perfect, article authors can be easily grouped by
merging all inter-connected article author pairs. However, in practice there may be inconsistent
prediction results. Figure 3-6 shows an example: although “E. L. Ostrom” and “E. K. Ostrom”
cannot be the same person (because the middle name initials do not match), they will be
merged together in this example because the classifier may predict another article’s author
“Elinor Ostrom” is both “E. L. Ostrom” and “E. K. Ostrom”. In order to solve the problem, I
further split a merged cluster into several groups if there are conflicting author names. For
example, as shown in Figure 3-6, the initial merged groups include at least two persons, i.e.
75

“Elinor L. Ostrom” and “Elinor K. Ostrom”. Then, an algorithm is applied to split the initial
merged group into two groups as shown in the Figure.

Figure 3-7 and Figure 3-8 show the algorithms of merging and splitting. After executing the
merge and split algorithms, the binary judgments on article author pairs are converted into
mutually exclusive author clusters. Each author cluster is treated as one person, with the
person’s publications being listed in the cluster.

Disambiguating ProQuest Authors

Name ambiguity problem also exists in the ProQuest dataset. As mentioned earlier, there are
two types of individuals in ProQuest: advisor and advisee. For the advisee, i.e. the doctorate
recipient, the name ambiguity problem is not as severe as Web of Science authors, since
ProQuest provides the full names for all most all the doctoral recipients. In addition, most
individuals have only one doctorate degree in a particular discipline. Therefore, this dissertation
takes each advisee name in a single discipline as an individual advisee.

For doctoral advisors, however, ProQuest does not provide full name for them. Therefore, extra
steps were taken in order to disambiguate individual advisors. Here the following simple rules
were adopted in determining whether two advisorships are the same individual or not:

(1) Advisorships with the same last name, first name and middle name (full) in the same
institution in a single discipline are considered to be the a single individual;
(2) Advisorships with the same last name, first name and middle name (initial) in the same
institution in a single discipline are considered to be the a single individual;
(3) Advisorships with the same last name, first name and middle name (full) within a single
discipline at multiple institutions are considered to be a single individual if their students
graduated from different institutions at different time periods;
(4) Advisorships with the same last name, first name and middle name (initial) within a
single discipline at multiple institutions are considered to be a single individual if their
students graduated from different institutions at different time periods;
The above rules were applied to advisors by discipline, and are based on the consideration that:
1) the probability of two individuals with the same name in a single discipline and affiliated with
the same institution is very low, and 2) advisors might move among institutions. After this step,

79

each unique advisor received a unique identification number, which was connected with the
advisees and publication records for subsequent analyses.

3.3

Integration between Web of Science and ProQuest

The integration between Web of Science and ProQuest is another challenging task in this study.
The ultimate goal for this procedure is to correctly connect ProQuest advisors and advisees with
their publication records found in Web of Science. This section introduces the detailed approach
in order to fulfill this goal.

Similar to the solution for disambiguating authors, this problem can also be transformed into a
binary classification task. First, I iterated each author cluster and each dissertation record in the
ProQuest database and generated candidate match pairs. The candidate generation process is
similar to those for the author name disambiguation. If an author cluster and an advisee or
advisor share the same last name and first name initial, they are a candidate pair.

Second, I randomly sampled several hundred candidate author-advisee and author-advisor pairs
and manually judged the correctness of the pairs. Using these human annotated results, binary
classifiers using multiple features are trained.

Finally, I predict whether each author-advisee and author-advisor pair are the same person or
not. Similarly, merging imperfect prediction results may cause certain inconsistencies. I adopted
some heuristics to eliminate the inconsistency.

The rest of this section introduces the features for classification (Section 3.3.1), evaluation of
classification (Section 3.3.2), and grouping of classification results (Section 3.3.3).

3.3.1

Utilized Features

In order to judge whether an author cluster is the advisee or advisor of a dissertation in the
ProQuest database, multiple features are calculated to measure the degree of match between
an author cluster and an advisee/advisor. The same set of features is used for both authoradvisee and author-advisor linking. But I expect the features should have different weights for
predicting author-advisee and author-advisor linking. These features can be categorized into
several groups as follows.


Static features of a cluster. I consider some static feature of a cluster that may be
related to the likelihood that a cluster is an advisee or an advisor. Table 6 lists the
features. For example, an advisor may have comparatively greater number of articles
and longer publishing time range, while it is less likely to connect a Ph.D. advisor to an
author cluster with only one or two articles.



Name match features. Similar to the features adopted for author name disambiguation,
I measure the match of authors and advisor/advisee by first name and middle name
initial. Table 7 shows features related to person name match.



Content match features. We match the similarity between the articles in the cluster and
the dissertation. We consider articles’ titles and keywords, and dissertations’ titles,
abstracts, and keywords. Table 8 shows features related to content match.



Time match features. We expect the difference of publishing time between articles and
dissertations may help us further refine author-advisee and author-advisor linking. For
example, it is less likely to link an advisee to a cluster with lots of articles published
before the year of graduation. Table 9 shows time match features.

81



Address and affiliation match features. We measure the degree of match of article
authors and advisee/advisor in terms of the affiliation and address. Table 10 lists the
features.



Co-author match features. Intuitively, advisee and advisor may have co-authored
articles. Therefore, if we can find any article in the cluster that is seemingly an adviseeadvisor co-authoring article, it may be helpful for author-advisee and author-advisor
linking. Table 11 shows features related to co-author match.

Author Classification

In order to train the classification model, we randomly sampled 1% of the candidate clusteradvisee and cluster-advisor pairs from these three discipline. We manually judged these pairs
and trained different SVM classifiers for advisee and advisor linking.

We evaluated the effectiveness of our SVM classifiers on the training set using 5-fold cross
validation. The following table shows the accuracy, precision and recall of our classifiers. For
both the cluster-advisee and cluster-advisor classifications, our classifier achieved high accuracy
and relatively high precision. It should be noted that our cluster-advisee classification has a
relatively low recall (0.462), which means that we missed about half of the cluster-advisee pairs.
This is a limitation of our work, and will be improved in the future.

We further compared the effectiveness of the classifier using only each category of the features
to those using all features. As shown in Table 3-15 and Table 3-16, name match features are the
dominating features for linking advisee and advisor between the two databases. Other
categories of features also further complement name match features and help improve the
effectiveness of classification.

Merging Classifications

Finally, we merged the classification results of Section 3.2. We create profiles of advisees and
advisors in the following format. Each unique advisee profile includes:


One dissertation record in the ProQuest database. Although technically one may get
more than one Ph.D. degree and therefore have multiple dissertation records in the
database, we ignore such cases because of their rarity.



Multiple article authors in the Web of Science database. For each author cluster, we
only assign it to the advisee with the highest prediction probability. Then, if an advisee
can be matched with multiple author clusters, we merge these author clusters together
as one cluster.

With the above steps, individuals in the role of advisors and advisees from ProQuest are
matched with Web of Science authors. The result from this step is a list of advisors and advisees
along with their publication records.

Measures of Scientometric Profile

This study seeks to explore the relationship between the scientometric profiles of doctoral
advisors and their advisees by looking into their publication, collaboration and citation practices.
This section describes the detailed measurements utilized in this study for the analyses of
publication, collaboration and citation practice of doctoral advisors and advisees in the social
sciences.
91

3.4.1

The 10-Year Rule and All-Year Rule

This study employed a 10-year rule for analyses. More specifically, in measuring the
scientometric profile of doctoral advisors and advisees, the achievement of advisors and
advisees in a certain time period is considered in addition to all career achievement. In this
study, the “certain time period” is, the 10-year period before an advisee graduated (for
advisors), and the 10-year period after an advisee graduated (for advisees), as shown in Figure
3-9.

Figure 3-9 The 10-Year Rule

The 10-year rule was adopted here for certain reasons. Scientific practices of scholars may not
stay still. Studies have shown that the scholarly practice of researchers changes by career age,
including publishing (Sugimoto, Milojević, Tsou, & Ding, 2013), citation (Long, McGinnis, &
Allison, 1980), collaboration (Bayer & Smart, 1991), and even mentoring patterns (Malmgren et
al., 2010). Additionally, the possible connection between advisors and advisees in terms of
scholarly practice may exist within only a certain limited time period instead of the whole career
life (Sugimoto, 2010). Therefore, in order to capture the contemporary relationship between
advisors and advisees, this dissertation focuses on a certain time period during which the
scholarly practices of advisors and advisees are possibly related, referred to as the 10-Year rule
92

here. That is, instead of examining the relationship between the lifelong achievements of
advisors and advisees, this dissertation considers the 10 years of achievements of the advisor
before his or her advisee graduated; and, for advisees, the 10 years of achievements after he or
she was granted a doctorate degree. As described in Figure 3-9, the “Ph.D. year-Advisee” means
the year when an advisee received his doctorate.

The 10-year period was determined based on the statistics from multiple studies and reports
(e.g. Economist, 2010) stating that about 52% of doctoral students get their degrees within 10
years of the enrollment, and about the one half of doctoral students did not finish their degrees.
Therefore, here the 10 years before the advisees got their degrees is considered as the potential
time period when the advisors’ scholarly behavior might be related to the students they were
mentoring. For the advisees, the 10-year rule was also applied in understanding of their
scholarly practices. One reason for using 10-year rule for advisees is to make the scholarly
achievements among advisors and advisees comparable in terms of time. The other reason is
that, based on several studies, the impact from doctoral advisors lasts even into when the
advisees are seeking tenure promotion. The tenure clock at most U.S. institutions is about seven
years and many fields have post-doctoral experience for two to three years. Therefore, the 10year rule also makes sense for advisees in measuring their relationships with their doctoral
advisors.

In addition to the 10-Year rule, advisors and advisees are also measured based on all-year rule.
That is, this study considers their scholarly practices in their whole career life in addition to 10year time period. In this study, all the scholarly practices are based on bibliographic data by the
end of 2012.

93

3.4.2

Publication and Productivity

The scientometric profile of scholars may consist of multiple aspects of their scholarly behavior,
and an important one is publication practice. This section introduces indicators adopted in this
study for the analyses of scholars’ publication behavior.

This study examines the publication practice of advisors and advisees by looking at their
publication productivity and publication diversity. Publication productivity of advisors and
advisees is measured by the number of publications they have authored or co-authored.
Productivity is time sensitive and in favor of scholars who have been publishing longer.
Therefore, this study developed a series of indicators of productivity based on the 10-year rule
mentioned earlier. For publication diversity, the 10-year rule was also employed.

This study measures both the advisor and advisee publication practice. Advisors are measured
through the following indicators for their publication practice:


All-year Productivity: the total number of publications by an advisor as of the end of 2012,
the time when the data were collected. This indicator aims to capture the overall
productivity of advisors.



Ten-year Productivity: the number of publications an advisor has produced as of the year
an advisee graduated. This indicator tries to capture the productivity of advisors at the
time period when the advisor had a particular doctoral advisee. Please note that, for the
same advisor individual, the value for this indicator varies by advisee.



All-year Publication Diversity: the number of disciplines that an advisor has published
research in within the whole time period examined. This indicator measures the overall
diversity of scholars’ publication diversity during their whole career.

94



Ten-Year Publication Diversity: the number of disciplines that an advisors has published
research in within the 10-year before an advisee’s graduation. This indicator measures
the overall diversity of scholars’ publication diversity under the 10-year rule.

Advisees are measured by similar indicators for publication productivity:


All-year Productivity: the total number of publications by an advisee. This indicator shows
the overall productivity of each advisee.



Ten-year Productivity: the total number of publication by an advisee within the 10 years
after graduation (included). The indicator displays the productivity of advisees within a
certain time period after the conferral of their doctoral degree. This indicator is based on
the consideration that, after a certain period of time, the impact of advisors on their
advisees might start to disappear, and other factors such as the departmental culture and
collaborators of these advisees after their doctorate may begin to have an impact.



All-year Publication Diversity: the number of disciplines that an advisee has published
research in within the whole time period examined. This indicator measures the overall
diversity of scholars’ publication diversity during their whole career.



Ten-Year Publication Diversity: the number of disciplines in which an advisee has
published research within 10 years after graduation. This indicator measures the overall
diversity of scholars’ publication diversity under the 10-year rule.

3.4.3

Co-Author and Collaboration

Collaboration has become the mainstream of research in the current scientific world. This study
considers collaboration as another important aspect of scholars’ scientometric profile, and
operationalized collaboration as the presence of more than one author on the byline of an
article. The following indicators quantify the collaboration diversity and intensity of advisors and
95

advisees. Similar to those measurements of publication practice, indicators here measure both
the 10-year and all-year collaboration practice of advisors and advisees.

Advisor collaboration measurements:


All-year collaborators: the number of unique individuals that the advisor has ever
collaborated with during their whole career. This is an indicator of collaboration
diversity.



Lifetime collaboration rate: the percentage of co-authored publications out of all
publications by the advisor. This indicator reflects the collaboration intensity overall.



Ten-Year collaborators: the number of unique individuals who the advisor collaborated
with 10 years before an advisee graduates. This is an indicator of collaboration diversity
within the time period when advisors have potential impact on their advisees.



Ten-Year collaboration rate: the percentage of co-authored articles out of all articles
published 10 years before an advisee graduates. Similarly, this indicator measures the
overall collaboration intensity during the 10-year time window.



Lifetime authors per article: the average number of authors per article of those articles
to which advisors have contributed during their whole career



Ten-Year authors per article: the average number of authors per article of those articles
to which advisors have contributed in the 10-year time period.

Advisee collaboration measurements:


All-year collaborators: the number of unique individuals that the advisee has ever
collaborated with during the whole career life. This is an indicator of collaboration
diversity.

96



All-year collaboration rate: the percentage of co-authored publication out of all
publications by the advisee. This indicator reflects the collaboration intensity overall.



Ten-Year collaborators: the number of unique individuals that the advisee collaborated
with 10 years after doctoral graduation. This is an indicator of collaboration diversity
within the time period, during which an advisee might be impacted by the advisor.



Ten-Year collaboration rate: the percentage of co-authored articles out of all articles
published 10 years after graduation. Similarly, this indicator measures the overall
collaboration intensity during the 10-year time window.



All-year authors per article: the average number of authors per article of those articles
advisees have contributed during their whole career.



Ten-Year authors per article: the average number of authors per article of those articles
advisees have contributed to in the 10-year time period.

In addition to the above indicators, more collaboration related practices are considered and
analyzed in this study, such as the collaboration between advisees and advisor, both before and
after graduation, and whether and how the advisee-advisor collaboration is related to other
aspects of scholarly practices.

3.4.4

Reference and Knowledge Base

Authors cite previous studies to support their current research, acknowledge prior research, etc.
Depending on various factors, studies have shown that scholars behave differently in terms of
reference practices (Larivière, Archambault, Gingras, & Vignola‐Gagné, 2006). This section is
interested in understanding the reference practices of advisors and advisees and aims to
discover whether there is any association between them. Specifically, this section explores the

97

reference practices of advisors and advisees by focusing on common reference, reference per
paper, outside discipline reference, reference age and the impact of reference source.

All-year reference per paper: the number of references cited by each paper contributed
by the advisor within the all-year time window.



Ten-year average references per paper: the number of references cited by each paper
contributed by the advisor within the 10-year time window.



3.4.5

Citation and Impact

For authors, the process of citing and getting cited is the intellectual trading between the citer
and citee: authors import knowledge by citing and export knowledge by getting cited (Cronin &
Meho, 2008). As has been proved in previous studies (e.g. Ding, Chowdhury, & Foo, 2000; Eom,
1996; Peritz & Bar-Ilan, 2002), citation analysis is a powerful tool for the analysis of knowledge
flows between scientific entities.

This study examines the citation practice of advisees and advisors by investigating their cited
sources (references) and citing sources (citations). Previous research has demonstrated that the
references cited by an author reflect her knowledge base (Milojević, Sugimoto, Yan, & Ding,
2011). Therefore, an examination of the reference set (reference journal title and disciplinary
area) of advisees and advisors will potential reflect the relationship between the knowledge
areas of them. The citing sources of advisees and advisors are analyzed similarly, focusing the
subject disciplines and journals titles cited by them. In addition, this study uses quantitative
indicators to quantify the citation practice and measure the citation impact of advisees and
advisors.

Advisor citation and impact indicators:


Lifetime citations: the total number of citations received by an advisor as of 2012. This
indicator shows the overall impact of the advisor.



Ten-year citations: the total number of citations an advisor received by the time the
advisee has graduated. This indicator tries to capture the impact of the advisor before the
advisee graduates, in that the citation of advisors may also change by career age.



Ten-year citations per paper: the average number of citations received by each advisor
paper in the 10-year time period. This is a normalized measurement of citation impact,
100

since a simple citation count might be in favor of those with a longer and more prolific
publication history.


Ten-year Outside-field citation: the percentage of citations that come from outside of
the advisor’s own discipline within the 10-year time window. This is an indicator of
interdisciplinarity.

Advisee citation and impact indicators:


Lifetime citations: the total number of citations received by an advisor as of 2012. This
indicator shows the overall impact of an advisee.



Ten-year citations: the total number of citations an advisor received 10 year after
graduation. This indicator tries to capture the impact of advisees at a certain time period,
based on the consideration that the influence of advisors on their advisees might start to
disappear, and other factors such as the departmental culture and collaborators of these
advisees after doctorate may begin to have an influence after a certain period of time.



Ten-year citations per paper: the average number of citations received by each advisee
paper in the 10-year time period. This is a normalized measurement of citation impact,
since a simple citation count might be in favor of those with a longer and more prolific
publication history.



Ten-year Outside-field citation: the percentage of citations that come from outside of
the advisee’s own discipline under the 10-year time window. This is an indicator of
interdisciplinarity.

This study utilizes the above measurements to quantify the citation diversity and intensity of
advisors and advisees, under both 10-year and all-year time window.

Statistical Analysis and Visualization Techniques

Statistical analysis is an important part of this study to reveal the relationship between the
scientometric profiles of advisors and advisees. The major techniques employed in this study are
descriptive statistics, Pearson’s r correlation coefficient, empirical cumulative distribution
function, Fisher’s r to z transformation for comparing multiple correlation coefficients, and
finally multivariate multiple regression.

Basic descriptive statistics, e.g. mean, median, and mode, are applied in this study for a general
understanding of advisors’ and advisees’ scientometric profiles. For instance, this study
compares the median values of publication quantity of advisors and advisees across disciplines
to examine who are more prolific. The empirical cumulative distribution is also applied here to
compare the overall distribution of advisors’ and advisees’ scientometric behavior.

While there are many other options of correlation analysis, Pearson’s r is selected in this study
to investigate the relationship between the scholarly practice of advisors and advisees. This was
decided after multiple experimental analyses and the consideration of the data distribution. For
some of the analyses, both parametric approach (Pearson’s r) and nonparametric approach
(Spearman’s rho and Kendall’s tau) are adopted and the results are compared for more robotic
conclusions. Additionally, to answer the research question regarding cross discipline
comparison, this study compares the correlation coefficients between advisors and advisees
across disciplines by using Fisher’s r-to-z transformation (Fisher, 1915, 1921).

Additionally, effect size was considered in this study, since it indicates the magnitude of the
difference between groups (Sullivan & Feinn, 2012). While p value has been widely adopted as
an indication of whether an effect exists, it is unable to reflect the size of the effect. Some
studies report p-values in comparing relationships between groups, which is the probability that
102

the observed difference between two groups is due to chance. If the p-value is higher than the
alpha value (the highest risk that the difference observed is due to chance), the observed
difference between groups is usually considered as being caused by sampling variability.
However, with a large-enough sample, a statistical test will almost always yield significant result.
Therefore, in this study, there are also concerns about whether the significant difference
between advisors and advisees is due to the fact that this study has a large sample size.
Therefore, reporting both the p-value and effect size is critical to better understand the result,
as has been claimed by some studies (Orwin, 1983; Sullivan & Feinn, 2012).

Based on the purpose of this study, the measures of association, e.g. Pearson’s r, are used in
order to compare the relationship between advisors and advisees. While there are multiple
options of correlation measurement available, such as Spearman’s rho and Kendall’s tau,
Pearson’s r is adopted based on some experiments. These three measurements were adopted
on all of the data, and the results show that there is less than 10% difference in correlation
strength and no difference in correlation significance. Considering that Pearson’s r is more
popular, this is adopted here as the measurement of association between variables.

As mentioned earlier, this study focuses on the relationship between advisors’ and advisees’
scholarly profiles within social sciences. Three disciplines were selected for the purpose of
demonstration: Economics, Political Science and Sociology. This section introduces details about
this selection, and a brief overview of the selected sample.

3.6

Discipline Selection Criteria

Economics, Political Science and Sociology were selected for the purpose of demonstration in
this study based on multiple considerations, among which publication genres of these disciplines
was an important one. As mentioned, data utilized here for scholarly practices are from Web of
103

Science, which mainly indexes journal publications and neglects other genres of publication,
such as conference proceeding and books. Economics, Political Science and Sociology were
selected here because scholars in these three disciplines mainly publish journal articles. To
validate the selection of samples, a list of faculty members in top 10 programs of Economics,
Political Science, and Sociology as determined by consulting lists published by U.S. News &
World Report17 were generated in August 2012. For the selected list of faculty members, their
publications list was collected from their resumes, and the genre of those publications was
manually labeled. Please see Sugimoto, Milojević, Tsou, & Ding (2013) for the detailed actions of
dealing with the data in Sociology. The time when those faculty members got their doctorates
were determined by matching back to ProQuest data.

Figure 3-10 displays the percentage of publications of different genres by the time of their
doctorate time in all three disciplines. Results shows that, in all three disciplines, journal articles
are the dominant publication genre (accounting for more than 70% of all publications). The
percentage of journal publications mostly increases by the time these faculty members receive
their doctorates: the more recently faculty members received their doctorates, the higher the
percentage of journal publications out of all publication records. On the other side, the majority
of degrees were conferred after 1970’s in ProQuest. Therefore, the selection of Economics,
Political Science, and Sociology in this study is reasonable given the data used in the analysis.

Figure 3-10 Genres of Publications by Scholars in Economics, Political Science, and Sociology

The selection of these three disciplines also takes into account the disciplinary classification
schema of both data sources. As mentioned earlier, ProQuest classifies dissertations into 144
disciplines based on its own schema. Web of Science data processed by OST classifies journal
titles into 143 disciplines, based on U.S. NSF schema. At present, there are multiple classification
schemas of research subjects, such as Web of Science subject categories, Library of Congress
Classification (LCC), NSF subject classification and ProQuest. Although disagreement exists,
those classification schemas overlap to someextent on categorizing some disciplines. In this
case, since the data start from the ProQuest and match with Web of Science based on NSF
classification, disciplines that agree between these two classifications (listed explicitly as
disciplines) are selected. Therefore, disciplines that are explicitly listed as disciplines by both NSF
categorization and ProQuest database were selected.

The longevity of disciplines was also considered during the sampling process. Disciplines with a
comparatively longer history of existence were selected so that diachronic analysis on the
105

selected disciplines regarding doctoral mentoring can be conducted. In ProQuest, the longevity
of a discipline varies from a few years old (e.g., Theater Studies and Aeronomy), to more than
one century old (e.g. Philosophy, Economics, Political Science, and Sociology). According to
ProQuest, the first Ph.D. in Economics in United States was conferred in 1899, the first Ph.D. in
Political Science in 1905 and the first Ph.D. in Sociology in 1916. These three disciplines have
similar length of existence in doctoral education and all have an established history for
diachronic analyses, and were thus selected here.

Geographic restriction was also applied to sample selection: this study concentrates on advisors
and advisees within United States only. This US-based selection is based on the consideration
that: 1) ProQuest is U.S. dominant (90.1% dissertations in ProQuest were conferred by US
institutions), and 2) Mentoring systems are different across countries (for instance, most
institutions in China require students to finish doctoral degrees in three years). Therefore,
focusing on U.S. conferred dissertations will ensure that the mentoring expectations will be
similar, and at the same time will eliminate bias towards location.

Based on the above considerations, Economics, Political Science and Sociology were finally
determined to represent social science in this study. This produces 9,553 pairs of advisoradvisee to be included in the subsequent analyses, and the details will be introduced in the
following sections.

3.6.1

Selected Dissertations

In the United States, Economics, Political Science and Sociology have been granting research
doctorates for more than one hundred years. According to ProQuest, the earliest doctorate
degree in Economics was conferred in 1899, Political Science in 1905, and Sociology in 1916.
Institutions in the United States have conferred 108,927 doctorate degrees as of the year of
106

2010 in these three disciplines. Economics is the largest in terms of size: it granted about twice
as many degrees as Political Science and Sociology did. In all three disciplines, the number of
doctoral graduates before the 1960s is small, and majority of doctoral degrees were conferred
in and after the 1960s. Overall, doctoral degree conferment increased over time in Economics.
For Political Science and Sociology, numbers of degrees dropped in the 1980s and 1990s.

Advisor information for each doctoral dissertation is essential for this study, yet, ProQuest only
provides the advisor information for a subset of dissertations. Table 3-17 provides the total
number of dissertations, and the number and percentage of dissertations with advisor
information available in the disciplines of Economics, Political Science and Sociology. As shown
in the table, only 41.7% of all the dissertations have advisor information available in ProQuest.
The number is slightly higher in Economics (46.5%), followed by Political Science (38.5%) and
then Sociology (34.4%).

The percentage of dissertations with advisor information available in ProQuest varies by decade.
Figure 3-11 displays the number of total dissertations and dissertation with advisor information
in ProQuest by decade for Economics, Political Science and Sociology. As shown, the more
recently the dissertations were conferred, the higher percentage of dissertations with advisor
information available in ProQuest. Additionally, in all three disciplines, most of the dissertations

107

with advisor information available were conferred after 1980s. Therefore, analyses using the
data cannot avoid biases the last three decades. This limitation is discussed further in the
following sections of this dissertation.

Figure 3-11 Number of Dissertations and Dissertation with Advisors Information in ProQuest

3.6.2

Selected Advisors and Advisees

Not all dissertations with advisor information available in these three disciplines were include in
the subsequent analyses. This is due to the matching of those scholars with Web of Science
data. Although there are about 45 thousand dissertations (advisees) in these three disciplines
with advisor information available, not all of these degree recipients (advisees) have publication
records in Web of Science. Doctoral advisees, after they graduate, may stop publishing papers
for multiple reasons. They may hold positions that do not require publications. They may also

108

publish in genres and venues not covered by Web of Science. Therefore, only a limited
percentage of doctoral advisees and their advisors were found in Web of Science.

The percentages of matched advisee-advisor pairs out of the total are 11.08%, 7.56% and 5.37%
for Economics, Political Science, and Sociology, respectively. As mentioned earlier, most of the
dissertations with advisor information available in ProQuest were conferred after 1980s.
Therefore, most of doctoral advisor-advisee pairs matched with Web of Science are also from
the same time period. The number of matched advisor-advisee pairs is 5,901 in Economics,
2,161 in Political Science, and 1,491 in Sociology. Table 3-18 displays the number of selected
advisor-advisee pairs by decade. As shown in the table, majority of those matched advisees
graduated after 1980. This biased sample is mostly due to data availability: ProQuest started
indexing advisor information for dissertations on a large scale after 1980, and only about 22% of
Web of Science publications were published before 1980.

Selected Institutions

The selected set of dissertations analyzed in this project were conferred at 220 institutions
within United States: Economics dissertations from 179 institutions, Political Science
dissertations from 166 institutions, and Sociology dissertations from 168 institutions. Table 3-20
displays the top 20 research institutions involved in this study, listed by the number of doctoral
dissertations conferred by them. The top three affiliations by the number of Economics
doctorates conferred are Harvard, MIT and Stanford. UC Berkeley, University of Michigan and
University of Wisconsin Madison are the top three institutions of Political Science. For Sociology,
they are University of Wisconsin-Madison, SUNY Albany and Ohio State University. It appears
that the number of dissertations selected does not differ widely across institutions in all three
disciplines in this selected sample.

This table does not intend to show the role of each institution in these three disciplines, but
rather to emphasize that the selected sample is not in favor of certain institutions, which makes
further analyses and conclusion more reliable.

Selected Publications

A subset of Web of Science data was finally matched for the analyses of scientometric profiles of
advisors and advisees. Those 9,553 advisor-advisee pairs published 145,628 articles according to
Web of Science. As shown in Table 3-21, Economics advisors and advisees published 89,213
articles in 2,513 journals of 22 disciplines; Political Science advisors and advisees published
31,905 articles in 2,012 journals of 18 disciplines; Sociology advisors and advisees published
24,510 articles in 1,398 journals of 19 disciplines. This selected set of advisor-advisee pairs along
with their publication records constitutes the data for final analysis in this study. This set of
publications contributed by advisors and advisees have received 2,501,620 citations as of the
end of 2013.

Result Analysis

As stated above, this study explores the relationship between the scientometric profile of
doctoral advisors and advisees in social sciences with massive, heterogeneous data. The
sampling method described in Chapter 3 produced 9,553 pairs of advisors and advisees in
Economics, Political Science, and Sociology. This chapter analyzes these 9,553 selected pairs of
advisors and advisees by focusing on their publication, collaboration, reference, and citation
patterns.

4.3

Publication Productivity

Publication practice is an important part of scholars’ scientometric profiles. As mentioned
above, one major task of this study is to understand the relationship between advisors’ and
advisees’ publication practices, and compare this relationship across disciplines. This section
illustrates the relationship based on the selected set of advisors and advisees in Economics,
Political Science, and Sociology, from the perspectives of publication diversity and intensity.

4.3.1

Publication Intensity

Publication is one essential form of scientific research output. Generally, the more a scholar
publishes, the more productive she is. This section explores the scientific productivity of
advisors and advisees by looking at their overall publication quantity.

Advisors and advisees were examined for their overall production productivity by looking at
their number of publications. Figure 4-1 displays the distribution of publication quantity by
advisors and advisees measured under the 10-year time window. For advisees, the median
number of publication quantity is three in Economics and Political Science, and two in Sociology.
For advisors, the number is 19 in Economics, 10 in Political Science and 11 in Sociology.
Furthermore, the distribution graph also indicates that advisors are significantly more
113

productive than advisees are in all three disciplines. The largest number of articles that an
individual advisee published was 169 in Economics, 89 in Political Science, and 137 in Sociology.
The highest number of articles that an individual advisor published was 233 in Economics, 156 in
Political Science, and 175 in Sociology. There is a higher percentage of advisees who published
infrequently than that of advisors: about 5.2% advisors in the advisor poll only published once
under the 10-year time window, and the number is 26.4% in the advisee poll. Additionally, the
median number of publications produced by advisors is much higher in Economics than in the
other two, and that by advisees is lower in Sociology than in the other two.

Figure 4-1 Cumulative Distribution of Publication Quantity – 10Year

114

When measured under the all-year time window, advisors are still more prolific than advisees in
all three disciplines. As shown in Figure 4-2, the number of publications by advisors is
significantly higher than that of advisees. This is not surprising considering the fact that advisors
usually have a longer history of publishing, and the total number of publications usually
accumulates over time. Additionally, advisees and advisors in Economics publish the highest
number of articles among all three disciplines, in terms of both mean and median values.

Figure 4-2 Cumulative Distribution of Publication Quantity – All-Year

115

4.3.1.1 Advisor distribution of highly productive advisees
In addition to the overall productivity, the distribution of advisors who trained highly productive
advisees is also a focus in this study. In this study, highly productive advisees are those who rank
among the top 25% of all advisees under the 10-year time window. Each discipline was
examined.

As mentioned earlier, this study includes two sets of scholars: doctoral advisees and advisors. To
analyze the distribution of highly productive advisees’ advisors, advisees are broken down into
quartiles, as are advisors. The top 25% advisees by productivity (in the advisee set) were then
selected, and their advisors were identified (along with their ranks by productivity in the advisor
set). Then this study analyzes the productivity quartile composition of advisors who mentored
those top 25% advisees by productivity. That is, this section is interested in where those advisors
sit in the advisor pool in terms of productivity. Do advisors of those highly productive advisees
mostly come from a lower or higher quartile range in the advisor pool in terms of productivity?

Figure 4-3 displays the percentage of advisors (of top 25% advisees) in each quartile of the
advisor pool by productivity. As shown in Figure 4-3, highly productive advisees (top 25%) were
mentored by advisors who distribute across the four quartiles by productivity. But there are
more advisors who also rank higher by productivity. As shown, about 35.2% advisors who
mentored highly productive advisees rank in the top 25% by productivity among Economics
advisors. The number is 30.6% in Political Science and 37.9% in Sociology. About 18.3% of those
advisors who trained highly productive advisees are in the last quartile by productivity among
Economics advisors. The number is 18.4% in Political Science and 15.7% for Sociology.
Additionally, a higher percentage of top advisors (first and second quartile) contribute to the top
advisees (first and second quartile) can be observed in the 10-year time window than in the all-

116

year time window. The percentage of top advisees mentored by top advisors is highest in
Sociology, followed by Economics and then Political Science. Although advisors come from
different percentile ranges by productivity, the percentage of those advisors from each quartile
range decreases. Please note that this figure shows only the result measured under the 10-year
rule, as that under the all-year rule does not differ much.

Additionally, the correlation between those top 25% advisees and their advisors are significantly
higher than all advisees and advisors among all three disciplines.

Figure 4-3 Advisor Productivity Distribution of Top 25% Advisees -10Year

4.3.1.2 Correlation between advisors and advisees
To understand the relationship between the productivity of advisors and advisees, this section
also investigates the correlation relationship between advisors’ and advisees’ publication
quantity using Pearson’s r correlation coefficient. Figure 4-4 displays the scatterplot and
correlation coefficient in each discipline under both 10-year (bottom) and all-year (upper) time
window. The null hypothesis here is that the correlation between advisors and advisees in terms

117

of productivity equals to zero. As shown in Figure 4-4, this study rejects the null hypothesis in
Economics and Sociology, indicating that there is sufficient evidence supporting the existence of
a non-zero correlation between advisors and advisees in these two disciplines. The correlation
coefficient between the productivity of advisors and advisees in Sociology is r=0.121 (p<0.05)
under the all-year time window and r=0.133 (p<0.05) 10-year time window. While in Political
Science, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that there is a zero correlation between advisors
and advisees in terms of the productivity. In other words, the current evidence supporting the
existence of such a non-zero relationship between advisors and advisees in Political Science
does not rise to a certain level (α=0.05).

Figure 4-4 Correlation between Advisee and Advisor Productivity

118

4.3.1.3 Cross-discipline comparison of correlations in productivity
One of the research questions this study asks is whether the relationship between advisors and
advisees vary by discipline. To answer this question, this section performs Fisher’s r-to-z
transformation. Additionally, this sections tests upon the productivity under the 10-year rule, as
it is the focus of this study.

As mentioned in the methods section, Fisher’s r-to-z transformation is utilized to compare the
difference between the correlations of two disciplines. Here the null hypothesis is that there is
no significant difference in the advisor-advisee productivity correlation between two disciplines.
The alternative hypothesis is that there is a significant difference in the advisor-advisee
productivity correlation between two disciplines. This study considers significance at 0.05 level.
Fisher’s r-to-z transformation and comparison on Economics and Sociology yields a value of
p=0.08, which means this study fails to reject the null hypothesis. In other words, there is
evidence supporting the existence of such a non-zero relationship between Economics and
Sociology does not rise to a certain level (α=0.05). For Economics and Political Science, result
shows that there is sufficient evidence supporting the non-zero relationship between them
(p=0.035). Additionally, we also reject the null hypothesis that the correlation between Political
Science and Sociology is equal (p=0.002). In other words, there is sufficient evidence from the
data supporting the existence of non-zero difference between Economics and Sociology in terms
of their advisors and advisees’ productivity.

4.3.2

Publication Diversity

While the number of publications reflects the publication intensity of scholars, the number of
venues and disciplines where scholars publish their research can be considered as an indication
of their publication diversity. Therefore, this study explores the relationship between advisors’
119

and advisees’ publication diversity, by looking at their publication venues and corresponding
disciplines. In general, the more venue titles and disciplines a scholar publishes in, the more
diverse that scholar’s research is.

4.3.2.1 Publication Venue
Each publication venue has its own scope of publishing, and therefore the venue where scholars
publish their research is another indication of research foci. Based on this understanding, this
section considers the number of venues where advisors and advisees publish their research to
indicate their research diversity: the more venues advisors and advisees publish in, the more
diverse their research is. In addition, the degree to which they share venues thus is an indication
of their research association strength. This section focuses on the number of venues that
advisees and advisors publish their articles in both the all-year and 10-year windows to explore
whether the publication diversity of advisees and advisors are related to each other.

Table 4-1 displays the basic statistics of the number of venues that advisees and advisors
published their research under the all-year time window. As shown, the number of venues
where advisees publish is overall lower than that of advisors, in all three disciplines. This is not
surprising considering their stage of career path: advisors are more advanced and have
accumulated more publications in more venues. Additionally, advisors and advisees in
Economics publish in more venues than those in Political Science and Sociology.

The publication venues measured under the all-year time window may, howeer, favor authors
with a longer histotry of publication. To avoid possible bias, Table 4-2 shows the basic statistics
for the number of venues where advisees and advisors published under the 10-year time
window. The number of venues measured in the 10-year window shows similar patterns as in
the all-year time window. That is, in this dataset, advisors overall publish on a larger number of
venues than advisees do, and Economics has the highest number of publication venues in which
advisees/advisors published their research among all three disciplines. ANOVA analysis was also
applied here to compare whether the number of publication venues by advisees vary by
discipline. The result (p<0.05) shows that the number of publication venues of advisees vary by
discipline.

This study also looks into the association between advisees’ and advisors’ publication venues. In
particular, the analysis aims to see whether advisees who publish in a wider range of publication
venues tend to be mentored by advisors who publish in a wider or narrower range of
publication venues. The Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r) between the number of advisees’
and advisors’ publication venues is employed and displayed in Figure 4-5. In calculating the
correlation coefficient, the null hypothesis is that there is a zero correlation coefficient between
advisors and advisees in terms of their publication diversity. As shown in Figure 4-5, the null
hypothesis is rejected in Economics and Sociology, indicating there is sufficient evidence
supporting the existence of a non-zero correlation relationship between the publication
diversity of advisors and advisees in these two disciplines. The correlation coefficient between
the productivity of advisors and advisees in Sociology is r=0.123 (p<0.05) under the all-year time
window and r=0.176 (p<0.05) 10-year time window. In Economics, the number is r=0.081
(p<0.05) for all-year time window and r=0.103 (p<0.05) under the 10-year time window. While
in Political Science, we fail to the null hypothesis that there is a zero correlation between
advisors and advisees in terms of the publication diversity in both time windows. In other words,
the current evidence supporting the existence of such a non-zero relationship between advisors
and advisees in Political Science does not rise to a certain level (α=0.05).

To compare whether the correlation of publication venues vary by discipline, this study also
employed Fisher’s r-to-z transformation. The null hypothesis here is that there is no difference
between the publication diversity of two disciplines. Fisher’s r-to-z transformation procedure
rejects the null hypothesis between Economics and Sociology (p=0.020), Economics and Political
Science (p=0.007), and Political Science and Sociology (p=0.001). In other words, there is
sufficient evidence in this study supporting the existence of a non-zero relationship between the
publication diversity of advisors and advisees between each two disciplines. Furthermore, the
result also shows that the correlation is higher in Sociology than in Economics and Political
Science.

4.3.2.2 Publication Discipline
This section considers the range of publication disciplines as another indication of research
diversity. As mentioned earlier, the data used here categorize each publication from the Web of
Science database using the NSF subject classification schema, which classifies each article and
each venue title into one discipline and one disciplinary area. Based on this understanding, here
the number of disciplines where advisees and advisors publish their research is considered as
another indicator of publication diversity. That is, the larger the number of disciplines where
advisees and advisors publish their work, the more diverse their research is.

Figure 4-6 and Figure 4-7 display the cumulative distribution of disciplines in which advisees and
advisors have published their research based on 10-year time window and all-year time window,
respectively. As can been seen from the tables, advisees on average publish in a smaller number
of disciplines than advisors do, in all three disciplines. This is consistent with the findings from
the publication venue analysis. Additionally, the number of disciplines in which both advisees
and advisors publish is higher when based on all-year time window than in 10-year time
124

window, which is not surprising since the number of articles published by advisees and advisors
increases by time. Please note that Political Science is the discipline whose advisees and advisors
publish on a wider range of disciplines than Economics and Sociology, which is different from
the result of publication diversity analysis based on number of venues. As can be recalled,
advisees and advisors in Economics published in a larger number of venues than those in
Political Science and Sociology.

Figure 4-6 Cumulative Distribution of Publication Disciplines -10Year

Results also show that the advisors published in a broader range of disciplines than advisees do,
in all three disciplines. In Economics, only 68.1% of advisors publish in three or fewer disciplines,
and more than 95.1% of advisors publish in three or less specialties. In Political Science, 57.0% of
advisors publish their work in three or fewer disciplines, and about 90% of advisees publish their
125

research in three or fewer disciplines. In Sociology, the trend is similar: 60.0% of advisors publish
in three or fewer disciplines, and about 90% of advisees publish in three or fewer disciplines.
The median number of disciplines in which advisors published their research is three, and the
number is one for advisees, in each of the three disciplines.

Figure 4-7 Cumulative Distribution of Publication Discipline – AllYear
The correlation18 between the number of disciplines where advisees and advisors have
published is displayed in Figure 4-8: the upper half shows the correlation based on all-year time
window and the bottom half shows the correlation based on 10-year time window. As shown,
this study also fails to reject the null hypothesis that there is a zero correlation between advisors

18

Please note that here Pearson’s r, Kendall’s tau and Spearman’s rho have been all employed to test the
possible correlations between advisee and advisor publication disciplines, since the distribution of
number of disciplines is not normal. Correlation results from all three approaches reveal similar strength,
direction and significance of correlation. Therefore, here the Pearson’s r is reported to keep consistent
with the other analyses.

126

and advisees in terms of publication discipline in Political Science. While in both Sociology and
Economics, this study rejects the null hypothesis. In other words, there is sufficient evidence in
this study supporting the statement that the correlation between advisors and advisees does
not equal to zero in Sociology and in Economics. The correlation coefficient is weak: r=0.076 in
Economics, and r=0.179 in Sociology.

Figure 4-8 Correlation of Publication Discipline
127

To compare the publication discipline diversity correlation among disciplines, Fisher’s r-to-z
transformation was applied. The null hypothesis here is that there is no difference between the
correlation coefficient of advisor-advisee publication diversity between two disciplines. The
alternative hypothesis is that there is significant difference between the publication discipline
correlation coefficients of two disciplines. Fisher’s test yields the result of p=0.003 between
Economics and Sociology, p=0.009 between Economics and Political Science, and p=0.000
between Political Science and Sociology. In other words, this study shows sufficient evidence
supporting a non-zero difference relationship between any two disciplines. Furthermore, result
also indicates that the correlation is higher in Sociology, followed by Economics and Political
Science.

4.4

Co-author and Collaboration

Collaboration is ubiquitous across most disciplines, and one essential aspect of scientometric
profiles examined in this study. According to the data, in Economics, Political Science and
Sociology, scientific collaboration (measured using co-authorship) is also the trend: about
66.15% of all publications by advisors and advisees are multi-authored, based on the data
utilized in this study. The number is expected to be higher in Natural Science and Engineering
disciplines, according to Larivière (2012). As mentioned earlier, co-authoring publications is
usually considered as a major type of scientific collaboration between scholars. Therefore, this
study operationalizes collaboration using co-authorship analysis. In other words, scholars who
appear in the byline of a publication are considered collaborators of each other. Similar to the
analyses on publication practice, collaboration analyses here also focus on diversity and
intensity. The collaboration diversity is examined using the number of unique collaborators, and
the collaboration intensity is measured using the percentage of a scholar’s collaborative
publications out of her total publications. This section aims to explore the relationship between
128

the collaboration patterns of advisors and advisees in Economics, Political Science and
Sociology.

4.4.1

Advisor and Advisee Collaboration

As some studies have mentioned, advisees usually collaborate with their doctoral advisors either
before or after their graduation (Sugimoto, 2010, 2011), and the intensity of advisor-advisee
collaboration differs depending on the discipline. In the selected sample in this study, about
22.5% of total advisees ever collaborated with their advisors. As shown in Table 4-3, Political
Science has the lowest rate of advisees collaborating with their advisors (14.5%) among the
three disciplines examined. In Economics, 24.9 % of the selected advisees collaborated with
their advisors. In Political Science, the number is 25.0%. In all three disciplines, result shows that
after-graduation collaboration with advisors is more prevalent than before-graduation
collaboration. This is possible because that those advisee-advisor collaborated publications were
in fact finished or submitted before the advisees graduated, and did not officially come out until
after they graduated. After all, it is well-know that the publication delay, which is defined as the
time from submitting a manuscript until its official publication (Luwel & Moed, 1998), exists in
all most all disciplines. Many studies (e.g. Egghe & Rousseau, 2000; Luwel & Moed, 1998) have
even shown that publication delay can be up to 48 months. Therefore, the publication delay
here can also be expected in these three social science disciplines, and is possibly one of reasons
why advisees, according to the data, seem to collaborate with advisors very frequently after
they graduated.

Furthermore, the extent to which advisees collaborated with advisors varies. Figure 4-9 displays
the percentage of publications collaborated with advisors/advisees. As shown, for advisees, the
percentage of publications that are collaborated with their advisors is higher in Sociology than in
Economics and Political Science. For advisors, the statistics are also higher in Sociology than in
Economics and Political Science. The number of publications in which advisees collaborated with
advisors also varies by discipline. Within the 10-year time window, the median number of
advisee-advisor collaborative publications for advisees in all three disciplines is one; the median
number of advisee-advisor collaborative publications for advisors is two in all three disciplines.
In all three disciplines, the number of advisee-advisor collaborative papers that advisors have is
larger than the advisee does, which is not surprising since advisors might have multiple advisees
while advisees only have a single advisor in most cases. Comparing across disciplines, advisors
in Economics have a larger number of advisee-advisor publications than those in the other two
disciplines, which can be caused by the fact that Economics advisors on average mentor more
advisees than Political Science and Sociology advisors in this dataset. Overall, advisees in
Sociology have a larger number of advisee-advisor collaborative publications, which is consistent
with the result in Table 4-3.

130

Figure 4-9 Percentage of Publication Collaborated with Advisors/Advisees

Publications collaborated on by advisors and advisees were removed for the subsequent
analyses regarding collaboration in order to avoid potential biases. There are reasons for doing
this. In this study, there are in total 138,437 publications finally sampled for the analysis,
including 47,684 advisee publications and 102,098 advisor publications. The total number of
publications that were the result of advisees collaborating with advisors is 3,474, which is about
7.3% of advisee publications, 3.4% of advisor publications, and 2.5% of total publications (Please
see Table 4-4 for details.). Additionally, the number of citations received by these adviseeadvisor collaborated papers was also investigated. As shown in Table 4-4, these 3,474 adviseeadvisor collaborated publications received 40,913 citations in total as of the end of 2013, which
is about 9.25% of all the citations received by advisee publications, 1.83% of citations received
by advisor publications, and 1.64% of citations received by all these selected publications in this
analysis. Meanwhile, as mentioned earlier, the number of publications for each individual
included in the analysis might be underestimated since only publications in journals indexed by

131

WoS are considered, and the citations to those publications are also underestimated since they
are only within WoS citations. Based on the above considerations, the set of advisee-advisor
collaborated publications were removed in the subsequent analyses.

Common Collaborator

Advisees may collaborate with their advisors, or some other scholars who are also collaborators
of their advisors. The in-depth of shared collaborator between advisors and advisees may also
show some connections between advisors and advisees. This section looks into the number of
collaborators that are shared by advisors and advisees, known as the common collaborator in
this study. Table 4-5 displays the number of common collaborators shared by advisor-advisee
pairs in each discipline, based on both the all-year time window and 10-year time window. The
percentage of advisees who shared collaborators with their advisors is lower when measured on
10-year time window than on all-year time window. In Economics, only 147 advisees (accounting
for 2.9% of total advisees in Economics included in this sample) shared collaborator with their
advisors, and the largest number of common collaborators is three, within the 10-year time
window. In Political Science, 45 advisees (accounting for 2.4% of advisees in Political Science
included in this sample) shared collaborators with advisors. The largest number of advisee132

advisor common collaborators is four, within the 10-year time window. In Sociology, 56 advisees
(accounting for 4.3% of total advisees in Sociology included in this sample) shared collaborator
with their advisors, and the largest number of common collaborators is three, within the 10-year
time window. Each of the above statistics is higher when measured based on all-year time
window, which is not surprising as the number of collaborators may increases by the number of
articles and the chance of having a common collaborator increases therewith. Among all three
disciplines, Sociology has the highest percentage of advisees who share collaborators with their
advisors, in both time windows. Result also shows that there is no significant difference
between the productivity of advisees with and without common collaborators with advisors
(p<0.05).

Collaboration Diversity

Collaboration is ubiquitous in today’s scientific world, but the extent to which they collaborate
varies (Olson, Zimmerman, & Bos, 2008; Sonnenwald, 2007). This section investigates the extent
to which scholars collaborate, i.e. collaboration diversity, by looking at the number of unique

133

collaborators they ever collaborated with within the examined time period. Collaboration
diversity intends to reveal the breadth of collaboration network of each scholar. In general, this
study assumes that the more collaborators an individual has, more collaborative she is. As
stated above, collaboration was operationalized as the presence of more than one author on
the byline of an article. Therefore, this study measures the collaboration diversity of scholars by
counting number of coauthors. As noted earlier, the advisor-advisee collaborated publications
were removed from this analysis.

Figure 4-10 displays the distribution of the number of unique collaborators for adviees and
advisors in all three disciplines: the left half shows the distribtion based on all-year time
window, and the right half shows the distribution based on the 10-year time window. As can be
seen from the figure, more than 70% of advisees in Political Science and Sociology have fewer
than 20 unique collaborators, for both the all-year and 10-year time windows. The number of
advisors in these two disciplines are slightly lower. The percentage of advisees with 21-50
unique collaboraotrs is lower than that of advisors across all three disciplines. Only fewer than
5% of advisees / advisors have more than 100 unique collaborotors in each of the three
disciplines, measured through both the all-year and 10-year time windows. Additionally,
advisors have on average (as measured by mean and median) a larger number of unique
collaborators than advisees do, in all three disciplines. Advisees and advisors in Economics have
more collaborators than those in Political Science and Sociology. There are some advisors (5%)
and advisees (7%) who have never collaborated with any others in the dataset, and the
percentage of these is lower in Economics than in Political Science and Sociology.

134

Figure 4-10 Distribution of Advisee and Advisor Unique Collaborators - AllYear

Figure 4-11 Cumulative Distribution of Advisors and Advisees’ Unique Collaborators – 10Year
135

The correlation between advisors and advisees’ unique collaborators was also examined here.
Figure 4-12 shows the correlation relationship between the unique number of collaborators of
advisees and advisors: the upper half shows the correlation coefficient measured on the all-year
time window and the lower half shows the correlation coefficient measured on the 10-year time
window. In examining the correlation coefficient, the null hypothesis that there is a zero
correlation between advisors and advisees in terms of unique collaborators. As indicated by the
figure, this study rejects the null hypothesis in all three disciplines. In other words, there is
sufficient evidence in this study supporting the existence of a non-zero correlation in any of the
three disciplines, under the significance level of 0.05. More specifically, the correlation
coefficient is r=0.237 in Economics, r=0.140 in Political Science and r=0.269 in Sociology when
measured under the 10-year time window. The number is slightly higher in each discipline when
measured under the all-year time window.

136

Figure 4-12 Correlation between Advisees and Advisors in terms of Collaborators

Additionally, while examing the number of collaborators by adviees and advisors, one possible
concern is that whether the number of collaborators is related to the number of publications.
Table 4-6 shows the correlation betweem the number of publications and the number of unique
collaborators for both advisees and advisors. Results shows that the number of unique
collaborators is not significantly correlated with the number of publications by scholars.

137

Therefore, the result is that collaborators of advisors and advisees are not necessary related to
their producitivity.

The comparison of the collaboration diversity between disciplines was conducted using Fisher’s
r-to-z transformation. In this analysis, the null hypothesis is that there is no significant difference
between the collaboration diversity correlation between each two of these three disciplines,
and the alternative hypothesis is that there is significant difference. The transformation yields
significant result between Economics and Political Science, Political Science and Sociology, but
not between Economics and Sociology. Therefore, the correlation of collaboration diversity
measured by unique collaborators varies by discipline.

4.4.4

Collaboration Intensity

Collaboration intensity in this study intends to measure the degree to which scholars collaborate
in doing research. With the availability of publication data from Web of Science, this study
measures the collaboration intensity of scholars using co-author analysis. Specifically, this study
created two indicators of collaboration intensity: the average number of authors per paper, and
the percentage of collaborated papers.

138

4.2.3.1

Average Authors per Paper

The number of authors per paper is calculated as the total number of authorship associated
with all the publication of a particular scholar, divided by the total number of articles that the
scholar publishes. As shown in Table 4-7, the average number of authors per paper varies by
discipline: Sociology is the highest and Economics is the lowest, for both advisors and advisees.
In all three disciplines, advisees have larger number of authors per paper than their advisors,
indicating to some degree that advisees are more collaborative than advisors on published
work.

Advisee
Economics
2.40
Political Science 2.57
Sociology

Advisor
2.17

2.54

In general, advisees have a higher number of authors per article than advisors do (2.22 vs. 2.16),
in all three disciplines. Figure 4-13 displays the average number of authors per paper of advisors
and advisees. As shown, advisors have a slightly lower number of average authors per paper
than advisees do across all three disciplines, as indicated by the median and mean value. The
distribution does not vary too much by time window.

139

Figure 4-13 Cumulative Distribution of Authors per Paper

Correlation between advisors and advisees’ average authors per paper was examined. Figure
4-14 shows the current evidence supporting the existence of such a non-zero relationship
between advisors and advisees in terms of authors per paper does not rise to a certain level
(α=0.05) in all three under the all-year time window. However, this study was able to reject the
hull hypothesis when measured under the 10-year time window in all three disciplines. In other
words, there is sufficient evidence in this study supporting the existence of such a non-zero
140

correlation between advisors and advisees’ average authors per paper indicator in all three
disciplines. Meanwhile, the correlation is weak in each discipline: r=0.201 in Economics, r=0.097
in Political Science and r=0.164 in Sociology.

Figure 4-14 Correlation between the Average Authors per Paper of Advisees and Advisors

To compare the correlations among disciplines, Fisher’s r-to-z transformation was performed
here. The null hypothesis here is that the correlation on the number of authors per paper
between advisors and advisees is not different between two disciplines, while the alternative
141

hypothesis assumes it is different between each two of them. The p values from Fisher’s r-to-z
transformation tests are all below 0.05 between Economics and Sociology, Political Science and
Sociology, and Economics and Political Science, indicating sufficient evidence of supporting a
non-zero difference between any two disciplines in terms of average authors per paper
correlations.

4.2.3.2 Collaboration Rate
In addition to authors per publication, this study also utilized collaboration rate, i.e. the
percentage of collaborated publications out of one’s total publications, as another indicator of
collaboration intensity. The higher one’s collaboration rate, the more intensive her scientific
collaboration is.

Figure 4-15 Cumulative Distribution of Collaboration Rate – All-Year
142

Figure 4-15 displays the distribution of collaboration for advisors and advisees under the all-year
time window, and Figure 4-16 the 10-year time window. As can been seen, the collaboration
rate of advisees is higher (both in terms of mean and median) than that of advisors, regardless
of disciplines when measured through the all-year time window. While measured through the
10-year time window, the median value of advisees’ collaboration rate is higher than that of
advisors in all three disciplines, but the mean value is lower. Of all three disciplines, Political
Science has lowest collaboration rate, while Economics the highest, for both advisees and
advisors. Furthermore, the median value of advisees’ collaboration rate is higher than that of
advisors across disciplines.

143

Figure 4-16 Cumulative Distribution of Collaboration Rate - 10Year

Pearson’s r reveals the association strength between advisors and advisees in terms of
collaboration rate. Figure 4-17 shows that there is sufficient evidence supporting the existence
of a non-zero relationship between advisors and advisees in all three disciplines, and measured
under both time windows, at the significance level of 0.05. The association between advisors
and advisees’ collaboration rate is higher measured under the 10-year time window than in the
all-year time window. However, correlation in each discipline is weak: r=0.28 in Sociology,
r=0.21 in Political Science and 0.14 in Economics.

Figure 4-17 Correlation between Advisees and Advisors in terms of Collaboration Rate

To compare the difference between the collaboration rate correlation coefficient between
disciplines, Fisher’s r-to-z transformation was employed. The null hypothesis here is that there is
no significant difference between the correlation coefficients of two disciplines. Fisher’s r-to-z
transformation yields p values under 0.05 between any two disciplines: p=0.003 between
Economics and Political Science, p=0.000 between Economics and Sociology, and p=0.024
between Political Science and Sociology. Therefore, there is sufficient evince in supporting the
144

existence of a non-zero difference between any two disciplines. A scrutiny at the comparison of
difference also reveals that the strongest correlation between the collaboration rate of advisees
and advisors appears in Sociology, and weakest in Economics. In other words, collaborative
advisees in Sociology are more likely to be mentored by collaborative advisors than in
Economics and Political Science. The correlation is stronger when measured in the 10-year time
window than in the all-year time window, which to some extent indicates that the advisees are
more likely to mimic their advisors’ collaboration patterns in the earlier years of their careers
than in the other times.

4.5

Reference and Knowledge Base

Authors cite previous studies to support their current research, acknowledge prior research, etc.
Depending on various factors, studies have shown that scholars behave differently in terms of
reference practices (Larivière, Archambault, et al., 2006). This section is interested in
understanding the reference practice of advisors and advisees and aims to discover whether
there is any association between them. Specifically, this section explores the reference practices
of advisors and advisees by focusing on common references, references per paper, outside
discipline reference, reference age and the impact of reference source.

4.5.1

Shared References

References cited by authors have been considered as those authors’ knowledge base by studies
(e.g. Yan & Ding, 2012). And advisors might transfer their knowledge about the discipline to
advisees during the process of mentoring, explicitly or implicitly. Therefore, this section is
interested in understanding whether and how advisors and advisees cite the same set of
references, known as shared reference hereafter. Generally, this study understands that the
more shared references between advisors and their advisees, the more similar their knowledge
145

base is. Additionally, publications co-authored by advisors and advisees were removed to avoid
possible over-counting and bias.

The number of advisees who ever shared references with their advisors was calculated.
According to the data, some advisors and advisees did tend to cite the same set of articles. As
shown in Table 4-8, about 28.48% of advisees studied here ever cited the same reference as
their advisors when measured in the 10-year window. The number increases to 35.39% when
measured through all-year time window. Among the three selected disciplines, Economics has a
higher percentage of advisees that have ever cited the same references as their advisors did.

This section also examines the shared reference between advisors and advisees at venue level,
i.e. shared reference venues. Similar to the findings from shared reference articles, some
advisees might cite documents from the same venues in their research as their advisors do.
Table 4-9 displays, in each discipline, the percentage of doctoral advisees that cited the same
venue as their advisors do, measured on both the all-year and 10-year time windows. As shown,
about 41.84% of advisees examined in this study ever cited the same venues when measured
146

under the 10-year time window, and 66.70% the all-year time window. Results also show that
on average a higher percent of advisees in Economics cite the same venue as their advisors do,
compared with the other two disciplines. The percentage of advisees who ever cited the same
venue as their advisors did is higher than those who cited the same article. This is not surprising
since venues are aggregations of individual articles in this study.

Reference per Paper

The number of references cited by an individual article varies a lot. According to Web of Science,
of those publication units categorized as “Article” type, the number of references cited in a
single article ranges from 1 to 4,785. More specifically, some previous studies (e.g. Larivière,
Sugimoto, & Bergeron, 2013) show that advisees and advisors cite different numbers of
references in their research. This section also examines the number of references that advisors
and advisees cited in their publications.

147

This analysis considers the average number of references per paper by advisors and advisees.
According to the data, advisees cite more references in their papers than advisors do across
disciplines, as displayed in Figure 4-18 and Figure 4-19. This is consistent with the findings in
(Larivière, Sugimoto, et al., 2013). In addition, advisees and advisors in Sociology cited more
references than those in Political Science and Economics. The difference between advisees’ and
advisors’ average references per paper is smaller when measured in the 10-year time window
than in the all-year time window.

Figure 4-18 Cumulative Distribution of Reference per Paper - AllYear

148

Figure 4-19 Cumulative Distribution of Reference per Paper – 10Year

Figure 4-20 displays the correlation between advisees’ and advisors’ average reference per
article: the upper half shows the correlation measured in the all-year time window, and the
bottom half shows the correlation measured in the 10-year time window. As displayed, there is
sufficient evidence supporting a non-zero correlation between the reference per paper of
advisors and advisees in all three disciplines in both time window. However, the correlation is
weak across disciplines: r=0.238 in Sociology, r=0.135 in Political Science, and r=0.182 in
Sociology.

149

Figure 4-20 Correlation between advisees’ and advisors’ average reference per article

The correlations were also compared with Fisher’s r-to-z transformation method. The null
hypothesis here is that there is no significant difference between the references per article
correlation of two disciplines. The result rejects the null hypothesis for the comparison between
Economics and Political Science (p=0.000), and Economics and Sociology (p=0.043) at the
significance level of 0.05. However, this study fails to reject the null hypothesis for the
comparison between Sociology and Political Science (p=0.144). In other words, there is sufficient

150

evidence supporting a non-zero difference between the correlation of Economics and Sociology,
and Economics and Political Science. While for Political Science and Sociology, the current
evidence supporting the existence of such a non-zero relationship between references per
paper correlation of these two discipline does not rise to the significance level of 0.05. Result
also shows that the correlation is higher in Economics than in Political Science and Sociology.

4.5.3

Reference Sources

Scholars might cite articles from within or outside of their own discipline. The degree to which
they cite from outside of their own disciplines might reflect one aspect of their research
interdisciplinarity: the more they cite other disciplines, the more interdisciplinary they are. This
section focuses on the percentage of outside discipline references, i.e. the number of references
from outside disciplines to the total number of references cited by an individual scholar.

Figure 4-21 and Figure 4-22 display the percentage of outside discipline references by both
advisors and advisees. As shown, in all three disciplines, advisees have a higher percentage of
outside discipline references than advisors do. Meanwhile, advisors and advisees in Sociology
have higher percentage of outside discipline references. Economics has the highest percentage
of outside discipline references among all three disciplines.

151

Figure 4-22 Cumulative Distribution of Outside Discipline Reference – 10Year
152

The correlation relationship between advisors and advisees in terms of outside discipline
reference was examined using Pearson’s r. By investigating the correlation, the study states the
null hypothesis that there is a zero correlation between advisors and advisees in terms of their
outside discipline references. As shown in Figure 4-23, this study rejects the null hypothesis in all
three disciplines. In other words, there is sufficient evidence exsits in supporting a non-zero
correaltion between advisors and adivisees’ outside discipline references in all three disciplines.
Additionally, the correlation is comparatively higher than that between advisors and advises in
terms of publication practice, or collaboration practice.

153

Figure 4-23 Correlation between percentages of outside discipline references

To compare the difference between the correlation of two disciplines, this study employed
Fisher’s r-to-z transformation. The null hypothesis here is that there is no difference between
the outside discipline reference correlations of two disciplines. Fisher’s r-to-z transformation
yields a value of p=0.638 between Sociology and Political Science, p=0.000 between Economics
and Political Science, and p=0.000 between Economics and Sociology. Therefore, there is
sufficient evidence exists here supporting such a non-zero difference between Economics and
Political Science, and between Economics and Sociology. This study fails to reject the null
hypothesis between Sociology and Political Science, indicating the evidence supporting the
existence of such a non-zero relation does not rise to a certain level (α=0.05). A scrutiny (onetail test) at the result reveals that the correlation is weaker in Economics than in Political Science
and Sociology.

4.5.4

Reference Age

The age of cited references of advisors and advisees is another focal point in this study. The
average age of cited references is calculated by subtracting the publication year of cited
document from the publication year of the citing document, and then averaging the numbers.
Figure 4-24 displays the distribution of average reference age of advisors and advisees in all
three disciplines. As shown, the advisors overall cite “older” references than advisees do in all
three disciplines. The median value of advisees’ reference age is 10.66 in Economics, 9.56 in
Political Science and 10.17 in Sociology. The median value of advisors’ reference is 11.63 in
Economics, 10.31 in Political Science and 10.61 in Sociology.

The correlations between the reference age of advisors and advisees are displayed in Figure
4-25. The null hypothesis here is that is a zero correlation between advisors and advisees in
154

terms of reference age. As shown, this study rejects the null hypothesis in all three disciplines. In
other words, the current evidence supporting the existence of such a non-zero relationship
between advisors and advisees in all three disciplines does not rise to a certain level (α=0.05).
Additionally, the correlation strength is weak in all three disciplines: r=0.14 in Economics, r=0.09
in Political Science and r=0.12 in Sociology

Figure 4-24 Distribution of Average Reference Age

155

Figure 4-25 Correlation between advisors and advisees’ average reference age

Fisher’s r-to-z transformation is employed here to compare the correlation between disciplines.
The null hypothesis is that there is no difference between the correlations of two disciplines.
Results yield a value of p=0.492 between Economics and Sociology, p=0.037 between Economics
and Political Science, and p=0.368 between Political Science and Sociology. In other words, there
is insufficient evidence exists supporting the zero difference between Political Science and
Sociology in terms of reference age correlation. Furthermore, the current evidence supporting
the existence of such a non-zero relationship between Economics and Sociology, and Economics
and Political Science does not rise to a certain level (α=0.05).

4.5.5

Reference source impact

Another aspect of cited reference examined in this study is the overall influence of cited articles,
which is operationalized as using the average impact factor of cited journals, known as average
reference impact in this study. As mentioned earlier, journal impact factor is a measurement of
scientific impact and is calculated annually based on Web of Science data and published in
Journal Citation Report. This study adopts the journal impact factor reported by JCR 2013 as a
measurement of journal scientific impact.
156

According to the data, the median value of average reference impact is higher for advisors and
advisees: 3.20 for advisors and 2.75 for advisees. At the discipline level, the trend is similar: the
median value of average reference impact is higher for advisors and advisees. Student’s t-test
was performed to compare the mean of advisors’ and advisees’ average reference impact,
showing that there is no significant difference between advisors’ and advisees’ average
reference impact. This result is also confirmed in Figure 4-26, which displays the cumulative
distribution of advisors’ and advisees’ average reference impact by discipline.

Figure 4-26 Cumulative Distribution of Average Reference Impact

The correlation between the average reference impacts was examined at the discipline level.
The null hypothesis here is that there is a zero correlation between the average reference
impact of advisors and advisees. As shown in Figure 4-27, this study rejects the null hypothesis
in all three disciplines. In other words, there is insufficient evidence in this study supporting the
existence of a zero correlation between advisors and advisees’ average reference impact at the
significance level of 0.05. Additionally, the correlation coefficient is weak: r=0.311 in Economics,
r=121 in Political Science and r=0.252 Sociology.

To compare the difference of average reference impact correlation between disciplines, Fisher’s
r-to-z transformation is employed here. The null hypothesis here is that there is no significant
difference between two disciplines in terms of average reference impact correlation at the
significance level of 0.05. The result yields a value of p=0.000 between Political Science and
158

Sociology, p=0.027 between Economics and Sociology, p=0.000 between Political Science and
Sociology. Thus, the null hypothesis is rejected here for the comparison between any two
disciplines. In other words, there is insufficient evidence supporting the existence of a zero
difference between any two disciplines. Additionally, a one-tail examination indicates that the
correlation is higher in Economics than in Sociology and Political Science.

4.5.6

Reference Diversity

Reference diversity here means the average number of unique journals and disciplines cited by
an individual scholar in this study. In general, this study considers that the larger the number of
journals (or disciplines) that an individual scholar cited, the more diverse this scholar’s reference
set is.

4.5.6.1 Journals
This section measures the number of unique journals cited by advisors and advisees in the 10year time period. The more journals an individual scholar cited, the more diverse the scholar’s
reference is. According to the data, advisors cite more journals than advisees do in all three

159

disciplines. Since the statistics on cited journals do not vary much by time window, only the
result under the 10-year time window is discussed here. As shown in Figure 4-28, the median
value of cited journals is 58 for advisors and 19 for advisees in Economics. In Political Science,
the median value of cited journals is 42 for advisors and 18 for advisees. While in Sociology, the
number is 71 for advisors and 23 for advisees.

Figure 4-28 Cumulative Distribution of Cited Journals

The correlation between advisors’ and advisees’ number of cited journals is displayed in Figure
4-29. The null hypothesis here is that there is a zero correlation between the reference diversity
of advisors and advisees. The null hypothesis is rejected in all three disciplines at the significance
level of 0.05, indicating there is sufficient evidence supporting such a non-zero correlation
160

between two disciplines. Meanwhile, the correlation is not strong: the correlation between
advisors and advisees’ number of cited journals is r= 0.092 in Economics, r=0.109 in Political
Science and r=0.223 in Sociology, which indicate weak associations.

To compare across disciplines, Fisher’s r-to-z transformation was employed here. The null
hypothesis here is that there is no significant difference between the reference venue diversity
correlations of two disciplines. According to the result, the p value between Economics and
Political Science in terms of the correlation is 0.529, which means this study fails to reject the
null hypothesis. However, the null hypothesis is rejected for the comparison between
Economics and Sociology (p=0.000), and Political Science and Sociology (p=0.001). In other
words, there is sufficient evidence supporting the non-zero relationship between Economics and
Sociology, and Economics and Political Science. Furthermore, one-tail exams also reveals that
the correlation is weaker in Economics than in Sociology and Political Science.

Figure 4-29 Correlation of Cited Journals between advisors and advisees

4.5.6.2 Disciplines
In addition to venue titles, the number of disciplines cited by an individual scholar is another
indicator of reference diversity in this study. Generally, the larger the number of disciplines cited
161

by an individual scholar, the more diverse this scholar’s knowledge base is. This section here
examines the number of unique disciplines that ever have documents cited by advisors and
advisees.

As shown in Figure 4-30, the median value of cited disciplines in Economics is 11 for advisors
and 4 for advisees. In Political Science, the number is 13 for advisors and 7 for advisees. While in
Sociology, the number is higher: 21 for advisors and 10 for advisees. As seen, advisors cite a
higher number of disciplines than advisees do in all three disciplines (p<0.05). Additionally,
advisors and advisees in Sociology overall cite more disciplines than those in Political Science
and Economics.

162

Figure 4-30 Cumulative Distribution of Number of Cited Disciplines

The correlation relationship was examined by discipline. The null hypothesis here is that there is
a zero correlation between advisors and advisees in terms of cited reference disciplines at the
significance level of 0.05. As shown in Figure 4-31, this study rejects the null hypothesis in all
three disciplines. In other words, there is significant evidence supporting the existence of a nonzero correlation between advisors and advisees. Additionally, the correlation is weak across
disciplines: r=0.158 in Economics, r=0.073 in Political Science and r=0.173 in Sociology.

163

While compared across disciplines, the null hypothesis here is that there is no significant
difference between two disciplines in terms of their correlation strength. Fisher’s r-to-z
transformation result indicates that the null hypothesis is rejected when comparing each two of
the three disciplines at the significance level of 0.05. In other words, there is sufficient evidence
supporting the existence of a non-zero difference between each two disciplines. Furthermore,
one-tail test reveals that the correlation is stronger in Sociology than in Economics and Political
Science.

Citation and Impact

A cited document indicates the citation of the concepts in the document (Small, 1978).
Therefore, the intensity and diversity of citations to a cited document may reflect the degree
and scope of impact by the concepts imbedded in the document. As mentioned earlier, citation
is commonly used as a measurement of scientific impact (e.g. Garfield, 1956). Although there
are contrary discussions (e.g. McGarty, 2000; Radicchi, Fortunato, & Castellano, 2008), citation is
still widely accepted as a measurement of scientific impact (de Bellis, 2009). In general, the
more citations received by a scholar, the more influential the scholar is. Additionally, the
164

diversity of citing sources reflects the interdisciplinarity of cited documents: the more disciplines
that cite a document, the more interdisciplinary the idea in the document is. Based on the
above understanding, this study also considers citation as an important aspect of scholars’
scientometric profiles, and focuses on the citation diversity and intensity of advisors and
advisees.

4.6.1

Overall Citations Received by Advisors and Advisees

According to the dataset, the selected advisors and advisees in this study produced 145,628
articles, and these publications have received 2,501,620 citations as of the end of 2013. Among
these citations, advisors account for 2,231,158 (89.19%), and advisees account for 442,301
(17.68%)19. The data suggest that the average number of citations per paper is higher in
Economics than in Sociology and Political Science, for both advisors and advisees. The average
number of citations per paper by advisors is 34.03 in Economics, 21.21 in Political Science, and
32.73 in Sociology. The average number of citations per paper for advisees is 16.38 in
Economics, 12.41 in Political Science and 16.24 in Sociology. Additionally, the number of
citations per person also varies by discipline. On average, advisors in Economics have a higher
mean number of citations (508.48) than in Sociology (306.30) and Political Science (202.16), and
the trend is consistent among advisees. Table 4-11 shows the detailed statistics for citations per
paper by advisors and advisees in these disciplines. Please note that the statistics reported here
are based on the all-year time window.

Table 4-11 Total Citations and Citations per Articles by Advisors and Advisees

The number exceeds 100% here because advisors and advisees collaborated on some of the articles,

and thus the citations are double counted when calculating for both roles.

Citation Diversity

As mentioned above, citation diversity is one important aspect of scholars’ scientometric profile.
This section looks into the citation diversity of selected advisors and advisees in Economics,
Political Science and Sociology. Here the citation diversity of advisors and advisees were studied
by examining the disciplines that have cited them, as known as citing disciplines. In general, the
more disciplines that cite a scholar, the more diverse her citation is. Furthermore, the citing
source of advisors and advisees’ articles reflect the research areas that their publications have
impact on. The number of citing disciplines of advisors and advisees, therefore, is an indicator of
interdisciplinarity: the larger the number of citing disciplines, the more interdisciplinary their
research is. Please note that the citing disciplines do not vary too much by the two time
windows (all-year and 10-year). Therefore, only the result measured under the 10-year time
window is reported here.

As described in the methods section, this study adopted NSF’s disciplinary area classification
schema for analysis. The disciplines that have cited publications authored by advisors and
advisees in these three discipline vary. On average, advisors have been cited by 21 disciplines,
and advisees seven. In Economics, the average number of citing disciplines is 6.25 for advisees,
and 22.14 for advisors. In Political Science, the number is 6.80 for advisees and 17.12 for

166

advisors. While in Sociology, the number is 9.60 for advisees and 25.89 for advisors. The
distribution of the number of citing discipline for advisors and advisees in Economics, Political
Science and Sociology is displayed in Figure 4-32. As shown, the median number of advisors’
citing disciplines is also higher than advisees’ in all three disciplines. For each discipline,
Student’s t-test was performed to compare the number of citing disciplines of advisors and
advisees, and the result (p<0.025, one-tail) shows that advisors’ number of citing disciplines is
significantly higher that of advisees’. The pattern is consistent across disciplines.

Figure 4-32 Number of Citing Disciplines

The correlation bettween advisors’ and advisees’ citing disciplines were also examined. In
testing the correlation by discipline, the null hypothesis here is that there is zero correlation
between advisors and advisese in terms of their citing disciplines at the significance level of
0.05. As shown in Figure 4-33, the null hypothesis is rejected in Economics (r=0.150, p<0.05) and

167

Sociology (r=0.21, p<0.05), indicating that there is sufficient evidence supporting the existence
of a non-zero correlation relationship in these two disciplines. This study fails to reject the null
hypothesis in Political Science, indicating that the current evidence supporting the existence of
such a non-zero relationship between advisors and advisees in Political Science does not rise to
a certain level (α=0.05). Additionally, the correlation between the number of citing disciplines of
advisors and advisees is weak.

Fisher’s r-to-z transformation was employed here to compare the difference between the
correlation relationship of Economics and Sociology. The null hypothesis here is that there is no
significant difference between disciplines in terms of citation diversity at the significance level of
0.05. The Fisher’s r-to-z result shows a p value lower than 0.05 between any two disciplines,
indicating that there is sufficient evidence supporting the existence of a non-zero relationship
between any two disciplins in this study. Furthermore, one-tail test also reveals that the
correlation is stronger in Sociology than in Political Science and Economics.

Citations Intensity

Citation count and its variants have been widely adopted as indicators of scientific impact. This
section considers total citations and average citations per paper as the two indicators of
scientific impact for advisors and advisees.

4.6.3.1 Total Citations
This section considers the total number of citations received by an individual scholar as her
overall indication of scientific impact. Citation counts are calculated under both the all-year and
10-year time windows. Overall, advisors received more citations (as measured by mean and
median values) than advisees in all three disciplines. This is not surprising considering the fact
that advisors are more advanced in their careers than advisees are, and advisors’ publications
have longer life and higher chance of accumulating citation. The gap between the citations of
advisors and advisees is larger when measured in the all-year time window than in the 10-year
time window. Additionally, both advisors and advisees in Economics received more citations
than those in Political Science and Sociology, as measured by median value.

169

Figure 4-34 Cumulative Distribution of Total Citations – All Year

Figure 4-35 Cumulative Distribution of Total Cites – 10Year

170

The empirical cumulative distribution reaffirms the results above, as shown in Figure 4-35.
Overall, advisees receive fewer citations than their advisors do. In addition, the percentage of
advisees who received zero citations is significantly higher that of advisors in all three
disciplines, measured in both all-year and 10-year time windows.

The correlation relationship is examined here using Pearson’s r correlation. The null hypothesis
here is that the correlation between the advisors and advisees in terms of their citations equals
to zero. This study fails to reject the null hypothesis in Political Science and Sociology, indicating
that there the current evidence supporting the existence of such a non-zero relationship
between advisors and advisees in these two disciplines does not rise to a certain level (α=0.05).
This study rejects the null hypothesis in Economics: the correlation coefficient r=0.181 in
Economics. This implies that there is sufficient evidence supporting the existence of a non-zero
relationship between advisors and advisees in terms of total citations in Economics.

Figure 4-36 Correlation between the total citations of advisors and advisees
171

Fisher’s r-to-z transformation examines the difference between population correlations of two
disciplines. The null hypothesis here is that there is no significant difference between the
correlation of two discipline at the significant level of 0.05. This study fails to reject the null
hypothesis between Political Science and Economics (p=0.089), Political Science and Sociology
(p=0.952) and Economics and Sociology (p=0.112). In other words, the current evidence
supporting the existence of such a non-zero relationship between any two disciplines does not
rise to a certain level (α=0.05) in this study.

4.6.3.2 Average Citations
While the total citations received by a scholar usually indicate her overall scientific impact, it can
favor scholars with larger number of publications. Therefore, this section focuses on average
citations per paper, which normalizes scholars’ citation by her productivity.

The mean value of citations per paper is 34.03 for advisors in Economics, 21.21 in Political
Science and 32.73 in Sociology. The number for advisees is 16.38 in Economics, 12.41 in Political
Science and 16.24 in Sociology. To further illustrate the relationship, Figure 4-37 shows the
cumulative distribution of average citations per article by advisors and advisees. As shown, the
average citations per paper of advisors is still significantly higher than that of advisees, and the
pattern persist across disciplines.

172

Figure 4-37 Cumulative Distribution of Average Citations per Paper by Advisors and Advisees

The correlation between advisors and advisees’ average citations per paper was also examined.
The null hypothesis here is that there is a zero correlation between advisors and advisees in
terms of average citations per paper. As displayed in Figure 4-38, this study rejects the null
hypothesis in all three disciplines under the significance level of 0.05. In other words, there is
sufficient evidence supporting the existence of a non-zero correlation between advisors and
advisees in terms of average citations per paper in all three disciplines.
173

Figure 4-38 Correlation between average cites per paper by advisors and advisees

To compare the correlations between advisors’ and advisees’ citations per paper across
disciplines, this section also adopted Fisher’s r-to-z transformation. The null hypothesis is that
there is no difference between the average citations per paper correlation of two disciplines. All
the p values are smaller than 0.05 in the test, indicating that there is sufficient evidence from
the study supporting the existence of a non-zero relationship between any two disciplines. The
correlation is stronger measured under the 10-year window than in the all-year time window.
Furthermore, the result shows that the association between advisors’ and advisees’ average
citation per paper is highest in Economics, followed by Sociology and Political Science.

174

4.6.4

Outside of discipline citation

Documents can be cited by studies within the same discipline (within-discipline citation) or
outside of its discipline (outside discipline citation). This section examines the percentage of
scholars’ outside discipline citations out of their total citations. As mentioned earlier, the more
that a document is cited by studies outside of its discipline, the more interdisciplinary the
document might be. Based on this understanding, in this study, the percentage of citations that
a scholar received from outside of her discipline is considered as an indicator of her research
interdisciplinarity: the higher percentage of her outside discipline citations, the more
interdisciplinary her research is.

According to the data, the percentage of outside discipline citation of advisees is higher than
that of advisors in all three disciplines, as measured by both mean and median. Among all three
disciplines, Sociology has the highest mean and median number of outside discipline citations
for both advisors (0.888) and advisees (0.810), when measured under the 10-year time window.
Economics has the lowest: the statistics for advisee is 0.727, and advisor 0.505. The percentage
of outside discipline citation is higher when measured under the 10-year time window than the
all-year time window. Figure 4-39 displays the cumulative distribution of advisors’ and advisees’
outside discipline citation in all three disciplines.

175

Figure 4-39 Cumulative Distribution of Percentage of Outside Discipline Citation

The correlation between the outside discipline citation of advisors and advisees were also
examined. The null hypothesis here is that the correlation coefficient equals to zero between
advisors and advises in terms of their outside discipline citations. As shown in Figure 4-40, this
study rejects the null hypothesis in all three disciplines under both time windows. In other
words, there is sufficient evidence supporting the existence of such a non-zero correlation
between advisors and advisees in all three disciplines. Meanwhile, the correlation is weak across
disciplines: r=0.314 in Economics, r=0.271 in Political Science and r=0.289 in Sociology.

176

Figure 4-40 Correlation of outside discipline citation between advisors and advisees

To compare the difference in correlations between disciplines, Fisher’s r-to-z transformation
was employed here. The null hypothesis here is that there is no difference between the
correlation coefficients of two disciplines. Fisher’s r-to-z transformation yields a result of p
values larger than 0.05 in between any two disciplines, which indicates that the current
evidence supporting the existence of such a non-zero relationship between any two disciplines
does not rise to a certain level (α=0.05). In other words, the difference between the correlation
strength of any two disciplines is not statistically significant.

Discussion and Limitation

This dissertation explores the relationship between advisors and advisees in terms of their
scientometric profiles, and the possible variation among disciplines. A number of
methodological innovations were necessary to carry out this analysis, in author name
disambiguation and data integration. This chapter will discuss the implications of both
methodological innovations and the results of the study.

4.7

Name Disambiguation and Heterogeneous Data Integration

This section will review the approaches of author name disambiguation and data integration
adopted in this study. As one of the few efforts towards disambiguating and merging Web of
Science and ProQuest data, approaches adopted here not only enable the analyses in this study
but also contribute to the overall solutions of author name disambiguation and heterogeneous
data integration on Web of Science and ProQuest.

4.7.1

Name Disambiguation

The ultimate goal of author name disambiguation is to attribute the documents to individuals
who authored them correctly. Assigning correct authorship has been attracting renewed
interest in the past years. Many conferences and workshops have continuous call for effective
author name disambiguation solutions. For instance, ACM SIGKDD (Association for Computing
Machinery’s Special Interest Group on Knowledge discovery and Data Mining) has run a special
competition on author name disambiguation solutions, known as KDD Cup for Author Name
Disambiguation, for many years. Publishers, such as Thomson Reuters and Elsevier, also devote
their internal efforts on author name disambiguation on Web of Science (Thomson Reuters) and
Scopus (by Elsevier) data. Additionally, there are other organizations promoting correct
authorship assigning. For instance, a non-profit organization, ORCID, facilitates the use of a
178

unique author identification number with the input from publication authors. Scholars have also
published intensively on effective solutions to author name disambiguation using different
models and data sources (e.g. D'Angelo, Giuffrida, & Abramo, 2011; Torvik, Weeber, Swanson, &
Smalheiser, 2005).

Many efforts mentioned above have both pros and cons, as discussed in chapter 2. To this end,
this study developed a new supervised-learning approach based on Support Vector Machine
(SVM) methods, which uses a selected set of features to classify authors in Web of Science. This
method was able to build a link between documents and individuals in Web of Science with
higher accuracy as compared with many other approaches. The main advantages of this
approach are: 1) it is one of the first few solutions on author name disambiguation on a massive
scale. Previous studies mostly focused on dataset of authors on the scale of hundreds (e.g.
Ferreira et al., 2010), thousands (e.g. Milojević, 2013), or millions (e.g. Torvik & Smalheiser,
2009). The current approach was used to deal with about 50 million records from Web of
Science. For the purpose of the particular analyses, this dissertation only used the result for a
subset of authors in Economics, Political Science and Sociology; and 2) unlike some other
approaches that use additional extra resources other than bibliographic information (e.g.
Pereira et al., 2009), the approach in this study only uses information provided by Web of
Science, which largely reduces the complexity of the solution. This author name disambiguation
approach not only enables analyses for this study, but also benefits many other uses, especially
those based on bibliographic databases.

The scientometrics community should benefit from this approach. Most scientometric studies
relied on Web of Science data, and yet suffered from name ambiguity issues in the database
(e.g. Bar-Ilan, 2008; Radicchi, Fortunato, Markines, & Vespignani, 2009; Andreas Strotmann &

179

Zhao, 2012; Strotmann et al., 2009). For instance, without the correct link between individuals
and documents, the number of publications (and citations) of a particular individual can be over
counted if there are many individuals with the same name, or be under counted if published
under different names. With the present approach, researchers will be able to apply the name
disambiguation approach after they collect data from Web of Science before they perform any
analysis. Additionally, since this approach was created and optimized towards features in Web
of Science, researchers will be able to use the approach directly without extra steps. This will
make their subsequent analyses on Web of Science data more accurate.

Journal editors and conference chairs might also find this approach useful. A colleague once
described to me that he once received an invitation to review an article submitted to a very
prestigious journal of its discipline, and yet he is clearly not within that discipline at all. He found
that there is an individual with the same name as him in that discipline after some research. This
may not be the only case in scientific communities. With the author name disambiguation
discussed here performed, journal editors might be able to avoid such situations, and assign
manuscripts to potential reviewers by knowing more details of their publication profile.
Conference chairs, similarly, will be able to send invitation to prospective invitees.

Funding agencies could also benefit from the solution of disambiguating Web of Science
authors. Web of Science is one of the largest bibliographic databases, and many organizations
(including some funding agencies) rely on the data for some relative activities. For instance,
those funding agencies seeking to choose referees for proposals can benefit from identifying all
of their collaborators, so that they can recognize some potential conflicts of interests in
advance. Funding agencies might also be able to evaluate the performance of previously funded
projects by identifying the publications by a specific funded investigator.

180

Academic promotion committees and award committees might also benefit from this solution.
Since Web of Science has specific criteria for titles to be included, which ensures the index of a
core set of journals in each discipline, it is still widely used as the source for scientific
performance evaluation of individuals. With the correct link between individuals and
documents, tenure promotion committees in universities, for instance, will be able to evaluate
the scientific performance of each individual more accurately. Similarly, award committees can
also make use of the result from this author name disambiguation solution to identify the
publication profiles for candidates, which might inform their final decision to some degree.

Policy makers who rely on Web of Science as the data source can also make use of this author
name disambiguation solution. Some policy makers would like to know the subsequent career
performance of some trainees and grantees (Smalheiser & Torvik, 2009). For instance, National
Research Council evaluates doctoral programs using a set of indicators including the number of
publications and citations of faculty in each program. They usually retrieve publication records
and citations from Web of Science, and thus suffer from incorrect links between individuals and
documents. To solve this problem, National Research Council usually sends questionnaires to
faculty members for possible name variants and associated zip codes to help with attributing
correct authorships to individuals. With the approach provided in this study, a questionnaire is
no longer needed, which will save much financial and labor expense for this purpose.

In addition to Web of Science, ProQuest also needs name disambiguation so that each individual
in it is correctly attributed with dissertation authorship and mentorship if any. As mentioned in
Chapter 3, the solution to link individuals with authorship and mentorship does not use any
complicated models or features, as most individuals only have one doctoral degree
(dissertation) in each discipline. It is straightforward, and the first known effort to deal with

181

authorship and mentorship on ProQuest on such a massive scale (about two million records).
This result could help any future analyses based on doctoral mentoring relationship, as it
identifies dissertation advisors, dissertation authors and dissertation documents.

4.7.2

Heterogeneous Data Integration

Connecting Web of Science and ProQuest is another critical step of the analyses in this study, as
it provides the scientometric profiles (extracted from Web of Science) of individual dissertation
advisees and advisors (extracted from ProQuest). As described in Chapter 3, the integration of
Web of Science and ProQuest data was considered as a binary classification task of supervised
learning based on a selected set of features (e.g. affiliation and publication topic). This step
involves some human judged pairs of ProQuest dissertation advisors (and advisees) and Web of
Science authors set as the training and evaluation set.

This is so far the first known attempt to connect the Web of Science bibliographic database and
the ProQuest dissertation database. This study employed an easy to understand,
computationally inexpensive and yet effective approach, which might be applicable to similar
questions regarding data integration. It should be particularly useful for connecting bibliographic
databases, as it was optimized for this type of data. Additionally, the integrated data not only
provide the data needed for the particular analyses in this study, but also any other future
research that will utilize the data. See Chapter 6 for more discussions on this.

The integration of ProQuest and Web of Science is the foundation of the “Integrated Scholar
Profile” database, as shown in Figure 5-1. As shown, the “Integrated Scholar Profile” database
will incorporate a comprehensive profile for each scholar, including her publication related
information, mentor and mentoring history, grant funding support, social-demographic feature,
etc. This will allow us to understand scholars, as the intellectual human capital of the scientific
182

workforce, more thoroughly than ever before. Creating the “Integrated Scholar Profile”
database will require more extra input, and the successful merging of Web of Science and
ProQuest is fundamental step.

Figure 5-1 Integrated Scholar Profile database

Researchers involved in bibliographic data based research will benefit largely from this
integration. Heterogeneous data integration is critical in the current era of Big Data, as the
successful connection of multiple datasets provides richer information that is otherwise not
available. The union of Web of Science and ProQuest in this study, for example, provides more
comprehensive profiles of scholars than ever before: most previous studies either considered
scholars as authors based on bibliographic data by Web of Science (e.g. Ni, Shaw, Lind, & Ding,
2013), or as mentors and mentees based on ProQuest data (e.g. Sugimoto et al., 2011). With
the successful union of these two data sources by this study (and more later on), analyses
regarding scholars will go beyond just a single aspect of their profiles. Meanwhile, the approach
183

of integration adopted here will be available to the public. Therefore, researchers will be able to
customize the solution to merge other data sources.

4.8

Publication and Productivity

Productivity is the fundamental criteria for academic success. This section, therefore, will
examine the degree to which publication practices are shared or differ between advisors and
advisees and across disciplines. This section discusses the publication diversity and intensity of
doctoral advisors and advisees in Economics, Political Science, and Sociology. The publication
diversity here is measured by the number of disciplines (by NSF category) where doctoral
advisees and advisors have published their research. The publication intensity here is measured
by the total number of articles doctoral advisees or advisors published within the 10-year time
window.

4.8.1

Publication Intensity

As mentioned earlier, publication is one essential form of scientific research output, and
publication quantity (and its variants) have been widely used as indicators of scientific
productivity (Narin, 1976). This study investigates the scientific productivity of advisors and
advisees by examining their number of publications in both the 10-year time window and the
all-year time window. Patterns regarding the publication intensity of advisors and advisees are
as follows.

On the one hand, advisors are more prolific than their advisees in all three disciplines, measured
under both time windows. In general, advisors outperform advisees in terms of publication
intensity under the all-year time window. This is not surprising considering the fact that advisors
usually have longer histories of publishing research, and thus may accumulate more publications
than advisees do. When measured under the 10-year time window, advisors are still more
184

productive than advisees. It is believed that faculty members usually have greater access to
social networks, scientific and technical human capital, collaboration opportunities, etc., which
are factors related to higher productivity (Allison & Stewart, 1974; Dietz & Bozeman, 2005).
Therefore, this finding seems to be more evidence of the close relationship between seniority
and productivity in academic career.

On the other hand, there is weak correlation relationship between the publication intensity of
advisors and advisees in Economics and Sociology, but not in Political Science. Fisher’s r-to-z
transformation further reveals that the correlation does not vary significantly by discipline.
Additionally, highly productive advisees (top 25%) are more likely to be trained by highly
productive advisors (top 25%) than by the rest of advisors, in both Economics and Sociology.
This is consistent with some findings from some previous studies. For instance, Long and
McGinnis (1985) found that mentees’ performances are related to that of mentors but not
strongly. Instead, there are many other factors that might be related to the scientific
productivity of mentees at the post-doctoral stage, such as scientific collaboration, institutional
position, and departmental culture of their new positions (Long, 1978).

4.8.2

Publication Diversity

Publication diversity is measured by analyzing the number of disciplines and journals that an
individual scholarly has published articles in. The more disciplines (journals) that scholars have
published in, the more diverse and interdisciplinary their research is.

Advisors are more interdisciplinary than advisees, as has been indicated by the result of
publication diversity: advisors tend to publish in a larger variety of disciplines and venues than
their advisees in all three disciplines. The interdisciplinarity of scholars are usually measured
through multiple perspectives, and the publication diversity is one of them. The more diversified
185

scholars’ publication venues are, the more diversified the scholars’ research is. In this study,
advisors publish in a larger number of journals and disciplines than advisees do overall. Reasons
why advisors seem more interdisciplinary than advisees are multidimensional, among which
tenure might be an important one. While in earlier career stages, advisees may tend to stay
within the confines of the discipline in order to establish themselves and win the tenure game,
more established researchers (advisors) may feel free to jump around multiple disciplines and
be more interdisciplinary (Nazim Ali, Young, & Ali, 1996; Tang & Chamberlain, 2003).
Additionally, the fact that advisors are more productive than advisees may also contribute to
this phenomenon: the higher the number of publications is, the higher chance that scholars
publish in more journals and disciplines.

Furthermore, significant correlation relationships exist between the publication diversity of
advisors and advisees in Economics and Sociology, but not Political Science. Fisher’s r-to-z
transformation further reveals that the strength of correlation is significantly different between
Economics and Sociology: the latter has a stronger correlation between the publication diversity
of advisors and advisees than the former. In other words, advisors in Sociology are more likely to
train advisees with similar research interdisciplinarity level than those in Economics. Whereas, in
Political Science, advisors and advisees are not associated in terms of interdisciplinarity.
However, it should be noted that the association is still rather weak. Interdisciplinarity can be
related to many other factors, such as collaboration, physical and human capital, and
institutional context (Rafols & Meyer, 2010; Wagner et al., 2011). Additionally, during the postdoctoral stage, there are might be other factors related to the interdisciplinarity of advisees in
addition to their advisors. Therefore, the interdisciplinarity of advisors is not the only factor that
is related to that of advisees, and further investigations into other factors are necessary.

186

4.9

Co-author and Collaboration

The collaboration pattern of advisors and advisees was also examined through diversity and
intensity. The collaboration intensity is measured as the percentage of scholars’ publications
that are finished by collaborating with others, and the collaboration intensity is calculated as the
number of unique collaborators. Additionally, collaboration between advisors and advisees was
also explored.

4.9.1

Advisee-Advisor Collaboration

Advisee-advisor collaboration is believed to be an important part of doctoral education, which
can improve advisees’ “productivity, success and competence” (Green & Bauer, 1995, p. 543).
While collaboration might happen in forms other than co-publishing, this study only focuses on
collaboration reflected by co-authoring publications between advisees and advisors.

In this study, advisees and advisors collaborate with each other to a different extent in
Economics (12.5%), Political Science (24.9%) and Sociology (25%). The advisee-advisor
collaboration rate of all three disciplines is 22.5%, which is lower compared with other
disciplines. Long and McGinnis (1985) found out that about 55% of advisees ever collaborated
with their advisors in Biochemistry. The number is higher in the field of Library and Information
Science: 41% of advisees reported that they collaborated at least once with their advisors
(committee chairs) (Sugimoto, 2011) during doctoral study. The lower advisee-advisor
collaboration rate in Economics, Political Science and Sociology might be caused by multiple
factors. Firstly, collaboration might happen in Economics, Political Science and Sociology in
forms other than co-publishing, such as in teaching, grant application, and co-authoring
monographs. Secondly, disciplines like Biochemistry usually require more collaborative work
than social science disciplines. Those disciplines function in the format of the lab, and are usually
187

in greater need of physical and human capital for research, which are later reflected in the form
of co-authorship in publications (Newman, 2001c).

Furthermore, the advisee-advisor collaboration rate is higher during post-graduation stage than
pre-graduation stage, in all three disciplines which is contrary to some previous studies
(Sugimoto, 2011). While there might be multiple reasons why advisees and advisors
collaborated more after graduation, such as continuing supervising from advisors after
graduation (Rose, 2003; Sugimoto, 2009), and publishing based on doctoral dissertations which
usually involve advisors (Isaac et al., 1992), another important one might be publication delay
(Garvey & Griffith, 1964). Publication delay is the chronological distance between completion of
a scientific work and distribution of its achievements as a peer reviewed paper (Roland &
Kirkpatrick, 1975; Stern & Simes, 1997). As demonstrated in Chapter 3, all three disciplines rely
largely on journals as the publication venue, and journals usually suffer from publication delays
between a few months to a few years (Amat, 2007). Therefore, observed collaboration between
advisors and advisees in this study might happen before graduation but were not officially
published until after graduation.

Advisee-advisor collaboration is considered an important part of academic mentoring system
(Long & McGinnis, 1985; Sugimoto, 2011). Results show that there is a significant difference
between advisees who collaborated with advisors and not in terms of productivity and citation
(See Chapter 4). Long and McGinnis (1985) claimed that collaboration with advisors during the
doctoral program stage initiates a process of cumulative advantage for advisees: the
performance (productivity and citation) of advisors has greater impact on advisees who have
ever collaborated with advisors during doctoral study than those who have not. Although this
study concentrates on the post-graduation stage (when measured under the 10-year time

188

window), the conclusion seems to be in line with previous findings. Therefore, advisee-advisor
collaboration is an important factor to be examined in the future.

4.9.2

Common Collaborators

Common collaborators in this study refer to those authors who published with both advisors
and advisees independently. The more common collaborators advisors and advisees share with
each other, closer they are to each other in terms of collaboration profiles. Result shows that
only a small amount of advisees ever shared collaborators with advisors under the 10-year time
window: 2.91% in Economics, 2.40% in Political Science, and 4.32% in Sociology.

Establishing collaboration with individuals is a process related to many factors, such as affiliation
history, geographic proximity (Cronin & Shaw, 2007), personal capability, infrastructure and
institutional context (Hara, Solomon, Kim, & Sonnenwald, 2003). Some factors change for
advisees after graduation, and thus continuous collaboration with specific individuals might be
limited. For instance, in Cronin and Shaw (2007) study about Rob Kling, an eminent information
scientist, they found his collaboration changed as he moves among institutions. Some other
studies (e.g. Hoekman, Frenken, & Tijssen, 2010; McKelvey, Alm, & Riccaboni, 2003) also
demonstrated that spatial proximity plays a critical role in scientific collaboration.

Advisors and advisees share collaborators to a limited extent. While shared collaborators might
be an indication of indirect collaboration between advisors and advisees, it may also imply to
the extent that advisees “mimic” their advisors’ collaboration pattern by continuing
collaboration with individuals who were collaborators of their advisors. However, as the result
as demonstrated, the percentage of advisees who share collaborators with advisors is still low,
which indicates that only a few advisees imitate advisors’ collaboration profiles by collaborating
with the same individual.
189

4.9.3

Collaboration Intensity

Collaboration intensity measures the extent to which individuals collaborate with others. This
article quantified it using the average number of authors per article (average authors), and the
percentage of collaborative articles out of the total (collaboration rate).

In general, advisees tend to collaborate with more authors, and published more collaborative
articles than advisors do in all three disciplines. With the increasingly narrow focus of scientific
research (Simonton, 2013), collaboration has been the trend of scientific knowledge creation (D.
D. Beaver, 2001). Positive correlation has been discovered between collaboration and many
other scientometric metrics, such as productivity (Price & Beaver, 1966; Reskin, 1977), citation
impact (Goldfinch, Dale, & DeRouen Jr, 2003; Oromaner, 1974), possibility of acceptance for
publication (Bahr & Zemon, 2000; Presser, 1980), and chances of projects receiving funding
(Hart, Carstens, Lacroix, & May, 1990; Price, 1981). Advisees analyzed in under the 10-year time
window are comparatively fresher in their careers, and thus might seek more collaboration
opportunities in order to build up their research. Additionally, based on the 10-year rule,
publications of advisors overall appeared earlier than those of advisees (see Chapter 3). Studies
have shown that collaboration rate and average authors increasing by time is a universal
phenomenon in most disciplines (Larivière, Gingras, & Archambault, 2006). Therefore, the
observation that advisees are more collaborative than advisors might also be due to the
changing nature of disciplines.

Advisors and advisees are significantly correlated in terms of collaboration intensity in all three
disciplines. The correlation is stronger than the correlation of publication diversity and intensity,
indicating that advisees are more likely to inherit the collaboration intensity of their advisors
than productivity. When compared across disciplines, the result shows that the correlation is

190

significantly different across disciplines. In other words, advisees in Sociology are more likely to
mimic the collaboration intensity of their advisors than those in Economics and Political Science.

Collaboration is considered a critical part of doctoral mentoring. Studies have proved that
collaborative context have salutary effects on the research careers of doctoral students
(Anderson, 1996), and students who are more collaborative during doctoral studies are more
likely to be collaborative than those not (Long & McGinnis, 1985; Stanley, Stein, Ottenbacher, &
Liu, 2002). The significant correlation between advisees’ and advisors’ collaboration intensity
further implies that collaboration intensity is more likely to be learned and continued by
advisees after graduation. While collaboration is related to many other factors (see above), it
also shows the cumulative advantage (Merton, 1988) to some extent: collaborative scholars are
more likely to remain collaborative than those who are not, and collaborative scholars are more
likely publish highly influential work, receive funding support, and be more productive.

However, it should be noted that the correlation is still weak (r< 0.3), which also implies that
there might other factors that would explain the relationship between the correlation of
advisors’ and advisees’ collaboration intensity.

4.9.4

Collaboration diversity

Collaboration diversity aims to measure the breadth of collaboration network of each scholar by
quantifying the number of unique collaborators that the scholar has co-published with. In the
theory of social networks, the more collaborators one scholar has, the higher the degree
centrality she is in the collaboration network. The number of collaborators of each scholar varies
by discipline (Newman, 2004b), and has been claimed to be associated with some scientometric
indicators such as productivity, and citation impact (e.g. Abramo, D’Angelo, & Rosati, 2013;
Persson, Glänzel, & Danell, 2004).
191

In this study, advisees have fewer unique collaborators than advisors do in all three disciplines.
Since collaborators are maybe associated with publication quantity, and career length, it is
expected that advisors have more collaborators than advisees. The trend is similar with
publication productivity, where advisors outperform advisees. However, the collaboration
intensity, as measured by collaboration rate and average author, shows advisees are more
collaborative. Additionally, the average number of collaborators each individual has is different
among disciplines, which is consistent with some previous findings (e.g. Larivière, Gingras,
Sugimoto, & Tsou, 2015; Newman, 2004b).

Advisors and advisees are significantly correlated in terms of collaboration diversity, but with
different strength. In other words, advisees with more unique collaborators during the 10-year
period are more likely to be trained by advisors with more unique collaborators. Since the
number of shared collaborators between advisors and advisees is subtle, collaborators of
advisors and advisees are mostly different individuals. Considering geographic proximity to be
an important factor of research collaboration (Gazni, Sugimoto, & Didegah, 2012), advisees’
collaborators might be colleagues in the position after graduation, or individuals from personal
relationships and others. This further implies that advisees mimic collaboration diversity of
advisors without collaborating with the same individuals.

Additionally, this study shows sufficient evidence supporting the existence of a non-zero
correlation in any of the three disciplines. In other words, the extent to which advisees imitate
the collaboration diversity of their advisor is different across disciplines. Sociology has the
strongest correlation relationship between advisors and advisees, followed by Economics and
Political Science. This is coincident with the findings from analyzing collaboration intensity. It

192

implies that, in Sociology, advisees with more (fewer) collaborators are more likely to be trained
by advisors with more (fewer) collaborators than in Economics and Political Science.

However, considering the longevity of collaboration, there are might be in general two types of
collaborators for a scholar: 1) sustaining collaborators-those collaborators who the scholar
worked multiple times with and maintain long-time collaboration relationship, and 2) ephemeral
collaborators-those collaborators a scholar only worked once or a few times and the
collaboration relationship ceased. Therefore, for an individual scholar, a higher number of
collaborators might be due to a higher rate of ephemeral collaborators. Therefore, future work
will consider the weight of collaborators (the number of times that the scholar has collaborated
with a specific collaborator) in measuring the collaboration diversity of advisors and advisees,
and further explore the association between them.

4.10 Reference and Knowledge Base
The reference practice of scholars reflects, to some extent, how they seek and use scientific
information, as well as their knowledge base. This section discusses the relationship between
advisors’ and advisees’ reference practices in Economics, Political Science and Sociology.

4.10.1 Reference per Publication
The number of references per publication may vary due to the type and field of research, as well
as the availability of scientific literature for references (Larivière et al., 2013). For each article,
advisors tend to cite fewer articles for their references than advisees do. This is accordant with
some previous findings (e.g. Larivière et al., 2013). Many studies connected this with the age
factor in science (e.g. Barnett & Fink, 2008; Gingras, Lariviere, Macaluso, & Robitaille, 2008): the
shorter a scholar is in her scientific career, the more literatures she cites. Young researchers try
to build their research by increasing productivity, and they thus will accumulate a basic set of
193

literature in the discipline as the knowledge base (and add to the set as new research comes
out.). While senior scholars might already have the set of references and not be as up to date on
the new literature as younger scholars are (Gingras et al., 2008). Additionally, senior scholars
may be more confident about knowledge of the discipline, and consider some knowledge as
common without citation to it needed, while younger scholars may be less confident and try
hard to support their arguments by citing more previous literature. In this study, advisors are
considered those in fields longer than their advisees. Therefore, the finding that advisees cite
fewer literatures in their research than advisors reconfirms the age factor in academic career.

As for the correlation between the number of references per publication of advisors and
advisees, the result indicates a positively significant correlation in each discipline. In other
words, the amount of references cited by advisees are associated with that of their advisors.
Previous studies (e.g. Barnett & Fink, 2008; George et al., 2006; Larivière et al., 2013) suggest
that advisors play an important role on the information seeking behavior of graduate students
regarding research. Therefore, the correlation observed can be accounted as that advisors might
tend to train their advisees regarding the use of scientific literatures for their research.

Additionally, there is sufficient evidence in this study supporting the existence of non-zero
difference between two disciplines in terms of references per paper correlation. It demonstrates
that although advisees and advisors are related in terms of references per publication, the
degree to which they are related is different. This might be because the reference practice itself
varies by discipline (Larivière et al., 2013; Milojević, 2011), and the mentoring practice, as
discussed in many disciplines (H. G. Adams, 1992; Davidson & Foster-Johnson, 2001; Walker et
al., 2008), is different across disciplines.

194

4.10.2 Reference Diversity
The diversity of references reflects the interdisciplinarity of the citing research (Hammarfelt,
2010; Porter & Rafols, 2009). This study examines the reference diversity of advisors and
advisees by focusing on the percentage of references of its total that are from outside of their
discipline (Porter & Chubin, 1985) (known as the outside discipline reference rate), and the total
number of disciplines where the references are from (known as the number of reference
disciplines). As part of scholars’ referencing practices, the outside discipline reference and the
reference discipline are considered as indicators of research interdisciplinarity: the higher the
number of reference discipline (and the outside discipline reference rate), the more
interdisciplinary the research.

Advisees are more interdisciplinary than advisors, as measured by outside discipline reference
rate. This might also be partially accounted for by the factor of age. Additionally, the outside
discipline reference rate varies by discipline, with Sociology having the highest rate of outside
discipline reference. Science is increasingly interdisciplinary (Larivière & Gingras, 2010) by time.
While measured under the 10-year time window, advisees are usually younger in scientific
careers as compared with their advisors. Therefore, that advisors are less interdisciplinary than
advisees might be due to the universal development of science. Additionally, as shown above,
advisees tend to cite more references in their publication due to their lower confidence in
presenting research claims and the purpose of building a basic knowledge set. This might also be
one of the possible reason that advisees cite a higher percentage of outside discipline
references.

Advisors and advisees are significantly and strongly correlated in terms of interdisciplinarity as
measured by outside discipline reference rate. In other words, more interdisciplinary advisees

195

are more likely to be trained by more interdisciplinary advisors. The relationship between the
interdisciplinarity of advisors and advisees was explored in Sugimoto et al. (2011), where it
argues that advisees who are mentored by advisors with Ph.D. degrees from outside of their
disciplines tend to have more interdisciplinary publication profiles than those from within.
Advisors with Ph.D. degrees outside of the discipline can be considered as more interdisciplinary
than those from within. Therefore, although measured using a different indicator, both the
(Sugimoto et al., 2011) study and this one reveal a similar message: the interdisciplinarity of
advisors and advisees are positively correlated. Since doctoral mentoring is a process of advisors
transferring discipline knowledge and norms to their advisees, and advisees usually work in
research areas similar to their advisors, the strong correlation between the outside discipline
reference of advisors and advisees is anticipated.

Additionally, the correlation between the outside discipline reference rate of advisors and
advisees is significantly different between Economics and the other two disciplines, but not
between Sociology and Political Science.

4.10.3 Reference Age
This section focuses on the average age of references cited by advisors and advisees, known as
reference age. It is found that advisees tend to cite more recent literature than advisors do.
Advisors are usually more senior than advisees in their academic careers. Therefore, this finding
is consistent with some previous studies (e.g. Gingras et al., 2008; Larivière et al., 2013;
Milojević, 2011), although concentrating on different disciplines. The reference age is part of the
age strata as mentioned in Zuckerman and Merton (1973):

If there are these age-stratified differences in receptivity to new (and sound) ideas, this
should be reflected in various behaviors. For example, younger scientists should rely
196

more on recently published research and cite it more frequently than should older
scientists in the same fields. For another example, the age strata of scientists should
differ on what they take to be the most significant contributions to their field (p. 514).

As mentioned previously, advisors, since usually more senior in their career, may already have a
basic set of references and are less likely to keep up to date with the latest studies. While
advisees are those who are more junior in their career and mostly trying to cite a wide range of
literature in order to build the basic set. In this case, advisees are citing more recent literature
than their advisors in general.

Furthermore, the correlation between advisors’ and advisees’ reference age is significant but
weak in all three disciplines. This indicates that, while trying to build the knowledge base by
citing literature, advisees might inherit from their advisors the preference of reference age.
Comparatively speaking, the correlation is stronger in Economics than in Political Science and
Sociology. In other words, it is more likely that advisees are trained by advisors with similar
reference age preference in Economics than in Political Science and Sociology.

4.10.4 Reference Impact
Reference impact of individual scholars is measured using the average impact factor of journals
where the reference comes from. In all three disciplines, advisors cite slightly higher impact
references (as measured by median value) than advisees do. In an earlier study dealing with
Ph.D. students in Quebec, Larivière (2011) found that advisees tend to cite lower impact articles
than advisors in Social Sciences and Humanities. Thus, Larivière et al. (2013) later on claimed
that doctoral students in Social Sciences and Humanities are overall less aware of important
sources of the field. Another possible explanation might be related to the claim that advisors
usually cite a basic set of references, while advisees are on their way to build up the basic set.
197

Those basic set of references frequently used by advisors might be the important paradigm of
the field and published on higher impact journals. Therefore, advisors cite overall higher impact
references than advisees do.

Significant correlations between the reference impact of advisors and advisees were observed in
all three disciplines. In the study regarding how graduate students seek information for
research, George et al. (2006) found that about 96% students they surveyed claimed that they
ever went to advisors for literature allied to their research as their first step in their research
process. Therefore, advisors’ preference regarding references might be directly transferred to
their students during the process.

However, the extent to which advisors transfer their preference of references to advisees is
significantly different among disciplines. The highest correlation appears in Economics, followed
by Sociology and Political Science. This seems to agree with the percentage of students who
went to advisors for reference help in (George et al., 2006), where they found 100% of students
in Economics they surveyed ever went to advisors seeking help with references. This might also
suggest that, in disciplines where advisees are more likely to go to advisors for reference help,
they will also inherit to a deeper extent from advisors about reference preference.

4.11 Citation and Impact
Citation has been widely used as an indicator of scientific impact (Garfield, 1956). This section
focuses on the citation diversity and intensity of advisors and advisees so as to understand the
breadth (diversity) and in-depth (intensity) of advisors and advisees. The citation intensity is
measured through two indicators: total citations received (total citations), and average citations
received per paper (average citations). The citation diversity is measured using the number of

198

disciplines that cited the advisor (advisee), and the percentage of citations from outside of the
discipline.

4.11.1 Citation Intensity
This study uses the total citation and average citation to measure the citation impact of advisors
and advisees. Both indicators are used so as to reflect different aspects of scholars’ scientific
impact.

In terms of total citation, advisors are more influential than advisees. This is anticipated due to
the selection of data: publications of advisees are more recent than those of advisors.
Additionally, as has been observed, advisors are more productive than advisees. Since citations
accumulate by time and the number of publications, advisors are likely to exceed advisees in
terms of total citation.

Advisors are significantly correlated with advisees in terms of total citations in Economics, but
not in Political Science and Sociology. In other words, among all three disciplines, only advisees
in Economics inherit the total citation pattern of advisors to some extent, but not those in
Political Science and Sociology.

However, it should be noted that the correlation is still fairly low in Economics. As has been
discussed (e.g. Adams, 2005; Amsterdamska & Leydesdorff, 1989), citation impact is associated
with many factors of scholars, such as collaboration (Goldfinch et al., 2003), productivity (Endler
et al., 1978), journal impact factor (Adam, 2002), and the actual prestige and impact of
publications. Therefore, the total citation of advisees might be related to many other factors
than total citations of their advisors.

199

Advisors outperform advisees in terms of average citations in all three disciplines. This agrees
with the findings from (Larivière, 2011), which shows that publications authored by doctoral
students receive lower citation rates than those by non-students, mostly faculty members in
universities. In this study, since the average citation is independent on the productivity, one
possible reason why advisors have higher average citations is that their publications are older
than advisees’. Additionally, publication type might be another reason: advisors, since having
been in the field longer, are more likely to write review articles based on their understanding of
the discipline. Review articles, among other publication types, are proved to be the type that
usually attract the highest number of citations (Neophytou, 2014). Finally, it could also be
because advisors are more senior in their scientific careers, and the overall impact of scholars
usually increases by scientific age (Bonaccorsi & Daraio, 2003).

Advisors and advisees are significantly correlated in terms of average citations per publication in
all three disciplines. The correlation is stronger than that of total citations. The significant
correlation between advisors and advisees implies that they are associated in terms of average
citation to some degree. However, the correlation between the average citation of advisors and
advisees varies by discipline significantly: Economics has the highest correlation, followed by
Sociology and Political Science. This indicates that advisees in Economics are more likely to
imitate the citation impact of their advisors than those in Sociology and Political Science.

4.11.2 Citation Diversity
Citation diversity is measured by two indicators: number of disciplines that cited the scholar
(citing disciplines), and the percentage of citations that came from outside of the discipline
(outside discipline citation).

200

Advisors are cited by more disciplines than advisees are in all three disciplines. Considering that
the number of citing disciplines is related to the total citation, which is dependent on
publication productivity, that advisors receive citations from more disciplines than advisees do is
expected.

Advisors and advisees are significantly correlated on the number of citing disciplines in
Economics and Sociology, but not in Political Science. In other words, in Economics and
Sociology, the number of citing disciplines of advisees is to some extent related to that of
advisors. The number of citing disciplines implies the popularity breadth of the work, and is
related to the number of reference disciplines in some way (Moed, 2006). As shown in Chapter
4, advisors mimic the behavior of advisors in terms of the number of reference disciplines to a
certain extent. Therefore, the correlation between the number of citing references of advisors
and advisees might be similar to that.

Outside discipline citation is another indicator of citation diversity in this study. Similar to the
rate of outside discipline reference, this also implies the interdisciplinarity of the research to
some extent. According to the result, advisees have a higher rate of outside discipline citations
than advisors do, indicating that advisees are more interdisciplinary than advisors. This is
consistent with the finding regarding outside discipline reference, which shows that advisees are
more interdisciplinary than advisors since they cite a higher percentage of references from
outside of their disciplines. If they publish in a larger variety of venues and disciplines, they
usually get a larger variety of readers from multiple fields, who later might cite their work
(Bornmann & Daniel, 2008). Therefore, it is not surprising that the publication diversity and
citation diversity of advisees and advisors show similar trends in this study.

201

The correlation of outside discipline citation rates between advisors and advisees is significantly
higher in Sociology than in Economics and Political Science. In other words, in Economics and
Sociology, more interdisciplinary advisees are more likely to be trained by more interdisciplinary
advisors. The relationship between the interdisciplinarity of advisors and advisees was explored
in Sugimoto et al. (2011), where it argues that advisees who are mentored by advisors with
Ph.D. degrees from outside of their disciplines tend to have more interdisciplinary publication
profiles than those from within. Advisors with Ph.D. degrees outside of the discipline can be
considered as more interdisciplinary than those from within. Therefore, although measured
using a different indicator, both the Sugimoto et al. (2011) study and this one reveal a similar
message: the interdisciplinarity of advisors and advisees are positively correlated.

4.12 Limitations
Like many other studies, this dissertation suffers from some limitations inevitably. At the current
stage, this study is mostly limited by the data availability, data processing, and data analysis
techniques.

Data provided by ProQuest are incomplete. For instance, ProQuest only provides the advisor
information for about 50% of total dissertations, and the majority of dissertations with advisor
information available are from the last two decades. This not only limits the analysis on adviseeadvisor pairs into a short time period, but also makes it difficult to build a network of doctoral
mentoring: it is unable to retrospect historically to find the advisor information for a current
advisor.

The subject classification of dissertations provided by ProQuest might be problematic. According
to ProQuest, the first subject category of each dissertation is the indication of the disciplinary
information for that dissertation. But the subject category information can be provided either by
202

dissertation author or adjusted by ProQuest indexer, which they do not have documentation
for. In one of our previous studies (Bowman, Tsou, Ni, & Sugimoto, 2014), it has been shown
that the agreement between ProQuest’s subject classification of dissertation and dissertation
authors’ self-identification of disciplinary is not high. Therefore, it is very likely that advisees
included in this analysis got their degrees in disciplines that are different from the first subject
category of their dissertations.

Data from Web of Science is another limitation. Web of Science bibliographic data mainly
includes journal publications, therefore, publications by advisees and advisors in other genres
(e.g. book and conference proceedings) are neglected in this study. It has also been noted that
Web of Science only has moderate coverage of journals for some social science disciplines, such
as Economics and Sociology (Moed, 2005). Additionally, in analyzing citation and impact, only
citations within Web of Science are considered. Therefore, the productivity and citation impact
of advisees and advisors in this study are underestimated overall.

One major step of this study, the author name disambiguation is not perfect. As has been
discussed in Section 3.2, author name disambiguation is never completely solved in both
academic and industrial contexts. Secondly, author name disambiguation approach applied in
this dissertation is not perfect, as most of those approaches that have been proposed. As a
renewed interest in both academia and industrial environment, name disambiguation has been
approached with various methods, but no “perfect” approach has been agreed on. The current
situation is that most of existing author name disambiguation methods works best for a specific
task on a specific dataset. Meanwhile, very few authors of author name disambiguation related
publications have tried to publicize their algorithms. Therefore, the replicability of existing
author name disambiguation approaches is largely hindered. In this dissertation, I developed a

203

new method of author name disambiguation based on the Web of Science bibliographic
database. Both precision and recall of this method is not perfect, but I believe that it can be
improved with more training data from different time periods and different disciplines being
added. Therefore, in the future, some extra records, from multiple disciplines and time periods,
will be added, and the model and corresponding parameters will also be adjusted in order to
disambiguate authors more effectively and efficiently.

Another limitation of this study lies in the statistical analysis on the data. This study mainly uses
correlation analysis to explore the relationship between doctoral advisors and advisees’
scientometric profile. While correlation analysis is helpful for understanding the possible
association between variables, it can be biased when the data have extreme outliers. Therefore,
the correlation analysis in this study might not discover the true association between advisors
and advisees. Future efforts will be put on this perspective to solve the problem.

Other limitations might also be observed in this study. For instance, this study considers the
doctoral dissertation advisor as the doctoral mentor who actually guided and trained the
advisee, which might not always be the case. Additionally, the data integration between
ProQuest and Web of Science is by no means perfect. Further efforts will be devoted onto the
limitations mentioned above in order to eliminate them.

Conclusion and Future Work

This study explores the relationship between the scientometric profile of advisors and advisees
in three social science disciplines, namely Economics, Political Science and Sociology. More
specifically, by using data from Web of Science and ProQuest, this study aims to address two
main research questions. The first research question asks whether there is a relationship
between the scientometric profile of advisors and advisees in social sciences, and the second
question aims to understand whether, if it exist, the relationship varies by discipline. The
scientometric profile of scholars is dissected into four aspects, publication, collaboration,
reference and citation practices, in order to analyze the relationship. In addition to these
questions, this study also aims to build an integrated scholar database based on heterogeneous
data sources, which involves large-scaled name disambiguation and data integration.

Advisors and advisees are associated in terms of publication, collaboration, reference and
citation practices, but to a limited extent. Among these four aspects, advisees are more related
to their advisors regarding reference practices, followed by collaboration practices. This is
consistent with a few previous studies that concluded that mentoring did not significantly
contribute to student outcomes, such as research productivity and impact (Green & Bauer,
1995; Paglis et al., 2006), but did to reference and collaboration patterns. In other words,
advisees inherit their advisors reference behaviors (reference age, reference impact, reference
per article and outside discipline references) more than any other aspects of scientometric
profiles. Both reference and collaboration behaviors are the academic practices that advisees
are more likely to learn from their advisors by immitating them. The productivity and impact, on
the other hand, are more likely to rely on individual endeavor other than something inheritable
from their advisors. Therefore, the productivity and impact of advisees will depend on, to some

205

extent, the advisees themselves, while reference and collaboration practices are more likely to
be transferred from their advisors.

Disciplines vary in terms of the extent to which advisees mimic their advisors’ scientometric
profiles. While compared across disciplines, Sociology shows the highest correlation in almost all
aspects of scientometric profiles (except for publication productivity), and Political Science the
weakest. Disciplinary differences in these relationships might be the result of various
characteristics of Ph.D. training and scholarly practices in different disciplines, which yields one
direction for future work on this topic: understanding the reason for the disciplinary
differences. .

Additionally, it should be noted that the correlation, although it exists, is still fairly weak in most
measurements of scientometric profiles. The strongest association between the scientometric
profile of advisors and advisees appears in their collaboration practices: collaboration diversity
and collaboration intensity. As many studies have demonstrated, the productivity, collaboration,
reference and citation patterns of scholars are related to many aspects of scholarly life. It has
been proved that productivity, collaboration, reference and citation patterns are related to each
other themselves, and the quality of Ph.D. graduates is related to many other factors such as
funding support, graduate GPA, department culture, etc. The weak correlation between advisors
and advisees in each aspect of scientometric profiles reaffirms many of these findings. To this
end, future work will use canonical correlation analysis and multiple multivariate regression
analysis to understand the relationship between advisors and advisees’ scientometric profiles
considering all these patterns together instead of examining them individually. Other features of
doctoral mentoring might also be added in order to further explore the relationship.

The result of this study generates many avenues for future studies. In addition to the possible
future endeavor mentioned above, there are many directions of research based on this study
and the availability of integrated scholar profile database.

As mentioned, canonical correlation analysis (Thompson, 2005) will be performed to analyze the
relationship between the scientometric profile of advisors and advisees. Canonical correlation
analysis is a statistical method usually employed to investigate the relationship among two or
more variables sets, with each consisting of at least two variables (Thompson, 2005). Therefore,
future research could focus on a set of selected advisors and advisees and analyze the
relationship. This is based on the observation that the data follow a distribution close to a power
law (Clauset, Shalizi, & Newman, 2009). Therefore, future research will select some extreme
cases and perform some analyses. For instance, we will concentrate on those highly productive
advisors, and analyze those advisees produced by them. Then we will also look at those highly

20

cells indicate the correlation for corresponding measurements are insignificant.

207

prolific advisees, and try to identify characteristics of advisors who produced them. Additionally,
we will also focus on those “academic siblings” and explore the reason why they show similar or
different patterns in their careers.

Collaboration network is another promising direction. As shown in the result, the relationship
between the collaboration patterns of advisor and advisees are observed. Additionally, advisoradvisee collaboration was also noticed in the study. Collaboration has been claimed to enable
the sharing and transferring of knowledge and equipment, and increases the visibility of articles
(Gazni et al., 2012). Therefore, future foci will be put on understanding how collaboration
networks of advisees are related and influenced by advisors. Some studies have claimed that the
collaboration between advisors and advisees initializes the socialization of advisees, and is
closely related to the productivity, impact, graduation rate and many other performances of
advisees. Thus, analyzing the impact of advisor-advisee collaboration on the performance of
advisees (or advisors) can be another possible topic after this dissertation.

Besides, the role of gender in doctoral mentoring will be examined, since it might be a potential
factor that is related to the outcome of doctoral mentoring (Bettinger & Long, 2005; Ragins,
1999; Ragins & Scandura, 1994). The identification of scholar gender by name has been
successfully applied in (Larivière, Ni, Gingras, Cronin, & Sugimoto, 2013). Similar approaches will
be taken onto the scholarly profile database for the identification of advisee and advisor gender.
Then the analyses regarding how gender is related to the scholarly practices and performance of
advisees and advisors can be performed. Additionally, examining the relationship between
gender and the interdisciplinarity of scholars might be another potential topic. It has been
mentioned in many studies that gender is related to the interdisciplinarity of scholars. Thus,
subsequent research will also focus on this and address this question using large-scaled data.

208

The integrated scholar database, as shown in Figure 5-1, was built using a new approach
invented for this study. The database will be extendable for extra data, and can be utilized for
many other studies. This study is only one aspect of exploration of this topic. Other work can be
planned based on the current project. For instance, studies can be extended to some other
disciplines. This study concentrates on three selected social science disciplines, and the
mentoring and publication related patterns could be very different from humanities disciplines
and natural science and engineering disciplines. Therefore, future analyses can be planned on
some other disciplines in order to provide more generalizable conclusions.

Finally, the scholarly profile database can be expanded and thus the analyses between the
advisees and advisors can go beyond bibliographic data. For instance, extra data regarding the
book publications, funding history, patent inventor-ship and bibliographic information (e.g.
gender) of scholars will be added to the scholarly profile database. This database will then be
able to provide comprehensive information for each scholar in order to complete his or her
profile. The analyses between advisees and advisors can then go beyond just journal publication,
and will thus reveal the relationship between advisors and advisees more comprehensively.
