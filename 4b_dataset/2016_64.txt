ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
I have many people to thank for getting me to this point. The most important of those are my
parents, Joe and Mary Luetkemeyer. Though my dad died in 2008 before I ever started working
on my doctorate, he and my mom were always my biggest supporters when it came to pursuing
my education. They always encouraged me to go as far as I wanted to go, and I thank them both
for helping me make it all the way. I must also mention my siblings, Victor and Lucy, who are
two of my biggest fans and have always expressed how proud they are of my accomplishments.
I love you all!
One of the most important people when it comes to completing a dissertation is your major
professor, and I could not have asked for a better one. When Marcia Mardis approached me two
years ago and asked me to work on a grant project with her, I remember a colleague telling me to
                    best advice I received during
the three years of my doctoral program. Marcia has been instrumental in helping me to finish
this research, as well as to the refinement of my academic writing skills. She has also been an
amazing mentor who has repeatedly placed my best interests before her own, and who I credit as
the main reason that I secured an academic position before I ever even finished my dissertation.
As I follow the tenure-track career path, I know that she will remain a large part of my work and
that I will re                  
Thank you, Marcia!
Also important are those people that support you during the day-to-day minutiae of life as you
work on your doctorate. They are, in fact, the most vital to your success. My boyfriend is one of
those people. He has no idea how much he helped during this process. He was the calm to my
storm, my safe haven when the stress of it all seemed to be more than I could handle. He was the
one that truly saw me at my worst and loved me anyway. Thank you, Elliott McCaskill. I love
you.
Other people who supported me day-to-day were my fellow doc students. I appreciate them all,
but most especially these: Laura Clark and Amelia Anderson, who started the program with me
and were always there to commiserate; Abby Phillips, who became my go-to for dissertation
questions and my                   
discovered earlier in the process; and Nate Ramos, my roommate and sounding board.
Last, but not least, I want to thank my other committee members: Dr. Juliann Woods for her
enthusiasm for my work; Dr. Don Latham for his calm demeanor, sage advice, and faith in my
ability; and Dr. Gary Burnett for the creation of information worlds theory and his unique
perspective that made my project that much better.
A very special thank you also to Dr. Nancy Everhart who, along with Dr. Marcia Mardis, created
the Technology Leadership Survey and graciously allowed me to use it for this research.
By the grace of God, I am done!

ABSTRACT

K-12 schools are making the move to digital learning resources, and are increasingly
integrating technology into the curriculum. With training as both a teacher and an information
specialist, the school librarian is in a position to help facilitate this transition to digital. The
purpose of this research was to examine the extent to which school librarians perceive that they
are prepared to act in the role of facilitator, and to determine what factors contribute to those
perceptions. The study was guided by three research questions that       



self-perceptions of their technology leadership abilities, and how their school cultures and
information worlds affect those perceptions.
In this case study, I used both quantitative and qualitative methods: a survey and followup interviews. The participants in this research were all Florida K-12 school librarians. In my
analysis, I found that school librarians are largely prepared to act as technology leaders, but that
there are many barriers to the enactment of that responsibility, many of which are related to a

affect school librarians technology leadership skills enactment. Specifically, research is needed
at the national level to determine whether or not the results of this study translate to the larger
population of school librarians. Research is als

explore the information worlds of school librarians, more extensive studies are needed in order to
continue to piece together the many facets of those information worlds.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION AND STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM
1.1 Overview of the Problem
According to Selwyn (2011), despite the prevalence of technology in schools, whether it
is actually used for teaching and learning depends largely on individual students and teachers and
their particular circumstances and level of comfort with technology. Further, when technology is
used, it is often for passive activities such as demonstrations on whiteboards, or copying and
pasting information from the internet for one-size-fits-all school assignments (Selwyn, 2011).
But, one of the rationales for integrating technology into the curriculum is the ability to provide
an individualized learning experience for each student (Selwyn, 2011). Realizing the goal of
personalized learning, however, is not just a matter of the proper technology, but also of the
proper learning resources (The Brookings Institution, 2011; West, 2013).
K-12 schools have long relied on print resources, such as the standard subject area
textbook, to provide access to the curriculum. However, as many states attempt to implement
digital textbooks and digital curricula (Leading Education by Advancing Digital, n.d.),
educational leaders must shift focus from traditional materials to digital learning resources for
curriculum delivery. Policymakers from the State Educational Technology Directors Association
(SETDA) and the Leading Education by Advancing Digital (LEAD) Commission have
emphasized that as long as schools remain bound to print resources, they will be unable to
provide the equitable access to resources required by recent legislation such as No Child Left
Behind and Race to the Top (Fletcher, Schaffhauser, & Levin, 2012; LEAD, 2013; U.S.
Department of Education, 2005, 2013).

Despite the focus on educational technology and the use of digital learning resources,
teachers are often ill-equipped to transform their planning, instruction, and assessment practices.
Between increasing demands on their time, and a lack of experience with information seeking
and integration, many teachers find it difficult to navigate through the abundance of available
digital resources    

8). Teachers need on-site assistance with digital resource selection and implementation (Project
Tomorrow, 2014b; Harris, 2014).
School librarians are trained to be both educators and information professionals; as such,
they have the subject area knowledge to understand what types of resources are needed, and the
professional insight to understand how to locate and curate those resources. This unique
combination of perspectives gives school librarians the potential for a key leadership role in
digital education, a role that is reflected in their professional guidelines (AASL, 2009). As
Everhart, Mardis and Johnston (2011) see it, school librarians should be information



  p. 13).

1.2 Importance/Significance of the Research
In order to fulfill this unique role, school librarians must possess the technology
leadership skills necessary to facilitate the integration of technology and digital learning
resources into the curriculum. Past research has indicated that school librarians have had a
significant amount of success in a technology leadership role when interacting with students, but

2

have been less able to lead teachers

    

(Everhart, Mardis & Johnston, 2011).

This dichotomy suggests that not only must school librarians possess the skills to lead
technology initiatives, but also that teachers must see school librarians in a technology leadership
role. In an effort to explore the extent to which school librarians are able to enact technology
leadership roles as they relate to digital learning resource use, I propose to: 1) examine how
school librarians perceive their own technology leadership capabilities; 2) explore how school
librarians are currently facilitating the integration and use of digital learning resources in their
schools; 3) examine how the organizational culture of the school enables and constrains school
     

 

and 4) determine whether school librarians interactions with

teachers, students, administrators, and other stakeholders form information worlds that inform
leadership perceptions and the ability to facilitate digital resource integration. I will carry out
this research using a purposive sample of K-12 school librarians practicing in the state of Florida,
where the move to all digital learning resources and digital assessments has been mandated to
occur by the end of the 2015-2016 school year (The Florida Legislature, 2015).
1.2.1 Definition of Terms
For the purposes of this research, several terms are operationally defined as follows:
- A school librarian is an individual employed in a K-12 school library, whether full- or
part-time, with the title of school media specialist or school librarian or the equivalent.
The term does not refer to an individual who volunteers in a K-12 school library or to an
assistant who may go by the title of media technologist, library assistant, or the
equivalent.

- Technology leadership includes the   nowledge they [school librarians] need
to succeed in the technological society of the 21st  

           

teachers succeed as well (Everhart, Mardis, & Johnston, 2011, p. 13).
- A digital learning resource is any form of digital media the content of which is used for
educational purposes, including, but not limited to, text, images, and video (Harley, 2007;
Clyde, 2004).
- School culture is a sociocultural system existing in a particular place and time, in this
case a school, which shapes, and is shaped by, the individuals and the environment that
are part of both its internal structure and its external setting. The external setting includes
not only the  physical location, but also the social and political atmosphere
(Allaire & Firsirotu, 1984; Ouchi & Wilkins, 1985; Scott, 2004).
- An information world is a social sphere of influence that acts as an information source,
and in which an individual participates, either as an active or passive member, that both
affects, and is affected by,          Information worlds can
be micro, meso, or macro level, and they do not act in isolation from each other (Jaeger &
Burnett, 2010).
1.2.2 Purpose
The purpose of this research is to examine and understand how K-12 school librarians
develop, exercise, and promote their technology leadership skills to other stakeholders within K12 educational organizations, and how that process is affected by their information worlds and
school culture.

Empowering Learners: Guidelines for School Library Programs (2009) lists leadership,
particularly in technology integration, as a primary professional role for school librarians
(American Association of School Librarians, 2009).
Because this leadership role is so critical, and because K-12 education is increasingly
based on digital resources (LEAD, n.d.), expanding the nascent corpus of work on school
     

     can reveal promising sources of support for teaching and

learning. Teachers benefit from school librarian    in searching for, accessing, and
using digital learning resources. The success of nationwide efforts to infuse technology and
digital resources into K-12 learning rests on effective implementation; in this study, I seek to
understand the extent to which school librarians see their role in leading and supporting
implementation as well as the extent to which school culture and its information worlds are
conducive to the fulfillment of the leadership role.
1.2.3.2 Significance to theory. Information worlds theory has been incorporated in
research in science (Burnett et al., 2010; Burnett et al., 2014); government, libraries, and
community (Jaeger et al., 2013); social activism (Burnett & Skinner, 2014); and health
informatics (Burnett, Whetstone, & Jaeger, 2013). Other researchers have applied information
worlds theory to the social networks of engineers (Du Preez & Meyer, 2011); the information
practices of extreme body modifiers (Lingel & Boyd, 2013); the effects of information poverty
on student test scores (Froggatt, 2013); information services for migrant workers (Peterson,
2014); and Latina gender construction and reconstruction (Burnett, Subramaniam, & Gibson,

5

2009). This wide variety of research applications suggests that the theory is useful in many
contexts. An application of the theory to school librarians, however, is novel. Therefore, the
proposed study will add to the growing amount of scholarship in this area by providing a glimpse
into the information worlds of school librarians and, by association, the information worlds of
schools.
1.2.3.3 Significance to preservice preparation. The results of this research may also
influence library and information studies (LIS) faculty to review their school librarian
preparation programs. When future school librarians are equipped with the knowledge, skills,
and abilities to lead technology-rich environments and support teachers and learners in those
environments, LIS programs will be making a substantive contribution to K-12 digital learning.
1.2.3.4 Significance to practice.

roles also supports AASL professional standards and will provide school librarians with
information about how to enact their roles as technology leaders. When school librarians share
this 

  with their schools stakeholders, particularly teachers and administrators, they

may gain the opportunity to engage in greater responsibility and to enhance their professional
image in the eyes of other stakeholders.
1.3 Research Questions
In the proposed research, my primary goal is to   



     

their technology leadership skills, with the intention of making a unique contribution to
knowledge about school librarian leadership and digital resource integration. The outcomes of
this research will illuminate areas for further school librarian preparation revision and create a
foundation for future research in digital content leadership. To these ends, I will guide the
research with these questions:

6

RQ1: To what extent do school librarians perceive they are prepared to lead digital
learning resource integration?
a. What do they perceive as their areas of strength?
b. In which areas do they perceive they need improvement?
RQ2: How does the organizational culture of the school affect school librarian leadership
enactment?
RQ3: How are school librarians leadership skills impacted by their information worlds?
1.4 Overview of the Research Method
In this research, I will use a single case holistic instrumental case study design. Feagin,
Orum, and Sjoberg (1991) provide a working definition of the approach   





defined as an in-depth, multifaceted investigation, using qualitative research methods, of a single
social phenomenon. The study is conducted in great detail and often relies on the use of several

(1) be adapted to multiple

disciplinary and philosophical perspectives; (2) be used to test or build theory; (3) include either
qualitative or quantitative data, or both; and (4) accommodate more than one sampling method
(Masoner, 1988). In this case, the phenomenon under consideration is the self-perception of
technology leadership skills of Florida school librarians, and the research methods are both
quantitative and qualitative, consisting of a survey instrument and semi-structured interviews.
Florida school librarians will be contacted through various professional email lists and
asked to participate in the survey. Upon completion of the survey, they will be invited to provide
their personal email if they would be willing to participate in the interview portion of the
research. Data analysis will consist of statistical analysis for the survey results, using an existing

specific statistical analysis. For the interviews, provisional coding will be utilized, and text will
be reviewed line by line in an attempt to detect patterns and similarities. These patterns will then
be matched to the themes and theoretical propositions of information worlds theory.
1.5 Limitations of the Research
A main limitation of the research is that, because I am only studying Florida schools and
Florida school librarians, the results may not be generalizable to all contexts. An additional
limitation stems from the data collection process because school librarians will be asked to selfreport their technology leadership skills and may have biased views of their capabilities. Because
this research is exploratory, these limitations will provide additional avenues for later research.
1.6 Overview of Subsequent Chapters
This introduction is followed by two chapters that describe the relevant literature
foundation and methodology in greater detail. Chapter Two contains an extensive literature
review of research relating to digital learning resources use and school librarian roles, as well as
the informing constructs of school culture and information worlds theory. In Chapter Three, I
outline the research methodology for the proposed study, including a restatement of purpose,
problem, and research questions. The chapter continues with a detailed explanation of the data
collection and analysis methods, and the significance and impact of the research.

CHAPTER 2
LITERATURE REVIEW
2.1 Introduction
While a shift from print to digital learning resources is beginning to occur, many states
and districts have been slower to make that move due to a variety of internal and external
barriers (Fletcher, Schaffhauser, & Levin, 2012). SETDA listed issues that need to be addressed,
some of which were confirmed   

            

robust internet connectivity, up-to-date policies and practices, prepared educators, intellectual
property and reuse rights, quality control and usability, and state and local leadership buy- 
(Fletcher, Schaffhauser, & Levin, 2012, p. 2).
Central to the implementation of digital resources is teacher preparedness to use them.
Because school librarians often deliver on-site professional development for new technologies
(Everhart, Mardis, & Johnston, 2011), they have the opportunity to help classroom teachers and
students become innovative and literate users of digital resources. As schools make the move to
digital textbooks and other digital resources as the primary learning materials in the classroom
(LEAD, n.d.), there is a need for a school-based professional to foster digital literacy among
teachers and students to support this move (Mardis & Everhart, 2013; Kang & Everhart, 2014).
Digital literacy is defined as proficiency in using digital technology, networks and
communication tools to effectively manipulate information in a variety of formats and from a
variety of digital sources (U.S. Digital Literacy, 2015).
Underpinning the digital literacy educators require to shift to digital resources is the set of
information literacy skills specifically related to not only recognizing when they have an
information need, but also to be able to find that information and to evaluate it and use it

9

effectively (ACRL, 2011). Due to their training both as educators and as information
professionals, school librarians are well positioned to assist both students and teachers in
acquiring information literacy skills. As such, it is important to understand how prepared school
librarians perceive themselves to be to assist in the integration of technology and digital learning
resources. In Florida, this process has been mandated by   

Despite this trend

toward digital textbooks and free materials, many districts experience roadblocks to
implementation that must be addressed if digital learning resources are to be adopted as the
primary tools for teaching and learning.
2.2.1 Instructional Materials Funding Models
Increasing demands on instructional personnel to provide individualized learning
experiences for their students require them to search outside the textbook for support materials
and supplemental resources (Kong et al., 2014). Unfortunately, school budgets are often
inadequate to cover the costs of all materials, and access to supplemental resources is affected.
According to Leachman and Mai (2013), for the 2013-2014 school year, 70% of states provided
per-student funding at levels below pre-recession (prior to 2007) rates. Unfortunately, districts
have not been able to supplement their budgets with traditional measures such as property tax
revenues, because local real estate markets are still recovering from the recession as well
(Leachman & Mai, 2013). A final challenge to school budgets comes from the federal

2.2.2 Instructional Materials Adoption Cycles
The SETDA report also outlined some recommendations for states and districts to make
the switch from print to digital resources as soon as their next adoption cycle, but not beyond the

11

2017-2018 school year. The development of a clear plan in order to make the switch, and
communication of that plan, was deemed imperative. Such a plan would include a revision of
policies, significant investment in the technology to support the move, and an implementation of
procedures that support key stakeholders during the move. Finally, SETDA encouraged

Because the pervasiveness of the Internet and devices allows virtually unrestricted access,
it is essential that schools afford students the same information environments for which they are
being prepared to enter. The benefits of using digital learning resources in both teaching and
learning support the move as well.
2.3 Types of Digital Learning Resources
Digital learning resources include text, videos, images, games, virtual experiences, online
assessments, and other forms. However, they can be divided into two distinct categories: feebased and open educational resources.

12

2.3.1 Fee-Based Resources
Fee-based resources are generally produced by educational publishers, and instructional
materials publishing is a multi-billion dollar per year industry. In 2013, the industry topped $8
billion in sales. Fee-based digital resources include textbooks, ebooks, databases, courseware,
supplements, assessments, and other electronic media, such as videos and images (Mickey &
Meaney, 2014). As budgetary shortfalls are commonplace, acquisition of these types of
resources are often limited.
Other issues with fee-based resources include outdated material, limited coverage of
some topics, and an uneven distribution among grade levels (Mardis, 2014). Additionally,
digital textbook packaging varies widely. Digital textbooks may be sold as a PDF, or they may
be sold as smaller pieces that allow for the combination of resources across platforms, or they
may be a combination of these. Their compatibility and usability across platforms varies
depending on the publisher (Jang, 2014). When coupled with structural concerns such as limited
bandwidth and the inability to download and edit video resources (Mardis, 2009), these problems
point to the need for careful consideration of funds allocation for educational resources. One
way around this is a greater reliance on open educational resources.
2.3.2 Open Educational Resources
Open educational resources (OERs) are defi   

resources that reside in the public domain or have been released under an intellectual property

Foundation, n.d., para. 2). To be defined as an OER, a resource must provide the ability to be
reused, revised, remixed, retained, and redistributed without cost to the end user (The William
and Flora Hewlett Foundation, 2013). The combination of open access and zero-dollar price tag

13

makes OERs a viable option for supplemental instructional resources. However, there are
challenges to overcome, some of which were outlined or alluded to by both LEAD (2013) and
SETDA (Fletcher, Schaffhauser, & Levin, 2012). In their view, the primary challenges are
related to the difficulties in finding and vetting quality resources and curation of those resources.
Despite these challenges, OERs have the potential to help minimize the gap in access to
resources described by the OECD (2014):
Equity in education means providing all students, regardless of their socio-economic
status, with opportunities to benefit from education. Defined in this way, equity does not
imply that everyone will have the same outcomes from education. It does mean, however,
-economic status has little or no impact on their performance, and that
    
all students, regardless of their background, are offered access to quality educational
resources and opportunities to learn. (p. 193)
OERs are readily available and free to use, making them ideal for addressing issues of access.
A shift from print to digital resources is also a shift toward SMART education. The
letters in SMART stand for self-directed, motivated, adapted, resource enriched, technologyembedded (Jang, 2014). The ideals embodied by the acronym highlight the benefits of digital
learning resources, and also the priorities set forth by SETDA, LEAD, and the U.S. Department

(Culatta, Ison, & Weiss, 2015, para. 1 & 5). Again, though, the issue of quality must still be
addressed, a job well-suited to the school librarian, who is trained to evaluate resource quality
(Ballew, 2014).

State School Officers (CCSSO) designed the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) to promote

14

college and career readiness in K-12 education. These standards call for a student to master the
use of technology and digital media and to be able to recognize relevant and reliable materials
(CCSS Initiative, 2015). Common Core State Standards have been adopted in 43 states and are
impacting curriculum decisions across the nation (Smith & Teasley, 2014). The focus on
technology and digital media centralized their role in CCSS-driven teaching and learning.

include resources beyond text, which speak to the various learning styles of students: video,
graphics, online assessments, and various interactive experiences. Digital learning resources are
also flexible. Instead of using a print resource beyond its continued relevancy, digital learning
resources can be replaced whenever the need arises. However, if a print version is required,
digital content can be easily converted to print as well. Additionally, digital content is available
at any time and in any location (Fletcher, Schaffhauser, & Levin, 2012).
2.4.2 Instructional Differentiation
For teachers, the benefits are similar to those of students, and are related to how they
teach and reach those students. In addition to the benefits mentioned above, digital content
granularization has an impact as well. Digital learning resources can be divided into smaller
pieces or larger chunks and combined with other digital resources to create a unique teaching and
learning experience to meet differentiated learning needs, as well as offering the opportunity for
immediate remediation when subject matter is not mastered. Both teachers and administrators
have expressed that digital learning resources provide more up-to-date information, encourage a

15

higher level of engagement from students, and improve the quality of instructional materials
(Schayan, 2001; Fletcher, Schaffhauser, & Levin, 2012).
If implemented fully and sustainably, a shift to digital resources can accomplish the
following goals:
Increase student learning and engagement
Accommodate the special learning needs of students
Facilitate the search and discovery of unbundled resources
Support educators in personalizing learning (Fletcher, Schaffhauser, & Levin, 2012, p. 8)
Despite what appear to be the obvious advantages of a shift to digital learning resources, there
are barriers to successful implementation.
2.5 Digital Learning Resource Challenges
In the early research relating to digital content integration, Hill and Hannafin (2001)
outlined a few issues to be aware of when making the move to digital learning resources, which
continue to be of concern. First, the creation and distribution of digital content is not
standardized in the way it is created, organized and presented to the end user. Nonstandardization can cause a number of potential problems: an inability to locate relevant
resources due to incorrect or insufficient metadata, incompatibility with existing systems, and
usability issues (Hill & Hannafin, 2001; Morgado, OrtuÃ±o, Yang, & Ferreras-FernÃ¡ndez, 2014).
Second, users often have relatively little     
validity, and reliability 

                through

digital resource use (Hill & Hannafin, 2001; ACRL, 2011; AASL, 2009). Before using a
resource for a particular pedagogical purpose, these factors should be considered in order to
determine whether or not that resource is suitable for the intended purpose. Another issue is that

16

the tension between breadth and depth of resources leaves subject areas inconsistently covered.
In other words, there are a plethora of resources to be found, but there is sometimes a paucity of
resources available on one subject, and a great deal on another (Hill and Hannafin, 2001; Mardis,
2014). Additionally, the quality of resources must always be considered. Although there may be
much available on a topic, it may or may not have the depth or detail to meet the intended
educational purpose. This is of particular concern in STEM areas, where resources greater than
  

Hill and Hannafin (2001) also cautioned that directed versus student-driven learning
should be considered and balanced in pedagogical design. This directive is reflected in the 2013
K-12 Horizon Report, in which the authors stated that K-12 educators should aspire to a blended
learning environment that includes both formal and informal learning and that

(Johnson,

Adams-Becker, Cummins, Estrada, Freeman, & Ludgage, 2013, p.11). In light of these

(p. 49). This recommendation is again echoed in the 2013 K-12 Horizon Report, which noted
that, when new technology is introduced, there is a great deal of pressure on teachers to
implement that technology and the associated media into their classrooms. However, there is
often very little professional development to accompany the introduction of new technology
(Johnson et al., 2013). The calls for increased professional implementation support those in the
SETDA report, and have been shown to be key to the successful integration of digital learning

17

resources into the curriculum. Both professional standards and prior research suggest that
implementation support is a key role for school librarians.
2.5.1 The Difficulty in Finding and Vetting Resources

         de a significant point regarding

digital resources. Information overload is a real problem. Educators often have limited time
and/or training on how to locate quality resources among the many available (Carlson & Reidy,
2004; Recker, Dorward, & Nelson, 2004; Hanson & Carlson, 2005; Perrault, 2007; Maull,
Saldivar, & Sumner, 2010; Ed. schools, 2013). Teachers also cited other problems in trying to
locate and integrate digital resources into their curriculum: lack of support at the district level;
dissatisfaction with search results or web interfaces; incompatibility of resources with
instructional needs; and lack of professional development to support integration (Hanson &
Carlson, 2005; Johnson et al., 2013).
The idea of quality is subjective and contextual, especially in a school setting, depending
on the purpose and the intended audience (Bethard, Wetzer, Butcher, Martin & Sumner, 2009).
Couple these concerns with the fact that the technology used for access is also ever-changing,
    ! !    " #    !  !   

but its care and maintenance are no simple task (Gaur & Tripathi, 2012, p. 294). This disconnect
between availability and quality is where digital curation practices, and the school librarian as
technology leader, become vitally important. The school librarian is in a unique position at the
intersection between pedagogy and resources. Because school librarians have had training and
experience in both areas, the ability to locate and curate appropriate digital learning resources is
a fundamental aspect of the job.

18

2.6 School Librarians as Technology Leaders
In Empowering Learners: Guidelines for School Library Programs, AASL identified five
roles that the school librarian must fulfill: program administrator, instructional partner,
information specialist, teacher, and leader. As the program administrator, the school librarian is
responsible for providing access to learning resources and other materials, both print and digital,
to the school community (AASL, 2009). However, even as school leaders make the move to
digital textbooks and other digital learning resources, many school library policies still reflect a
primarily physical collection. For example, items written into existing policies include language
influenced or dictated by accrediting bodies that require schools to maintain a certain number of
books per student, or to maintain a certain percentage of nonfiction print materials. In many
instances, the language has not been updated to reflect that digital items might count toward
those quotas.
Despite legacy policies and practices, school librarians serve not only as digital literacy
instructors, but also as their schools onsite curators, sifting through and organizing digital
resources for a variety of learning and teaching applications (Ballew, 2014). This dual role was
confirmed by Project Tomorrow (2014a) through its Speak Up initiative, an annual national
survey of K-12 

the findings that 78% of respondents

depended on their school librarian to locate appropriate websites for classroom use, 56% to
create digital collections to support the curriculum, and 47% to locate specific requested digital
content. At the same time, respondents also indicated that the school librarian was instrumental

19

in answering technology-related questions and in training faculty on how to find and evaluate
digital resources independently (Project Tomorrow, 2011, p. 13).
Because of this acknowledged support position, school librarians are often familiar with a
variety of digital resources that best serve the needs of teachers, students, and other stakeholders.
Further, those resources must also be curated and offered in such a way as to make their
integration with the existing curriculum seamless and intuitive. The curatorial role requires a
unique set of technological skills, and the ability to provide technological leadership to others.
But technology leadership is not just limited to familiarity with, and curation of, digital
resources. School librarians also have a role to play in teaching technology skills to others.
In addition to serving as the school library program administrator, the school librarian
must also ensure that the school community is equipped to be able to access and use the
collection of resources. Much of Empowering Learners: Guidelines for School Library
Programs (2009) describes       

through leadership. According to the guidelines, a school librarian acts as a leader 

(AASL, 2009, p. 58). One way to both foster collaboration and to be visible at faculty meetings
is to provide professional development for teachers, and this action is listed as another of the

While leadership skills are helpful in planning, producing, and delivering professional

development, the school librarian must also enact another of the roles outlined by the AASL:

20

teacher. It is through this role that the school librarian can pass on the information literacy skills
so vital to those on the front lines of instruction of 21st century learners. The focus of the

   

          (AASL, 2009).

By imparting

instruction in an area in which the school librarian is an expert, he or she is empowering teachers
to become proficient in this area themselves. This focus on leadership development through
resource collection and promotion is indicative of yet another of the five roles: information
specialist. It is this role that informs what will be passed on to teachers, and how:
As an information specialist the school librarian uses technology tools to supplement
school resources, assist in the creation of engaging learning tasks, connect the school
with the global learning community, communicate with students and classroom teachers
at any time, and provide 247 access to library services. The school librarian introduces
and models emerging technologies, as well as strategies for finding, assessing, and using
information. He or she is a leader in software and hardware evaluation, establishing the
processes for such evaluation to take place. Doing so requires frequent evaluation of the
use of technology in the school library through regular data analysis. (AASL, 2009, p. 28)
Once teachers are comfortable using these information literacy skills, and teaching them to
others, the role of instructional partner also becomes easier to achieve. Having been taught by
the school librarian themselves, teachers may be more likely to enlist his or her help to plan
instruction to pass on these skills to students. Clearly the function of the school librarian is
complex, incorporating all of the five roles, which are complementary and often overlap.
2.7 School Culture
School librarians, teachers, students, and administrators engage in the context of an
organization called the school; as such, the culture of the organization reflects, constrains, and
enables the interactions within it, and understanding this culture is important to understanding its
members. The study of both organizational climate and culture within schools has been the focus
of a large body of research. The advent of organizational culture research was in the late 1970s,
and articles about organizational culture in schools began appearing in earnest in the early 1980s.

21

However, in 1948, Robinson and Brady published an article entitled The School Culture and
Educational Planning

by administrators and teachers that must be navigated, though not necessarily accepted, by
students. Although presented as an essay rather than a study, this work contained elements that
suggest the existence of an organizational culture in schools was recognized well before the
establishment of organizational culture as a phenomenon of interest.
Eventually renamed school culture, much of the research regarding the organizational
culture of schools appears to have been inspired by the pursuit of what Edmonds defined in 1979
as the effective school model: one with a strong administrative leader, high expectations for
student performance, an environment that is both safe and orderly, and one that emphasizes basic
skills and closely monitors the progress of its students. Most of the literature can be divided into
four main categories: elements and descriptions of school culture; factors that impact school
culture; how curriculum/pedagogy is influenced by school culture; and the impact of school
culture on stakeholders (which include students, teachers, parents, and administrators).
2.7.1 Elements and Descriptions of School Culture
The first body of literature on school culture focused on describing that culture, and
making recommendations for its improvement. A few common threads were the belief that
school culture is socially constructed, and that a strong school culture is necessary for the

theoretical works that focused on definitions and best practices, or empirical studies, that
described observed manifestations of school culture.

Erickson (1987) defined culture in terms of the transmission of information from one
member of an organization to another. On the most abstract level, culture can be viewed as
small bits of information stored and maintained within the organization as a whole. At the midrange, culture is best described as large chunks of knowledge shared from one member of the
organization to the other. And, at the micro level, culture is a socially constructed set of
knowledge that is stored and shared according to specific definitions of power and membership
within the organization. Conway (1990) posited

rites, which include six types: passage, enhancement, degradation, integration, conflict reduction,
and renewal. Hoy (1990) asserted that culture reveals itself in perceivable norms, a system of

definitions differ in terminology, they highlight different facets of the broader concept of school
culture. In other words, each definition is a useful representation of school culture, and taken
together, they allow for a richer picture of that culture to emerge.
Building on the concept of what constitutes school culture, other researchers have
proposed best practices for constructing an effective one. According to these authors, a shared
set of standards, beliefs, and values is essential (Burns, 1985; Conway, 1985; Deal, 1985;
      

d regular communication and strong

administrative support as vital characteristics. While Deal (1985) agreed that strong leadership is
necessary, he also advocated reinforcing cultural rituals that are celebratory and promote
widespread participation; recognition of group members; and balance between the traditional and
innovative, as well as between autonomy and control. Finally, Gruenert (2000) called for a
collaborative school culture as a means to effectively promote learning.

23

It is of interest that the research attempting to match definitions and best practices to
reality is sparse. In a 1986 study, Willower and Smith examined the organizational culture of
two disparate schools in an effort to do so. Rather than confirming existing definitions and best
practices, their findings added new dimensions to what was already in place. For instance, they
discovered that school culture is not holistic, but rather consists of subcultures divided by social
groups such as teachers, students, and administrators. Additionally, they found that strong

autonomy. Further, while school culture is not universal, it does appear to be tied to the
educational goals of the school rather than to social norms. Again, this study only involved two
schools, but the results can certainly be used to inform and inspire further research.
2.7.2 Factors that Impact School Culture
There is some overlap between the literature aimed at defining school culture and the
literature regarding factors that affect that culture. That is to be expected. If a strong leader
figures in the definition of a strong school culture, then it follows that leadership, whether good
or bad, has a significant impact on a sc

reviewed for this section recognized leadership as a prominent factor in determining school
culture. Other factors that were cited by two or more studies as strong predictors of school
culture include community influence (Mitchell & Willower, 1992; Kent, 2006); school
subcultures (Kent, 2006; AlemÃ¡n, 2009); value orientation (Shaw & Reyes, 1992; Howard,
2010; Lance, 2010); collegial relationships between teachers and/or teachers and administrators
(Khourey-Bowers, Dinko, & Hart, 2005; Howard, 2010; Lance, 2010; Roby, 2011); and district
level support (Mitchell & Willower, 1992; Eilers & Camacho, 2007). Additional factors worth

current dynamic play out (Pescarmona, 2010). Here, as in the previous section, leadership
figured prominently. In five out of twelve studies, support from leadership (or lack thereof) was
listed as one of the strongest factors influencing the adoption of a particular curriculum or
pedagogical approach (Rovegno & Bandhauer, 1997; Vesilind & Jones, 1998; Carrington, 1999;
Zollers, Ramanathan, & Yu, 1999; Smyth, 2007). Curricular and pedagogical initiatives that
originate with the principal, or receive his or her backing, are often more successful than
individual efforts championed by one teacher or department. However, support of, and
collaboration with, colleagues also contributed to successful initiatives (Rovegno & Bandhauer,
1997; Vesilind & Jones, 1998; Carrington, 1999; Smyth, 2007; Coyle, 2008).
These two factors are reflective of a third influencer, which is a strong sense of
community within a school (Zollers, Ramanathan, & Yu, 1999; Smyth, 2007; Coyle, 2008). A
strong sense of community can be reflected not only in the relationships that teachers cultivate
with each other and with administrators, but also in those cultivated with their students, and these
relationships often influence how and what teachers teach (Feirsen, 1997; Carrington & Elkins,
2002& '

2008). Additionally, a sense of community can be created between the school and the area in
which it resides, and this relationship can also affect curricular and pedagogical considerations

25

(Carrington, 1999; Coyle, 2008). For example, a metropolitan community might encourage a
different curriculum than a rural farming community, as different value orientations are brought
to bear.
These same types of differences in value orientation also strongly affect curriculum and

Carrington & Elkins, 2002; Gleeson et al., 2002; Coyle, 2008; Meier, 2012). Differences in
value orientation may refer to any number of issues, such as whether or not the overall school
culture encourages professional development or whether schools value certain student outcomes
or innovative teaching strategies. Value orientation is also indicated by the allocation of
resources, which includes classroom materials and resources. Values that differ from the school
culture at large can also be reflected in the subcultures found within specific disciplines (science
versus language arts, for example) and these differences can affect curriculum and pedagogy

organizational culture: its beliefs, values, norms, standards and traditions. Each of the studies
mentioned above indicated this to be the case, whether implicitly or explicitly, and regardless of
the differences in how that foundation might be described.
2.7.4 The Impact of School Culture on Stakeholders
The last body of literature on school culture centered on the experiences of various
,&     '&  '&re. Research primarily featured teachers and students,

26

though there were a handful of studies featuring parents. While the focus of each study was on
stakeholders and school culture, the research questions and topics under examination varied
widely.
Studies focused on students often dealt with how school culture affects academic
achievement (Gilliom, 1964; Mok & Flynn, 1998; Brady, 2005; Marcoulides, Heck, &
Papanastasiou, 2005; Dumay, 2009; MacNeil, Prater, & Busch, 2009). Students who are labeled
as deviant, as well as marginalized or minority populations were also represented in the literature
(Burke, 1995; Gaziel, 1997; Aveyard et al., 2004; Morris, 2005; Bisset, Markham, & Aveyard,
2007; Wilkinson & Pearson, 2009; Elia, 2010; Carroll, Fulmer, Sobel, Garrison-Wade, Aragon,
& Coval, 2011; Markham, 2014). Other research involving students and school culture included
student perceptions of school culture (Schratz & Steiner-LÃ¶ffler, 1998; Bell & Kent, 2010) and
  

      

    

Teacher-focused studies also focused on perceptions of school culture (Wong, 2010;
Barr, 2011) and on minority populations (Madsen & Mabokela, 2000; Mahamud & Ruiz-Funes,
2014). However, also featured were studies on teacher satisfaction, well-being, and burnout, and
how school culture contributes to each (Friedman, 1991; Sweeney, 1992; Wong & Zhang, 2014).
How school culture affects learning or adapting to the role of teacher was covered as well
(Aubusson, Watson, Vozzo, & Steele, 2005; Strogilos, Nikolaraizi, & Tragoulia, 2012;
Grosemans, Boon, Verclairen, Dochy, & Kyndt, 2015).
Parents are featured very briefly in the literature, though they are mentioned in studies
featuring other stakeholders. One study involving parents and school culture examined how
teacher-parent relationships are established and how parents are often marginalized due to what
is perceived by the educational community as their ignorance of the educational system and

27

school culture (Nason, 1997). Another study investigated

  

 

culture that purportedly disregards the needs of minority students (Vang, 2006) at the expense of
teacher habit, personal bias, or unwillingness to change. In both instances, the purpose of the
research was to encourage increased parent participation in the educational process.

due, in part, to the general perception that most schools have traditionally operated fairly
consistently and in a structured manner, to the point of near inflexibility. As a result, change has
been approached in a similarly consistent and structured manner with a top-down approach
(Evans, 1996).
The problem with this approach is that schools are not immune to technological, social,
political, and economic upheaval. Increased diversity among students and staff, technologicalmediated change, an aging teacher population, and the move towards privatization of education
are just some of the factors affecting American schools today. Combine those factors with the
myriad social and personal issues that influence the lives of school personnel, and the underlying
organizational structure becomes increasingly more inconsistent, unstructured, and complex.

is that they are either worn out, overworked (often of their own volition), or not challenged in
their current role. As a result, they are often dissatisfied professionally, and feel that there is
little to be done about it, as their dissatisfaction is related to external factors beyond their control.
Many of these factors, of course, fall under the larger umbrella term of change (Evans, 1996).
Now, more than ever before, change is moving at a rapid pace in order to keep up with
technological advances that affect current schooling.

Impact on School Culture

Technology-based change in an organizational culture can occur in three ways: planned
change, technological imperative, or punctuated equilibrium. Planned change involves a topdown approach, where managerial personnel initiate the change. When technological imperative
is the impetus for change, it is generally the result of an immediate and unavoidable need for new
technology. The punctuated equilibrium model of change is a longitudinal model that views

Havelock, 2005).
This leads to the question: what makes change sustainable? In a study on educational
innovation, Billig et al. extrapolated nine factors that made those innovations sustainable for ten
years or more: leadership, infrastructure, support, incentives, visibility, credibility, mutually
beneficial partnerships, macroculture development, and sufficient funding (Billig, Sherry, &
Havelock, 2005). Many of these factors echo the elements of strong school culture, and they all
are impacted by multiple levels of that culture, as well as outside influences such as federal,
state, and district level entities.
It is also important to understand the barriers to integration and sustainability. In an
analysis spanning more than a decade of technology integration studies, Hew and Brush (2007)
identified six barriers: insufficient resources, institutional barriers (such as poor leadership and
support), subject culture, teacher attitudes and beliefs about technology, lack of technology

31

knowledge and skills, and tensions between assessment and technology integration. Again,
elements involved in describing a strong school culture are evident here and, in fact, the authors
went on to describe strategies to overcome those barriers that rely implicitly on having a strong
school culture in place. Those strategies we

Brush, 2007, p. 232). Inherent in these strategies is the need for fundamental change, the success
of which, as demonstrated above, is also dependent on the organizational culture.

culture, the successful implementation of technological integration and school wide change

and external factors discussed previously.
A small body of school culture literature dealt with school culture and change. Topics in
this collection included collaboration (Oberg, 2009; Waldron & McLeskey, 2010; Dickerson,
2011), inclusion (Hanko, 2003), and curriculum and system reform (Snyder & Snyder, 1996;
Ediger, 1997; Oberg, 2003; Gordon & Patterson, 2007). An even smaller collection of literature
dealt with school culture and the introduction of new technology (Emihovich & Wager, 1992;
Maddux, 1997; Windschitl & Sahl, 2002; Demetriadis et al., 2003; Hew & Brush, 2007; Smith &
Cap, 2007; Kitchenham, 2009; Watson & Watson, 2011). None of these studies investigated the
introduction of digital learning resources as a replacement for traditional learning materials and
how that change might be affected by school culture. Additionally, most dealt with the learning

32

culture in schools rather than the organizational culture (Watson & Watson, 2011; Windschitl &
Sahl, 2002). As organizational culture has a significant impact on teacher buy-in as well as
learning, it is important to consider that culture when studying technological change and
integration.

integration is through a theoretical lens. Information worlds theory, which was developed by

encompass their participation in society both within and beyond the confines of the school. In
other words, an examination of their information worlds does not stop at the school doors.

33

2.8.1 Theoretical Concepts
The bulk of information worlds theory is based on

 concept of small worlds

and her theory of normative behavior, and the theory retained three of its fundamental
conceptssocial norms, social types, and information behavior. The concept of social norms
refers to what a group or society deems acceptable in behavior and appearance. These include
both implicit and explicit norms, which are enforced and reinforced by group members.
Members of a specific social setting (an information world) tend to share a collective sense of

 

    the rightness or wrongness  of social appearances and observable

    

r & Burnett, 2010, p. 22). Thus, behaviors and practices of members of the

information world tend to resemble each other.
Social types deals with how people in a group or society are perceived and defined by
other people in that information world, again both explicitly and implicitly. Information
behavior refers to how information is used (or not used) in a group or in society. This includes
information seeking behavior, as well as sharing, exchange, archiving, avoidance, and the
channels through which information travels (Jaeger & Burnett, 2010; Burnett, Hollister, Lee, &
Skinner, 2014).
In information worlds, Jaeger and Burnett took the fourth concept of normative behavior,
worldview, and adjusted it slightly to create a new concept: information value. Information
value is the determination of how important information is to a group or to society. Members of
an information world tend to share an understanding of which aspects of their world (and the
wider world) are important enough to deserve attention and which are not, as well as an
understanding of the information value and meaning of the objects and practices that make up

34

that world (Burnett, personal communication, March 25, 2014). As with social norms and social
types, information value can be either explicit or implicit.
Within the concept of information value lays another set of concepts that make it a bit
more complex than the overarching idea of a worldview. Specifically, information value
encompasses information content, perception, control, and information economies. Information

with how information is presented and subsequently understood by the individual. Control is
related to how information is filtered through a particular information world. And, finally, the
concept of information economies deals with the idea of information value. There are, in fact,
multiple definitions of value in relation to information economies including, but not limited to,
monetary, social, and intrinsic (Jaeger & Burnett, 2010; Burnett, Hollister, Lee, & Skinner,
2014).
From philosopher Habermas, information worlds theory retained the idea of the
lifeworld. In contrast to Chatman, Habermas was interested in the         

concept of boundaries ties in. The exchange and sharing of societal resources may occur (or not
occur) at boundaries between information worlds, either between small worlds, or between a
small world and the lifeworld. Multiple information worlds are both connected to and
separated from each other by the boundaries between them; information and associated values
and behaviors may or may not move easily across these boundaries. Interactions between worlds

35

may result in either reinforcement and agreement or conflict (Burnett, personal communication,
March 25, 2014).
2.8.2 Information Worlds Theory and K-12 Schools
The theory of information worlds goes beyond the ideas of the lifeworld and small worlds
to create the concept of the information world

 -         

p. 20). This is where the value of information worlds theory to work involving public K-12
schools becomes evident. A public school operates within, and is influenced by, the public
sphere, or lifeworld. However, a public school is also self-contained in many ways, operating as
its own small world. Though the school, as a public entity, is responsible for maintaining the
policies, procedures, and values of the larger lifeworld, it also functions separate from that
lifeworld, often going for long periods of time without direct contact from that lifeworld. A
more complex multi-level theory such as information worlds is necessary to examine an entity
that operates both within, and at times separate from, the public sphere. A theory that recognizes
only the larger lifeworld, or smaller independent worlds, is just not sufficient in scope.

36

1. Information worlds theory recognizes that people, and the small worlds in which they
operate, do not exist in isolation.
2. A multi-level theory such as information worlds is necessary to examine an entity that
operates both within, and separate from, the public sphere.
3. The complexity of information worlds theory is useful for the examination of multiple
types of information behavior, whether that behavior occurs serendipitously or through
formal channels of communication.
4. Information worlds theory is both broad and detailed, as well as being applicable across
the many facets of life, including work, home, and leisure.
5. Information worlds theory offers a way to gain a comprehensive understanding of the
way people make sense of information and the processes involving information.
6. Information worlds theory is composed of a rich set of concepts which are crucial to an
investigation involving a complex social entity.
7. Information worlds offers the ability to study people as groups, rather than considering
the minutia of individual relationships and their relevance to a network.
2.8.3.2 Limitations. Though information worlds theory is well-suited for the proposed
research, it does have limitations. Jaeger and Burnett (2010) acknowledged that the role of the
individual is somewhat neglected in information worlds theory. Burnett (2015) took steps to
rectify this situation in a soon-to-be published article in which he discusses three information

the three domains together (p. 9). This new work recognizes the role of the individual within his
or her information worlds. Further consideration of that role might involve thinking about how
the individual manages his information practices in relation to the small worlds in which he
participates, and the role he plays in each of those worlds. In order to consider the boundaries of
those worlds, it is necessary to consider the individual, as actors can, and do, move between
information worlds. This consideration of the individual actor will create a richer picture of
information worlds, where macro, meso, micro, and individual significance are all considered.
Though the role of the individual in information worlds theory is beginning to develop, it
is still evolving. This is a limitation that was pertinent to my research, because the unit of
analysis was the individual school librarian. As it was influence of the information worlds and
the general culture of the school that were of the greatest interest to the research, the limitation
was a minor one. However, it is my hope that this research might be used to gain insight into
how information worlds theory might be further expanded, particularly based on the release of

  



such that the individual actor is recognized as part of the conceptual

model.
2.9 Information Worlds Theory and Organizational Culture
In addition to considering the role of the individual in this research, organizational culture
and information worlds theory function as complements, rather than as competing theories. First
and foremost, organizational culture (or school culture as it is referred to in the context of this
research) was treated as a concept rather than a theory. As defined previously, organizational
culture is a sociocultural system existing in a particular place and time that shapes, and is
shaped by, the individuals and the environment that are part of both its internal structure and its
external setting (Allaire & Firsirotu, 1984; Ouchi & Wilkins, 1985; Scott, 2004). Viewed as

38

such, organizational culture was used as a framework for understanding the information worlds
of librarians, some of which were tied to the school culture. School librarians both influenced,
and were influenced by, that school culture, and the same is true of their information worlds.
Culture is distinguished by knowledge rather than behavior. In studying school culture,
the three main concepts in that domain that have emerged are  

culture as conceptual structure and symbols, and culture as meanings generated in political

definitions of information!as thing (bits of information), as knowledge (conceptual), and as
process (generating meanings), demonstrating that school culture can be considered as a model
of knowledge construction which can be understood and described in terms of information
behavior (Buckland, 1991). The focus of the research was on how that existing school culture
affects information behavior (in this case, the process of digital learning resource integration),
rather than in the culture as a process in and of itself. That is not to say that theories of
organizational culture do not exist, but the goal of this research was to operationalize the way
researchers define and conceptualize organizational culture in a school context.
To further demonstrate the complementary nature of the concept of organizational culture
and information worlds theory, I considered the disparate yet balancing views on the actors
within the school community. While information worlds theory acknowledges a small
(information) world as its smallest unit of analysis, studies of organizational culture
acknowledge the individual actor. Conversely, information worlds theory recognizes that
information worlds are influenced by, and influence, each other and the larger lifeworld;
organizational culture is focused within the parameters of a particular organization, with only
marginal consideration of other organizations or the world outside. They are unified, however,

39

in their recognition that culture, and reality itself, are socially constructed. The shortcomings of
one are alleviated by the other, allowing a richer picture to emerge from the data analysis.

culture would be the only influence considered. The totality of the process cannot be captured by
examining only one of these facets.
2.10 Summary
The role of the school librarian is multi-faceted. While in a position to influence
stakeholders within the school, the school librarian is also influenced by those stakeholders in
return, as well as by the organizational culture of the school, its information worlds, and the
larger information worlds of which the school librarian is a part. In my research, I explored the
complexity of this position. I assessed the technology leadership skills of Florida school
librarians, based on their own perceptions, and then examined the acquisition and development
of those skills through the theoretical lens of information worlds theory, taking into consideration
the organizational culture of the school and how it affected 

methodology, and impact. The purpose of this chapter is to review the methodology and methods
I used for conducting this research. I chose a case study as the appropriate methodology by
which to examine the phenomenon of interest. This methodology was chosen for its flexibility,
its constructivist approach (which reflects the framework of school culture and the theoretical
lens of information worlds theory), and for the ability to use multiple data collection methods in
order to form a more complete picture.
3.1 Restatement of the Problem
The evolving role of technology in education calls for a school librarian who is proficient
both as an educator and as the local technology expert for teachers and students (Everhart,
Mardis & Johnson, 2011). This dual role is a break from the traditional role of the school
librarian as primarily a resource teacher ancillary to the classroom teacher. Now, increasing
demands to provide individualized learning experiences require school librarians to work in
critical partnerships with classroom teachers and to provide technological leadership through a
time of fast-paced educational change (Kong et al., 2014).
3.2 Significance of the Problem
As stated previously, students are connected, and those connections are mobile. In this,
the third generation of digital natives, it is important that education reflects that reality (Wang,

should be prepared to use

in order to become global digital

citizens, and they need guidance on how to do so (Wang et al., p. 24). If educators are to provide

41

this guidance, they must be prepared to master the use of technology for pedagogical purposes as
well, including the integration of digital learning resources into the curriculum. As teachers,
technology leaders, and information specialists, school librarians are uniquely qualified to help
bridge the gap between technology and education by providing the support that educators need to
shift away from a reliance on print resources (AASL, 2009). However, not all school librarians
are equally prepared to meet this challenge.
3.3 Restatement of Research Questions
With this background in mind, the research questions for the proposed study are as
follows:
RQ1: To what extent do school librarians perceive they are prepared to lead digital
learning resource integration?
a. What do they perceive as their areas of strength?
b. In which areas do they perceive they need improvement?
RQ2: How does the organizational culture of the school affect school librarian leadership
enactment?

worlds?
3.4 Restatement of Purpose
The purpose of this research was to assess the self-reported technology leadership skills
of Florida school librarianswhere the mandatory move to digital textbooks is underwayand
their ability to lead the transition to, and use of, primarily digital teaching and learning materials.
By studying the process where it has already begun, this research identified potential best
practices for, and strengthened research about, effective technology leadership in a range of

42

educational contexts. The importance of information literacy skills and the constraints under
which teachers operate make it essential to understand how the integration of technology and
digital learning resources into the curriculum occurs, and how prepared school librarians are to
assist in the integration.

The case study methodology was operationalized

with quantitative and qualitative methods.

research questions associated with this study have already been outlined above.
3.5.1.1 Propositions. The propositions, if any, are guided by the type of case study to be
conducted. For this research, an instrumental case study was appropriate. An instrumental case
study seeks specific insight on a particular topic, or works toward refinement of a theory. The
case itself is not the center of interest, and the focus is not on understanding or on generalizing
results (Stake, 1995). The purpose of this research was to gain insight into sc 
ability to take the lead in the process of technology and digital learning resource integration, and
to contribute to the literature on school culture and information worlds theory as it pertains to
school librarians. The researcher did not approach the subject matter with a hypothesis, but
rather with an open inquiry. As such, there were no research propositions associated with the
case study (Yin, 2014). There were, however, several theoretical propositions.

43

Burnett, one of the originators of information worlds theory, defined the following
theoretical propositions:
1. Members of a specific social setting (an information world) tend to share a collective
    

o





the rightness or wrongness

       

of social appearances and

Burnett, 2010, p. 22). Thus, behaviors and practices of

members of the information world tend to resemble each other.
2. The functional roles of individuals within an information world are related to the ways in
which such individuals are typed or perceived by other members of that world.
3. Members of an information world tend to share an understanding of which aspects of
their world (and the wider world) are important enough to deserve attention and which
are not, as well as an understanding of the information value and meaning of the objects
and practices that make up that world.
4. Members of an information world tend to share an understanding of what behaviors,
practices, and activities are most appropriate in relation to information use, exchange, and
storage.
5. Information worlds do not exist in isolation from one another, but interact with each other
in a variety of ways. Multiple information worlds are both connected to and separated
from each other by the boundaries between them; information and associated values and
behaviors may or may not move easily across these boundaries. Interactions between
worlds may result in either reinforcement and agreement or conflict. (Burnett, personal
communication, March 25, 2014)
I considered these propositions in the course of the proposed study, and used them to guide my
discussion of the findings.

44

3.5.1.2 Units of analysis. In order to determine the units of analysis to be studied in a
case, the case must first be defined and bounded (Yin, 2014). For the purposes of this research, a
single-case holistic study was selected. The case was defined as the state of Florida. The unit of
analysis was Florida K-12 school librarians who were tasked with assisting in the process of
integrating technology and digital learning resources into their curriculum. The case was bound
to these individuals, and did not include administrative personnel, teachers, students, district
personnel, parents, other school staff, or any other relevant stakeholders. Interactions with those
outside the bounded group were mentioned and analyzed during the course of this research, but
the focus remained on that bounded group. Similarly, the case was bound to activities related to
the purpose of the study, and to the specified time frame: the 2015-2016 academic year.
3.5.1.3 Data collection. The study employed two methods of data collection: an
electronic survey, followed by in-depth interviews. Initially, a survey instrument was distributed
to allow the researcher to establish an understanding of the current perceived level of the school
 

Library Media Standards, First Edition (Coatney et

al., 2001). Upon receiving Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval for the research, the
Technology Leadership Survey (see Appendix A) was keyed in and distributed via the Qualtrics
web-based survey tool. In an effort to reach the largest possible population of Florida school
librarians, the survey was publicized using major school librarian professional email lists
(LM_NET and AASLForum), the Florida Association for Media in Education (FAME), and the
Florida Department of Education (via the Library Media and Instructional Materials Specialist,
who then distributed the survey statewide to her district level contacts). The Qualtrics

P address as he or she completed the survey. As such,

any response not associated with a location in Florida was easily discarded in order to maintain
the integrity of the results, though location cannot be 100% guaranteed due to the possibility of
location spoofing. This also constituted a purposive sample, as only Florida school librarians
were asked to participate in the survey and subsequent interviews. The survey was open from
November 30, 2015 to December 31, 2015, and reminders were sent every seven days. At the
time of the survey, there were 5,670 certified school media specialists in the state of Florida
(Florida Department of Education, 2015). It is possible that not all of those certified were
practicing school librarians. I anticipated a response rate of approximately 2%, or 113
participants. The actual response rate was 1.7%, or 97 participants. These participants were also
given the opportunity to be entered into a drawing for one of ten $10 Amazon gift cards. This
incentive was offered because of the length of the survey instrument, in an effort to encourage
greater participation.
Following a review of the survey data, I scheduled individual interviews with
respondents who indicated a willingness to participate in this second part of the research. I
hoped to conduct 15-20 interviews. I was able to conduct a total of 19 interviews. Interviews
with these participants were scheduled immediately following analysis of the survey data, and
were conducted primarily by phone. Two interviews were conducted via email. Interviews took
between 12 and 30 minutes, and were recorded, and later transcribed, in order to facilitate
analysis. The purpose of the interviews was for clarification 

questions where needed, as well as to gain insight into the school culture and information worlds
of the participants. They were semi-structured to allow the school librarian the flexibility to
discuss related topics that arose during the course of the interview that were relevant to the

46

research. The critical incident technique was used, in which participants were asked to recall and
describe specific events from their own experiences related to the research topic. The
advantages of using this technique included the ability to collect facts rather than impressions,
and to have participants report situations that were significant to them (Flanagan, 1954). Rather
than ask a series of disjointed questions during the interviews, the critical incident technique
allowed themes to emerge naturally during the course of storytelling. Four questions were
posed, the first two of which were critical incident questions. The third was designed to extract

designed to capture any additional thoughts that the participants might have. The questions were
as follows:

current position.
2. Please describe an instance where you felt hindered in your ability to act as a technology
leader in your current position.
3. How has Florida's move to a digital curriculum affected you in your current position?
4. Is there anything else you would like to add about the technology leadership role of the
school librarian?

-129). The first

principle allowed for triangulation of data, thus strengthening the construct validity of the study.
This was achieved by collecting both survey and interview data. The second principle increased
reliability by ensuring that the data in its original form (prior to analytical notations) was kept

47

intact. This was achieved by extracting data from the survey software and maintaining it in an
Excel file on a password protected computer. Additional information on respondents who chose
to participate in the optional interviews was also added to this file. Only information pertinent to
the completion of the study was kept in the Excel database, and all data will be destroyed one
year from the completion of the research. The third principle also increased reliability and was
achieved through the careful coding and re-coding of the data. Additionally, data from each
interview was presented to the participant to check for accuracy. The fourth and final principle
deals with the analysis of data from electronic records such as emails or company policies (Yin,
2014). None of these types of electronic records were used during the course of this study.
3.5.1.4 Data analysis. Because the study had associated propositions that needed to be
linked to the collected data, analysis relied on two of
collected data. The four strategies

(2014, pp. 136-141). Because of the need to both examine the phenomenon of interest
(perceived technology leadership skills), and to test the theory (information worlds), the study
relied on theoretical propositions, but also worked the data from the ground up. Working the
data involved a complex data analysis process in which the theoretical concepts were tied back to

Because a Chi-Square test looks at the difference between expected and actual results, it was
ideal for this purpose. Age and years of experience are often generalized culturally as having an
association with technological ability. The purpose of the study was not to determine
correlation, but to provide a description of the technology leadership skills of school librarians as
perceived by that group, and to explore some factors (information worlds and school culture) that
may affect those perceptions. Using both simple statistical analysis and the technology score,
along with the coding and pattern matching process described below, allowed for a

was applied to each

survey -ended question responses and each interview transcript, using a provisional coding
approach for each phenomenon of interest: technology leadership skills, school culture, and
information worlds. Provisional coding involves establishing a predetermined set of codes
before data collection begins (SaldaÃ±a, 2009). Three codebooks were used during data analysis,
with the understanding that revisions to those codebooks might need to be made as themes began
to emerge.
To determine the presence of information worlds themes, I used a pre-established
codebook for information worlds theory created by Burnett, Hollister, Lee and Skinner (2014).
The codebook for technology leadership skills was derived from the same NBPTS Library Media

50

standards as the survey instrument, using the definitional language for each section heading
(Coatney et al., 2001). The codebook for school culture was derived from the literature. The
literature corpus was synthesized and analyzed for overarching themes. Eight such themes
emerged, and were defined as codes based on the literature: autonomy; collaboration;
communication; conformity; cultural rituals; evidence of subcultures; a shared set of standards,
beliefs, and values; and strong leadership (Burns, 1985; Conway, 1985, 1990; Deal, 1985; Hoy,
 



   

Once these codes were applied during the provisional coding process (described below),
data was arranged                   
facilitate pattern matching and thematic analysis (Charmaz, 2006, p. 46). In the first round of
coding relating to technology leadership skills, codes applied to the data were the categories
established in the headings of the survey, followed by the assignment of the leadership level that
the coded statement reflected in a process known as magnitude coding (SaldaÃ±a, 2009). For
example, a statement that received    

twice more in order to extrapolate data relating to school culture (RQ2), and then to conduct a
theoretical analysis to extrapolate codes related to the theoretical propositions and concepts
related to information worlds (RQ3). A fourth and final round of coding was conducted in which
all codes were carefully reviewed. Coding occurred immediately following data collection.
Once the coding process is complete, Yin recommends five possible analytical
techniques, one of which was appropriate for this research: pattern matching. Pattern matching
was useful for research questions two and three, because it compares the empirical to the

51

predicted, or theoretical (Yin, 2014). The overlay of these three sets of codes identified the
junctures at which technology leadership, school culture, and information worlds connect.
3.5.1.5 Interpretation of findings. Once the data was coded and analyzed, themes and
patterns emerged. Again, the purpose of the proposed research was not explanatory or
descriptive, and the results are not generalizable. The findings are intended to offer insight into
the perceived technology leadership skills of school librarians in relation to the integration of
digital learning resources, and to examine how the school culture and information worlds of the
school librarians affect those perceptions. As such, findings were interpreted according to the
analytical techniques described above, and based on the theoretical criteria, and results are
reported appropriately. Any patterns detected from the data are included in the report as well.
Where suggestions for best practices could be extracted from the data, those are also reported in
the findings. Finally, the limitations of the study (such as the inability to generalize) and
suggestions for future research are included.

In summary, the electronic survey, which contained the three types of questions listed in
Figure 1, was open for approximately four weeks. Once the survey closed, frequencies and
leadership scores were calculated for questions 1-92, and data from the open-ended questions
was coded and analyzed in order to prepare for the semi-structured interviews. Those interviews
were completed within a month of analysis of the survey results. Each interview was then
transcribed and coded. As previously described, I coded the data from the open-ended survey
questions and the interview transcripts in four rounds: NBPTS categories and associated
leadership level, school culture, information worlds, and a final round to review all coding
(illustrated in Figure 1.)
3.5.1.6 Connecting the data. While the methodology for the proposed research was a
case study, it was also mixed methods research. The Technology Leadership Survey contained
both quantitative and qualitative elements, and the semi-structured interviews were qualitative.
Because of this, it is necessary to discuss how the two types of data are connected. The
quantitative and qualitative data were    

and closed questions) and sequentially (via the semi-structured interviews following the survey
administration). Coding took place once the survey closed, and again following the completion
of the interviews. Leadership scores were calculated upon closing the survey, and I referred to

structured interviews. Thus, data collected via the survey contributed to data collected during the
interviews (Driscoll, Appiah-Yeboah, Salib, & Rupert, 2007).
A key objective of this study was to try to determine whether or not the information
worlds and school culture of school librarians have any effect on their perceptions of their own
technology leadership skills, and what those effects might be. One way to achieve this objective

      by combining

the reliability of empirical counts with the

validity of lived experience (Wheeldon & Ãhlberg, 2012, p. 115). Because the effects of
information worlds and school culture were of primary interest, the qualitative methodological
approach was more dominant than the quantitative approach in my research (Wheeldon &
Ãhlberg, 2012). However, the quantitative data was important, in that it provided a foundation
for the qualitative data to build upon. In short, knowing how school librarians perceived their
technology leadership skills afforded the researcher the opportunity to connect those perceptions
to the themes that emerged 

        

school culture.
For the purposes of this research, it was necessary only to connect the two types of data
rather than to fully integrate them, which would have involved either transforming the
quantitative data to qualitative data or vice versa (Wheeldon & Ãhlberg, 2012). In fact, it was
beneficial to present the data separately, and then to form that connection. The answers to the
research questions, though they may exhibit a correlation, should be considered separately. It is
of interest whether or not school librarians perceive themselves as technology leaders in order to
establish a baseline of these skills, and it is also interesting to consider what factors might affect
that perception, so that areas for future research and possible educational opportunities can be
illuminated.
3.6 Benefits and Challenges of the Method
3.6.1 Benefits
Some of the advantages of case study methodology have already been mentioned
previously. These include the ability to include both quantitative and qualitative data, use

55

multiple methods of data collection, and to build or test theory (Masoner, 1988). The case study
is also  

  

           (Yin, 2014, p. 4).

Further, though Yin advocates for case study in any phase of an investigation, the implicit belief
among many social scientists is that a case study is most appropriate during the exploratory
phase (Yin, 2014). As the phenomenon of interest in the research is indeed a complex social
one, and the research was exploratory, a case study was particularly advantageous. Finally, a
case study is of particular value when the researcher has no control over the variables of interest,
and when the study is guided by a how or why question (Yin, 2014). Despite the flexibility of
case study research, however, there are disadvantages to consider.
3.6.2 Challenges: Rigor in the Case Study
Case study has been criticized as a research design for its perceived lack of rigor (Yin
2014). According to Gibbert, Ruigrok, and Wicki (2008), this concern can be addressed by
vigilant attention to study design and careful consideration of the four criteria for establishing
rigor, as defined by the positivist tradition: construct validity, internal validity, external validity,
and reliability.
3.6.2.1 Construct validity. Construct validity refers to the use of appropriate
     

               

    

validity is particularly challenging because a case study is often exploratory, and my research is
no exception. For this reason, I have refrained from subjective judgments during the periods of




 

    !   "  # $    

     

construct validity include: using a variety of sources to support findings; connecting evidence to
form a chain that can be followed logically; and having case study participants review data for
inconsistencies and misunderstandings (Riege, 2003; Yin, 2014). These measures are addressed

56

in this study through the use of two types of data collection and detailed coding practices. I also
had participants review their interview transcripts for accuracy.
3.6.2.2 Validity. Internal validity deals with the establishment of causation.
Traditionally, the biggest challenge in establishing internal validity is in ferreting out spurious
relationships that do not actually show causation (Yin, 2014). Case study research, however, is
more concerned with establishing the ability to make inferences from the case that will hold up
in the general population (Riege, 2003). Measures for increasing internal validity include
pattern matching, explanation building, addressing alternate explanations, and using logic
models (Riege, 2003; Yin, 2014). In this research, pattern matching was used during the coding
process in order to ensure internal validity.
External validity involves the generalizability of research findings, and can be addressed
initially by properly constructed research questions. Specifically,   
          



             Clearly

defining the scope of the study is another way to increase the validity of single-case studies
(Riege, 2003; Yin, 2014). For the purposes of this study, the researcher used an established
survey instrument to limit the scope of the data collected, in addition to outlining specific
parameters for the case under examination. Further, I carefully constructed interview questions
to address the concepts extracted from the corpus of school culture literature, and to address the
theoretical concepts from information worlds theory.
3.6.2.3 Reliability. Reliability refers to the ability to repeat research and get the same, or
reasonably similar, results. The concern when dealing with qualitative research is the
subjectivity of the researchers. Ways to circumvent this concern involve keeping detailed
records and accounts of the research. Yin (2014) suggested

teachers to meet this need themselves, and the shift to digital learning resources that brings this
need to a place of urgency!but the research is unique in addressing them simultaneously.
Not only does the study on school librarians and the integration of digital learning
resources address this unique gap in the literature, but it also does so through the theoretical lens
of information worlds, which lends itself nicely to a pairing with the framework of
organizational culture. Information worlds theory also provided the concepts and terminology
for a richer description of school culture than what is currently found in the literature, and a
model for examining how that culture is influenced both from within and without.

3.9 Summary of the Method
In this study, the researcher used survey and interview data in order to determine the
technology leadership skills of school librarians in the state of Florida as perceived by that group.
A survey was especially useful as a first step in designing the case study. A survey is designed
to collect general information, under natural conditions, on particular variables for a specific
sample. Ideally, survey samples are chosen such that the information collected can be
considered to be generalizable to the larger population (Roberts, 1999). However, the use of the
survey as a starting point for a case study does not need such considerations in design, as the
population of the case study is the population of interest, and the purpose of conducting the
survey is to uncover topics of interest for further exploration using qualitative methods, such as

, p. 3). The interview design

for this research was semi-structured, consisting of a series of open-ended questions with room
to move off topic if desired (DiCicco Bloom, & Crabtree, 2006). Taken together, these two data
collection methods provided a richer picture of the phenomenon of interest than either one could
have alone.

website&iplocation.net&I was able to determine that responses were likely representative of 26
of 67 counties in the state of Florida (N=97). However, this information cannot be 100%
guaranteed due to the possibility of location spoofing. Due to restrictions in IRB approval,

60

specific counties cannot be named. However, the geographic distribution appeared to be
representative of all regions of the state.
4.1.1.2 Training, certification, and experience. Following the three demographic
questions, participants were asked about their certification, training, and experience. The
majority of respondents (n=82) indicated certification as both a teacher and a librarian/media
specialist, one as a teacher only, and 14 as a librarian, but not as a teacher.
Next, participants were asked to indicate the state in which they obtained certification.
The majority of participants (n=86, or 88.7%) were certified solely in Florida. Two respondents
were certified in multiple states: one was certified in Arizona and Florida and one was certified
in Alabama, Florida, and South Carolina. Two participants (2.1%) were certified solely in New
York. Seven participants (9%) were certified in only one state: Georgia, North Carolina, New
York, Pennsylvania, and Texas. One participant did not report the state in which he/she was
certified.
The next set of survey questions pertained to

     

-12 education.

Participants were first asked about their level of experience as a school librarian. The number of
years of experience varied from zero, or first year, to 36 years, with the median level being ten
years of experience. A subset of the 97 participants (n=17, or 17.5%) were also National Board
Certified Media Specialists. National Board certification is a voluntary, peer-reviewed process,
and the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, which bestows the certification, is
an independent non-profit agency. The standards that must be met to achieve certification are
developed by accomplished educators in each field (NBPTS, 2014).
Many respondents (n=74) had been classroom teachers prior to running the school
library. For those who taught at the elementary level, the grade level at which they taught was

61

fairly evenly distributed, with a few (3) teaching music, physical education (P.E.) and special
education, as Table 2 shows.

full time and 89 served only one school. The rest distributed their time among multiple schools:

Also for the majority of respondents (n=86), only one certified school librarian worked in
the school. Ten participants indicated that they had two, and only one indicated that there were

one full-time paid staff member and five indicated that they had two; 13 indicated that they had
one part-time paid staff member, one indicated that they had 22, one reported three, and one
reported two.
Some participants (n=60) also had volunteer help, with the number of hours ranging
widely from one to 75 per week. Less than half of respondents (n=48) also reported having fulltime instructional technology staff at their schools, while approximately one quarter (n=25)
reported having part-time instructional technology staff.

both students (4, or 4.1%) and teachers (30, or 30.9%). Few participants indicated that only
unfiltered access was offered to students (1, or 1%) and teachers (2, or 2.1%). Three participants
did not know what type of access was offered to their students and four were unsure what type of

Specifically, they were asked to indicate how many computers fell into the following categories:
desktops located in or under supervision of the school library; desktops located elsewhere in the
school, not under the school library control, but connected to school library resources; laptops
located in or under supervision of the school library; and laptops located elsewhere in the school,
not under the school library control, but connected to school library resources. Appendix E
illustrates detailed responses to these questions.
These findings suggest a profile of a typical respondent as a white female with prior
classroom experience, working as the only school librarian at her school. The typical participant
was also certified as both a teacher and a librarian/media specialist who was responsible for a
number of computers and digital resources both within and beyond her library.
4.1.2 Survey Section II. Technology Leadership
Participants responded to a series of questions based on the NBPTS Library Media
Standards (first edition), the standards that drove National Board Certification of school library
specialists from 2001-2011. Those questions are divided into the following ten categories
derived from the NBPTS standards sections: Knowledge of Learners; Knowledge of Teaching
and Learning; Integrating Instruction; Knowledge of Library and Information Studies (Resource
Focus); Leading Innovation through Library Media Program; Administering the Library Media
Program; Reflective Practice; Professional Growth; Ethics, Equity, and Diversity; and
Leadership, Advocacy, and Community Partnerships.

leadership level assigned to that question (entry: 1, adaptive: 2, transformative: 3). The scores for
each category were then added together to produce the 

Leadership Score. The minimum and maximum possible scores were 145 and 930, respectively.
(The minimum and maximum possible scores for individual categories are discussed in the
corresponding sections below.)
4.1.2.1 Knowledge of learners. The first category focused on Standard I of the NBPTS
Library Media Standards (first edition): Knowledge of Learners. This standard states that

school librarians use technology to support growth and development within their schools. The
minimum possible score for this category was 12 and the maximum 72. As illustrated in the

The mean of the scores was 42.04, and the standard deviation was 12.769, indicating that
scores were somewhat spread out, rather than clustered tightly around the mean. However, the
65

two scores which represented the mode (39 and 42, with seven participants each), were rather
close to the mean.
Knowledge of learners scores were then divided into three categories: entry (12-32),
adaptive (33-53), and transformative (54-72). As Figure 2 illustrates, 21 participants fell into the
entry level category; 58 participants into the adaptive category, and 18 into the transformative
category.
4.1.2.2 Knowledge of teaching and learning. The next category focused on Standard II

scores was 96.89, and the standard deviation was 17.732, indicating again that scores were
somewhat spread out, rather than clustered tightly around the mean. In this case, however,
scores were spread out around the upper end of the score range. In fact, the mode for this
category was 120, the maximum score possible.
The Knowledge of Teaching and Learning category scores were then divided into three
categories: entry (20-53), adaptive (54-87), and transformative (88-120). As Figure 3 illustrates,
only one participant fell into the entry level category; 23 participants into the adaptive category,
and the overwhelming majority (73) into the transformative category.

4.1.2.3 Integrating instruction. The next category focused on Standard IV of the
NBPTS Library Media Standards (first edition): Integrating Instruction. This standard states that

entry level category; 37 participants into the adaptive category, and 55 into the transformative
category.
4.1.2.5 Leading innovation through library media program. The next category
focused on Standard V of the NBPTS Library Media Standards (first edition): Leading
Innovation through Library Media Program. This standard states that accomplished library
media specialists lead in providing equitable access to and effective use of technologies and

The mean of the scores was 44.91, and the standard deviation was 7.486, indicating that,
in this case, scores were clustered more tightly about the mean. This tighter clustering illustrates
that participant scores in this category were not as spread out as in previous categories. In fact,
when the three leadership levels are considered, a clearer picture emerges.

Advocacy, and Community Partnership scores were divided into three categories: entry (11-28),
adaptive (29-47), and transformative (48-66). As Figure 11 illustrates, 13 participants fell into

the entry level category; 47 participants into the adaptive category, and 37 into the
transformative category.
4.1.3 Technology Leadership Scores
Each   responses to the survey questions were recorded numerically; for each
participant, then, I calculated a technology leadership score for each survey category (discussed
in the preceding sections) as well as an overall technology leadership score. The minimum
possible overall technology leadership score was 145 and the maximum 930. Figure 12 depicts a
fairly normal distribution, with a slight skew to the left, as might be expected considering the
results from each sub-category above, the majority of which also reflected a slightly leftward
skew.

Figure 12. Overall technology leadership scores.

77

The mean of the scores was 666.27, and the standard deviation was 134.606, indicating
that scores were spread out, rather than tightly clustered about the mean. Overall technology
leadership scores were divided into three categories: entry (145-407), adaptive (408-669), and
transformative (670-930). As Figure 12 illustrates, only three (3.1%) participants fell into the
entry level category. There were 43 (44.3%) participants in the adaptive category, and the
majority (51, or 52.6%) fell into the transformative category.
Due to the distribution of gender and race described earlier in this chapter (dominantly
female and white), I did not examine the relationship of those variables to the technology
leadership score. I did, however, examine the relationship between age and technology
leadership score, and between years of experience and technology leadership score. A Pearson
Chi-Square test showed no association between a participant  age and his or her technology
leadership score [2(3306) = 3425.178, p = .073]. The scatter plot in Figure 13 better illustrates
the lack of association.

Figure 13. Association between age and leadership score. (N=97)

A Pearson Chi-Square test also showed no association between the number of years a
participant had    

.119]. This lack of association is also better illustrated by the scatter plot in Figure 14.

Figure 14. Association between years of experience and leadership score. (N=97)

For each of the ten NBPTS categories, the majority of respondents fell into the adaptive
or transformative range of scores. In three categories, the number of participants who fell into
the transformative range was particularly high: Knowledge of Teaching and Learning (73, or
75%); Administering the Library Media Program (78, or 80%); and Ethics, Equity and Diversity
(69, or 71%). For these same categories, the number of participants who fell into the entry level
range was less than five. Also of possible interest is the Knowledge of Learners category, which
had the most normal distribution and the highest number of participants in the entry level range
(21, or 22%), as well as the lowest number of participants in the transformative range (18, or
19%).

schools. The answers to these questions were coded in four rounds, the first of which involved
NBPTS codes related to the theme of Technology Leadership. The first open question asked
participants about their current level of involvement with technology at their schools: Think

these questions. Their responses were coded using an established codebook (see Appendix C), in
a process known as provisional coding. Once NBPTS codes were applied, responses were
further coded for magnitude: entry (level 1), adaptive (level 2), or transformative (level 3).
These levels were based on the Technology Integration Matrix discussed previously. During the
process of coding, it became necessary to add a fourth level of magnitude 

All ten of the NBPTS Library Media Standards (first edition) categories from the survey
were represented in the open-ended survey question responses. Leading Innovation through
Library Media Program was the most represented category (n=47). A quote from Survey
Respondent 80 is illustrative of the types of responses that were coded as Leading Innovation
through Library Media Program:
I am the tech coordinator for our school. I am expected to take a leading role in
tech[nology] instructional strategies, trouble shoot equipment, provide instruction,
produce the TV news, manage all of the computer labs and facilitate all online testing. I
work to keep all of the computers working so the teachers can rely on them.

The second most frequent code was Reflective Practice (n=41). Reflective Practice responses
fell more along the lines of this quote from Survey Respondent  I would like to be more

effectiveness might be improved rather

4.1.4.2 School culture. Themes reflecting school culture components also emerged from
the answers to the open-ended survey questions, and were coded provisionally using the
established codebook. The researcher began with eight school culture codes (based on a careful
review and analysis of the literature): autonomy; collaboration; communication; conformity;
cultural rituals; evidence of subcultures; shared set of standards, beliefs and values; and strong
leadership. During the process of coding, it became necessary to amend these codes with two
additional codes#one for external barriers and one for internal barriers. The resulting ten codes
were defined as follows:
Autonomy: Working independently with little or no direction from administrative staff
Collaboration: Working with other stakeholders within the school

82

Communication: Exchanging information with other stakeholders within the school
Conformity: Working within the parameters set forth by administrative entities such as
the school principal or district personnel
Cultural rituals: Events that promote widespread participation in the school culture; may
include: passage, enhancement, degradation, integration, conflict reduction, and
renewal
Evidence of subcultures: Subcultures refers to groups of stakeholders within the school
such as students or teachers who may or may not adhere to the school culture, but
can definitely be identified as a unique group.
External barriers: Barriers that originate outside the school/district, e.g. socioeconomic or
psychosocial barriers.
Internal barriers: Barriers from within the school/district, e.g. financial
constraints/scheduling/time.
Shared set of standards, beliefs and values: Members of the school organization agree on
values and on how things should be done.
Strong leadership: Refers to an administrator who is generally respected and whose
directives are carried out mostly without resistance and complaint.
Eighty-three participants chose to answer one or more of the three open-ended survey
questions (see Appendix A for question wording). In the second round of provisional coding, I
assigned school culture codes to participant responses that reflected those codes thematically.
Table 5 illustrates the frequency of the school culture codes that emerged from the analysis.

remaining school culture categories, are located in Appendix F.
Conformity (n=28), external barriers (n=25), and strong leadership (n=21) all appeared
with similar frequencies. Autonomy was represented 13 times; shared set of standards, beliefs
and values only seven; and cultural rituals just once.
4.1.4.3 Information worlds. Finally, open-ended survey questions were analyzed and
coded for information worlds concepts. The existing codebook consisted of 40 codes that were
subdivided under the five concepts of information worlds theory: boundaries, information
behavior, information value, social norms, and social types. (Please see Appendix C for how
each of the 40 codes is defined.)
The 83 participant responses for the open-ended survey questions were analyzed for the
extraction of information worlds codes. Again, the researcher utilized a provisional coding
process with an established codebook. Table 6 depicts the frequency with which each code
appeared in the analysis of the open-ended survey questions.

All five information worlds concepts, and eighteen of the 40 codes, were represented in
the data analysis. The concept of boundaries (n=58) appeared most frequently, followed closely
by information behavior (n=49) and social norms (n=48). Information value (n=20) and social
types (n=12) appeared less frequently.
4.1.4.3.1 Boundaries. Within the concept of boundaries, references to explicit boundaries
(n=25) appeared most often. Boundary interactions (n=22) were mentioned almost as frequently.
Implicit boundaries (n=11) were referred to less, and time not at all. An example of the type of
response that was coded as explicit boundary is Survey Respondent   

4.1.4.3.2 Information behavior. In regards to the concept of information behavior,
participants referred to information sharing (n=33) most frequently. Information seeking (n=6),
information avoidance (n=5), information use (n=3), and information exchange (n=2) were
mentioned far less frequently. References to information archiving, information channels, and
information source did not emerge from the data. An example of the most frequent code,
information sharing, is this quote from Survey Respondent  School based DLLs receive

4.1.4.3.3 Information value. Only three of the 14 information value codes were reflected
in the coding analysis: cultural value (n=9), implicit indicators of value (n=7), and explicit
indicators of value (n=4). Statements of information value were generally expressed in terms of
benefits to stakeholders, as expressed in this statement of cultural value from Survey Respondent

4.1.4.3.4 Social norms. For the concept of social norms, implicit norms (n=23) appeared
most frequently, followed closely by explicit norms (n=19). The idea of reinforcement of norms
appeared six times, and references to expression or sanctions did not appear at all. Examples of
implicit social norms within the survey responses tended toward practices that were regularly
occurring, but not explicitly outlined in official school policy such as this situation outlined by
Survey Respondent  The past 2 years, the district has spent the [Follett] Destiny [state

4.1.4.3.5 Social types. Four of the nine social types codes were represented in the data
analysis. Reference to explicit status/title appeared eight times, while reference to implicit status
appeared only twice. Hierarchy and team/community role appeared just once each. Survey

The percentage of interviewees at each technology leadership level is similar to the
overall percentage of survey participants at each technology leadership level: one interviewee
(5.2%) was entry level, and three (3.1%) survey participants were entry level; seven interviewees
(36.8%) were adaptive level, and 43 (44.3%) survey participants were adaptive level; 11
interviewees (58%) were transformative level, and 51 (52.6%) survey participants were
transformative level.

4.2.2 Interview Question Responses
Each interview participant was asked to answer the following four questions:
1. Please describe a time when you feel you were able to act as a technology leader
in your current position.
2. Please describe an instance where you felt hindered in your ability to act as a
technology leader in your current position.
3. How has Florida's move to a digital curriculum affected you in your current
position?
4. Is there anything else you would like to add about the technology leadership role
of the school librarian?
Like the data analysis for the open-ended survey questions, the interview analysis is
organized thematically. Data analysis for this section involved the coding of responses to
interview questions. Results are presented first for the theme of Technology Leadership,
followed by School Culture, and ending with Information Worlds.

4.2.2.3.2 Information behavior. In regards to the concept of information behavior,
participants referred to information sharing (n=37) most frequently. Information seeking (n=5),

between the score and their years of experience in the school library. All of the NBPTS themes
from the survey categories appeared in the open-ended survey question responses, with most
responses being indicative of an entry or adaptive level. The same was true of the technology
leadership category coding of the interview responses. However, the Ethics, Equity and
Diversity category was not represented in the interview responses.
In regards to the school culture coding analysis, reference was made to all of the school
culture codes during the follow-up interviews, while the open-ended survey question responses
referenced all of the codes except evidence of subcultures. In both cases, internal barriers and
communication were mentioned most often. The coding results for technology leadership and
school culture themes were, in fact, quite similar between the open-ended survey questions and
the interview responses.
For the final round of coding related to information worlds theory, there were more
noticeable differences between the results of the open-ended survey question analysis and the
interview response analysis. While the responses to the survey questions referred to the concepts
of boundaries (n=58), information behavior (n=49), and social norms (n=48) with similar

97

frequencies; the interview responses referenced social norms (n=84) almost 1.5 times as
frequently as the next closest concept: social types (n=54). Further, some of the sub-categories
for the five information worlds concepts appeared in the open-ended survey question responses,
but not in the interview responses, and vice versa. These findings, my conclusions, and
recommendations for future research are discussed in Chapter Five.

CHAPTER 5
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
In this study, I collected 97 complete survey responses, and conducted follow-up
interviews with 19 of those participants. In Chapter Four, I introduced my findings, which were
based on the analysis of both the survey and interview data. In this chapter, I will expand upon
that analysis by discussing the findings in more detail, and by providing some conclusions based
on those findings.
5.1 Restatement of the Problem
In Empowering Learners: Guidelines for School Library Programs, the AASL calls for
the school librarian to be a leader in the school.





    Leadership is

integral to developing a successful 21stcentury school library program. As information literacy
and technology skills become central to learning, the school librarian must lead the way in
building 21stcentury skills throughout the school environment (AASL, 2009, p. 26).

This

statement suggests that, not only do school librarians need to be capable of providing leadership
in the traditional area of information literacy, but also in the area of technological literacy.
The prevalence of technology in the K-12 classroom backs up this leadership directive
from the AASL, as does the nationwide move toward digital learning resources as the norm for
teaching and learning (Leading Education by Advancing Digital, n.d.), and for personalizing
instruction (Selwyn, 2011; The Brookings Institution, 2011; West, 2013). As the school-based
professional possessing the training and expertise outlined by the AASL in the roles of
instructional partner, teacher, and information specialist, the school librarian is positioned to
carry out the leadership role in a manner that serves the technological needs of 21st century

99

learners and teachers (AASL, 2009). With this in mind, I focused on the following research
questions during the course of this case study:
RQ1: To what extent do school librarians perceive they are prepared to lead digital
learning resource integration?
a. What do they perceive as their areas of strength?
b. In which areas do they perceive they need improvement?
RQ2: How does the organizational culture of the school affect school librarian leadership
enactment?

5.2 Review of the Method

This study focused on K-12 public school librarians in the state of Florida. I used an
established technology leadership survey instrument and semi-structured follow-up interviews to
collect data from the participants. The survey was distributed electronically through professional
email lists (LM_NET and AASLForum), the Florida Association for Media in Education
(FAME), and a contact at the Florida Department of Education. Ninety-seven Florida school
librarians completed the survey in its entirety. Nineteen of those participants followed up with
interviews that lasted between 12 and 30 minutes each. Each interview was recorded and then
transcribed.
I used statistical analysis for questions 1-92, and provisional and magnitude coding for
questions 93-95 of the Technology Leadership Survey. Questions 1-20 provided demographic
data, which was reported in frequencies. Results from questions 21-92 were used to calculate
Technology Leadership Scores, which were then analyzed for possible associations with the
demographic data, where appropriate.

100

Both the open-ended survey questions (93-95) and the interview transcripts were coded in
four rounds. Each was first coded for Technology Leadership codes, followed by School Culture
codes, and Information Worlds codes. A final round of coding was performed to ensure
continuity. During the Technology Leadership coding, a magnitude code associated with the
established leadership levels

not involved, entry, adaptive, or transformative was also

assigned to each coded response. The complete codebook is available in Appendix C.
5.3 Discussion of Findings
In the following sections, I will discuss my findings and how these findings relate to my
research questions.
5.3.1 RQ1: To what extent do school librarians perceive they are prepared to lead digital
learning resource integration?
a.

What do they perceive as their areas of strength?

b.

In which areas do they perceive they need improvement?

My first research question asked about the extent to which school librarians felt that they
were prepared to lead digital learning resource integration, and about areas that were perceived
as strengths or areas for improvement.

(AASL, 2010, p. 11). This technologically integrative leadership role was reflected

in the NBPTS Library Media Standards, First Edition, which formed the basis of the
Technology Leadership Survey utilized in this research (Coatney et al., 2001).
The majority of participants in the survey self-reported that they were prepared to act as
technology leaders within their schools. When asked to rate their participation in response to the
statement,

71.1% of respondents indicated that they were substantially or fully involved. The overall
technology scores of participants supported this response, where 96.9% scored in the adaptive or
transformative range. The adaptive level signifies that the librarian is acting as a technology
facilitator, which indicates enough familiarity with technology to not only use it (as with entry
level), but to understand and be able to explain it to others. The transformative level signifies a

(Florida Center for Instructional Technology, 2015). In both cases, an integration of technology
beyond its use simply as an instructional aide is implied. This self-reported ability to act as a
technology leader suggests that, in cases where the school librarian is not fully involved in
technological integration, factors beyond their own preparedness are at play. Embedded within
this general readiness to act as technology leaders, however, there were distinct areas of strength,
as well as room for improvement.

fell into the transformative range in three of the nine NBPTS categories: Administering the
Library Media Program (n=78, or 80%), Knowledge of Teaching and Learning (73, or 75%);
and Ethics, Equity and Diversity (69, or 71%). Additionally, the number of participants who fell

102

into the entry level range in these three categories was less than five. These categories are
reflective of the four traditional roles of the school librarian: program administrator, information
specialist, instructional partner, and teacher (AASL, 2009). The AASL defines the role of
program administrator as follows:
As program administrator, the school librarian ensures that all members of the learning
community have access to resources that meet a variety of needs and interests. The
implementation of a successful school library program requires the collaborative
development of the program mission, strategic plan, and policies, as well as the effective
management of staff, the program budget, and the physical and virtual spaces. To
augment information resources available to the learning community, the school librarian
works actively to form partnerships with stakeholders and sister organizations at local
and global levels. The school librarian also addresses broader educational issues with
other educators in the building, at the district level, and at the professional association
level. (AASL, 2009, p. 31)
As program administrator, a school librarian is expected to understand the administration of the
school library program and to do so with an eye toward ethics, equity, and diversity, as indicated
by the directive to provide access to a variety of resources that meet diverse needs. Program
management and administration is also listed as Standard 5 of the ALA/AASL Standards for
Initial Preparation of School Librarians, which calls for school librarians to possess skills in
collection development, strategic planning, and business management, and to enact those skills
in a professionally ethical manner (AASL, 2010). The survey results indicate that participants
have internalized the program administrator role and feel comfortable leading in that role.
School librarians must also employ ethics, equity, and diversity skills in their role as

(AASL,

teaching and learning such that collaboration with the classroom teacher can become an
established and ongoing practice. In the closely related role of teacher, a school librarian
empowers students to become critical thinkers, enthusiastic readers, skillful researchers, and

One possible explanation

for the number of responses coded as entry level is that participants might be involved in
transformative activities, but not have described them in terms that sound transformative. For
example, Brittany said,
I feel like %& '()& *'& +,- ,./0(01 %'&0& 1+230& -&(,.45 %.*' *'& 6'17.8(, /++97 (4- (,,

technology and databases that Brittany referred to. It could be that Brittany was referring to just
making students and teachers aware of their existence (entry level), facilitating the use of these
tools through guided instruction (adaptive level), or practicing full integration of the resources by
creating lessons that employ higher order skills to complete (transformative level).
Participants also did not discuss activities falling into these three categories with great
frequency in either the open-ended survey question responses or the interviews, despite
indications (from the technology leadership survey category score calculations) that these were
their areas of greatest strength. Instead, the most frequently discussed topics were Integrating
Instruction, Leading Innovation through Library Media Program, and Reflective Practice.
However, the frequency with which something was discussed may not be directly proportional to
strength in that area. By the same token, just because school librarians possess strengths in the
areas of Knowledge of Teaching and Learning; Administering the Library Media Program; and
Ethics, Equity and Diversity does not mean that those are the categories on which most of their
time is spent. This disconnect is consistent with prior research. Elkins, Luetkemeyer, & Mardis
(2014) reported that the roles that school librarians felt were most important were not necessarily
the roles that they were able to enact regularly. It would be natural for participants to tend
toward discussing areas in which they spend most of their time, and perhaps that is the case here.
5.3.1.2.1 Integration and innovation. When participants did talk about Integrating
Instruction and Leading Innovation through Library Media Program, their responses indicated
either that they were very involved and acting as leaders in technological integration, or that they

105

wanted that opportunity. Meredith says,   

    

pushing the envelope to use the next technology, or to do something really cool with the teachers
   

   Some respondents provided more detail as to what their

involvement entailed:
I am very involved with working with students with technology in the media center. I
teach a series of classes on using the internet to improve their learning. I can do this
because I teach or work with students in the media center three days each week. (Survey
Respondent 23)
Still others expressed frustration at how the level of technology integration within their schools
and programs hindered them from enacting their technology leadership skills. Survey
Respondent 85 said Instruction and usage of technology tools with students is, as I see [it] the
greatest current need in our school Survey Respondent 20 echoed   !" Technology
integration continues to be the last issue addressed within the classroom and my program.
Sometimes participants expressed both the ability to enact their technology leadership skills and
the desire to do more:
I do get the opportunity to work with students one-to-one and solve detailed and
complicated tech and tech integration issues, but I'd love the opportunity to share my vast
knowledge with a larger pool of individuals. (Survey Respondent 87)
Another situation that often emerged from the data was the full involvement of many participants
in all five of the professional roles:
Along with managing the library and providing weekly information skills lessons for
grades 3-5 and story time for the primary students, I am the tech coordinator for our
school. I am expected to take a leading role in tech[nology] instructional strategies,
trouble shoot equipment provide instruction, produce the TV news, manage all of the
computer labs and facilitate all online testing. I work to keep all of the computers
working so the teachers can rely on them. (Survey Respondent 80)
Responses of this nature display the full potential of the school librarian as outlined by the AASL
and the NBPTS standards.

106

5.3.1.2.2 Reflective practice. One caveat regarding the Reflective Practice code:
instances where responses indicated that the respondent would like to do something in the future,
or where the participant talked about the school library profession as a whole, were coded as
Reflective Practice. These items also could have been coded secondarily in some cases into one
of the other nine categories, but I chose to code them only as Reflective Practice, as they did not
describe currently occurring practices. As such, passages coded as Reflective Practice were not
indicative of the existing technology leadership skills of the participants, which was the focus of
this first research question.
As the second most frequent code from the qualitative data, however, it is clear that
participants were engaged in the reflective process, as illustrated by this statement from Survey
Respondent 52:
I would like to collaborate with more teachers, and also encourage the school to
purchase more technology (laptops, iPad minis, etc.) so that I can instruct teachers on
how best to use them and also use those devices as a stepping stool for more
collaborations.
Many participants expressed similar desires, but there were also a few who expressed goals for
the profession as a whole:
The role of the media specialist is vital to the success of the school. It is important that
administrators understand the difference in the responsibility of classroom teachers and
school library media specialists. It is also the responsibility of the media specialist to be
proactive in promoting his/her program and being sure the "powers-that-be" fully
understand the role and the impact a strong library program has on student achievement.
(Survey Respondent 91)

the first element in Standard 1 (AASL, 2010, p. 1).

Standard 1.1 calls for the following skillset:
Candidates are knowledgeable of learning styles, stages of human growth and
development, and cultural influences on learning. Candidates assess learner needs and
design instruction that reflects educational best practice. Candidates support the learning
of all students and other members of the learning community, including those with
diverse learning styles, physical and intellectual abilities and needs. Candidates base
twenty-first century skills instruction on student interests and learning needs and link it to
the assessment of student achievement. (AASL, 2010, p. 1)
Despite the importance placed on knowledge of learning and learning styles by both the NBPTS
and AASL, responses in the Knowledge of Learners category reflected the highest number of
participants in the entry level range (21, or 22%), and the lowest number of participants in the
transformative range (18, or 19%). This finding indicates that participants are less comfortable
with their knowledge of learners than in any other category of the survey. This finding was
supported by the qualitative data. The Knowledge of Learners code appeared only three times in
the open-ended survey and interview data, each also coded as entry level. In each instance, a

There are a few possible explanations for this result. Certified school librarians do not



requirements do not include an undergraduate degree in teacher

education. Additionally, school librarians may or may not spend time in the classroom before
moving into the library, and not all school librarians teach regularly when they do secure a
position in the library. Unfortunately, the survey instrument did not ask for    
degree specialization. Information regarding whether or not the participant had been a classroom
teacher was collected, and 74 (76%) respondents indicated that they had spent time in the
classroom. However, the amount of time spent in the classroom before moving to the library
might also be a factor in the number of participants who fell into the entry level range in the
Knowledge of Learners category, and the survey instrument did not capture that information.
The remaining six technology leadership survey categories fell somewhere in the middle,
with the large majority of scores distributed more evenly between the adaptive and
transformative levels. This trend suggests that there may be additional factors at play that hinder

5.3.2.1 Barriers. When I began coding for school culture, I discovered a trend in the
discourse that was not captured by any of the codes in my existing school culture codebook.
However, the frequency with which barriers to enactment of technological leadership emerged as
a theme in the open-ended survey questions and interviews necessitated that I add two codes to
capture the trend: internal barriers and external barriers. Taken together, these two topics made
up 44.5% of the data analysis. It is possible that these barriers provide some explanation for why

109

participants seem confident in their ability to act as technology leaders, but are often unable to do
so.
5.3.2.1.1 Internal barriers. The first code that I added was internal barriers, which I
  

   arriers from within the school/district, e.g. financial

constraints/scheduling/time Participants spoke most often about issues of time and staffing, but
also about budget, all of which figure prominently in the following quote from the open-ended
survey questions:
This year I am currently teaching two intensive reading classes, taking an online class to
be qualified, and in January will also be teaching an art class in addition to my primary
role as Media Specialist. Some years I have had a lot of other roles added, such as
school website, morning show, school newsletter, tech duties and various other things
that came up. Several years ago the media positions in this district were on the table as a
possible position to cut to save money on the budget. We were eventually kept, but I
picked up additional duties each year to compensate. We do have a full-time noninstructional tech specialist at the school. It is very difficult to [do] anything effectively
when you are pulled in so many directions. The media positions were looked at for a
couple of years, but seem to be off the block now. (Survey Respondent 32)

everal participants. These themes are

certainly prevalent in the literature. Instructional personnel, including school librarians, report
time constraints as a primary barrier to digital integration (Carlson & Reidy, 2004; Recker,
Dorward, & Nelson, 2004; Hanson & Carlson, 2005; Perrault, 2007; Maull, Saldivar, & Sumner,
2010; Ed. schools, 2013). Even when they do find time, there is often a lack of understanding of
the role that the school librarian can play in that integration, and the school librarian position is
sometimes even replaced outright by an instructional technology specialist (Johnston, 2015).
Hartzell (2001) identified this problem of understanding in his work on school reform:
Because libraries and library media specialists are not thought of as integrated
components of quality teaching and learning experiences, they are not visibly identified
with the central core of school activities, nor are they thought of as integral to school

110

success. Consequently, they receive less recognition, their influence is often less than it
ought to be, and they are much more vulnerable to being ignored. (The School Library
Media Specialist's Job, para 3)
In many cases, study participants indicated that there was no school librarian on staff in schools
within their district, because administrators had complete authority to make the decision whether
or not they wanted a school librarian at their school, and preferred to fill the vacancy with a
different type of position, such as a technology specialist.

budgetary constraints, which was a concern not only iterated in this study of Florida school
librarians, but also nationwide (Leachman & Mai, 2013).
Participants also frequently mentioned issues with technology availability, age, and
infrastructure , often tied to budgetary constraints, as in the following example: One of the
greatest issues in our district is lack of funding so much of our equipment is antiquated and
doesn't always work leading to LOTS of frustration# (Survey Respondent 68). The National
Education Association (NEA) recognized these problems in 2008 in a policy brief entitled
Technology in Schools: The Ongoing Challenge of Access, Adequacy and Equity. The NEA
brief articulated eight years ago two of the still ongoing issues mentioned by participants in this

111

Lack of proper training was also a concern, and was often intertwined with issues of time.
This lack of training was also mentioned in the literature (Johnson et al., 2013), and is illustrated
by the following excerpt from the interviews:
I can't think of a specific instance but have to say that generally my frustration as a
technology leader is the lack of time to properly train teachers on the technology
resources we have available for their use. We are rarely given any time to demonstrate
and have EFFECTIVE training for the multitude of hardware and software we have
purchased. (Pam)
Many of these barriers hinged around a lack of administrative support, as illustrated by this
statement from the open-ended survey responses:
Our current administration is very poor. Things we have been able to do in the past are
no longer allowed. For example, there are fifty laptops (two laptop labs) on campus
which we used to use with students and have available for teachers to use. Our current
administration will only allow these to be used as testing computers for FAIR testing and
the end of year testing. (Survey Respondent 40)
Lack of administrative support presents a problem, as the principal plays a key role in
implementing and sustaining change (Billig, Sherry, & Havelock, 2005; Hew & Brush, 2007),
and makes budget and staffing decisions (Church, 2010). Further, when school librarians are
able to establish strong relationships with their administrators, school library programs are more
effective, and can contribute to student achievement (AASL, 2011). One possible explanation
for the restrictive actions of administration could, again, be related to a lack of understanding on
their part of what school librarians are trained to do. This lack of understanding has been
documented in the literature (Shannon, 2009; Church, 2010).
Finally, poor district decision-making and active prohibition from involvement in those
decisions was of concern for many participants:
They tend to have conversations about technology at the district level, or when they talk

the prohibition from participation in these decision-making activities.

The LEAD Commission (2013) listed resistance to change as a primary concern in the move
toward digital education, and Evans (1996) wrote extensively about how staff buy-in was key to
the success of any new school initiative. With the entrenchment of school culture, convincing
stakeholders of the necessity of change is critical. Without stakeholder support, the proposed
change will fail as the existing school culture reestablishes itself, and things return to the norm

113

established by that culture (Evans, 1996). Sometimes, though, it is not about resistance to
change, but about a misunders  

This problem with misunderstanding could be related to the lack of training discussed earlier in

appearance several times, both in the open-ended survey responses and in the interviews. Megan

understanding of the current environment (Molly). Comments on standardized testing tended
less toward problems with implementation, and more toward how the testing initiative stymied
educational activities: 5The constant and oppressive focus on testing impedes much of the
process of teaching using technology 6Survey Respondent 85). The pressure created by
constant assessment and accountability measures has been the cause of much public debate.

114

Researchers such as Alfie Kohn (2000) and Stephen Krashen (2014) argue stringently against the
volume of standardized testing, often citing the lack of any real evidence that a focus on testing
improves student learning, and what they see as wasted tax dollars that could be put to use
elsewhere in education. In fact, the advent of Common Core caused a 57% increase in the
testing and assessment market in just three years (Schools Matter, 2014).
As for the Digital Divide issue, many participants mentioned limits to access for students
at home.

Of course, the Digital Divide

problem is not limited to Florida; it is an international issue (Ragnedda & Muschert, 2013).
Unfortunately, this is not a problem that the school librarian is equipped to address singlehandedly.
These barriers discussed by survey and interview participants appear to corroborate Hew

that fell into this category revolved around the ways that school librarians communicate and
collaborate with teachers, students, and administration.
5.3.2.2.1 Communication. Communication was the second most frequently appearing
code in the school culture coding round. Participants talked about five general activities, which
often overlapped: dissemination of information to stakeholders, teaching/training stakeholders,
advocating for technology use and integration, facilitating or supporting the use of technology,
and providing input to administration. In the following example, you can see elements of
dissemination, training, advocacy, and facilitation:
Really being the facilitator, going out and finding different things and coming back and
sharing it with people. Finding that one or two people in the building who can become

This quote speaks to the multiple roles that school librarians are expected to fulfill, not only by
their professional association (AASL, 2009), but also by their stakeholders in actual practice.
School librarians are explicitly directed  communicate with students and classroom teachers
in order to administer the duties inherent in those diverse roles (AASL, 2009, p. 28).
Sometimes, participants spoke more explicitly about the five roles. Responses often
talked about how facilitating the use of technology enables and enhances educational goals, and
about the long-term implications of facilitating learning. From the survey data, for example:
We incorporate the use of technology in our library media program to help inspire our students
to be lifelong learners. We encourage our students to create content based on what they are

Acting in the capacity

of facilitator in these examples means blending rolesacting as a teacher, as an information
specialist, and as an instructional partner all at the same time, as indicated in the professional
guidelines:
As a guide, risk-taker, expert at learning how to learn, partner in meeting instructional
goals and curriculum development, and information specialist, the school librarian must
work to create an environment where everyone is a teacher, learner, producer, and
contributor. Patrons of the school library are now collaborators who interact with
resources and with each other. Technology is woven throughout this framework,
influencing every aspect of teaching and learning. (AASL, 2009, p. 14).
Despite some participants having experienced barriers to providing input regarding
technology decisions, many participants seem to have established themselves as information
specialists whose input is valued by their administration. This is evident in the ways in which
they described how they provide input to their stakeholders, and in how their input is solicited.

principal came to me and asked me for a recommendation on websites that we could use to
better certain skills in the classroom (Haley). Some even mentioned serving on committees at
the district level that made more high-level decisions.
5.3.2.2.2 Collaboration. Many of the responses that were coded as communication were
also coded as collaboration. This is a logical association, as collaboration involves
communication. There was far less discussion about collaboration overall, though, than about
communication. Responses coded as collaboration fell into three main categories: providing

117

resources and support during lessons, general collaboration with stakeholders, and things that
inhibit the ability to collaborate (which also overlaps with the section on barriers).
Participants talked most often about how they provided resources and support during

blending of the roles of instructional partner, teacher, and information specialist. Sometimes,
however, the desire to fulfill those roles was not enough to enable collaboration. Several factors
emerged as barriers to collaboration. As mentioned previously, a misunderstanding of the role of

Another previously mentioned barrier that came into play in regards to collaboration was

Being on a fixed schedule limits the time I have to collaborate and plan with classroom

teachers on incorporating technology with their instruction Survey Respondent 64) were two
responses that referenced time as a mitigating factor. The issue of time as a barrier to teacherlibrarian collaboration is certainly not new (Montiel-Overall, 2008), and continues to be a factor
(Latham, Julien, Witte & Gross, 2015). Administrative support, on the other hand, has been
associated positively with teacher-librarian collaboration (Morris & Packard, 2007), and
administration is another topic that came up frequently during the survey and interview
responses.

118

5.3.2.3 Administration. In responses that referenced administration, participants talked
mainly about administrators who either enabled their ability to act as technology leaders, or
hindered that ability. On the one hand, many participants felt that they had significant
administrative support. Survey Respondent   I have a very supportive administration
team who values me as a technology leader and the response from Survey Respondent 57 goes
a step further:
I have a principal who is a complete supporter and advocate of school libraries. She
believes libraries and information are the heart of the school and supports the collection
of resources, the building of new technology, and [the] ability for me to go out in the
school and support teachers.
Even when administration is supportive, however, it is not necessarily because school leaders
grasp the role that the school librarian plays within the school. Bev indicated repeatedly that she
was allowed to do a great deal both within and outside the school and had more than sufficient
access to resources, but still said 

participants also reported feeling stymied by their principals. In reference to her responses to the
Technology Leadership survey questions, one participant had this to say: Most of the ones I
selected as 'not my job' literally are the job of our Tech[nology] Specialist. My administration

1985; Rovegno & Bandhauer, 1997; Carrington, 1999; Smyth, 2007).
5.3.2.4 Behaviors. Three school culture codes fell into the category of behaviors:
conformity, autonomy, and evidence of subcultures.
5.3.2.4.1 Conformity. In every instance in which participants discussed conformity, it
was in terms of doing what was expected by administration, both at the school and district level.
Responses included discussions about how technology was an expectation of the school librarian
and the reverse. Where it was not an expectation, participants very often indicated that they were

participants expressed the desire to enact their

technology leadership role, they often felt constrained:
I would [like to] be more involved in sharing information with teachers concerning all
aspects of technology. The barrier is that we have a part time tech[nology] person, and
they have been selected by the administration to handle that aspect of technology, and
they are not interested in having help. (Survey Respondent 23)
Conversely, many participants also talked about experiences where technology leadership was
deemed part of their job description and they were expected to fulfill that role:

120

In my role as the media specialist in a district that is moving towards one-to-one device,
it is the expectation that in my role, I will be a tech[nology] guru. Be confident in all of
the available programs and that I'll be able to teach the teachers and the students how to
use those tools. (Survey Respondent 41)
Not only did participants express that these were expectations from administration, but also that
they expected to have to conform to these roles, and for their colleagues to do so as well. As
Caroline put it,     

to do more and the apparent acceptance of themselves in a technology leadership role is
reflective of the survey results, which indicated that school librarians are prepared to enact the
role. The fact that it is not always deemed part of their job description, and is often parceled out
to other stakeholders, could be one reason that they are not necessarily able to do so.
5.3.2.4.2 Autonomy. Another component of school culture that made an appearance less
frequently during data analysis was autonomy. In regards to autonomy, comments that were
made were exclusively about the administration of the library program, rather than the school as

previously discussed.
5.3.2.4.3 Evidence of subcultures. Sometimes, school stakeholders subvert the
administrative directive by establishing their own subculture. There was very little evidence of
this phenomenon in participant responses. In fact, in the three interviews where this theme
emerged, the discussion focused more on subcultures within the school librarian profession as a

welcome, school librarian involvement in schoolwide reading initiatives.
5.3.2.5 Buy-in. The final set of themes related to school culture has to do with
stakeholder buy-in. Cultural rituals and a shared set of standards, beliefs, and values can have an
influence on school stakeholders:

their information worlds. In this section, I will discuss the findings in the context of each of the
five components of information worlds theory, and tie those findings back to the theoretical
propositions.
5.3.3.1 Social norms. Social norms are what a group or society deems acceptable in
behavior and appearance. During the data analysis process, social norms were mentioned more
frequently than any other information worlds concept. Specifically, participants referred to

and how decisions about technology and technology positions were made.

123

Q1 1 R1 '

Two survey participants painted particularly clear pictures of the norms and expectations
for their positions, and why those norms acted as barriers to their ability to enact a leadership
role:
I would like to work on developing library programs and presentations/lessons for
classes. We are a one to one school, and as such, my media aide and I spend much of
our days troubleshooting for students who are having laptop issues. This is a huge
barrier to running a full media program since we are pulled for nearly 80% of our day
with technology issues. (Survey Respondent 31)
With the funding picture as it has been, I have been put into the classroom part of the day
for the last several years. Every year it has been in a different subject. Therefore, I
spend a lot of time learning the curriculum and trying to meet the requirements to be
considered highly qualified for that subject. As a result, my library program has take(n)
a lesser role in my day to day responsibilities. My new principal, says that she wants me
strictly in the role of media and technology next year. So the biggest barrier is the
additional roles that have been given to me over the last several years. (Survey
Respondent 32)
In both cases, the participant was expected to fulfill duties that conflicted with her ability to act
as a technology leader. In the first example, the participant was expected to spend the majority
of her time troubleshooting, rather than actually participating fully in the educative process. In
the second example, the participant was expected to act as a classroom teacher, thus prohibiting
her from acting in a capacity in which she can actively engage with technology integration, or
even with her media program.
With particular expectations for behavior there often come ways to reinforce that
behavior. In the following example, the participant expressed not only what the expected norm
was, but also how that expectation was specifically reinforced by excluding her from the
decision-making process:
An entire set of laptops for student use were given to a part time technology teacher who
does not feel that students in K-2 can do technology lessons at all. She does read alouds
with K-3 instead of technology of any kind. She only does EduTyping with 4th and 5th
graders -- absolutely no other technology instruction. Seriously. When I asked for those

Not all descriptions of social norms bore negative connotations, however. Meredith described a
situation in her district where the norm enabled her ability to act as a leader rather than inhibiting
her: We are extremely lucky in this district to have just about everything we need. I know that I

Here the school librarian has been asked, and is expected, to fulfill the

technology leadership role and to facilitate technology integration.
Other participants had similar things to say about the expectations for their role.
Responses centered around the two themes of facilitation and prohibition. In many cases,
participants talked positively about how social norms facilitated and enabled their ability to act
as technology leaders. In just as many cases, participants talked negatively about how
expectations hindered their ability to do so. These findings are reflective of the first theoretical
proposition:

members of the information world tend to resemble each other. (Burnett, personal
communication, March 25, 2014)
As members of the information world of the school, participants expressed a great deal of
similarity in the dichotomy of expectations and social norms of that world. Specifically, either
the norm was an expectation that the school librarian would fulfill the technology leadership role
outlined by the AASL (2009), or the norm prohibited that role fulfillment. Participants
expressed their feelings toward those expectations either negatively or positively.

Whether or not the tendency to be positive or negative is an individual trait or related
specifically to the information world in which each participant finds herself is unclear. It does

past 2 years, the

district has spent the Destiny Funds for us, and hasn't given us the option to purchase our own
digital media (Survey Respondent 65). Though these were similar situations where district
level personnel took the lead, the responses were quite different. Further support for the idea that
participant responses cannot be predicted based on a particular situation comes from Caroline:
I entered the whole profession many, many years ago because MS [media specialists]
were just quitting because they were so overwhelmed by automation and I remember
thinking to    ! "#$% &'( ! )#*"  ( &+# ,- ' ' ) $% #. "'/' 
automation.
Here, Caroline illustrates that school librarians react differently to the same situation. This may
seem common sense to some readers, but information worlds theory posits that individuals are
influenced by stimuli from their information worlds rather than internal stimuli. More research
is needed to explore whether or not school librarians inhabit smaller worlds within the larger
world of the school librarian and whether or not those small worlds are in opposition, as may be
the case here.
5.3.3.2 Social types. Social typing helps describe how people in a group or society are
perceived and defined by other people who occupy the same information world. Participants
mentioned social types about half as frequently as social norms, but social type responses were

126

often also coded as social norms. Just as with social norms, discussions of social type most often
centered around the role of the school librarian. Whereas the social norms discussions were
dichotomized between positive and negative role descriptions, the social types discourse was
almost exclusively positive. One noticeable tendency was for

  

to refer to

themselves with a specific title or label, whether or not that title was self-selected or explicitly

participants have internalized the roles associated with these titles. This tendency might also
provide one possible explanation for the positivity associated with the social types data. The
internalization of the role would indicate acceptance of, and possibly even agreement with, the
role.
Though this social typing is self-reported, it seems safe to assume that it is a reflection of

The assumption is further corroborated by Survey Respondent 8=; I have a very supportive

administration team who values me as a technology leader. Because these participants are
viewed by school stakeholders as a specific social type, and expected to meet the expectations of
that social type, they conform to the role as perceived.
5.3.3.3 Information behavior. Information behavior refers to how information is used
(or not used) in a group or in society. After social norms, information behavior was the most
frequently occurring information worlds theme. In fulfilling the role of information specialist,
the school librarian must locate and share information, as well as instruct other stakeholders in its
use (AASL, 2009). This role was reflected in participant responses regarding their information
behavior. They talked primarily about sharing and exchanging information with various
stakeholders, and about seeking information for themselves through professional development
activities. This quote from Survey Respondent 41 exemplifies the level of commitment to the

Participants spoke a great deal about the different ways that they share their expertise
with other stakeholders in the school and district. For example, Survey Respondent 50 talks

demonstrate an active dedication to information sharing. Some wrote about their interactions

I do my best to inform the students and staff at my school about the advancements of

information world tend to share an understanding of what behaviors, practices, and activities are

communication, March 25, 2014). Survey Respondent 64 understands what is expected of her in
regards to her information behavior, and she has adopted that behavior in order to meet those
expectations. Other participants expressed similar situations. For example,
School based DLLs receive monthly in-services and summer opportunities to continue
development of best practices for tech[nology] in teaching. Part of our service is sharing
what we learn with our site staff. The most tech-related growth and exploration I've done
is directly linked to this program. (Survey Respondent 17)
Survey Respondent 17 shares information with her staff, while also engaging in information
seeking behavior. She has been given the opportunity for professional development and she
seeks to better herself by doing so. Participant responses demonstrate a dedication to the role of
information specialist that is manifested in their information behavior.

129

5.3.3.4 Information value. Information value is the determination of how important
information is to a group or to society. Participants talked about information value primarily in
terms of how technology integration and training was important for teachers and students, and
how keeping up with their role as a technology leader was important for job security. Taking on
a technology leadership role means cultivating the     

teachers succeed as well (Everhart, Mardis, & Johnston, 2011, p. 13). Further, the AASL,
LEAD, and Project Tomorrow have all stressed the importance of 21st century skills instruction
for students (AASL, 2009; LEAD, 2013; Project Tomorrow, 2014a). Bonnie demonstrates an
understanding of her responsibility in imparting those skills when she says,
I believe that, from day one when I started working at my school, that the best thing that
happened was that I was able to get the students on computers and help them get the
skills they need: information skills for the 21st century.
        ows insight into the cultural value of technology. In a society where

virtually everything is computerized, she understands that it is important for her students to have
the skills they need to be able to participate in that society. Similarly, Ruthann recognizes the
  

     As we move forward, most education involves technology in

some way. If students are to succeed, they must be able to participate fully in the educational
experience, and that means achieving enough familiarity with educational technology to do so.
But imparting 21st century skills goes beyond simply preparing students for what they will
encounter in the classroom. It means exposing them to technology that will facilitate their
education beyond the classroom. Survey Respondent   I am also implanting a
makerspace in the library that will bring about new technologies that students might not
encounter throughout the school.

130

As technology leaders, school librarians must be up-to-date on the latest technology in
order to facilitate the learning and understanding that must occur in their students, as illustrated
by the following response:
For me it is not just a matter of job security (I am afraid I am a techie and perhaps too
much of that) but a job function that has become increasingly important as curriculum
goes digital and we are called to do our jobs digitally instead of physically. (Flora)
Here Flora recognizes the importance of the technological component, and her thoughts are
echoed by Brynn:

and taking all the training I can . . . My life kind of depends on it.
Although Brynn does not feel like she has a specific vision for her future as a school librarian,
she demonstrates an understanding of the cultural value of technology, and the importance of
remaining abreast of advancements in technology so that she can fulfill her leadership role. All

5.3.3.5 Boundaries. The exchange and sharing of societal resources may occur (or not
occur) at boundaries between information worlds, either between small worlds, or between a
small world and the lifeworld. A school is a small world that exists within the larger lifeworld of
society. Each of those is also an information world, and there are other information worlds
within the school. Teachers occupy one of those worlds, as do students and administrators.
School librarians may be part of those information worlds as well, but also removed from them

131

in some ways. Participants expressed this paradox in their responses coded as boundaries. They
talked a great deal about how both their job descriptions and bureaucratic decision-making acted
as boundaries, as well as how they were able to permeate those boundaries and interact with
other stakeholders. For example, The third and present school [that  worked in] has a
technology specialist. They do most of all the repairs etc., but at times we've been without this
position so it fell on to me to do Survey Respondent 86). T

able to permeate the boundary between job descriptions and enact that role. Conversely, Survey

This participant is unable to permeate the information worlds of the district and state to have
input into textbook purchases, but is able to participate in the information world within her
school to help make some lower level decisions regarding technology purchases. She also
expresses her frustration at not being included in the information world of teachers so that she
can more fully enact her instructional partner and teaching roles. This constant push and pull
between worlds is supported by the fifth and final theoretical proposition:
Information worlds do not exist in isolation from one another, but interact with each other
in a variety of ways. Multiple information worlds are both connected to and separated
from each other by the boundaries between them; information and associated values and
behaviors may or may not move easily across these boundaries. Interactions between
worlds may result in either reinforcement and agreement or conflict. (Burnett, personal
communication, March 25, 2014)
5.4 Conclusion
This research was exploratory in nature and cannot be generalized to either the national
or international population of school librarians. Participants in this study resided and worked as
school librarians in the state of Florida only. The study used both quantitative and qualitative
methods to collect data electronically and via phone, and relied on participant self-reporting. As
such, some measure of bias is to be expected, whether that bias is under- or over-reporting their
skill levels. Rather than offering generalizations about the school librarian population at large,
this dissertation provides applications to practice and preservice training, implications for
information worlds theory, and directions for future research.
5.4.1 Applications for Practice
Professional standards for school librarians call for them to act as technology leaders
(AASL, 2009), and the quantitative data for this study indicates that they are prepared to do so.
However, participants spoke a great deal about barriers to that type of leadership that occur in
actual practice.

lack of training opportunities, lack of administrative support, poor district decision-making and
prohibition from participation in the decision-making process, staff resistance and lack of buy-in,
government initiatives, and the Digital Divide. However, there are measures that can be taken to
help mitigate some of these factors in practice. Making inroads with other stakeholders in the
school in order to encourage buy-in may be as simple as finding just one teacher who is open and
willing to collaborate, and then to share the experience with others. This approach was
mentioned by a few participants (Caroline, Bev & Brittany). Another way to encourage buy-in
and decrease staff resistance is to impart a better understanding of the school
This can perhaps best be accomplished

were to be provided during the preservice years for both principals and teachers, it might prove
easier to gain administrative and faculty support in practice.
Another application for preservice training would be the issue that emerged from the
survey data regarding the Knowledge of Learners category. The NBPTS Library Media
Standards and the ALA/AASL Standards for Initial Preparation of School Librarians both call for

134

school librarians to develop and exhibit some level of mastery in this area (Coatney et al., 2001;
AASL, 2010). A larger focus on the components of learners and learning in preservice school
library programs might result in a shift toward more school librarians self-reporting at the
transformative level. This shift might also be evident to other stakeholders within the school,
particularly teachers, and might encourage collaboration, which might lead to the opportunity to
more fully enact the technology leadership role.
5.4.3 Implications for Information Worlds Theory
This research is the first project to examine the information worlds of school librarians.
It is important to note again that the study was exploratory in nature. As such, I have provided a
glimpse into these information worlds rather than constructing a complete image. What this
research has revealed is the following:
1. Social norms within the information worlds of school librarians are not universal, even
within a particular state (in this case, Florida), and may depend largely on the



culture and, more particularly, the administration.
2. Internalization and acceptance of the social type associated with the school librarian in a

that social type implies.
3. The information behavior of the school librarian is tied to the expectations of the social
type, and consists of a considerable amount of information sharing, as well as
information seeking and exchange.

well as the local bureaucracy.
The information worlds of the school librarians in this case study were influenced considerably
by the school culture where they worked. However, participant responses did not illuminate
their information worlds outside the school and district. More research is needed in this area, as
discussed in the final section below.
5.4.4 Directions for Future Research
Future directions for research include a larger national and/or international study
regarding the enactment of technology leadership skills of school librarians across the U.S. and
possibly the world. It would also be useful to design and implement training modules for
preservice teachers and administrators about the role of the school librarian, and then conduct a
study on the efficacy of that training in influencing the behavior of the trainees in practice. In
each of these studies, I would use the theoretical lens of school culture rather than treating it as a
concept. Although it can be viewed as either, I believe, based on the outcome of this project, that
it would be more valuable to conduct the proposed research using school culture theory. Doing
so would involve a careful consideration of organizational culture theories and their applicability

suggests the possibility of rich data with the potential to provide valuable insight into the impact
of school culture on recent graduates as they enter the education profession. In fact, results in the
current research focused primarily on school culture and provided less information about
information worlds than I had hoped.

136

This research has revealed that the many facets of information worlds theory make it
more feasible to study on its own. As such, I would like to conduct more extensive research into
the information worlds of school librarians in the future, which would possibly involve
observation and extensive interviews with not only school librarians, but also those they come
into contact with. I would also like to continue to explore the role of the individual in
information worlds theory. Although Burnett (2015) has begun to delve into this role, I believe
that practical research will provide a richer picture and help to expand the theory.
The results of this study suggest that, while most school librarians feel prepared to serve
as digital learning leaders, there are a variety of barriers to their performance of that particular
task. S  

When school librarians know how to navigate their school cultures (i.e., conforming to the
standards, beliefs, and values of that culture), and when they are able to permeate the boundaries
of multiple information worlds (i.e., the information world of teachers and the information world
of administrative personnel), they are able to demonstrate their value and to help the stakeholders
within the school understand the responsibilities of the school librarian as teacher, instructional
partner, program administrator, information specialist, and leader. In turn, developing this

Information Worlds of School Librarians as Digital Learning Leaders at Florida State University.
Thank you for completing the digital survey and for agreeing to participate in this interview
aimed at Florida K-12 school librarians.

I am asking you to take part in a research study because I am trying to learn more about the
perception of technology leadership skills among Florida school librarians as Florida makes the
move to digital learning resources. You will be asked to answer a set of questions about this
topic and you may be asked to clarify answers to the open-ended questions from the survey you
already completed. This interview should take about 15-20 minutes. With your permission, I
would like to audio record this interview so that I can refer to the recording later for clarification
of the notes I will be taking. You have the right to review or edit the audio recording, and it will
be erased upon completion of this research. Your participation is voluntary, and you can stop the
interview at any time without any penalty to you.

You will not benefit directly from participating in this research study, and you will not be paid
for participating in this research study.

Your personal information and any data from this research will be stored digitally in a password
protected file. Audio recordings will be stored in a password protected phone. Confidentiality
can be protected only to the extent permitted by law. Again, all data will be destroyed upon
completion of the research.
