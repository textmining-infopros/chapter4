Abstract
This thesis demonstrates how the book industry shaped knowledge formation by mediating
the selection, expression, marketing, distribution and commercialization of mathematical
knowledge. It examines how the medium of print and the practices of book production
affected the development of mathematical culture in England and Canada during the
nineteenth and early twentieth century.
Chapter one introduces the field of book history, and discusses how questions and methods
arising from this inquiry might be applied to the history of mathematics.
Chapter two looks at how nineteenth century printing technologies were used to reproduce
mathematics. Mathematical expressions were more difficult and expensive to produce using
moveable type than other forms of content; engraved diagrams required close collaboration
between author, publisher and engraver.
Chapter three examines how editorial decision-making differed at book publishers compared
to mathematical journals and general science journals. Each medium followed different
editorial processes and applied distinct criteria in decision-making about what to publish.

Daniel MacAlister, Macmillan and Company’s reader of science, reviewed mathematical
manuscripts submitted to the company and influenced which ones would be published as
books.
Chapter four explores economic aspects of mathematical book publication. Macmillan and
Company’s mathematical authors profited from the successful publication of textbooks. Both
author and publisher augmented their prestige, influence and image through successful
author-publisher liaison.
Nation building and the definition of a national identity are explored in chapter five as factors
influencing the development of mathematical publishing. It is shown how the capacity to
print mathematics locally was important to the development of a Canadian culture of
mathematics. John Charles Fields’ production of the Proceedings of the International
Mathematical Congress, Toronto, 1924 is identified as a major turning point within this
development.
Chapter six concludes that publishers, not just mathematical authors, shaped nineteenth
century British mathematics. While an increase in mathematical book production during the
nineteenth century stimulated popular engagement with mathematics, British publishers
perpetuated conservative mathematical values through the mass production of textbooks. In
distributing these textbooks to domestic and foreign markets, publishers perpetuated a
moribund image of mathematics inside and outside Britain.

Acknowledgments
Many memorable life events have occurred during my time engaged in doctoral study.
Marriages were made, children were born, and deaths recorded. My wonderful husband and
son, John and Colin, have enriched my life enormously and supported this project. My
grandparents Frederick and Mary Barton always believed in the transformative power of
education and I hope the present work would have made them proud.
I am also grateful to the organizations that furnished the necessities of life while I completed
this project. I was supported along the way by a Canada Graduate Scholarship from the
Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC). The Michael Smith
Foreign Study Supplement (SSHRC funded), as well as travel grants from the Institute for the
History and Philosophy of Science and Technology at the University of Toronto, enabled me
to spend a significant amount of time in England completing archival research. I am very
grateful to have benefitted from financial support that made researching and writing this
dissertation both possible and enjoyable.
I also acknowledge the people I have met along the way, from whose work and mentorship I
have learned much. Trevor Levere, Nicholas Griffin and June Barrow-Green provided
guidance and inspiration when I was just getting a handle on my project, as well as detailed
advice on the final product. In her role as Librarian at Massey College, Marie Korey opened
up the world of ancient books and printing when she allowed me to volunteer and later, work
in the Robertson Davies print shop. Both Massey College and the Institute for the History
and Philosophy of Science and Technology allowed me to go on historical and intellectual
adventures through the many wonderful people I connected with through these institutions.
To my supervisor Craig Fraser, thank you for being my guide to the history of mathematics.
Before coming to Toronto you recommended I read Joan Richard’s Mathematical Visions.
This book continues to be an inspiration and a guide for me in my academic work.
Librarians are often the gateway to the knowledge that historians seek. Several librarians and
archivists assisted me while I completed research during my doctorate. Alysoun Sanders
(Archivist, Palgrave-Macmillan), John Shoesmith (Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library),
Adam Green (Wren Library, Trinity College), Catherine Harpham and Anne Barrett
iv

(Imperial College London), Dan Mitchell (Special Collections, University College London),
Carl Spadoni and Kenneth Blackwell (Bertrand Russell Research Center) and Loryl
MacDonald (University Archivist, University of Toronto) all assisted me. Some of this
assistance was for research I completed on the nineteenth century British mathematician
William Kingdon Clifford, which I still hope will one day come to publishable light. I
probably would have asked Richard Landon (formerly of the Thomas Fisher Rare Book
Library) for his opinion on the present work if he were still alive.
To my friends and my extended family too numerous to name, thank you for your
encouragement and patience. To my parents, Ann Marie and James, and to my parents-in-law
Hilary and Peter, your support has in so many ways made it possible for our family to
continue to fulfill our dreams and goals. I dedicate this work to you.

Note to the Reader
References
I have adhered to a version of the Chicago Manual of Style author-date system for the
references in this work. For published sources, the author and date of publication are
specified, e.g. (Adams 1844). If referring to a specific section of text, the author and date is
followed by a page number, or span of pages, for example (Adams 1844: 187) or (Adams
1844: 20-21). If the author has more than one publication in a given year listed in the
bibliography, the author and date may be further distinguished by the addition of a letter, as
in (De Morgan 1842a). If a book has two authors or editors, the name of both is given, or if
there are more than two authors, then the lead author is specified followed by ‘et al’.
Anonymous works appear under the authorship ‘Anonymous’ in the bibliography, and cited
using ‘Anon.’ in place of the author’s name, e.g. (Anon. 1856: 5).
References to archival materials are given in the footnotes, with the name of the collection
and the accession number. The name and location of all archives consulted are listed in the
bibliography.
Records for Macmillan and Company, a business about which this work makes many
comments, are held in several collections. There are documents from Macmillan held at
several locations in the United Kingdom: at the Palgrave-Macmillan head offices in
Basingstoke, in the Special Collections department at Reading University, and in the
Department of Manuscripts at the British Library. This thesis has made particularly extensive
use of the last of these collections. The Macmillan Archive (British Library Add MS 5478656035) comprises nineteenth and twentieth century correspondence and business records
from the publishing firm. In referring to the British Library’s collection of Macmillan Papers,
this thesis employs the acronym “MP” followed by an accession number, followed by either
a page reference or a date reference (for correspondence) to locate the source within a
volume of documents (e.g. MP 56016, p. 15). In official British Library citation style, the
same document would be cited as BL Ad. MS 56016, fo. 15.

Included in Macmillan's many extensive records of their publishing activity are a series of
production ledgers, the Editions Books, which list the number of books ordered, date of
publication, name of printer, type and date of paper ordered, etc., for each published title. The
first Editions Book covering Macmillan's publications to the year 1892 is held at the
Palgrave-Macmillan head office in Basingstoke. Subsequent volumes are found in the British
Library. For convenience sake, the British Library holds a CD-ROM copy of the first
Editions Book as a complement to their Macmillan collections, and it was the British
Library's CD-ROM copy consulted by this author. References to Macmillan’s first Editions
Book have been given in the footnotes by “Macmillan’s first Editions Book, Macmillan
Archive, British Library”, followed by a page number. However it should be noted that this
source is not officially a part of the British Library's manuscript collections, and so the CDROM is not listed in their catalogue or in the records of manuscripts. By bringing attention to
this I hope to alleviate any confusion for the reader wishing to locate this source.

Currency
Occasionally this thesis makes remarks about amounts or prices in British currency. Prior to
decimalization, one pound was divided into 20 shillings, and each shilling into 12 pence.
When money is discussed, s. is used to denote shillings, and d. pence. For example, one
pound, seven shillings and eleven pence is written £1 7s. 11d.

Introduction

And from my pillow, looking forth by light
Of moon or favouring stars, I could behold
The antechapel where the statue stood
Of Newton with his prism and silent face,
The marble index of a mind for ever
Voyaging through strange seas of Thought, alone.

Wordsworth (Wordsworth 1888)

1. Mathematical books
In his book Begriffsschrift (Conceptual notation, 1879), Gottlob Frege created a logical language
he hoped to apply towards forming a rigorous theoretical foundation for mathematics. Using his
language of pure thought, Frege imagined giving greater rigor and formality to mathematical
proofs, formulating definitions for the operations of arithmetic and the idea of number. Frege’s
Begriffsschrift is often cited as the work that began the logicist movement in the philosophy of
mathematics (Van Heijenoort 1967; Nagel and Newman 1958: 42-3; Tiles 1989: 138-9).
Legends surrounding the book frequently include the detail that Frege’s Begriffsschrift was a
difficult publishing venture, as were Frege’s later books.
Frege’s conceptual writing was two-dimensional in nature, spreading across a page both
vertically and horizontally. When mathematician and logician Ernst Schröder reviewed the
Begriffsschrift he referred to Frege's notation as a “monstrous waste of space” (quoted in Vilkko
1998: 416). The criticism of Frege’s reviewers focused on both the impracticality of Frege’s
symbolism and the fact that Frege had seemingly ignored the work of the algebraic logicians,

2

who were his contemporaries (i.e. George Boole, William Stanley Jevons, Robert Grassmann
and Schröder himself).

1

In Schröder’s review of Frege’s book, he argued that the notation used by the algebraic logicians
was better than the one designed by Frege. When you compare the two, Schröder said, an
expression in algebraic form was easier to understand than the same statement made in Frege’s
two-dimensional language. Schröder used the following example. The argument “a is true or b is
true but not both”, in Schröder’s algebraic expression can be written as: ab1 + a1b = 1 or ab +
a1b1 = 0 (where the subscript 1 stands for negation). Using conceptual writing, the Fregean
version of the same expression is the following (courtesy of Vilkko 1998: 415):

Figure 1 Frege’s conceptual writing (Source: Vilkko 1998: 415)
Despite its recognition today as a signal work in philosophy, the two-dimensional notation Frege
introduced in the Begriffsschrift was never adopted by logicians (Vilkko 1998: 416). Only one
symbol coined by Frege continues to be used today. Frege’s turnstile is a symbol that when
preceding a statement, implies that statement is a fact. Bertrand Russell and A. N. Whitehead
adopted this symbol and used it as Frege did, although they referred to the symbol as an assertion
sign (Vilkko 1998: 416).
There have been many suggestions by historians of science that mathematical books were
difficult or expensive to print and publish (Rider 1993; Secord 2009; Topham 2000a, 2000b).
Gottlob Frege's Begriffsschrift is one example of a nineteenth century mathematical book with an
intriguing history. The aim of the present study is to discover how the forming of mathematical
works into printed books might have presented unusual, unique or difficult challenges to the
printers who applied their technologies to reproduce them, and what special methods, if any,

1

When comparing his system with that of Peano’s, Frege wrote in 1896, “The convenience of the typesetter is not
however the highest Good” (Frege quoted in Gilles 2013: 82).

3

publishers applied to the planning, marketing and distribution of these books. Did
mathematicians have to accommodate the printing and publishing trades when they had their
mathematical works translated into print? As print was the conduit through which their findings
would reach a critical audience, mathematicians had no choice but to work with printers and
publishers. The present study aims to discover more details about the nature of these
relationships and their effect on the communication of mathematics. Finally, the conclusion of
this thesis will relate its findings to received ideas about nineteenth century British history of
mathematics.
From an intellectual point of view, Frege’s reviewers criticized his two-dimensional notation as
unnecessarily cumbersome. From a printing and publishing point of view, the adoption of
Frege’s concept-script may have been prohibitively costly and technically impractical (see
section 1.2 in chapter one). Both of these points together may explain why no logician, even ones
who closely studied him, ever adopted Frege’s two-dimensional language as the medium for
further work in symbolic logic.
John Herschel once wrote to Edward Bromhead, on the occasion of the publication of the
Analytical Society’s 1813 Memoirs, “the publication of Mathematical work, particularly if it
goes one step beyond the comprehension of elementary readers is a dead weight and a loss to its
author” (quoted in Topham 2000a: 325). Many examples confirm Herschel’s suggestion that the
publication of higher mathematics was a trial for both author and publisher, and that neither
expected to come out of the endeavor more financially successful. As publisher Daniel
Macmillan wrote to P. G. Tait with regards to the publication of Tait’s Dynamics of a Particle,
“as these high subjects never sell enough to cover expenses we shall be in no hurry about it”.
Now considered a masterpiece in the development of modern vector analysis, Hermann
Grassman's book Ausdehnungslehre (Theory of Extension, 1844) is another remarked upon

example of a failed publishing venture in the history of mathematics. In 1864 Grassman’s
publisher remaindered the book, recycling 600 copies as waste paper. In 1876 he wrote to
Grassman apprising him of the situation, noting that what was left after the discard were “a few
odd copies, [which] have now been sold, with the exception of one copy which remains in our
library” (quoted in Crowe 1967: 65; Engel 1911: 331).
What mathematical authors such as Frege, Grassman, Tait, and members of the Analytical
Society had in common is that their mathematical work challenged accepted norms within
mathematics. For this reason, “high” books in mathematics did not necessarily find a ready
audience able to understand their new ideas, or at least not right away. The publication occurred
within the parameters of commerce and business, and therefore in the case of publication, market
forces and economic costs had certain effects on intellectual work. It merits questioning under
what circumstances publishers and authors could afford to undertake the publication of
mathematical works destined for small, specialized audiences. Did mathematicians meet with
resistance at the printing and publishing stage, even before their work could be entertained,
favourably or unfavourably, by a broader audience? Would a publisher’s association with an
esteemed author outweigh a financial loss on publishing academic work? The present study aims
to find out.
In contrast to “high” books, publishers were very aware of how valuable a successful textbook
could be, especially if required by a captive audience. Daniel and Alexander Macmillan were
enthusiastic publishers of mathematical textbooks, often eager to seize upon the student market
before another publisher could. In 1854 Daniel Macmillan wrote to well-known textbook author
Isaac Todhunter, “We have not above 100 copies of your Calculus left. There will be some in the
Trade, and with our agents, but not many. So we think we ought to go to press by Xmas, or
4

sooner if you are ready. It would be a mistake to let it be out of print even for a day”. With
regards to a new edition of Barnard Smith’s Arithmetic, Macmillan wrote:

3

Grassman was not a well-known author when he released this book, and many have also commented that his
writing itself was obscure. In this case, these are the reasons why Grassman’s book sold badly (not the typographical
complexity of it).

Even if we could save £10 – which we doubt – by this plan, it would be ill saved money if
it holds back the book even for a week. For the sales now in hand show that the book is
pressingly wanted; and if we, by delay, miss any who now will decide to adopt another
book we shall be throwing away money while we fancy we are saving it. So we should now
blaze on through against all other considerations and think only of getting the complete
book out by Easter. And keep pressing the Printer. And give him no cause for delay.5

Macmillan heavily promoted some of their mathematics textbooks. In 1861, 14,000
prospectuses were prepared to advertise the publication of Todhunter’s Theory of
Equations (1862) (Barrow-Green 2001: 187 f.n.51). They also produced some of their
mathematical books in very large quantities, for example, H. S. Hall’s various
mathematical books for India enjoyed sales upwards of three million copies (Chatterjee
2002: 156).
By examining the promotion and distribution machinery that publishers like Macmillan
applied to their mathematical textbooks, we may discover that publishers played a role in
the advancement of a particular view of mathematics, as the publisher disseminated these
mathematical ideas en mass into an educational setting. John Feather, who has written
extensively about the history of British publishing, has described the publisher as a
capitalist whose trade is in ideas (Feather 1988). It will be one aim of the present work to
find out which mathematical ideas were heavily capitalized upon by publishers, and
whether the choice of publishers to invest money and organization into a certain image of
mathematics shaped mathematics in Britain and in other English-speaking countries.

2. Journals versus books
In recent years historians of mathematics have paid attention to the founding and development of
mathematical journals (Crilly 2004; Barrow-Green 2002; Lützen 2002; Despeaux 2002b; Kent
2008, etc.). These histories have offered us a picture of how specialized publications arose,
particularly in the nineteenth century, to support burgeoning research-oriented mathematical
communities in continental Europe, Britain, and America (Parshall and Rice 2002). Some of the

5

Daniel Macmillan to Barnard Smith, 6 March 1856, MP 55378, p. 36.

6

mathematical journals that have received historical attention are Journal für die reine und
angewandte Mathematik (Crelle's Journal, f. 1826), Journal de Mathématiques Pures et
Appliquées (Liouville's Journal, f. 1836), and the American Journal of Mathematics (f. 1878).
In the British context, a number of journals that published mathematics developed in the
nineteenth century, including the Cambridge Mathematical Journal and its related descendant
journals. The Mathematician was a short-lived publication out of Woolwich Military Academy,
and The Ladies and Gentleman’s Diary was a general interest periodical that included a section
for mathematical recreations (Albree and Brown 2009). Proceedings and transactions of the
many learned societies offered paths through which mathematicians could communicate their
work to an interested audience. The Royal Society of London, The Royal Society of Edinburgh,
The Royal Irish Academy, and the British Association for the Advancement of Science all
published reports or transactions. For students of mathematics, Transactions of the Cambridge
Philosophical Society (later, Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society) offered an
important early outlet for mathematical publication at Cambridge. From the 1860s onward, the
Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society carried mathematical articles arising out of
activities of the society. General science journals such as the Philosophical Magazine included
important articles in physical science. For research mathematics, Crelle’s Journal and Liouville's
Journal remained the most esteemed vehicles for publication.
At the same time that many mathematical practitioners sought out publication in journals, a
number of examples demonstrate that mathematicians continued to develop and showcase new
and important ideas in the format of research monographs and books. Landmark Writings in
Western Mathematics contains several examples of groundbreaking new approaches to
mathematics first presented or most comprehensively demonstrated in book form, for example,
the analytical approach contained in Joseph Louis Lagrange’s Méchanique analitique (1788) or
the theory of limits contained in A. L. Cauchy’s Cours d’analyse (1821) (Grattan-Guinness et al.
2005). Landmark Writings mentions several books as important to the advancement of research
mathematics published in the second half of the nineteenth century. These titles included
William Rowan Hamilton’s Lectures on Quaternions (1853), George Boole’s Laws of Thought
(1854), Johann Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet’s Vorlesungen über zahlentheorie (1863),
William Thomson and P. G. Tait’s Treatise on Natural Philosophy (1867), Stanley Jevons’ The
Theory of Political Economy (1871), James Clerk Maxwell’s A Treatise on Electricity and

7

Magnetism (1873), Lord Rayleigh’s Theory of Sound (1877-1878), Richard Dedekind’s Stetigkeit
und irrationale zahlen (1872) and Oliver Heaviside’s Electrical Papers (1892). Frege’s
Begriffsschrift and Grassman’s Ausdehnungslehre have already been mentioned as examples.
Another signal monograph in nineteenth century mathematics is Hilbert’s Grundlagen der
Geometrie (1899). Hilbert’s re-axiomatization of geometry as presented in this small book has
been credited for giving rise to what some commentators have described as modernism in
6

mathematics.

Many of the nineteenth century journals in which mathematicians published have been studied
and written about. As such the role of the periodical in nineteenth century mathematics has been,
to a certain degree, explored. To date, historians have not explored the case of mathematical
books in the nineteenth century, and how their publication, production, and marketing may have
shaped the culture or practice of mathematics. Although no histories have been written about this
topic, some historians have indicated their desire to know more. In her article about the career of
prolific textbook author Isaac Todhunter, June Barrow-Green notes the difficulty of interpreting
certain facts about her subject's publication career given that a larger account of the publishing
and sale of mathematical books is not available. She comments that “the relationship between
mathematical authors and their publishers, and the general influence of the book trade on
nineteenth century mathematics have not been explored [here] although they clearly merit further
research” (Barrow-Green 2001: 187, f.n.51).
Likely historians of mathematics have focused more on journals because important papers by
now-famous mathematicians appeared frequently in these publications. In the opening passages
of Tony Crilly's article about the Cambridge Mathematical Journal, Crilly expresses a value
judgment commonly held by historians of mathematics about mathematics itself. He states that
original research, and the circulation of original research through publication, is the most
important aspect of mathematical development (Crilly 2004: 455). Due to similar sorts of value
judgments, historians of mathematics have tended to focus on the historical development of what

6

David Rowe looks at different perspectives on Hilbert in his paper (Rowe 1997), as does Herbert Mehrtens in
Moderne – Sprache – Mathematik (Frankfurt am Main: Suhrkamp 1990), where he suggests Hilbert’s work in
foundations initiated modernism in mathematics. Jeremy Gray’s book Plato’s Ghost traces the rise of modernist
practices and approaches to mathematics during the years 1890 to 1930 (Gray 2008).

8

contemporary mathematicians consider to be highly original mathematics. Recognized
mathematical innovations of the nineteenth century more commonly appeared in journals than in
books. It is likely for this reason that mathematical journals have received more substantial
study.
The present examination, by contrast, seeks to offer a more nuanced story of mathematical
development than what a history focused on the summits of mathematical research can provide.
A focus on research-oriented mathematical publication will not be an exclusive focus here. I aim
to include mathematical works considered historically important as well as books that may now
be unknown. If the work existed in book form, and can be identified as mathematical (using
broad criteria as introduced by Wallis and Wallis 1986: v), then I have considered it equally
important to the present study.

3. Passage into print
The topic of this thesis has arisen from the author’s interest in nineteenth century British history
of mathematics and her desire to apply certain intriguing perspectives offered by the discipline of
book history and print culture to this subject. Before venturing forward, a brief introduction to
the discipline of book history and print culture seems warranted.
In art history, an artists’ use of paint as a medium for his or her expression is often considered a
subject of equal importance to the content of the painting. The premise at the heart of the book
history and print culture discipline is similar. The study of book history examines the printed
word as a medium for the expression and communication of knowledge. It asks the question: If
the book is a medium, what effect does that medium have on the content represented there?
Choosing to focus on the printed form as a communications medium puts an emphasis on
questions about how all the mechanisms of print, from the physical form of the book to the
organization of its publication, distribution and eventual use, mediated the communication and
reception of the knowledge contained therein. Book history and print culture asks whether there
are characteristics common to all printed texts, and if so then how those characteristics have
affected how printed knowledge has been generated or received.
While Marshall McLuhan’s famous catchphrase “the medium is the message” has become
something of a cultural cliché, this concept, presented in his book, The Gutenberg Galaxy, is one

9

of the ideas that launched the study of book history and print culture. Elizabeth Eisenstein took
inspiration from McLuhan for the premise of her book, The Printing Press as an Agent of
Change: Communications and Cultural Transformation in Early-Modern Europe first published
in 1979. Eisenstein’s two-volume work sets out to document the effect of the “communicationsshift” that occurred when Western countries moved from a reliance on manuscripts to printed
texts (see Eisenstein 1979: vol. 1, x, xi). An ambitious work that took fifteen years to write, The
Printing Press as an Agent of Change put forward Eisenstein’s perspective on how the invention
of moveable type printing affected the subsequent developments of the Reformation, the
Renaissance and the Scientific Revolution. Eisenstein’s opinions expanded from McLuhan’s
initial suggestion about how communication affects knowledge production. For Eisenstein, the
medium through which communication takes place has an effect on the message, or ultimate
reception and cultural meaning, of the knowledge contained therein. Although McLuhan’s
Gutenberg Galaxy was too cryptic a work for most to digest, Eisenstein’s 1979 book, and the
conversations it subsequently provoked, are associated with the development of book history and
print culture into a recognized, albeit interdisciplinary, field of study.
Eisenstein proposes that printed culture has three characteristics that differentiate it from the
preceding manuscript culture. These characteristics are standardization, dissemination, and
permanence. Roughly speaking, printing brought an authority to a particular version (the printed
version) of a text, with more copies of that text made available than ever before. According to
her thesis, the production of numerous identical copies of the same text fixed and objectified
knowledge (literally), whereas the sharing of knowledge in script and oral culture had been more
fluid. Eisenstein claims these characteristics endemic to print affected how people acquired
knowledge, what kinds of knowledge people had access to, and how many people could access
it. In particular, she claims that because printing technology brought more reliability and
objectivity to texts, these characteristics enabled subsequent social-cultural changes to take place
in religion, in the humanities and in science. Because these movements relied on using texts in a
way made possible by print, she suggests these fundamental changes to Western belief systems
would not have been possible without a transformation from the previous manuscript-reliant
culture to the ensuing printed culture brought about by the invention of the printing press and its
eventual adoption across Europe.

10

Since the publication of The Printing Press as an Agent of Change, Eisenstein’s book has
inspired much debate about how Western culture evolved over the five hundred years in which
the printed word has been a dominant communications medium. While still acknowledged as a
founding work in book history, Eisenstein’s account has since been criticized as overly
deterministic in its theoretical approach (Finkelstein and McCleery 2006: 2). Subsequent
historians of the book have significantly revised both Eisenstein’s account of the print medium
and her claims about its transformative effect on culture. While Eisenstein assumed that printed
books arrived with many of the values we associate with printed knowledge today, Adrian Johns’
counters that the value of “intrinsic reliability” cast upon printed texts was concocted over time
by the printing industry itself. Johns’ claims this image of print was constructed to ensure
printers’ own cultural and commercial success (Johns 1998: 2-3). John’s well-received The
Nature of the Book (1998) challenges Eisenstein’s account of printing and claims that her
description of the transformative power of print stands “outside of history” because she places
the printing press itself beyond her historical analysis (Johns 1998: 19).
Eisenstein claims that the effect of the printing press on culture was revolutionary as opposed to
evolutionary (Eisenstein 2005: 15). Subsequent historians of the book have not wanted to venture
as far. While Johns claims that Eisenstein sees the scientific revolution as inconceivable without
the preceding printing revolution, this is not an entirely fair assessment. Eisenstein writes,
“printing is an agent, not the agent, let alone the only agent, of change in Western Europe… the
very idea of exploring the effects produced by any particular innovation arouses suspicion that
one favours a monocausal interpretation or that one is prone to reductionism and technological
determinism” (Eisenstein 2005: xviii).
David Finkelstein and Alistair McCleery have solidified the discipline of book history in the new
millennium with their compilations An Introduction to Book History (2005) and The Book
History Reader (2002). In his chapter “What Is the History of Books?” Robert Darnton’s
formulation of the communications circuit attempts to position the book as an artifact that should
be analyzed through its interaction with people in society (Darnton 2006: 12). Darnton’s
influential article described how books circulate from author to typesetter, printer, binder,
shipper and bookseller and then on to the reader who completes the circuit. This is an attempt to
see books in a more complicated way than the assumed linearity of a ‘diffusionist’ model, where
books progress from the author’s creation to publication to reception. Darnton attempts to close

11

that path by reminding us that we are all readers and writers both, and writers must be readers
first. Mindful of this, we may consider the role of books in society to be more circular than
linear.
Darnton and D. F. MacKenzie have been identified as leaders of a new movement in the history
of the book (see Howsam 2000: 189, 190; Darnton 2006) who have sought to integrate book
history with cultural history, simultaneously taking a cautious approach towards adopting
theoretical frameworks for how books function in culture. The new book history describes itself
as having grown up from previous approaches to studying the book, including bibliography and a
previously exclusive focus on literary works, both of which were familiar occupations to English
scholars. The Society for the History of Authorship, Reading and Publishing (SHARP) founded
in 1993 symbolizes the openness of the redefined genre with an interest in stories not just about
literary books but about all books, including ones that tell us about religion, science, politics,
food, homemaking and education, etc.
Approaches from the book history and print culture discipline have inspired the questions I pose
in this thesis. McLuhan, Eisenstein, Johns, and Darnton have all provided ways to conceptualize
the interaction of books in culture. To a large extent, the study of book history and print culture
offers a web of interdisciplinarity too diverse to offer one methodology or a single approach for
describing how the print medium has transformed culture and knowledge. However, in the
conclusion of this thesis, I will return to perspectives from book history and print culture, in
order to examine how we might see the history of mathematical printing and publishing through
these frameworks.

4. Science publishing
We know that publication was important, in science and in mathematics. In their history of
mathematics in Canada, Tom Archibald and Louis Charbonneau recognized the important role
printers and publishers played in the development of a nascent mathematical community. In
order to have a mathematical culture, they write, one must have some cultural value placed on
the acquisition of mathematical skills, an educational infrastructure to develop those skills, and
good teachers who inspire students. In addition, they recognize that “an additional aspect of the
local setting [for mathematics] is the book trade: publishers and printers played an important role
in the diffusion of basic mathematical knowledge” (Archibald and Charbonneau 1995: 2).

12

James Secord has drawn similar conclusions about the increasing importance publication played
in the growth of nineteenth century science. He has noted that while other vectors of
professionalization, such as vocational societies, institutions of learning and positions of
employment have been examined, the role of print culture in the professionalization of the
scientist has been less studied. The nineteenth century saw changes in the way that mathematics
7

was practiced, with the gentlemanly ideal merging into the role of the specialist practitioner.

However, within a new structure wherein professionalism was defined by academic positions,
membership in professional organizations, meetings and conferences etc., “an approach informed
by the history of print shows that this view of the changing structure of science is radically
incomplete and sometimes just plain wrong. For it ignores, or at best treats as peripheral, the
forms in which knowledge appeared, assuming that publication in specialist periodicals was
already established as the only legitimate means for announcing new discoveries” (Secord 2009:
444). Secord continues:
it presupposes that specific forms of communicating knowledge were ready to hand, and
firmly in the control of a well-defined group of specialists. Except works devoted to book
history, the transmission of knowledge into print is usually treated as relatively transparent.
Carrying out procedures in the laboratory, creating scientific organizations and attracting
new practitioners: all these are assumed to require work. But the forms of publication, with
few exceptions, have been taken for granted (Secord 2009: 444).

Jonathan Topham, who along with Secord has written about the history of science from the print
culture perspective, has raised the point that publishing increased the cultural influence and
power of the scientist. He writes that one area worthy of further exploration
concerns the involvement of the incipient scientists in managing the new print media to
secure their ends, and there has been increasing historical interest in the rhetorical strategies
by which practitioners sought to construct audiences and to make their science public.
However, this work has tended to be carried out with little consideration either of the
rapidly changing print culture through which such rhetoric was mediated to audiences, or of
the nature of new reading audiences themselves. This arguably testifies to the lingering

7

On the evolving perception and self-perception of mathematicians in England at this time, John Heard’s doctoral
thesis The Evolution of the Pure Mathematician in England, 1850-1920 is particularly useful (Heard 2004).

13

presence in our historiography of one of the assumptions of the diffusionist model—that the
communication of scientific ideas and practices operates (at least when successful) in an
unmediated, unidirectional manner from the scientist to the lay public (Topham 2000b:
561).

While science was becoming professionalized in the later nineteenth century, there existed
limited positions of responsibility in science, and these positions often offered small financial
compensation. Besides a professor’s salary, marrying into money or patenting a successful
invention, another option for financial advancement of the scientist was publishing material for a
general audience (Meadows 2004: 121). Publishing, however, held more potential than merely
supplemental income. Being sought out by a publisher and its attendant audience recognized the
scientist’s cultural authority on a particular topic. Over time, scientists’ participation in science
publishing further legitimized and added respectability to the profession. Jack Meadows
recognizes the 1850s to the 1870s as the time of the greatest pace of change in the Victorian
scientific community. In this same period Macmillan and Company became one of the most
prolific publishers of science in the English language. It grew from a small bookshop into one of
the largest London publishers over these thirty years. In this thesis I make a case that both the
scientist-authors and the publishers at Macmillan and Co. used one another to bolster the other’s
prestige. Publishers could associate themselves with the cultural cachet of eminent scientists, and
market their books as if the product contained some of this mystique. Meanwhile, the scientist’s
authority was legitimized through publication. Most often career advancement in the scientific
profession and the commercial interest of the publishing business brought these groups together
to work in mutual self-interest. The relationships formed between publisher and scientist were
influential bonds that effectively curated the scientific knowledge available in print.
In the year 2000 the British Journal for the History of Science published a special issue on book
history and the sciences (BJHS vol.33 no. 2, June 2000). Leslie Howsam’s article in this issue
discusses the design and production of the International Scientific Series, and how Victorian men
of science such as T. H. Huxley, John Tyndall and Herbert Spencer used these books to
broadcast an image of science they wished to promote. In her introduction she writes
Even some more recent scholarship discusses scientific books as if they had emerged straight from
the minds and consciousness of their authors, to be decanted on the page, unmediated by any
influence from the publishing and printing trades. Publishing does not work that way now, and it did

14

not work that way in the past. The bland package of a printed and bound book may conceal a
complex history of networking and power-broking among authors and publishers (Howsam 2000:
187).

It has been shown how nineteenth century science was organized by professional organizations
such as the Royal Society, the British Association for the Advancement of Science and the
London Mathematical Society (Morrell 1981; Hall 1984; Rice et al, 1995). Other histories have
demonstrated how specific sites of training and pedagogy, such as the University of Cambridge,
were important in molding and influencing mathematical research communities and knowledge
production (Warwick 2003). As Andrew Warwick has mentioned in his history of mathematical
teaching at Cambridge, historians of science have at times taken for granted that mathematicians
and scientists were able to communicate easily with one another and create innovations in their
field, without asking what social structures and material resources put them in a position to do
so. Histories of professional organizations and educational structures (of which Warwick’s book
Masters of Theory is an example), have attempted to reverse these assumptions by grounding the
history of mathematics in the realm of social history, with a sensitivity to and an awareness of
how labour and material culture had an impact.
The very idea of basing a history of mathematics in material culture may seem unusual, as the
practice of mathematics has often been regarded as one of the most socially or culturally neutral
human pursuits that exists (Warwick 2003:12). Mathematics is often considered one of the most
privileged forms of knowledge, and its association with perfect or God-like knowledge continues
in Western culture to this day. Perhaps the fact that Euclid is the second most frequently printed
book in history, next only to the Bible itself, is a sign of how culturally esteemed mathematical
knowledge has been (Barrow-Green 2001: 193). Movements in the Sociology of Scientific
Knowledge have attempted to undermine these beliefs by deconstructing the production of
mathematical knowledge (see chapter four, “Constructing quaternions” in Pickering 1995) or by
socially engaging it (see Bloor 1981).
The common assumption that mathematical knowledge is not affected by labour and material
culture is motivation to make more visible what has so far been less explored. In the book history
and print culture field, it has been demonstrated how “invisible” factors had an effect on the
book trade. Transportation and trade-routes including railways, barge and stage-coach, the labour
market, population growth, geo-political forces, raw materials and improvements to public

15

education, were all part of the nexus of the production and circulation of books. This study
acknowledges that material realities had an impact on the production and distribution of ideas in
their physical manifestation as books. As such this work will demonstrate that mathematics too,
in its transmission through print, was in certain ways subject to these limitations. Very material
and pedestrian conditions may have had an impact on the evolution on mathematics, this most
immaterial of subjects.

5. Plan for the work
Chapter two explores how translating mathematical ideas into print presented technical
challenges. It was complex and expensive to typeset works laden with mathematical symbols and
diagrams. Composing mathematical symbolism using a system designed to mimic alphabetic
script presented challenges that were not covered in the standard printers’ manuals (Secord 2009:
466). Mathematical diagrams had to be engraved with a high degree of precision to preserve the
meaning the author intended. The engraver who translated the author’s diagrams into wood or
copper may have done so without understanding what aspects of the image were crucial to its
meaning. Because of all this, printing mathematics was a specialized art within the printing trade,
and not every printer undertook it. Chapter two demonstrates how difficult and costly it could be
to compose and print texts that were heavily laden with special mathematical symbols and
diagrams. Commercial printers William Clowes and A&R Spottiswoode, the university presses
at Oxford and Cambridge, and London-based journal printer Taylor and Francis are explored as
printers and publishers of mathematics. Two further case studies are presented that illustrate the
difficulties of printing mathematics: typesetting Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead’s
Principia Mathematica (Cambridge University Press, 1910-13) and the production of woodcut
illustrations for Issac Todhunter’s Plane Coordinate Geometry (Macmillan, 1855).
Although the relationship between publisher and literary author has been a subject of study since
the 1970s, the relationship between publisher and scientific author has been less frequently
attended (MacLeod 1980: 63). The mingling of publisher and mathematical author, especially in
the case of the publication of research monographs or books, is unexplored. Chapter three
examines how mathematical publishing was pursued and managed at mathematical and general
science journals compared to at a book publisher. The roles of referees and editors are explored
at the mathematical journals Cambridge and Dublin Mathematical Journal and Acta

16

Mathematica. It is revealed how the values applied to the decision-making process differed at
general science journals compared to mathematical journals. Chapter three introduces Macmillan
and Company as major publishers of mathematical books, and introduces Donald MacAlister as
Macmillan’s professional reader of science and mathematics. MacAlister reviewed almost all
mathematical manuscripts submitted to the press between 1880 and 1900. MacAlister’s readers’
reports reflect what mathematics he considered beneficial for publication. Differing values
applied to the decision-making process at mathematical journals, general science journals and
books resulted in different images of mathematics cultivated in each print media.
Chapter four provides a quantitative study of mathematical books published at Macmillan and
Company, looking at the quantities in which Macmillan produced its mathematical books and
how lucrative these books were for their authors and publisher. The amount of scientific books
Macmillan produced and the pattern in which it produced them is compared to what is known
about mathematics and science publishing in the nineteenth century British book market
generally (Eliot 1994, 1995, 2002). From statistics about Macmillan’s mathematical books (title,
year of publication, print run, etc.), trends in Macmillan’s mathematical publications are
observed. Author-publisher contracts suggest that authors of Macmillan’s mathematical
textbooks could find significant financial benefit from a successful title. For Macmillan, their
mathematical textbook sales provided a consistent source of income upon which they could
found riskier ventures, such as the publication of higher books on special mathematical subjects.
Both textbooks and academic books had their purposes. While textbooks were profitable,
academic publishing also had an affirmative role. Publishing specialized materials in
mathematics gave Macmillan’s textbooks further legitimacy. Also, publishing projects in higher
areas of science became a way of developing relationships with authors who might later write
educational products. Both author and publisher came together for mutual benefit in the
commercialization of knowledge. Schoolbooks and academic books coexisted within the
publishing program to mutual benefit; each product reinforced the success of the other.
Chapter five presents the development of mathematical printing and publishing in nineteenth and
early twentieth century English-speaking Canada. Nationalism and nation building are revealed
as important motives for the development of local printing and publishing of mathematics. Local
production of mathematical books in the Canadas was at first restricted to reprinting American or
British mathematical schoolbooks. Locally produced textbooks in mathematics were developed

17

for political reasons, as a response to changes in educational structures or to reinforce political
loyalties. John Lovell’s series of schoolbooks on mathematical subjects written by John Herbert
Sangster are explored as an early example of native authorship and publication. Throughout the
nineteenth century, researchers, when they existed in Canada, sought publication outside Canada
for their work. Into the twentieth century scientists found Canadian printers inadequate for the
production of original technical works. James MacGregor’s An Elementary Treatise on
Kinematics and Dynamics, published by Macmillan in 1887, and John Charles Fields’ Theory of
the Algebraic Functions of a Complex Variable prepared in Berlin by Mayer & Müller and
produced in Sweden by Almqvist & Wiksell in 1906, are examples in which Canadian
researchers published abroad. Out of this context Field’s collaboration with the University of
Toronto Press on the Proceedings of the International Congress of Mathematics, Toronto, 1924
(University of Toronto, 1928) was an important turning point, as it developed the capability of
the University of Toronto Press to handle specialized mathematical printing. This capability in
turn facilitated the creation of Canadian journals and research monographs. These materials
showcased research being done in Canada, and in turn assisted a fledgling mathematical culture
that was identifiably Canadian.

“Never put together such crabbed stuff”: Printing Mathematics
Using Moveable Type and Engraving

The subject of mathematical printing has never been methodically treated, and many
details are left to the compositor which should be attended to by the mathematician. Until
some mathematician shall turn printer, or some printer mathematician, it is hardly to be
hoped that this subject will be properly treated.
Augustus De Morgan, from “Symbols and Notation”, Penny
Cyclopedia (De Morgan 1842a)

1. Introduction
The British mathematician Augustus De Morgan was a teacher, logician, and historian of
mathematics. In 1826 he became a member of the populist Society for the Diffusion of Useful
Knowledge, and over the course of his life he wrote some 850 articles for its Penny Cyclopaedia
(Stephen 2004). When, in one of these articles, De Morgan stated that “many details [of printed
notation] are left to the compositor which should be attended to by the mathematician”, he wrote
this having a certain familiarity for, and ability to make generalizations about, printed
mathematics. For instance, De Morgan's annotated bibliography Arithmetical Books (1847)
displays his interest in and knowledge of a large number of mathematical books emanating from
a variety of places and times (De Morgan 1847). When De Morgan died in 1871, he proved
himself something of a book collector too, having amassed a private library of roughly three
thousand volumes. While on the one hand De Morgan’s statement about the haphazard nature of
mathematical printing is an offhand remark, on the other hand it is a meaningful comment from
someone who published mathematics himself and who carefully observed printed mathematics in
many forms.
The impression given in a variety of sources is that technical printing was a difficult undertaking
for nineteenth century printers. William Francis, co-partner in the printing firm Taylor and

19

Francis and publisher of the science journal Philosophical Magazine, wrote to the physicist and
mathematician George Gabriel Stokes in 1864, “I fear that the expense of printing Archdeacon
Pratt's elaborate numerical calculations would prevent the Editors of the Philosophical Magazine
8

from accepting the paper for insertion in their Journals”. Similarly, Francis’ publishing partner
Richard Taylor explained that inclusion of mathematics in the Philosophical Magazine came
with limitations:
It is not in [the editor’s] power to admit any very great quantity of pure mathematics. The
majority of the readers of the Magazine are more interested in other sciences, and the
Magazine would soon cease to exist if it were more than sparingly supplied with articles
on lofty mathematical subjects… The papers of the Philosophical Transactions, of the
Memoirs of the Royal Irish Academy, of the Cambridge Philosophical Society, of the
Cambridge Mathematical Journal, &c, are much fitter vehicles for extensive
mathematical discussion than those of the Philosophical Magazine (quoted in Brock and
Meadows 1984: 100).

Although Taylor and Francis served as printers to most of London's scientific societies and were
experienced printers of scientific work, Francis’ letter and Taylor’s sentiments suggest that even
this firm had limits when it came to mathematical printing.
When the Cambridge Analytical Society took their Memoirs featuring new analytical expressions
of the calculus to the Pitt Press at Cambridge University, William Whewell wrote that “the
extraordinary complexity and symmetry of the symbolical combinations sorely puzzled the yet
undisciplined compositors of that day” (quoted in Topham 2000a: 328). The irony in Whewell's
statement is that the press at Cambridge was one of the best-equipped printers for mathematics in
England at the time. Apprentice compositors received specific training in the composition of
mathematics (McKitterick 2004b: 356). Despite this, John Smith, who was University Printer
when the Memoirs was in progress, complained that he had “never put together such crabbed
stuff in his life” (quoted in Enros 1983: 35). He had to order more type from out of town – small

William Francis to George Stokes, 21 April 1864, Taylor and Francis Papers, St. Bride Library, London UK. Other
factors, such as Pratt’s residence outside England, may have contributed to Francis’ dismissive attitude. A chaplain
for the East India Company, Pratt was appointed Archdeacon of Calcutta in 1850. From his geographical position in
India Pratt attempted to carry forth his mathematical career and defend his professional interests and reputation in
England, something that was not easy to do from such a distance (see Barrow-Green 2001: 200).

20

numerals and brackets – in order to complete the job. The Analytical’s new method for the
calculus puzzled students using the fluxional and geometric approach required by the Tripos
examination. Similarly their unfamiliar symbols challenged the printers at the Press. Once
9

available in book form, the Memoirs were priced at a high cost of 15 shillings per volume. This
reflected what the authors had paid the press to print it; each published the book at an individual
loss of £9 6s. 4d. (Topham 2000a: 329). While the unfamiliar content of the Memoirs was likely
the decisive factor in its lackluster reception among the Analytical’s contemporaries, another
factor might have been the cost of the book.
The present study aims to answer questions arising from the suggestion that it was difficult to
communicate mathematics through moveable type printing (for the text) and wood engraving
(for the illustrations). Considering the few known examples of how mathematics was translated
into print, was it really harder and more expensive to print mathematical matter over other
printed matter? This chapter explores why technical manuscripts were in fact more tedious and
expensive to produce than other printed materials.
Two consequences arose from the increased difficulty of printing mathematics, and these had
specific effects on the communication of mathematics in print. First, the increased expense of
composing mathematical matter resulted in a financial burden for the publisher, be that a
scientific society, a publishing company, or the author. This exaggerated the cost-to-benefit ratio
in the publication of mathematics. This had an oppressive effect on the publication of scholarly
mathematics, but the opposite effect on mathematical textbooks. Because the cost to enter the
market with a new book was higher than for other subjects, a successful mathematical textbook
could become even more successful due to lack of competition. Secondly, the difficulties
involved in printing higher mathematics resulted in certain printing houses doing most printing
of mathematical works.

10

In order to have mathematics printed in a professional manner, an

According to the National Archives currency converter, the Memoirs in 1813 cost approximately £30 or $50 in
today’s money.
10

Or at least, the printing of difficult or unusual mathematical work was something that only certain printers were
capable of, or willing, to do. The Analytical’s Memoirs, Frege’s Begriffsschrift, and Bertrand Russell and Alfred
North Whitehead’s Principia Mathematica are examples of mathematical books that would have been non-trivial to
produce. When University of Toronto professor John Charles Fields published his Theory of the Algebraic
Functions of a Complex Variable with Mayer & Müller in Berlin and Almqvist & Wiksell in Sweden, proofs crossed

21

author or publisher would have required the cooperation of one of these firms in order to receive
the most able preparation of the text.
When a manuscript was sent to the printer, how, if at all, was its presentation altered by the
printing process? Did the cost of setting mathematics encourage authors to economize their
symbolism or the requirement for illustrations? Did the limitations of type influence
mathematicians in their choices of certain mathematical expressions over alternatives? How were
common printing practices in nineteenth century England applied to printing mathematics? The
printing of mathematics is contextualized within the history of technological changes that
occurred within the nineteenth century printing industry, changes that inevitably affected the
production of mathematical texts during this time.
In section (2) I offer a brief overview of nineteenth century printing technology, focusing on the
processes of composition and wood engraving. (3) aims to answer the question, what were the
specific issues that made printing mathematics difficult? Sections (4) through (7) survey
nineteenth century English printers and the mathematical work they undertook, looking
specifically at Cambridge University Press and Taylor and Francis, firms that have been
identified as major printers of mathematics (Secord 2009: 466), as well as printing firms William
Clowes, A&R Spottiswoode and Oxford University Press. In section (8) a short case study of the
printing of Principia Mathematica (Bertrand Russell and Albert North Whitehead, 1910) is
presented. While more a work of logic than of mathematics per se, the dense symbolism of this
text certainly posed an unusual typographical challenge to Cambridge University Press. Section
(9) examines the tradition of using wood engraving for mathematical illustration. In section (10),
concerns and attitudes about the production of successful mathematical illustrations will be
revealed through the case study of Isaac Todhunter's A Treatise on Plane Coordinate Geometry,
published 1855 by Macmillan and Company. Plane Coordinate Geometry was a college level
textbook printed at the Cambridge University Press. Through correspondence between the
Macmillan publishing house and wood engravers William Dodd and William Dickes, details

the Atlantic several times and Fields made an overseas trip to supervise the printing (Riehm and Hoffman 2011: 634).

22

about the production of illustrations for the book are revealed. Section (11) concludes by offering
answers to questions raised in this introduction.

2. Printing in the nineteenth century
Until the beginning of the nineteenth century, the printer's art had not changed much since
Gutenberg first practiced the craft in 1450.

11

As one author put it, “printing historians agree that

the period between 1500 and 1800 was technically stable. Despite some local variation, printers
everywhere handled closely similar tools and materials in closely similar ways” (Dewalt 1995:
24).
The original tools of printing were, basically, the common press, or wooden press, paper, lead
type, and ink. Sheets of paper were made by hand from a mix of pulverized linen rags and other
scraps with water. The mixture was spread and left to dry in woven wire racks. Type was cast by
hand, letter by letter, from reusable moulds. Ink was applied to the letterform by dabbers or pelt
balls, and considerable skill was required to apply a uniform layer of ink over the surface of type.
Books were typically sold in sheets, and traveled in large bales wrapped in heavy paper.
Compared to textiles, their intrinsic value was slight, but shipping (by stagecoach or barge) was
usually costly. As books initially traveled to their customers unbound, the paper was
occasionally exposed to the elements and could be subject to damage during transit (Darnton
2002: 19). Bookbindings were arranged for separately and crafted according to taste and ability
to pay.
The act of ‘composition’ is the assembly of pieces of spacing and type so as to prepare the
manuscript in moveable type. Metal letterforms cast out of lead were stored in a type case such
that an entire alphabet of type was sorted into compartments according to letter. In one hand, the
printer or compositor held a composing stick made out of wood or metal. Lines of type were
formed by assembling letters from the case in the correct order in the stick. Lines were separated
by thin pieces of lead, called leading, to create appropriate spacing between lines of text. When

11

It should be noted that while Gutenberg is credited for the invention of printing from moveable type, it had been
invented in China in the eleventh century (using wooden types), and in Korea (using bronze types) in the fourteenth
century. Historians believe the invention of printing from moveable type in Europe to be independent of its
discovery in Asia (Twyman 1998: 21).

23

the stick was full, the block of type was moved to a tray (also called a galley) for temporary
storage. Once enough lines for a page were composed, they were fastened into a metal frame (a
chase), using pieces of wood (furniture) and metal keys (coins) that, when tightened, applied
pressure to the assembled type. This entire construction is called the printing forme (see figure
2). Held together by pressure and friction, the hundreds of separate pieces that make up the
printing forme remain assembled when the forme is moved for printing from the composing
stone to the press bed.

Figure 2 The printing forme
Wood engraving, a form of relief printing, was a commonly used technique for the reproduction
of images in nineteenth century books. Using wood as a surface for relief printing is an ancient
art, having been applied for the printing of block books in ninth century China. However, wood
engraving (as opposed to wood cutting) was a method first popularized by Thomas Bewick in the
late eighteenth century. Its expression in his book British Birds (1797-1804) started a trend in
illustration that quickly spread into common use across Europe. Bewick's wood engraving
technique used boxwood cut across the grain, and a burin replaced the knife and gouge as the
principal tool of carving. The technique offered more detailed, refined images than were possible
with traditional wood blocks cut with the grain (the artist Albrecht Dürer, for instance, is
considered a master of the wood cutting method).
As engraved wood blocks could be made the same height as type, the innovation of wood
engraving also made it possible to print refined pictures beside text printed with moveable type.
The other advantage was that boxwood was a tough material, and images engraved on it could

24

withstand the wear and tear of long print runs, in some cases, up to one million impressions
(Twyman 1998: 51). Wood engraving met the demands of the nineteenth century for detailed
images capable of being reproduced quickly and in large volumes. Typically, an image drawn
onto the block or separately by an artist was cut into wood by an engraver. In the 1830s and 40s
engraving became an industrial trade in cities such as London or New York, where dedicated
firms satisfied the high demand for large, detailed engravings by assigning many engravers to
one image in an assembly-line manner. Each engraver worked a piece of the image according to
his or her skill (outlines, parallel shading, backgrounds, etc.). It was not uncommon for certain
engravers to acquire a specialty such that they would only do certain elements of the image, such
12

as foliage, faces, or architecture.

The first major invention in printing technology of the nineteenth century was the development
of the iron press in 1800 (Clair 1965: 210). With an improved action it was quicker and took less
effort to operate. Whereas the wooden or common press operated at about 30 sheets per hour, the
upper limit on a Stanhope iron press was roughly 200 impressions per hour (Clair 1965: 211).
The second major change to press design occurred when the cylinder was adapted to the press.
Both inking the forme and pulling the impression were mechanized so that a series of touching
cylinders accomplished these tasks. Eventually stereotype plates of the printing forme could be
curved and bolted to a cylinder as well, making the entire printing process even more efficient.
By the end of the century rotary presses were fed a continuous stream of paper from a spool,
eliminating the need to feed the machine separate sheets of paper, and increasing printing speed
again. When Frederick Koenig and Andreas Bauer built the first cylindrical perfecting machine
in 1816 it was capable of 900 to 1,000 sheets per hour.

13

The Applegath and Cooper machine

installed by The Times of London in 1827 completed 4,200 sheets per hour. The rotary presses of
the 1860s produced 12,000 perfected eight-page newspapers in one hour (Clair 1965: 217).
The skilled compositor could assemble just over 1,000 letters and spaces per hour. Around 1840
the first composing machine raised the speed of composition to over 6,000 letters and spaces an

12

An immense demand for wood engravings was created by the illustrated periodicals of the day, such as Charles
Knight's Penny Magazine (f. 1823, London), the Illustrated London News (f. 1842) and Harper's New Monthly
Magazine (f. 1850, New York).

The term ‘perfecting’ refers to the act of completing a printers' sheet by printing both sides of the paper.

25

hour. Composing machines went through various iterations and improvements in the next forty
years. The problem with these machines initially was that while they hastened composition, no
accelerated system had been implemented for distribution (putting the type back into the case for
reuse). For this reason, the mechanization of typesetting was not widely adopted until the
invention of typecasting machines in the 1880s. When the linotype machine was invented in
1886, it combined into one machine all the jobs involving type: casting, composing, justifying,
and distributing. The linotype machine solved the problem of distributing by melting down old
type and reusing the metal to make new type. Monotype machines also composed mechanically,
but in this case a paper ribbon perforated by a keyboard was fed into a separate metal casting
machine. The monotype system also reused material to cast new letters. The difference between
the two systems was that the linotype produced a ‘slug’ – one complete line of type, whereas the
monotype machine produced individually cast letters assembled in the correct order,
approximating more closely the appearance of regular moveable type. It was the common use of
these machines in newspaper printing offices that begat the widely used term “hot type” (Clair
1965: 226).
Although the basic idea to mould and copy the printing forme had been the subject of experiment
throughout the eighteenth century, the stereotype was not fully realized until the nineteenth
century. In the stereotype process a mould is made from the printing forme using either plaster of
paris or papier mâché. A thin layer of metal is poured into the mould, producing a duplicate
surface to the original forme. The advantage of stereotype copies was that once made, the
original type was free for use in new jobs, while one retained the ability to reproduce the printing
forme without having to re-compose it. In the case of books in high demand, this saved time and
money. The plaster method was used in England until 1846 when the papier mâché method,
common in France, was introduced (Clair 1965: 220). Electrotype was invented in 1839. In this
case a wax mould was made from the printing forme and then an electroplating technique was
used to create a metal printing plate. The average print-run for an electrotype was 100,000,
compared to roughly 50,000 from stereos (Clair 1965: 226). Woodcuts were also reproduced
using the stereo- and electrotype methods. Using stereo or electro copies, the same illustration
could be printed on more than one machine, or used by more than one printer. If the original
wood block was damaged during printing, there was an identical copy to take its place.

26

The advent of the papermaking machine (invented by Nicolas Louis Robert, in 1799) increased
the output of papermakers by ten fold and had the effect of cheapening the price of paper
considerably (Clair 1965: 208). The supply of rags couldn't match the demand for material
created by machine papermaking, and so a variety of new sources for raw materials were
considered. In 1840 ground wood pulp was introduced, and over the next decade chemicals were
applied to break down the cellulose fibers, with paper being manufactured in this way. In 1865
esparto grass was introduced as a cheap and practical material out of which to make paper. The
use of esparto grass drove a massive increase in the amount of printed matter. The introduction
of this new material along with the reduction of long-standing taxes on paper and stamps (the socalled ‘taxes on knowledge’ were cut in 1836), made paper in all its forms cheaper and more
accessible than ever. As a result, Britain quadrupled its paper production between 1865 and 1895
(McKitterick 2004b: 2).
By the end of the century, books were put “in boards” by the publisher rather than receiving
custom bindings chosen by the book buyer. By the 1840s bookbinding, which at one time had
been a separate trade, became a subsidiary business of the large printers and publishers, who
folded and bound their own books in house. Standard issue books typically received a cardboard
binding, usually wrapped in cloth. By 1900 all books received standard bindings issued by the
publisher (Briggs 2008: 15; Potter 1997).

3. Difficulties of printing mathematics
Although nineteenth century book and printing history is a lively area of research, few sources
exist on the history of printing science, and fewer still offer anything about printing mathematics
specifically. In his survey of science publishing in the nineteenth century, James Secord
mentions the difficult and expensive task it was to undertake the printing of mathematics (Secord
2009: 466). He references a student’s unpublished M.Phil paper on the subject, which book
14

historian Jonathan Topham agrees is the best source he’s read on the matter.

Amidst the

published record, Robin Rider has provided the most engaging account of how mathematical

14

Jonathan Topham to J. E. Barrow-Green, personal e-mail correspondence, 6 April 2011. The paper to which they
refer is Chitra Ramalingham, “The mathematician and the compositor”, unpublished MPhil essay, University of
Cambridge, 2002.

27

knowledge was influenced by the practice of typography and the print medium (Rider 1993).
However, Rider's article does not discuss the time period in question here, as it begins in the
fifteenth century and ends with the eighteenth.
Despite the lack of historical writing about mathematical printing, we can isolate a few reasons
why the printing of mathematics has been characterized as difficult or specialized. All the issues
that made technical manuscripts difficult were incurred in the first step of the process, that is, in
preparing the manuscript for printing. While many of the skills of the printing house could be
applied equally to mathematical books as they were to other books, the setting of a mathematical
book in type could be more difficult. It might require a highly skilled compositor for the text and
a skilled wood engraver for the illustrations, and possibly specific fonts had to be specially cast
for the job.
The difficulties encountered in composing mathematical matter for printing can be listed as
follows: 1) it required time consuming justification, 2) the use of rules increased the difficulty of
composition (rules, which are type-high pieces of lead, were required to create the printed lines
required by fractions or square brackets, for instance), 3) it required skilled compositors to attend
to the job, 4) special types were sometimes required and had to be specially cut and founded, 5)
illustrations, where needed, had to be precise and labeled accurately. The qualities most sought
in mathematical illustration, such as precision and the accurate labeling of vertices or other
elements of the drawing, were not necessarily qualities required of other illustrations or of wood
engravers working in other contexts (more on this in sections 9 and 10).
‘Justification’ is the process by which small pieces of non-printing metal spacing are fitted
around assembled elements of type. This is required to build up a solid printing forme in which
pressure holds everything together throughout the printing process. Justification was often more
complex with mathematical works because the use of exponents and subscripts required the
assembly of extra spacing in order to secure the printing forme. The addition of spacing below
and around letterforms as well as between them made the setting of these expressions more
difficult than setting a regular English sentence in type. The use of rules in mathematical printing
also intensified the difficulty of justification. For example, if a fraction (with a division line,
necessitating the use of a rule) is followed by an operator such as a ‘+’, ‘-’ or ‘=’, this is one of
the mathematical forms that breaks the printers line, thereby causing difficult justification.

28

Brackets surrounding three or more lines of type also involved the use of rules, as they were bent
to the necessary shape. Large brackets also broke the printers line of type.
In his chapter “Science, technology and mathematics” Secord cites an 1875 report of the British
Association of the Advancement of Science (BAAS) as one source that indicates that
mathematical printing was indeed tricky (Secord 2009). This report is worth examining in more
depth. The report was filed from a subcommittee “appointed to study mathematical notation and
printing”. On the committee were mathematicians William Spottiswoode, Arthur Cayley, George
Stokes, William Clifford, and James W. L. Glaisher (Spottiswoode et al 1876). The report
mainly addresses the first two difficulties of mathematical printing as identified above. Timeconsuming justification and the need for rules are the two main problems cited. This BAAS
report also includes a figure showing four examples of mathematical expressions as a way of
illustrating why such forms were difficult to compose. It is reproduced here (figure 4).
In figure (4), A and B represent compound fractions, C depicts an integral expression with
indices expressing the limits of the integral at the top and bottom of the integral sign, and D
shows a base (the mathematical constant e) with a functional exponent. Each mathematical
expression is depicted as an amalgamation of letterforms and spacing as it might appear in a
printer's forme. The grey areas represent the non-printing bits of metal (i.e. spacing) and the
white squares represent the letterforms, or bits of type. This diagram illustrates why composing
mathematics for printing was different to setting, for instance, a novel, poem or other English
work. English sentences (see figure 3) require much less spacing to be added than do compound
fractions, integrals with indices or bases with complicated exponents. In figure (4) the
letterforms and spacing pieces are various sizes whereas in figure (3) the spaces and type
conform to one uniform font size. In figure (3) the structure of the printing forme is organized by
lines of leading that separate each line of words from the next line of words. In figure (4) lines of
leading do not structure the printing forme in this way.

29

Figure 3 A sentence set in type

Figure 4 Examples of difficult justification (Source: Spottiswoode et al 1876: 338)

Figure (4) illustrates both why mathematical typesetting required time-consuming justification
and why division lines (i.e. rules) magnified this problem. The report states that because of the
difficulties involved in justifying such forms, “the cost of composing mathematical matter may
in general be estimated at three times that of ordinary or plain matter” (Spottiswoode et al 1875:
387). The function of the report is to suggest to mathematical authors that they take steps to
replace certain expressions with equivalents that are easier and less expensive forms to typeset.

30

The authors recommend eliminating division lines (rules) where possible and suggest the use of
specific mathematical expressions that do not break the printers line of type (see figure 5 for the
list of recommended forms). Adopting the recommendations, they say, will maximize efforts of
the compositor, thereby minimizing the extra costs involved in printing mathematics.

Figure 5 Mathematical expressions not involving justification (Source: Spottiswoode et
al 1876: 339)

It makes sense that in their report, Spottiswoode et al would encourage mathematicians to
standardize the forms in which they sent their mathematical language to the printer. One can
imagine that the forms chosen to express certain ideas might have had a measurable impact on
the speed and overall cost of composition, as expressions might be repeated numerous times in a
book length work or technical paper of a certain size. This advice was still being offered seventy
years later when G. H. Hardy was consulted about a mathematical manuscript intended for
publication as part of the series Cambridge Tracts in Mathematics and Mathematical Physics.
Hardy notes that the author “does not observe the rules for setting up formulae laid down by the

31

LMS [London Mathematical Society] ‘Notes for authors’ and the result is a good deal waste of
space” (quoted in Todd 1994: 34). He further comments that

Given the number of mathematical texts circulating in its day, it would be difficult to comment

€ on whether the 1875 BAAS report had any effect on the use of mathematical expressions by
nineteenth century British mathematicians. However publications about the preparation of
mathematical manuscripts continued to be issued in Britain well into the twentieth century. G. H.
Hardy authored a short pamphlet on the preparation of mathematical manuscripts in 1932,
published by the London Mathematical Society (Hardy refers to it in his comment above). In
1954, T. W. Chaundy, P. R. Barrett and Charles Beatty released a guide for authors, editors and
compositors of mathematics at the Oxford University Press (Chaundy et al 1954). This replaced
Hardy’s pamphlet as the standard guide for preparing mathematical manuscripts for printing.
Ray Hitching’s 1964 publication The Mathematician and the Printer contains a description of
typographical difficulties very similar to the difficulties described by the BAAS report of ninety
years earlier. A base (the natural logarithm) with a fractional exponent presents a timeconsuming justification problem for the compositor. In this case justification requires the
assembly of seventeen small pieces of type (see “a” in figure 6). This example of difficult
typesetting is quite similar to problems outlined by the BAAS report from the previous century
(compare with figure 4 expression “D”). However the difference between the 1870s and the
1960s is reflected by Hitching’s depiction of an equivalent expression (see “b” in figure 6). In
this case, the expression is composed entirely by Monotype machine. The adaptation of the
Monotype machine to mathematical composition in the 1930s eliminated the human being
having to pick out different sized fonts from various type cases, or assemble expressions by hand
in a composing stick. A monotype operator sitting at a keyboard could compose a mathematical
text by typing it; the machine would output the type. While originally machine composition had

15

Common fractions (such as ½) were available as single letterforms of type. Hardy suggested expressions that
avoided the setting of a fraction by the compositor (a fraction requiring a “2” under a division line, would require the
use of several separate letterforms). This would have saved space.

32

to be combined with a certain amount of make-ready, by the 1960s some mathematical
manuscripts were entirely composed by machine (Hitchings 1965: 83).

16

function requiring justification and (b) showing an equivalent form composed by

In their 1954 guide, Chaundy et al noted that “the setting of mathematics is a rare and expensive
skill not readily acquired. Existing facilities often have difficulty keeping pace with the rapidly
growing output of mathematical writing. For this reason there may be a long and vexatious delay
between the writing and the publication of a mathematical work” (Chaundy et al 1954: 21).

17

In

16

Within the context of composition by machine, in some cases printers had to re-arrange certain bits of type by
hand after machine composition but prior to the type forme being ready to print. This act is one of the tasks referred
to by printers as make-ready.
17

In his essay about mathematical printing at the University of Toronto Press, Roy Gurney echoes this sentiment.
The Press at UofT installed a monotype keyboard and caster in 1910 to aid in the composition of mathematical
examination papers at the university. By 1950, the University of Toronto Press was a major printer of mathematics,
with Gurney reflecting that “By 1950, the capabilities of the University Press in mathematical typesetting were
being severely taxed. Only one of the machinist operators really possessed the requisite skill, and he was becoming
advanced in years…There were two or three highly skilled hand compositors capable of making up the complicated
formulae, but their available time was overloaded, and it was becoming very difficult to train apprentices in this
difficult craft. To find Canadian craftsmen in the industry who had this skill was virtually impossible. Another
problem was, of course, the increasingly high cost of the hand operations involved in the composition of technical

33

1930, G. H. Hardy, R. H. Fowler and the editors of the Quarterly Journal of Mathematics
collaborated with Oxford University Press and the Monotype corporation to adapt machine
composition to the setting of mathematics, but it was not an easy task: “much adaptation and
recutting of type faces was necessary before the new system could come into use” (Chaundy et al
1954: v).
Whether the composition of mathematics was actually made more efficient by its adaptation to
the Monotype machine is difficult to ascertain. Historian David McKitterick has noted that all
compositors at the Cambridge University Press received specific training in the composition of
mathematics. This practice of mathematically training compositors continued well into the
twentieth century, even after the Press acquired Monotype machines and began relying heavily
on them for composition (McKitterick 2004b: 356). For some mathematical work, type was still
hand set at the Pitt Press well into the 1970s (McKitterick 2004b: 8). Even after computers could
drive hot-metal casting machines in the 1960s, the press at Cambridge continued to rely on the
established skills of an experienced compositor when it came to setting mathematical works. For
most mathematical material “extremely skilled Monotype setting was combined with handcomposition, including filing down pieces of type so as to achieve better fit, or to create special
sorts” (McKitterick 2004b: 12). Cambridge University Press was known to keep high standards
for printing mathematics. McKitterick says that the Press “became for many the best for
scientific and mathematical composition in Britain” in the 1950s and 1960s (McKitterick 2004b:
356). Until mathematicians themselves began to use computer programs for composition (TeX
software was invented 1978), a highly skilled compositor using a combination of hand setting
and Monotype machine remained the most efficient way to transform mathematical manuscripts
into printable form in the twentieth century.
In a 1950s article in The Monotype Recorder, a trade publication of the Monotype Corporation,
Arthur Phillips confirms the idea that skilled compositors with knowledge of mathematics are
required for the job of composition. It is interesting to note that the requirement for a skilled

material. Labour cost had already become a major item in any printing job and this was reflected strongly in the cost
sheets for mathematical works being produced” (Gurney 1961: 125).

34

compositor with mathematical literacy remained even after the advent of machine composition.
Phillips describes the necessary ingredients for a successful job: “There are several requirements
for successful mathematical setting. Both the ‘Monotype’ operator and the compositor need an
elementary knowledge of mathematical notation. The author’s copy must be legible and without
ambiguity. The printer must give some thought to the problem of mathematical setting before
undertaking the work, for it is all too easy to underrate the extent of the planning and equipment
required for mathematical composition” (Phillips 1956: 7).
Historically, compositors played a crucial role in the adaptation of any text for printing,
mathematical or not. Until the twentieth century, the compositor was relied upon to make
decisions about the visual presentation of a text, and to correct small mistakes in the manuscript.
Graphic designers did not emerge as distinct professionals until after 1900 (Dewalt 1995: 46). In
the nineteenth century it was the compositor’s job to devise the visual presentation of a book,
possibly under the supervision of an author, editor, or publisher, depending on the circumstance.
The compositor also frequently served as copy editor when setting English or Latin texts,
routinely correcting spelling and punctuation errors in the original manuscript (Dewalt 1995: 46).
Perhaps DeMorgan had this image of the compositor in mind when he stated that in
mathematical printing, “many details are left to the compositor which should be attended to by
the mathematician. Until some mathematician shall turn printer, or some printer mathematician,
it is hardly to be hoped that this subject will be properly treated” (De Morgan 1842a: 444).
Unless a compositor had a certain basic degree of mathematical literacy, decisions about line
breaks, the organization of the material on the page, the prominence of headings or even the
ability to interpret an author’s written symbol and chose the appropriate letter of type, would
have been difficult.
Mathematics was a specialized art within the printing trade and only some printers undertook it.
This was because of the extra expertise, time and tools required to do the job. However,
bibliographies of mathematics show that mathematical books emanated from printers all over
Britain, in cities and in smaller towns, not just in London, Cambridge, Oxford, Edinburgh and
Dublin but also from Bristol, Birmingham, Newcastle, York, Whitehaven and Chipping
Campden (Wallis and Wallis 1986). This seemingly presents a paradox and raises the question,
how did printers outside major centers of learning overcome their lack of mathematical expertise
when they printed a mathematical book? How can mathematical printing be a specialized art if in

35

fact mathematical books were printed in a variety of disparate places?
Robin Rider has conjectured an answer that is plausible and which is adopted by the present
work. First of all, one might consider that not all entries in mathematical bibliographies represent
first publications of original mathematics (Rider 1993: 111-112).

18

In many cases smaller

printers brought out their own versions of common guides or schoolbooks or subsequent editions
of classic books on mathematical subjects. Peter and Ruth Wallis’ Biobibliography of British
Mathematics and its Applications, for instance, also takes a broad definition of mathematics,
including entries for books about astronomy, navigation, surveying, building, dialing and
clockmaking, motive power, electricity, accounting and insurance (Wallis and Wallis 1986: v).
Some of these books may not have required the kinds of specialized tools or specialized
knowledge that producing other mathematical texts would have required.
For works of mathematics, Rider suggests that “typographical culture” took over from
mathematical culture, for all subsequent editions beyond the first. While a book’s author often
approved of the notation used in the first edition, for subsequent editions, Rider suggests printers
copied the forms used in the first printing (Rider 1993: 111-113). She gives as her example
Euler’s Elements of Algebra. First published in 1768 in Russian , numerous translations and
editions appeared from various printers over the following four decades. In comparing these,
Rider posits that the compositors always copied the formulae from earlier printed versions.
While the house style (and language of the text) varied between editions, the similarities in the
equation typography are, in her opinion, too similar to be the product of a new setting of the
equations. Rider suggests that subsequent printers had on hand a previously printed copy of the
text, and followed all the original decisions about how to present the symbols (regarding
alignment, where to break a line, which sorts to use, etc.). Copying from previously printed
mathematical symbolism created similarities in the typography of every edition, even if the text
was translated into a different language (Rider 1993: 112). If this conjecture holds generally true,
then most of the difficulty of composing mathematics was concentrated in the first printing, with

18

Bibliographies that come to mind are Peter and Ruth Wallis' Biobibliography of British Mathematics and its
Applications, Part II, 1701-1760, Rider's A Bibliography of Early Modern Algebra, 1500-1800, and D. M.
Sommerville's Bibliography of Non-Euclidean Geometry.

36

subsequent editions following conventions set by the first.

19

These and other details arising from her close observation of early mathematical books lead
Rider to conclude that “the practical problems of publishing mathematics [may have] had more
influence on the simplification and standardization of mathematical expression than did any
organized action by mathematicians” (Rider 1993: 113). The idea that printed forms begat
similar printed forms of symbolic expression may have continued throughout the history of
printed mathematics.
Rider observes, “The Book of Nature might be written in mathematical language, but it was
printers who conveyed this language to the eyes of most students and scholars of early modern
mathematics” (Rider 1993: 113). This statement holds for nineteenth century British
mathematicians and their audiences even more so than it did in earlier times. By 1900 British
mathematical books were in general, more affordable commodities available to ever-larger
audiences domestically and around the world. This change occurred through the application of
steam-power to printing, amplifying the number of available mathematical books, and the
implementation of public education systems that, by the twentieth century, brought many
students into to contact with mathematical textbooks.

4. British printers of mathematics
As has already been mentioned, Wallis’ Biobibliography of British Mathematics and Its
Applications has demonstrated that in the eighteenth century, mathematical books were being
produced not just from London, Cambridge, Oxford, Edinburgh and Dublin, but also outside
major centers of learning in smaller towns and cities (Wallis and Wallis 1986). Given the
expansion of the book trade in the nineteenth century, especially in the latter part of the century,
both the number of mathematical books and the number of different printers of these books will
be impossible to examine in entirety. That being said, we can look at some of the largest printing

19

To test how universal a practice this was, one might, for instance, examine some of Isaac Todhunter’s textbooks
that were pirated and translated into local languages by Indian printers at the end of the nineteenth century (see
Aggarwal 2007). If errors were present in the equations of the original edition, were these mistakes reproduced in
the equations of the pirated editions? Were the syntactical breaks in the equations from the original book mimicked
in pirated editions in Hindi, Bengali or Urdu? Copies of Indian printed mathematical books reside in the Oriental
collections at the British Library. To date a comparison of these editions for typographic style has not been made.

37

houses and those already known as having a specialization in mathematical books, and examine
their connections to the printing and publishing of these works. The following sections discuss
some of the ways in which printers William Clowes, Andrew and Robert Spottiswoode, Oxford
University Press, Cambridge University Press, and Taylor and Francis were involved with the
printing of mathematical books, and how the conditions of each printing house would have
shaped the material that was printed there.

5.

Populist printers William Clowes and A&R Spottiswoode

William Clowes of London, the first printer in Britain to apply steam printing to book
production, produced books and educational works for the masses. A&R Spottiswoode were also
early adopters of steam-printing technology. Like Clowes, they had one of London's largest
printing works in the 1830s. Clowes biggest client was the Society for the Diffusion of Useful
Knowledge (or SDUK, founded in 1827), which developed materials for the edification of the
working and middle classes, most notably the publications Penny Cyclopaedia and Cabinet
Cyclopaedia. A number of mathematicians connected to the newly founded University College
London (UCL) were associated with the SDUK, contributing materials about mathematical and
scientific topics to its educational publications. Augustus De Morgan (UCL's first professor of
mathematics) and Dionysius Lardner (UCL's first professor of natural philosophy and
astronomy) both contributed materials to the Penny Cyclopaedia and Cabinet Cyclopaedia.
These publications were printed by either Clowes or A&R Spottiswoode. Both printers had
steam-printing machines as early as 1819, which facilitated the production of large quantities of
books at low prices. These printing houses produced some of De Morgan’s most famous books.
Clowes handled De Morgan’s The Differential and Integral Calculus (De Morgan 1842b).
Released as part of the SDUK’s Library of Useful Knowledge series, De Morgan’s Calculus was
sold for the low price of sixpence (Fischer 2004: 279).
Clowes was one of the first English printers to apply the invention of steam printing to make
what had been essentially a craft product – the book – into an industrialized product. Clowes set
up his printing shop with one press and one assistant in 1803. At this time his stock of type was
so small, that Clowes was “under the necessity of working it from day to day like a banker’s
gold” (Smiles 1885: 208). However, Clowes’ goal as a printer was to deliver a product with
accuracy, speed and in large quantity. He made it his business to produce books in sufficient

38

amounts and affordable enough to be marketed to a large population. With these goals in mind,
his business grew steadily, and in 1823 he purchased his first steam printing press from
Applegath & Cowper in order to fill even larger orders for books. While steam-printing
machines had been used for newspaper production, he was the first printer to make regular use of
20

the steam press for books (Clair 1965: 228).

In the course of a few years, Clowes acquired twenty steam powered printing machines. He kept
them busy printing publications for the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, including
the Penny Magazine, edited by Charles Knight (which reached a circulation of 200,000 copies)
and the Penny Cylopaedia. By 1839, Clowes expanded his business into type founding, a
practice usually considered a trade unto itself and uncommonly undertaken by printers (Clair
1965: 225). Through this practice he reportedly supplied his compositors with 50,000 new sorts
(bits of type) per day. He also undertook stereotyping on a large scale. In 1839 the Clowes
premises held more than 1,600 formes of standing type, about 100 tons of free type, about 2,000
tons of weight in stereotype plates, and 50,000 woodcuts on hand from which stereotype casts
were taken and sent to various printers across Europe (Clair 1965: 231, Smiles 1885: 214). He
employed 500 people directly and many more indirectly (Smiles 1885: 214). Even in a time
when industrialization was rapid, Clowes mid-nineteenth century printing establishment was
gigantic, considered by some one of the largest in the world (Clair 1965: 228). Because of his
association with the SDUK and his printing of many educational works aimed at the middle and
working classes, the reformer and educational advocate Samuel Smiles wrote that “[William
Clowes’] name is entitled to be permanently associated, not only with the industrial, but also
with the intellectual development of our time” (Clair 1965: 229).
In 1819 when Andrew and Robert Spottiswoode succeeded their uncle Andrew Strahan in his
London printing business, one of the first steps the brothers took was to install steam printing.

21

Investments of this kind in the early days of the technology did not come cheaply: the steam

1998: 70).

The mathematician and printer William Spottiswoode was related to the business (as Andrew Spottiswoode's
son). In 1846 William took over the title of Queen's Printer and ran the government printing side of the family
business.

39

engine itself cost £782, the Applegath perfecting machine £1200, the foundry £735. By 1832
Robert died and Andrew became the sole proprietor. In 1837 a fire consumed one of the
Spottiswoode’s printing sites, and records of the fire document how large the operation was at
that time. The quantity of destroyed books totaled an estimated value of twenty thousand pounds.
Some of the lost works included spelling and other school-books for Longman’s and Co., various
novels for Bentley, an edition of Shakespeare, various law-books, books commissioned by John
Murray (including works by Lord Byron), the greater part of the forthcoming volume of
Lardner's Cyclopaedia, and other works from a large variety of London's publishers (AustenLeigh 1912: 39).
Both Clowes and A&R Spottiswoode were heavily capitalized in steam printing technology
making it possible in the 1830s for each to produce large numbers of books at a lower price. This
was not typical of all book printers at the time. Oxford applied steam printing in 1834 (eleven
years after William Clowes), however these presses were used only for the production of Bibles.
At the time, printers who applied steam technology to the production of regular trade books
could produce many books at a lower unit cost than other book printers. This makes the
application of steam printing a significant aspect of a book’s production history if it was printed
this way in the early half of the nineteenth century. In general, print was becoming increasingly
prolific during the nineteenth century (Eliot 1994). However, books were still considered a
luxury, a fact particularly apparent in times of economic depression (Barnes 1985). Books in the
Cabinet Cyclopaedia and Penny Cyclopaedia series were priced at three to six shillings. Books
in the Library of Useful Knowledge series sold for sixpence. Through such series, large numbers
of books were made available at cheap prices. Conceivably, such books could come into contact
with a greatly expanded population.

22

22

The average price of a new novel in the 1820s was 10s. 6d. Buying a book for this price was considered a luxury
in 1818 (Barnes 1985: 211). In his extensive study of the nineteenth century book trade, Simon Eliot defines ‘cheap
books’ as having a price of 3s. 6d. or less. The Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge’s publications were
on the leading edge of what would become a wave of cheap books. Eliot observes that in the late 1840s and
throughout the 1850s, cheap books rose to dominance within the book trade. Eliot also notes that frequently a book’s
low price correlated with longer and more frequent print runs, i.e. higher circulation (Eliot 1994: 24).

40

The author of numerous volumes on natural philosophy for the Cabinet Cyclopaedia series,
Dionysius Lardner was deeply involved in broadening the audience for technical subjects during
his day. When Lardner came to London from Dublin in 1827, he had already graduated from
Trinity College Dublin (BA 1817, MA 1819) and received numerous prizes in logic, metaphysics
and mathematics, including a gold medal for lectures on the steam engine (Peckham 1951: 39).
By the time he took up the first professorship of natural philosophy and astronomy at the newly
founded University College, he had already published a number of treatises on mathematical and
technical subjects. During his time in London he continued his involvement in the writing and
editing of books on mechanics, hydrostatics and mathematics for a popular audience.
Bibliographer Morse Peckham sees Larder's work in populist educational publishing as not
strictly motivated by altruism but also a product of identifying a newly available market and
capitalizing on it. Peckham particularly sees Lardner's involvement in the Cabinet Cyclopaedia
series this way. The cheap and quick printing offered by steam-power suddenly opened up the
middle and working classes as customers for books. This economic opportunity dovetailed with a
political movement that viewed education as a benevolent and civilizing force for the lower
classes. Peckham writes, “out of this situation of spreading literacy and agitation for political,
social and educational reform came the Cabinet Cyclopaedia, edited by one of the men who saw
the possibilities for simultaneously extending knowledge and making money, Dr. Dionysius
Lardner” (Peckham 1951: 39).
The Cabinet Cyclopaedia series was comprised of sixty-one titles issued in 133 parts, published
between 1829 and 1846. Dionysius Lardner was the series editor of this large project. Excluding
unnamed authors, thirty-eight authors contributed to the series, and a number of them wrote
books in the area of natural philosophy. Natural philosophy and natural history formed a large
quantity of the material in the Cyclopaedia comprising 27 (nearly half) of the 61 titles published.
The titles within the natural philosophy section included Augustus De Morgan’s book An Essay
on Probabilities and on their Applications to Life Contingencies and Insurance Offices (1838).
Dionysius Lardner’s contributions include separate volumes on heat, hydrostatics, and
electricity, as well as Treatise on Arithmetic Practical and Theoretical (1834) and A Treatise on
Geometry and its Application in the Arts (1840). Astronomer Sir John Herschel contributed
Astronomy (1833) and A Preliminary Discourse on the Study of Natural Philosophy (1831).

41

David Brewster contributed Optics (1831). Henry Kater co-authored with Lardner a volume on
Mechanics (1831).
Printed by A&R Spottiswoode, each volume of the Cabinet Cyclopaedia series sold for six
shillings, a price that made it affordable for the middle class but slightly out of reach of the
working class, the audience intended for the Penny Cyclopaedia. The Cabinet Cyclopaedia was
popular enough that an American printer began pirating the work almost at once (Peckham 1951:
43). The series spawned many titles that continued to be in demand for years afterwards.
Herschel’s books on natural philosophy and astronomy, De Morgan’s book on probabilities, and
Lardner’s contributions, were reprinted many times. Though the dissemination of cheap books,
particularly on subjects most often reserved for cultured or educated society, the Cabinet
Cylcopaedia series played a role in nurturing popular interest in these subjects.
Thomas Peacock’s satirical novel of 1831, Crotchet Castle, gives some context for how the
popularizing spirit was affecting the nation in the early nineteenth century. In the book, the main
character Reverend Doctor Folliott (a learned, middle-aged clergyman) exclaims, “God bless my
soul, sir! …I am out of all patience with this march of mind. Here has my house been nearly
burned down, by my cook taking it into her head to study Hydrostatics, in a six-penny tract,
published by the Steam Intellect Society…My cook must read his rubbish in bed; and as might
naturally be expected, she [sic] dropped suddenly fast asleep, overturned the candle, and set the
curtains in a blaze” (Peacock 1831: 19). Dr. Dionysius Lardner’s treatise on Hydrostatics and
Pneumatics (published in April 1831, part of the Cabinet Cyclopaedia series) is the book being
parodied here (Peckham 1951: 37). References to Lardner’s book in popular literature (despite,
notably, the cook having been put asleep by reading it!) indicate that his books had a public
impact in their day.
Lardner’s popular edition of Euclid for the use of schools, printed by Clowes in 1828, was also a
successful publishing venture. The University of London opened for instruction in October of
1828, and Lardner’s book was ready to fill student demand. He self-published this version of
Euclid and had it printed by Clowes, who by that time had on hand their twenty steam printing
machines. The ability of these machines to print books cheaply may have meant that the price of
Lardner’s Euclid undercut the price of other Euclids in the marketplace. Moreover, Clowes had
the capability to stereotype the book and produce subsequent editions quickly and as needed.

42

June Barrow-Green in her survey of English Euclids notes that Lardner’s Euclid was very
successful, being reprinted for the twelfth time by 1861 (Barrow-Green 2006: 13). While it may
have been the presentation of the book that made it successful, qualities dictated by the
circumstance of its printing, such as price, abundance, and timing, facilitated by Clowes intense
capitalization in steam-powered printing technology, may have played a part in the success and
longevity of the edition.
William Clowes and A&R Spottiswoode applied the power of steam printing to popular and
educational works on technical subjects. This unique marriage paired content often considered
specialized or particularly learned with a printer capable of producing the material in a large
volume and at a price that facilitated a broad audience for these works. It is well known that the
application of steam printing to book and newspaper production contributed to what Peacock
referred to in Crotchet Castle as the “march of mind”. However, it is significant within the
history of mathematics that mathematical subjects had some place within the diffusion-ofknowledge movement. Titles on technical subjects were written for the non-specialist audience
and made affordable to middle class and working class audiences. That William Clowes and
A&R Spottiswoode printed these materials in vast quantity was one way in which mathematical
subjects achieved greater exposure in the early nineteenth century period.
According to Peckham, “the revolution of literacy, partly the result of the spread of liberal ideas
by the French Revolution, partly of the desire to combat those ideas by teaching the poor to read
the Bible and religious tracts, was to have an effect on modern society almost as profound as the
industrial and agricultural revolutions” (Peckham 1951: 38). To what degree numeracy might
have developed hand-in-hand with literacy during the same period is an open question worth
considering. Possibly similar social forces brought about a wider familiarity with mathematics at
the same time that public literacy was increasing. Before simple mathematics became a pillar of
a public education system and before barriers to higher education were removed, these
publishing ventures in the diffusion-of-knowledge movement were early attempts to make this
material more broadly accessible.

Scholarly printers Oxford University Press and Cambridge
University Press

As one of the two learned presses in England, Oxford University Press produced mathematical
books since it was founded in the fifteenth century. A variety of editions of Euclid, for instance,
were produced by the press in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries (see Carter
1975, for a list). They published works by the Savilian Professors of Geometry and Astronomy,
authors such as John Wallis, David Gregory, Edmund Halley, and Christian Huygens.
While Oxford University Press entered the nineteenth century a small to medium sized
publishing house, it emerged in the twentieth century a publishing giant. In 1994 it was gauged
as the largest university press in the world (Balter 1994). However, the Press’ development in the
nineteenth century until very recently had remained opaque, as no comprehensive history of the
press had yet been released. Fortunately, Oxford University Press just received comprehensive
historical treatment, as a multivolume history edited by Simon Eliot was published in the fall of
2013.

23

One crucial factor that shaped both Cambridge University Press and Oxford University Press
over the course of the nineteenth century was their involvement in the printing of Bibles. This
fact played an important role their development as scholarly printers. The Bible movement,
which began in England in 1804 with the founding of the British and Foreign Bible Society, was
a cultural force that transformed both Cambridge University Press and Oxford University Press
as printers. By 1816, the Bible society had 236 auxiliaries and 305 active branches spread out
over the United Kingdom (Clair 1965: 250). The society was one of the printing industry’s
largest clients in the first half of the nineteenth century. It commissioned the printing of millions
of Bibles, and because of an ancient law regulating the printing of these so-called ‘privileged
books’, Oxford University Press, Cambridge University Press, and the Queens Printers shared
the exclusive right to print the Bible and associated religious texts of the Church of England. The
Bible society’s mission to make available cheap religious books reorganized and transformed the

British printing trade, and particularly the presses at Oxford and Cambridge, who reorganized
themselves in the early nineteenth century to serve the demands of this powerful client.
Historian Leslie Howsam has characterized the effect of the Bible movement on the printing
industry this way: “That nineteenth century Britain was deeply attached to its Bible as the
source-book of Protestant Christianity is well known; the text did not, however, enter the minds
and hearts of its readers without the mediation of publishers and printers” (Howsam 1991: xiii).
The British and Foreign Bible Society was such a ubiquitous presence within early Victorian
24

culture that its organizing effects were completely taken for granted (Howsam 1991: xv).

When the British and Foreign Bible Society began purchasing Bibles in 1804, the extraordinary
numbers in which they demanded books, combined with Oxford and Cambridge’s exclusive
ability to fill this need, placed extraordinary demands on each university press. The development
of stereotype, machine printing and papermaking were developed for and then perfected by the
work each did on the mass production of Bibles. In the process of working for the Bible societies
both presses at Oxford and Cambridge developed the technology and supply-chain necessary to
mass-produce books. The Bible having primed the pump, these printers went on to apply the
same industrial capacity for the projects of other clients, and other markets, later in the century.
In this way, the Bible movement had an important organizing force on these two academic
publishing houses, making both uniquely equipped to serve as printers on other large and
complicated printing projects.
In the case of Cambridge University Press, their involvement with the Bible trade had specific
beneficial effects on their printing of scholarly work. Their presses were kept in good condition
and up to date. They invested in their stock of type; when it became worn they replaced it. The
demand for Bibles brought about their early application of stereotyping, a process that the Pitt

24

When Charles Babbage and Michael Slegg founded the Analytical Society at Cambridge, they took as inspiration
the activities of the British and Foreign Bible Society. Babbage conceived of the Analyticals as purveyors of the
French math text Traité élémentaire by Silvestre Lacroix. In jest he modeled their mathematical agenda to parody
the controversy over the British and Foreign Bible Society’s policy on whether or not the Bible should be distributed
with commentary. Babbage set out the Analyticals’ agenda: “that we should have periodical meetings for the
propagation of d’s; and [consign] to perdition all who support the heresy of dots” (d’s and dots being symbolic of
the rival notations for the calculus bring used on the continent versus in Britain). It maintained that the work of
Lacroix was “so perfect that any comment was unnecessary” (Babbage, quoted in Enros 1983: 27, 44 f.n.2).

45

Press began using in the very earliest days of its development as a technique (McKitterick 2004a:
32). For an extremely large work like the Bible, which contains nearly 800,000 words, every
page of an octavo edition required some 5,000 pieces of metal to compose it. Despite the
vigilance of proofreaders, the possibility of errors due to the mixing up of letters was very great.
Because of the way in which stereotyped plates could be corrected, printers learned to apply this
technology to reproduce an accurate text through multiple editions. Because of the skills and
technologies Cambridge University Press had acquired from the printing of Bibles, it had
become by mid-century a highly skilled and well-equipped printing house. These investments
benefited all clients who subsequently commissioned work from the Press (for example,
Macmillan and Company, who used Cambridge University Press as their printer for almost all
their mathematical books). The skills of a highly trained printing house were especially
beneficial for the production of scholarly works that demanded precision and an unusual
attention to detail in the composition and printing process. Mathematics was one such subject
that benefitted from the experience of Cambridge University Press staff. Trained by the demands
of the Bible trade, the Press could apply its learning and experience to the preparation of other
25

complicated texts, for instance, mathematics.

Oxford University Press also benefited from their involvement with Bible work. In 1834 Oxford
installed their first steam-powered presses, which vastly expanded their output of Bible work. At
Oxford, close to half a million Bibles were printed between 1808 and 1815. After the installation
of the steam-printing machines, roughly two and a half million Bibles were printed in the same
number of years after that (Barker 1978: 44). This is an astonishingly large number of books to
have been produced by a printer at this time. In 1822 Oxford had for sale nineteen different
editions of the Bible, nine editions of the New Testament, and twenty-one different prayer books,
ranging in price from over five pounds for a royal folio Bible to eight pence for a small pocketsized prayer book. In 1895, Oxford University Press had seventy-eight different editions of the
Bible available.

25

McKitterick notes that the standards for proof reading at Cambridge were high, because readers accustomed to
proofing the Bible and Prayer Book developed rigorous skills. This fact was appreciated by clients such as
Macmillan, who themselves had high standards for printing (McKitterick 2004b: 66).

46

However, because Oxford's “Bible press” and “Learned press” operated separately until 1882,
the benefits of investment arising from the Bible business did not cross over to benefit the
printing of scholarly books in the same way that it did at Cambridge. Only when Oxford’s press
began losing lucrative contracts to print the Bible did it decide to venture more seriously into the
business of publishing, at the same time reinvesting in its learned press. In May 1863 Alexander
Macmillan (the head of London publisher Macmillan and Co.) was appointed publisher to
Oxford University. The publishing arm of the Oxford University Press was called the Clarendon
Press. During the nineteenth century Oxford published about one hundred and fifty titles within
the subjects of mathematics, science and medicine, as well as printing on commission other
books for Oxford authors and booksellers. Some of the significant titles they produced include
William Thomson and Peter Guthrie Tait’s Treatise on Natural Philosophy (1867), James Clerk
Maxwell's A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism (1872), the Index Kewensis (1893–5), and
translations of German physiological and botanical works including August Weismann’s Essays
on Heredity (1889) (Topham 2013).
Because the height of the type used by Oxford's Bible press and height of type used by Oxford's
learned press was not equal, none of the type maintained for the Bible press could be assimilated
26

for use in the learned press, or vice versa.

In 1882 Oxford amalgamated their learned and Bible

presses, which had previously run as two independent businesses using separate sets of
equipment. At that time, the learned press was relying on then-antiquated machinery (Barker
1978: 50). Horace Hart, formerly of William Clowes and Sons (the London printing works)
became printer to Oxford in 1883. He subsequently bought new presses and purchased new fonts
of type for learned works (mainly from Germany). To go along with the reorganization, Hart
published his Rules for Compositors and Readers, in 1893.
At Cambridge, Bible work had benefits beyond just the rejuvenation of physical infrastructure.
For the first half of the nineteenth century, Bible work was the bread and butter business from

26

In 1688 Oxford had set up a ‘Bible press’ as a special department, separating this from the ‘Learned’ or Classical
Press (Clair 1965: 250). There was not a standard height of type in England until 1905, when the American point
system became general (Clair 1965: 271). Why the typefounders of England spurned standardization is unknown,
although Clair suggests that perhaps it was to prevent the lending of sorts among printers (Clair 1965: 269). France’s
typefounders Fournier and Didot made the first efforts to set standards for type size, and the system was generally
adopted in France in 1801 and in Germany shortly thereafter. By 1890, most American type founders had adopted
an American point system.

47

which they could pay for unprofitable ventures in the expensive realm of scholarly publishing.
McKitterick notes, “their privilege, permitted them to print the Bible and prayer book; and in the
second half of the eighteenth century these two books became the economic rocks on which it
was possible to build a structure of publications many of which required subsidy such as this
assured income could provide” (McKitterick 2004a: 40). The profitability of Bible printing
lasted until the mid-nineteenth century. For nearly a century the Bible business was a major
source of income from which Cambridge could finance its scholarly publishing program.
Until the mid-nineteenth century, Cambridge University Press’s business was oriented more
towards printing-for-hire (job printing for external clients) than its own publishing program. In
the 1850s, Cambridge offered a narrow list of books for sale, which appealed only to a small
audience, even among the academic population. By 1900, the Press’ printed catalogue spread to
164 pages, signaling how much the publishing side of the business had grown (McKitterick
2004b: 108). Much of the growth came when Cambridge University Press began publishing
textbooks and schoolbooks in the 1880s. The profits that flowed from sales of educational titles
became a new source from which scholarly books could be funded. Through the many transitions
the Press weathered as a printer-for-hire, it continued its commitment to scholarly publishing,
where in general titles moved slowly and some projects never recouped expense or would only
after many years.

27

McKitterick notes that the press carried on with scholarly projects with little

effort directed towards discovering the true cost of this part of their business (McKitterick
2004b: 110).
Among the collected works they undertook were G. G. Stokes Mathematical and Physical
Papers (5 volumes, 1880-1905) and the Mathematical and Physical Papers of Sir William
Thomson (6 volumes, 1882-1911).

28

These were multivolume works that required subsidy to

27

At the end of 1891 the press still held 1,144 sets of Isaac Barrow’s collected works in nine volumes, which had
been published in 1859. In eight years, only thirty-two sets had been sold or given away. During the same time the
stock of Whewell’s edition of Barrow's Mathematical Works (1860) had reduced by forty-two copies, from 367 to
325 (McKitterick 2004b: 112).
28

William Thomson acquired the title of Lord Kelvin in 1892. However, during the majority of his activities
discussed in this thesis, for instance in his role as editor of the Cambridge and Dublin Mathematical Journal (see
chapter three), he was still known as William Thomson. For the sake of consistency, he will be referred to as such
throughout this work.

48

produce. Sometimes a series such as these would not sell out for decades, which meant that
Cambridge University Press waited many years to recoup its investment. In particular, one
volume of Stokes’ mathematical papers produced at the end of 1884 required the allocation of a
portion of the Government Annuity Fund, a sum of £500 per annum, to fund its completion
(McKitterick 2004b: 92). The Government Annuity Fund was designed to support scholarly
publishing work that could not be expected to return a surplus. Subsidy of Stokes’ Mathematical
29

and Physical Papers signals that the Press deemed the work important but not profitable.

In the nineteenth century, Cambridge also published many single volume books (or monographs)
by prominent men of science. As either graduates, tutors, professors, or students, many of these
authors were in some way connected with Cambridge’s institutional focus on mathematics. Some
of the books on mathematical topics that the press released include J. Gow’s History of Greek
Mathematics (1884), A. R. Forsyth's Theory of Functions of a Complex Variable (1900), and S.
L. Loney’s Treatise on Elementary Dynamics with Solutions (1889-92). On physical topics they
produced A. Freeman’s translation of Fourier’s Analytical Theory of Heat (1878), and Maxwell's
edition of Henry Cavendish's electrical research. The Press also bought titles that had been
originally published or considered for publication elsewhere. For instance William Thomson and
P. G. Tait’s Treatise on Natural Philosophy and Elements of Natural Philosophy as well as Tait’s
Elementary Treatise on Quaternions, had originally been Oxford books (McKitterick 2004b:
103).
Cambridge also printed college level mathematical textbooks. R. T. Glazebrook, who was
appointed one of the first of the university’s mathematical lecturers in 1883, wrote a number of
such books for the Press. When a revision of the university’s statutes brought about reforms to
undergraduate education, one result was demand for suitable textbooks. For Cambridge
University Press, Glazebrook authored such texts as Mechanics and Hydrostatics (1895),
Electricity and Magnetism (1903), and Heat and Light (1894). Horace Lamb was also a major
author of textbooks for the press. He wrote A Treatise on the Motion of Fluids (1879), later

29

While mathematical books were often among the more carefully prepared and expensive books Cambridge
University Press produced, they were not always the most expensive. There were some extreme outlier projects in
terms of expense, for instance C. M Doughty's two-volume Arabia Deserta, costing £700 to produce 1000 copies in
1885 (McKitterick 2004b: 93).

49

revised and released as Hydrodynamics (1895), as well as Statics (1912) and Dynamics (1914).
Many of these were highly successful textbooks going into six or more editions (McKitterick
2004b: 103).
In the 1880s Cambridge entered the market in schoolbooks. Perhaps due to Cambridge’s
institutional concentration in mathematics, The Pitt Press’ school book series in mathematics
were aimed at a higher level than some others publisher’s school math books, and were pitched
higher than titles in other subjects in their general educational series. Titles from the Pitt Press’
mathematical series include H. M. Taylor’s Euclid (1893) and S. L. Loney’s Elements of Statics
and Dynamics (1891). Both of these texts were specifically aimed at school-aged students taking
examinations, a process that had been initiated by the 1870 Education Act (McKitterick 2004b:
78). By 1903 the Pitt Press series had 300 titles, including many in science and mathematics.
The Cambridge name had a connection to excellence in mathematics. In the 1870s publisher Bell
and Sons issued a “Cambridge Mathematical Series”, although it lacked any connection to
Cambridge (McKitterick 2004b: 80). The Press at Cambridge didn’t defend their ownership over
the title until later. It was only in the late nineteenth century that Cambridge developed a sense of
itself as a publisher, developing at the same time a more proprietary attitude toward its name and
connection to excellence in mathematics.
In the 1870s and 1880s University Printer C. J. Clay established a hierarchy of format for all
Cambridge University Press books. This hierarchy used the physical form of the book to confer
status on certain authors and projects. James Clerk Maxwell’s collected papers, for instance,
were printed in the largest size, royal quarto (for an explanation of book sizes, see footnote 38).
This was slightly larger than the collected works of John Couch Adams and Arthur Cayley
(which were printed in demy quarto size). Smaller still were the volumes of William Thomson,
in the demy octavo size. On the shelf, Maxwell’s books would be the largest; thus a value
judgment about the work was subtly stated by the work itself. By the early years of the twentieth
century, many mathematical books were printed in blue binding in the demy octavo size. More
ordinary textbooks were treated to the crown octavo size (McKitterick 2004b: 110). The
collected papers of G. H. Darwin, William Thomson (Lord Kelvin), Lord Rayleigh, G. G. Stokes
and the thirteen volumes of Arthur Cayley’s collected papers in mathematics were among the so-

50

called “big blue books” the press produced in the late nineteenth century period. These books
remained a staple of the Press’ back catalogue for years to come.

7. Journal printers Taylor and Francis
Richard Taylor and William Francis’ firm Taylor and Francis have been identified previously as
a major nineteenth century printer of mathematics (Secord 2009: 466). As a printer, Taylor and
Francis served many of London's scientific societies, and for some time were the printers of the
Royal Society’s Philosophical Transactions, in which many mathematical papers appeared. They
also published the physical and natural science oriented Philosophical Magazine. While they
printed books, Taylor and Francis were most preoccupied with the printing and publishing of
journals. Many of these journals, newly founded in the nineteenth century, reflect a growing
community of practitioners concerned with scientific topics.

30

In the 1830s, Richard Taylor attended meetings of many of London's scientific societies. Starting
in 1827 Taylor began printing “Taylor’s calendar of the meetings of the scientific bodies of
London”. A single-sided broadsheet tightly packed with information, this document at one
glance speaks remarkably to the breadth of activity among London’s knowledgeable class.
Comparing Taylor’s calendar over some of the years it was issued, one can gather the appearance
31

and disappearance of specific groups amidst the overall growth of scientific activity in general.

Taylor’s activities brought him into contact with many members of Britain's scientific elite. One
of the firms’ bestselling books was Michael Faraday’s Experimental Researches in Electricity of
1839, which was composed of Faraday's articles from the Philosophical Magazine. Because of
the way that Faraday had cross-referenced papers, a volume presenting the collected papers

30

Taylor and Francis’ publishing projects the 1840s and 50s reflect their connection to scientific London. These
publications include the Journal of the Geological Society, Transactions of the Linnean Society, The Annals and
Magazine of Natural History, The Chemical Gazette, The Journal of Entomology, The Ibis: A Magazine of General
Ornithology, Transactions of the Zoological Society, and the Journal of the Photographic Society. Other learned
clients of the press included the Royal Society (for their Philosophical Transactions), The British Museum (for
catalogues), the British Meteorological Society, the Royal College of Surgeons of England, and the Royal Botanic
Society (See listings in Check Book, 1845-1860, Taylor and Francis Papers, St. Bride Printing Library, London
UK).

51

proved to be a desirable commodity. Other best selling titles included a popular manual of the
barometer and a work of natural theology (Brock and Meadows 2003: 44). Of the scientific
books Taylor and Francis published, it was often through Taylor’s personal connection to the
scientific societies, or editorship of the Philosophical Magazine, that introductions to authors and
their respective publishing projects came about.
Taylor generally employed between twenty and thirty compositors (Brock and Meadows 2003:
38, 45). A list of the typical weekly jobs in 1832 shows that a great majority of their work was
devoted to composing learned materials of one sort or another, with a large portion devoted to
subjects within natural history and science (Brock and Meadows 2003: 45). A scan of Taylor and
Francis’ costing book for the years 1854-60, shows that they set mathematics for experts and
students alike, composing mathematical papers for the Philosophical Transactions and setting
examinations papers for Woolwich’s Royal Military Academy and the East India Company.
Other projects from these years include Richard Potter’s Physical Optics (1856), Useful
Information for Engineers by William Fairbairn (1856), A New View of Electrical Action by
Richard Laming (1858) and Rev. W. Foster’s Examples in Arithmetic (1856).
At Taylor and Francis, an experienced printer of scientific materials, the composition of
mathematics incurred higher costs than the composition of more routine jobs. Taylor’s detailed
records and costing books show extra changes routinely applied to the composition of
mathematical pages. In the case of Arthur Cayley’s “An Introductory Memoir upon Quantics”, a
paper from volume 144 of the Philosophical Transactions, its eight pages of text incurred an
extra 16 shillings levy. Cayley’s paper, while not too symbol laden, does use some unusual sorts.
Of the 143 pages in volume 144 of the Transactions, published in 1854, Taylor charged an extra
£15 for all the mathematics.

32

In general, the company’s record books confirm that mathematical

composition incurred additional charges that were added to regular charges for composing. The
suggestion by Spottiswoode et al that mathematics cost one-third more to compose than regular
English text is confirmed by Taylor and Francis’ checkbook records.

52

James Secord’s observations that printing science often required special techniques, in the form
of precise illustrations or unusual symbolism, is certainly observed in the history of Taylor and
Francis. In the early years, Taylor made his reputation as a specialized printer when he undertook
the printing of Flora Graeca by the Oxford botanist John Sibthrop. Taylor printed the first of ten
folio volumes in 1806. The entire series included 966 coloured plates (Brock and Meadows
2003: 28). Some of these books were costly and the specialized work proved troublesome, such
as when George Grave’s Flora Londonensis (1818-1834) was plagued by the cost of engravers’
bills (Brock and Meadows 2003: 43). But by the 1840s, records indicate that the firm was careful
to enumerate extra costs relating to both mathematical composition and any engravings needed
to produce the illustrations required. For instance, Taylor’s records indicate the one hundred and
one figures in Richard Potter’s Physical Optics, added approximately £3 to the cost of
33

production.

Taylor and Francis’ development as printers and publishers reflects a growing awareness of how
to manage the costs associated with publishing scientific materials. They placed limits on the
number of illustrations appearing in some of their periodicals, and levied extra per-page changes
for the composition of mathematics (Brock and Meadows 2003: 125).

Mathematical typesetting at Cambridge, Principia
Mathematica (1910)

Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead's three-volume logical work Principia
Mathematica provides an interesting case study in the difficulty of mathematical typesetting. It
confirms some of the factors that made technical printing difficult. It was time consuming to
compose, it required a skilled compositor to do the job, and the book required typefaces to be
newly founded. As such it is a good example of how some specialized mathematical printing
could be difficult. The manuscript required a printer experienced in specialist works and it was
extremely expensive to produce.
Principia Mathematica was an unusually complex and massive work, intellectually and
physically. Its manuscript was enormous at an estimated five to six thousand hand-written leaves

33

Check Book 1845-1860, p. 71, Taylor and Francis Papers, St. Bride Printing Library, London UK.

53

of paper (Linsky and Blackwell 2005: 143). The manuscript was so large and the symbols it
employed so unusual that it was never typed or even copied. In October of 1909, Russell packed
the first 4000 leaves of original handwritten manuscript into two large crates, and in this manner
he transported it by rail from London to Cambridge.

34

Russell described the notation used in Principia as party invented, partly based on the logical
notation of George Boole, Ernst Schröder and Giuseppe Peano (Grattan-Guinness 1975: 97).
Although many of the symbols it uses can be found in other Cambridge books, there is some
evidence suggesting that in fact special types were specifically cast for the job of printing this
book.

35

There is also evidence that only one compositor at the Cambridge University Press set the
manuscript in type. In 1910, while the manuscript was in press, Russell informed a
correspondent “there is only one compositor who can read our queer symbols”.

36

Whitehead’s

biographer Victor Lowe also suggested this, describing the printing process as slow going since
only one compositor could manage it (Lowe 1985: 289). The few existing manuscript leaves
have the name “Rackham” penciled in and circled in the margin above the instruction for the
next printers’ sheet. Comparing these marks to similar ones on other manuscripts of Russell had
printed at Cambridge, Kenneth Blackwell surmises that Rackham is the name of the compositor
to whom the manuscript of Principia Mathematica was assigned (Linsky and Blackwell 2005:
153).
If, in fact, Principia Mathematica was composed by Mr. Rackham alone, this would have been a
highly unusual way for a book to have been composed. As was standard practice at most printing
houses, at Cambridge compositors traditionally worked in ships (teams), dividing up the text of a
manuscript and composing different sections in parallel so as to maximize efficiency

54

(McKitterick 2004b: 135). While all compositors at the Cambridge University Press received
special training in mathematics, one can imagine that Principia Mathematica, a work that pushed
many intellectual boundaries and in the process defined its own unique language, would have
challenged the most experienced compositors of mathematical work. If in fact only one
compositor could handle setting its text, then this remarkable book was equally remarkable for
how challenging it was to typeset.
There is also evidence that suggests this manuscript was set directly into pages, and that Russell
and Whitehead did not see galley proofs. Likely someone at the press (perhaps Mr. Rackham)
made the decision about how to break the manuscript into printed pages of formula, after which
Russell received printer’s sheets for correction and proofreading (Linsky and Blackwell 2005:
142).
When comparing the few pages of extant manuscript and the printed book, it is possible to
observe certain compositional decisions, for instance the choice of where to make line-breaks
and appropriate spacing between symbols. As Blackwell noted, “the lines of formulae were laid
out, sometimes realigned under major operators, and broken according to professional standards,
although the positioning of references was not changed; a period was inserted after theorem
numbers and the heading “Dem” to accord with Cambridge house-style; and—important for
readability—the relative spacing of the symbols now reflected syntactic elements. No
instructions for the manuscript’s passage into print were marked on the extant leaves, yet the
whole attained an austere typographical beauty” (Linsky and Blackwell 2005: 152).
The three volumes of Principia Mathematica were printed in 750, 500 and 500 copies
respectively. Somewhat predictably for the nature of the book, the first edition was neither
stereotyped nor electrotyped, suggesting the publisher did not expected a second printing.

37

Each

printer’s sheet, once corrections were final, were printed off in the required number without
waiting for the entire volume to be completed in type. Blackwell surmises that from each
printer’s sheet the type was distributed “otherwise a stock of many thousands of unusual types

55

would have been necessary” (Linsky and Blackwell 2005: 154). By the time Cambridge
University Press reprinted the book in 1926, the type was not standing.
In 1909 the Syndics of the press consented to publish the book, but balked at absorbing the entire
cost of such an expensive project. They were willing to take a loss of £600, not the full £920 loss
that was estimated. The Royal Society’s relief fund agreed to chip in £200 towards its
publication, and Russell and Whitehead agreed to split the remaining £100. This lead Russell to
later quip that both authors had thus “earned minus £50 each for ten years work” (see GrattanGuinness 1975: 102).

9. Mathematical illustrations in print
Prior to 1800, copperplate engraving offered an alternative to woodcuts when mathematical
illustrations were required (recall descriptions of the woodcut and wood engraving methods in
section 2 of this chapter). With an engraver of average skill, fairly complicated and detailed
diagrams could be achieved using an intaglio method on copperplate. Intaglio is a process in
which details to be printed are scratched, engraved, or otherwise etched into a flat metal surface.
Ink is wiped or pushed into these indentations and the plate is polished with muslin or light
fabric, wicking away ink from the highest surfaces, leaving ink in the recesses or troughs. The
impression is taken with the pressure of a rolling press on a piece of dampened paper.
In 1800 the intaglio process had two main drawbacks as a method of book illustration. Copper,
as a softer metal, lost certain engraved details after the force of a few hundred impressions. Also,
printing intaglio plates was more laborious than printing a wood cut. The intaglio process
required a different press altogether than that for moveable type printing or relief wood blocks,
and often printers specialized in one method or the other, but not both.
In practice, the use of copperplate as an illustration technique meant that detailed images could
not be integrated within the textual pages of a book. Most books that included copperplate
illustrations had foldout pages in which all the figures were presented together, most likely
bound into the back of the book. Intaglio printed frontispieces were common, as these could be
added fairly easily onto the front of the first signature of a book. They either would have had a

56

stub that wrapped around the first gathering of pages or would have been tipped in (i.e., glued to
the leaf it was facing).

38

Amassing all the figures for a technical work into a few pages at the back of a book often had the
effect of removing what might have been a helpful visual referent from the text to which it was
associated. Robin Rider in her study of early modern algebra has even suggested a connection
between the use of copperplate technology as a dominant form for printed illustrations and the
disappearance of visual materials in works about algebra during this time (Rider 1982). She
writes that the printer’s necessity of separating illustrations from the relevant text reinforced a
trend within mathematics itself: “over the course of the 17th and 18th centuries, analysis of
mathematical relationships as expressed in the formalism of algebraic language grew even more
distant from geometric context as depicted in diagrams, just as all diagrams were relegated to the
back of the book” (Rider 1993: 99).
Henry Kater and Dionysius Lardner's Treatise on Mechanics (1831), which was part of the
Cabinet Cyclopaedia series, has 21 pages of intaglio illustrations at the back of the book,
containing 224 figures. I would imagine this arrangement would not have been ideal, as it
requires the reader to continually turn pages to refer to diagrams. Likely the figures were deemed
too detailed for wood engraving, and thus were printed intaglio, a process that could capture
more detail. Although wood engraving became a popular illustration method in the nineteenth
century, mathematical books continued to be illustrated using intaglio printed figures, for
example John Henry Pratt’s Mathematical Principles of Mechanical Philosophy (1845). Pratt’s
book was an early co-publication of the Macmillan brothers, and was printed at the Cambridge
University Press. Like Kater and Lardner’s Treatise on Mechanics, Pratt’s book also uses
intaglio printed illustrations, the effect being that the figures are collected in pages at the back of
the book (see figure 9).

A “signature” or a “gathering” is the term used to describe the packet of pages created by folding a printer’s
sheet. A printer’s sheet is one large piece of paper printed on both sides. If a printer’s sheet is folded once to make a
signature, it is referred to as folio size (producing two leaves, or four pages). When a printer’s sheet is folded twice
it makes the quarto size (with four leaves, eight pages), folded three times it makes an octavo (with eight leaves,
sixteen pages), folded four times makes the duodecimo or twelvemo size (with twelve leaves, twenty-four pages),
folding five times forms the sextodecimo or sixteenmo size (with sixteen leaves, or thirty-two pages).

57

Prior to 1800, woodcutting was the other method in which illustrations could be produced for a
book. Woodcuts could be placed next to moveable type; thus this method allowed for images to
be integrated with text. However, fine detail was more difficult to achieve in a woodcut.
Woodcuts were also prone to splintering. If a line was broken or a label on a diagram was
obscured because a piece of wood had chipped off in the printing process, the diagram could be
rendered inaccurate or a certain crucial meaning of the diagram lost.
An example of the woodcut technique as used in a mathematical text can be found in Robert
Simson's Euclid of 1762. In it woodcuts are used throughout the text. The letters identifying
vertices are cut from the wood and appear rather large (see figure 7). As the book progresses the
diagrams become more complicated. In these later diagrams it is evident that only so much
complexity could be achieved using the woodcutting method (see examples on pages 50, 218,
and 225 of Simson’s Euclid).
Because of the different limitations posed by both the woodcutting and copperplate techniques,
wood engraving coming into greater use after 1800 must have been a boon to mathematical
authors – or at least those who felt that visual representations assisted with the comprehension of
39

their work.

As mentioned, wood engraving meant that more detailed diagrams could be placed

within the body text and were less subject to wear or damage through extensive use in printing.
In Richard Potter’s An Elementary Treatise on Mechanics (1846), the detail in the line suggests
40

that its illustrations were produced using the wood engraving technique (see figure 8).

The

incredibly small and precise letters used to identify vertices may have been created by drilling
holes in the wood block so that actual pieces of cast type could be used in the place of engraved
letters. A level of delicacy and detail are achieved in the illustrations in Potter’s book that sets
these in contrast to the wood cut diagrams in Simson’s Euclid.

39

In the preface to his Mécanique Analytique, Lagrange proudly wrote that “On ne trouvera point de Figurés dans
cet Ouvrage. Les methods que j'y expose ne demandent ni constructions, ni raisonnemens géométriques ou
mécaniques, mais seulement des operations algébriques” (Lagrange 1815: i).
40

Richard Potter was a professor of natural philosophy and astronomy at University College London. Potter’s
biography describes him as having been an incompetent teacher, whose views on optics (as a proponent of the
corpuscular theory), were ridiculed by his contemporaries who embraced the wave theory of light. Apparently Potter
had some difficulty keeping up with the increasing mathematization of physics. The conclusion of the ODNB article
about him is that Potter “made no significant contributions to science” (Cantor 2004).

Copperplate engraving was generally too easily worn to produce high-quality illustrations in
cheap mass-produced books. Pratt’s Mathematical Principles shows what can happen when an
intaglio illustration starts to become worn. In diagram number 56, from figure 9, the black lines
describing the architectural figure are beginning to dissolve into broken rather than solid lines.
This is a sign of wearing of the copperplate, or possibly, the result of a careless printer.
As of 1823 steel engraving offered an alternative to copperplate, using a similar printing process
yet resisting the wear of thousands of impressions on the press. Steel engraved plates were
expensive to commission. However, it could be a good investment if the images produced from
such plates could be sold many times, or if the plates themselves could be sold to another
publisher for further use after the initial printing.

41

41

Taylor and Francis had some illustrations

The practice of re-using illustrations was common practice. As Elizabeth Eisenstein points out, it was common
for early newspapers to use the same woodcut to represent several different cities, or the same portrait to represent
several individuals (Eisenstein 1979: vol. 1, 65). Engraved plates were valuable commodities bought and sold
between printers, and re-used for different purposes. Works of mathematics display evidence of this as well. The
lushly illustrated frontispiece for Henry Billingsley’s Euclid (1570) was originally commissioned for William
Cunningham’s The Cosmographical Glasse (1559), which explains why the frontispiece contains symbols of
geography rather than mathematics. William Whiston’s 1714 Euclid includes a ‘portrait’ of Euclid, as does

60

engraved on steel, for instance, for their journal Annals of Natural History (Brock and Meadows
2003: 125).
As technology changed rapidly, very many different printing techniques were in use at any given
time during the century. This multiplicity of printing techniques used in the printing trade lead to
experiments in which novel techniques were applied to mathematics. One fine example of this,
and a highly original use of colour in mathematical illustration, can been seen in Oliver Byrne's
The First Six Books of the Elements of Euclid published in London by William Pickering in
1847, and printed at the Chiswick press.
In his introduction, Byrne states “this work has a greater aim than mere illustration; we do not
introduce colours for the purpose of entertainment, or to amuse by certain combinations of tint
and form, but to assist the mind in its researches after truth, to increase the facilities of
instruction, and to diffuse permanent knowledge” (Byrne 1847: vii). His introduction attempts to
explain the existence of this most unusual book. Byrne defends the book’s aims as far more
serious than merely aesthetic. According to Byrne, the special diagrams make the process of
reasoning itself more precise, and the student’s attainment of mathematical reasoning “more
expeditious”. In fact, he claims that by using his book, the student of Euclid will acquire the
subject in less than a third the usual time devoted to studying it. Additional benefits include a
long-lasting retention of the material: “these facts have been ascertained by numerous
experiments made by the inventor [i.e. Byrne], and several others who have adopted his plans”
(Byrne 1847: ix).
In Byrne’s book, colours and shapes are used as the primary identifying characteristics of the
diagrams, instead of letterform labels. This provides an unusual alternative to the convention of
naming diagrams with letters that are used to connect the diagram to the written proof. In more
conventional books the letterforms ∆ABC are used to refer to a diagram of a triangle with

Sawbridge’s edition of Leeke and Serle’s 1661 Euclid (Barrow-Green 2006: 6, 9, 11). Since nothing is known about
the life of Euclid, these ‘portraits’ of him are spurious at best. In the nineteenth century, Charles Dodson re-used the
same engravings for his edition of Euclid in 1882 that had been created and used for Isaac Todhunter’s 1862 Euclid
(Barrow-Green 2006: 15). Although publishing and printing are commonly assumed to confer standardization and
accuracy to a text, this was not always the case (Eisenstein 1979: vol. 1, 65).

61

vertices labeled A, B, and C. In Byrnes book a tiny picture of a triangle, colour-coordinated with
its larger presentation as a full-blown figure, is how a diagram’s parts are identified and referred
to within a demonstration (see Figure 10, showing Proposition 6 in Book I).

Figure 10 Proposition 6, Book I from Oliver Byrne’s The First Six Books of the Elements
of Euclid (1847) (Source: Byrne 1847: 6)

While certainly a clever and visually interesting way to apprehend the connection between the
proofs of geometry and the constructions that accompany these proofs, it does not present as
radical a technique for comprehending geometry as Byrne had first claimed. It remains, however,
interesting that Byrne held this belief about the enlightening benefits of visual representation in
mathematics. Equally interesting is how a specialized printing technique was applied in this case
to create such unique mathematical illustrations. Byrne’s edition of Euclid is a beautiful piece of

62

fine printing, and must be one of the most aesthetically pleasing Euclids that exist. However, the
cost to produce a book such as this, in which every page is printed with four different colours,
must have been extremely high. The book was featured as an example of fine printing at the
Great Exhibition of 1851. Unfortunately, William Pickering’s expensive tastes put him into
bankruptcy in 1853 (Warrington 1990).
Prior to the nineteenth century, early printers of mathematics also experimented with unusual
printing and illustration techniques as a way to illustrate mathematical concepts. Rider points out
how in some eighteenth century books, movable cut out diagrams (called ‘volvelles’) depicted
the function of an astrolabe or guided the observation of comets. In this case, concentric paper
circles were attached to the page in the center such that their rotation could actually display the
position or rotation to be apprehended. Billingsley's Euclid (the first English edition, 1570)
included pop-up diagrams to illustrate concepts of modern geometry. The figures, made of paper,
were pasted into the book so that they could be opened up to create three-dimensional models of
the solid figures they represented (Barrow-Green 2006: 6). Sometimes these three-dimensional
“illustrations” remained only potentially illustrative if they had never been cut out and assembled
from the original bound-in printers sheet (Rider 1993: 102).
Outstanding books like Byrne's Euclid exemplify the kinds of elaborate illustration techniques
capable in craft book printing. These books belong to a tradition of experimental printing in
which new methods are employed to facilitating the teaching and learning of mathematics. In
contrast, books such as Todhunter's Plane Co-ordinate Geometry (see section 10 below) and
many other school math books of the period exemplify how nineteenth century printing
technology was harnessed for different effect, that is, to reproduce math books into the hundreds
of thousands of copies. The multiplicity of these books wielded a different sort of intellectual
influence on mathematics, as they were used by many generations of students. Even in earlier
centuries, books varied greatly according to the audience they were seeking and the cost paid to
produce them: Tartaglia's 16th-century Italian edition of Euclid was “aimed at the low end of the
market” while Commandino's Latin edition of 1572 was “a scholar's edition de luxe” (Rider
1993: 99). Similarly in the nineteenth century a variety of mathematical books continued to be
produced with different production values, aimed at different audiences, and serving different
purposes.

63

In her book The Printing Revolution in Early Modern Europe, Elizabeth Eisenstein claims that
the print medium itself shaped the evolution of science in ways that would not have been
explored or considered if it had remained in manuscript form. Her vision for the change printing
brought to science applies to mathematics as well. In particular, she notes how printing changed
the visual presentation of information, which in turn affected its comprehension. She writes,
“mathematical tables, for example, were also transformed. For scholars concerned with scientific
change, what happened to numbers and equations [during the printing revolution] is surely just
as significant as what happened to either images or words. Furthermore, many of the more
important pictorial statements produced during the first century of printing employed various
devices…to relate images to texts. To treat the visual aid as a discrete unit is to lose sight of the
connected links which were especially important for technical literature because they expressed
the relationship between words and things” (Eisenstein 1979: vol. 1, 26).

10. Engraved diagrams for Todhunter's Plane Co-ordinate
Geometry (1855)
Isaac Todhunter (1820-1884), who has retained some fame as the author of many textbooks, was
a Cambridge graduate and a mathematical lecturer. By some accounts he was an able
mathematician who wasted his talent on textbook authorship over the pursuit of highly original
mathematics. When Todhunter married he left his position as college fellow and took up work as
a private tutor, examiner and author.
Todhunter’s book A Treatise on Plane Co-ordinate Geometry, As Applied to the Straight Line
and the Conic Sections, With Numerous Examples was a beginner’s textbook published by what
then was a burgeoning new publisher, Macmillan and Company, in 1855. At 299 pages in length,
1250 copies were originally printed at Cambridge University Press and sold for 10 shillings and
6 pence. The book proved to be a success and went into several re-printings. A total of 27,750
copies were printed, the last edition being printed in 1888.

42

The book was distributed and sold

in London, Oxford, Edinbugh, Dublin, Cambridge, and possibly elsewhere.

64

For our purposes we will examine the production of the illustrations for this book, which
contained 63 wood engraved diagrams. Macmillan commissioned work from two engravers,
William Dodd and William Dickes, to fabricate Todhunter’s diagrams into engraved figures for
the book. Dodd’s illustrations appear on pages 133-163, with Dickes’ figures on the remaining
43

pages.

Two things are interesting about the correspondence between Macmillan and Todhunter, and
Macmillan and Dickes, regarding the composition of images for this book. As we discuss below,
Dodd was an experienced technical engraver, while Dickes was not. In doing engravings for
Todhunter’s book, Dickes received a kind of informal training, or on the job training, for the
technical illustrations he produced. Todhunter’s Plane Coordinate Geometry was the first book
Dickes illustrated for Macmillan, and it may have been his first experience producing technical
illustrations (Dickes set up business as an engraver in 1846).
Secondly, we can infer from these letters certain values that Macmillan and Todhunter (via
Macmillan’s intermediary letters) felt were important to successful mathematical illustration.
Successful mathematical illustrations are uniform, symmetrical, with identifying letters
appearing close to the proper parts. When a letter indicates an intersection it must be placed close
to this point in the corresponding angle. The appearance of pinched up corners (when lines meet
in vertices) detracts from the beauty and readability of the image. A bold style in the identifying
letters makes the diagram easier to read. When Dickes illustrations did not conform to these
qualities, they were sent back for revision.
Dickes’ informal education on how to do technical illustrations begins with Macmillan
instructing him to study Dodd’s work. In a letter to Todhunter, Daniel Macmillan writes: “Many
thanks for the trouble you have taken in writing about the woodcuts. I wrote to Mr. Dickes on
Saturday night and enclosed a sheet of Phear’s to show him how Dodd had done the thing. The
enclosed is his answer. Our fear is that no one but Mr. Dodd has mastered the woodcutting of

65

mathematical diagrams”.

44

However, as Macmillan goes on to explain, Mr. Dodd is very slow to

produce, which is why Macmillan has sought another engraver to do the work.
It appears that Todhunter was not too pleased with Dickes’ first efforts. The proofs of four
engravings were returned to Dickes with Todhunter’s corrections marked in pencil. Macmillan
cites “a want of uniformity” and work “done by some extremely timid hand” as the problem with
Dickes’ approach.

45

After Dickes sends a second round of proofs just two days later, Macmillan

relays that Todhunter’s estimate of these is actually worse: “We enclose you a specimen of the
woodcuts that we have been used to and we hoped for something better [from you]. But our
author thinks they are much worse and that they indicate a weak female hand. It is not impossible
that he may be too severe a critic. We shall be glad if those which you have still to send come up
46

to his standard”.

Macmillan again instructs Dickes to study carefully Dodd’s work. Macmillan sends him to a
nearby bookshop to borrow a copy of Goodwin’s Mathematical Course, telling him that in this
47

book, “you will see the kind of woodcuts we want”.

A few days later, Dickes produced something pleasing Macmillan. He writes to Dickes,
“Nothing could be better than these… They are all right except one – (which Mr. Todhunter has
corrected in pencil) the letters are beautiful but for the sake of uniformity they must be drilled
out to match the others”.

48

However within a few weeks time, Todhunter was again displeased to

44

Daniel Macmillan to Isaac Todhunter, 20 February 1855, MP 55376 General Letter Book 1854-55. Macmillan’s
reference to “Phear’s” is probably to J. B. Phear’s Elementary Mechanics, published by Macmillan in 1850.

46

Daniel Macmillan To William Dickes, 17 February 1855, MP 55376. It’s hard to know if Todhunter’s charge of
“a weak female hand” was brought about by specific knowledge or whether by this accusation he meant to
emphasize the inferiority of the engravings. Women may have worked as assistants in engraving houses. To my
knowledge, however, it was rare for a woman to be recognized as the engraver when such a name was signed to an
engraving.
47

Daniel Macmillan To William Dickes, 20 February 1855, MP 55376. In the letter, Macmillan identifies the
woodcuts in Goodwin’s Mathematical Course as being the work of Mr. Dodd (i.e., Harvey Goodwin’s An
Elementary Course of Mathematics, J. & J.J. Deighton, 1846).
48

Daniel Macmillan To William Dickes, 23 February 1855, MP 55376. The replacement of wood engraved letters
by drilling and fitting in their place precisely cast lead letters, was a technique apparently used to achieve greater

66

the point where entire diagrams had to be re-cut. Todhunter was, apparently, an author that
49

demanded high production values from his published work.

Macmillan writes to Dickes, “I will

call on you tomorrow…to talk about those woodcuts. We find that nothing will satisfy Mr.
Todhunter but having them recut, and with good letters. And he now wishes them upright like
those you sent down last. We hope under the circumstances you will do them justice or at any
rate make some … compromise. We cannot make him pay for these [revisions] and should very
much grudge to pay for them ourselves”.

50

A month later, trouble continued over accurate labeling of the diagrams. An unhappy Macmillan
wrote, “I shall remark that you people still do not seem to be fully impressed with the importance
of placing the letters close to the proper parts. In all cases where the letter is to refer to an
intersection it ought to be placed quite close to the angle. On looking carefully at Mr.
Todhunter’s drawings, it seems to me that an intelligent man … need find no difficulty in
reproducing his drawings from what has been sent. I must say I do not think proper care has been
taken”.

51

Even after Todhunter’s Plane Coordinate Geometry was in press, Macmillan continued to
express his feeling that in comparison to Dodd’s work, Dickes’ engravings lacked uniformity and
52

symmetry.

However, Macmillan felt that Dickes was trainable and that, in time, his skills for

this kind of work would equal the standards to which he was accustomed. Dickes had been
occupied by Todhunter’s book from early February until the end of May. By July, Todhunter’s
Plane Coordinate Geometry had been printed and its pages were at the binder. Macmillan

uniformity in the labeling of mathematical diagrams. Macmillan also mentions this in a letter to Dodd (Daniel
Macmillan to William Dodd, 23 February 1855, MP 55376).
49

Barrow-Green mentions this in (Barrow-Green 2001: 189). Apparently clarity was an issue to which Todhunter
attached great importance. In correspondence with the editor of his last two textbooks in 1877, Todhunter apparently
picked over publication details, on one occasion discussing the merits of having woodcuts printed in Paris as
opposed to London.

instructed Dickes to go take a look at the pages and compare his engravings to those that Dodd
produced. Macmillan notes that “Dodd’s diagrams …have a uniformity and symmetry yours
entirely want. We should very much like you to see the book and …to make diagrams … as like
53

Dodd’s as possible”.

Plane Coordinate Geometry was officially released on August 6, 1855.

Macmillan continued to employ Dickes on his next projects. Dickes engraved the diagrams for
Stephen Parkinson’s Mechanics (Macmillan, published on November 7, 1855) and Peter Guthrie
Tait and William John Steele’s A Treatise on the Dynamics of a Particle (Macmillan, published
on January 26, 1856).

55

With respect to his contributions to these works, Macmillan seems to

judge that Dickes’ style is improving, and that he has understood what is aesthetically required

68

for good mathematical illustration. In August, Macmillan writes “as far as we can judge from the
proofs the cuts are very good in all respects except that the corners have a pinched up look which
56

detracts both from their beauty and readability”.

In September, a minor criticism is levied: “as

far as we can gauge these you have sent [for Parkinson’s Mechanics] are very good except that a
57

little bolder style of letter would be better”.

By the end of September, Dickes is still completing new engravings and doing revisions on the
diagrams for these books. However, by early November Dickes moved on to his next
assignment. Macmillan had him do the engravings for Charles Kingsley’s book Heroes, or,
Greek fairy tales for my children (Macmillan, published on December 22, 1855). His instructions
were that all the engravings were to be finished so the book could be released in time for
Christmas. Macmillan promises that, “If you get ready in time we fancy we shall not disagree
about the price”.

58

Dickes’ work on Kingsley’s book is a departure from the technical style to which he had be
apprenticing from February to November. As a trade engraver Dickes is best known for his
colour printing, using wood engraving and lithography (Buchanan-Brown 1982: 48). Technical
illustration was not his only business. He illustrated natural history works for Charles Kingsley’s
books and also engraved many portraits. An 1890 edition of Glaucus contains interesting
examples of Dickes’ full colour renderings of undersea life using the chromolithography
technique. The frontispiece to Glaucus shows what kind of lush and aesthetically pleasing lines,
shades and tones Dickes was capable of as an engraver, when he worked in a completely
different genre from the mathematical one (see Figure 12).

Technical illustration comprised part of Dickes’ overall business enterprise. However, one would
never know that Dickes worked as an engraver for mathematical diagrams. Unlike his work in
other genres, he is not acknowledged in Todunter’s book. This anonymity separates Dickes’
mathematical engraving from his other work, as it was common for engravers to initial or sign
illustrations. In portraits, landscapes, or children’s book illustrations, engravings were most often
considered a collaboration between artist and engraver. The artist and engraver were often both

70

credited on the image. Unacknowledged in the technical engravings he completed, Dickes’
contribution to Todhunter’s book is invisible. Dickes and similar artists who engraved
mathematical illustrations are forgotten and their role in rendering these images for the print
process is overlooked.

11. Conclusion
In conclusion, twentieth century style guides point to problems with mathematical typesetting
similar to those outlined in the 1875 British Association for the Advancement of Science report.
This suggests that the problems that made composing mathematics difficult and expensive
remained so despite most of the nineteenth century’s technological changes. Moreover, the more
contemporary guides offer similar recommendations to mathematical authors (i.e. use equivalent
expressions that ease composition) offered in Spottiswoode’s 1875 report. Given this, it seems
likely that familiarity with mathematical expressions that eased typographical concerns must
have arisen slowly over time, and that no immediate shift followed directly from printed guides
relating to mathematical typography. All these documents reinforce the impression that
typesetting mathematics was a subject of ongoing concern, in the nineteenth century and after the
application of the Monotype machine to aid mathematical composition in the 1930s.
While the difficulty of composing mathematics in type was not eliminated by improved
technology, other nineteenth century printing efficiencies – such as improved press speed,
cheaper paper and electro and stereotype methods – were easily applied to the printing of
mathematics. Efficiencies of the press came in particularly handy when school textbooks were
demanded in larger and larger numbers towards the century’s end. It was common for the
publisher Macmillan to order their best-selling mathematical texts in batches of twenty or thirty
59

thousand copies, printed from electrotype plates.

On the other hand stereos or electros were

rarely made for “high” books of mathematics that, in some cases, were not expected to sell out
the first printing of 500 copies.
While the printing of mathematics was expensive and technically challenging, it was one of
many printing tasks that challenged the technical capabilities of the British printing trade. Music,

71

oriental and other foreign languages, as well as other works of science required specialized
techniques, special sorts of type, or precise illustrations. Mathematics was difficult to compose
for the printing press. But other unique symbolisms such as music, and even uncommonly
printed languages outside major printing centers, were adapted for moveable type and the
60

printing press, even when these symbolisms served similarly restricted audiences.

In effect,

while the printing of mathematics was a specialized art within the printing trade, it was not as
special or difficult a printing task as one might, at first, assume.
In his chapter “Science, technology and mathematics” in The Cambridge History of the Book in
Britain, James Secord observes that scientific publishing encouraged a close integration between
authors, publishers and printers, and challenged standard printing techniques in a variety of
ways. The publication of technical works placed extraordinary demands on the typesetters,
illustrators, and printers through whose hands scientific manuscripts passed. Technical
terminology, lists of species names and mathematical symbols all lead to a greater expense and
labour in the typesetting room. The requirements for details and specific forms of illustration
pushed the boundaries of image making in print media and forged new techniques (Secord 2009:
465).
Factors governing the British printing trade as a whole also had an effect on the printing of
mathematics. Market forces organized the printing industry such that only some printing
establishments became involved with printing mathematics. Pragmatic business decisions made
higher mathematics a specialized art within the printing trade. Only some printing houses
invested in the equipment and human resources needed to print difficult mathematical symbolism
well. James Secord observes, “although the major printing firms had capabilities for setting
simple geometry and algebra, more advanced mathematical works presented challenges not
covered in the standard printers’ manuals. Much of the work was done at Taylor and Francis and

60

On the development of music printing, see (Poole 1965, 1966; Twyman 1998: 45). Prior to the twentieth century,
the Cambridge University Press, for instance, had been equipped to print many languages, including Arabic,
Hebrew, Armenian, Coptic, Ethiopic, Bengali, Sanskrit, Syriac, Nestorian Syriac, Estrangelo Syriac, and Egyptian
hieroglyphic type (McKitterick 2004: 119). Even in remote parts of Canada, ingenuity overcame difficulty when
applied to the printer’s art. In 1841 a missionary devised an entirely homemade system for printing the Cree
language, complete with homemade movable type, printer’s ink from lampblack and using a common fur press to
make the impression. Using these tools in 1842, in a remote outpost in what is now Manitoba, he printed a sixteenpage booklet containing hymns and Bible passages in Cree (Dewalt 1995: 15, Gundy 1972: 68, 70).

later, at the University Press in Cambridge, where mathematical typesetting became part of every
apprentice’s training” (Secord 2009: 466). Printing houses that were large enough or specialized
enough to take on mathematical work were made so by economic and market forces that were
largely external to and had little to do with mathematics. Partly the larger profitable markets
served by these printers enabled them to apply their honed skills to the printing of difficult
mathematics, which was often achieved with an excellence of skill (but executed at little
financial gain) by these firms.

Chapter 3
Referees, Publisher’s Readers and the Image of Mathematics in
Journals and Books

1. Introduction
Although the relationship between publisher and literary author has been a subject of study since
at least the 1970s, the relationship between publisher and scientific author has been less
frequently attended (MacLeod 1980: 63). The relationship between mathematical author and
book publisher has been explored even less. In the few cases where it has been acknowledged
that mathematical authors had relationships with book publishers, it has often been
bibliographers or book historians who have taken notice (Wallis and Wallis 1986; Rider 1993,
1982; Topham 2000a).
In the nineteenth century, there was a considerable expansion in the number of mathematicians
for whom publication was increasingly important. As Roy MacLeod has described in
Development of Science Publishing in Europe, mathematical practitioners, like scientists in the
nineteenth century, increasingly depended on establishing peer recognition in an academic
hierarchy. Within this structure, publication in journals or books began to take on a new
significance.
With regards to publication in journals, Tony Crilly has argued that journals were instrumental in
launching mathematical careers. In particular Crilly demonstrates how the Cambridge
Mathematical Journal provided networking opportunities for its editors, first publications for its
authors, and an outlet for non-university affiliated mathematicians to become known and
recognized within the largely Cambridge-connected mathematical community (Crilly 2004: 487).
While mathematical prowess had often been equated with standing in the Tripos exam, the
Cambridge Mathematical Journal challenged traditional systems of achievement, as publication
on its pages provided an alternative standard for measuring accomplishment (Crilly 2004: 492).
New journals also helped change educational standards, as these materials were adapted and used
in teaching and in setting examinations (Crilly 2004: 467).

74

In their power over what to publish, book publishers, like journal editors, were instrumental in
advancing careers and in forming the reputations of their authors, including mathematical
authors. Book publishers were also nodes around which communities of intellectuals and culture
makers organized. Publishers like Alexander Macmillan consulted their personal networks in
order to solicit materials for publication. Macmillan also relied on the opinions of his friends and
advisors to make decisions about what to publish. As such, both the publisher and his advisors
influenced a larger community of authors who submitted books to the publishing house. This
influence extended over the readers as well who interacted with the texts that were the product.
The reach of the printed text expanded in the nineteenth century. Increasingly literate populations
expanded the potential market for books, and new technologies and infrastructures facilitated the
movement of texts to geographically diverse locations. Mathematical authors sought to publish
books for the peer and public recognition publication might bring. Particularly with textbooks or
books that could be used in an educational or practical context, the prospect of financial gain was
also motivation to publish. Publishers acquired mathematical work when they valued being
associated with the author’s scholarly achievement, or if they expected a profitable sale of the
book, which most often coincided with the prospective sales of schoolbooks or manuals. While
book publishers relied on an informal network of advisors to make decisions about what
mathematical books to publish, publisher’s readers also played a role in the selection of
mathematical texts, as the case study of Macmillan and Company demonstrates.
In section (2) of this chapter the role of authorship is briefly explored. While most of what we
know about authorship comes from historical studies of literary works, some observations about
how authorship was perceived and the motivations for it provide helpful background to this
study. Following this, section (3) investigates what is known about mathematical refereeing in
the nineteenth century. The role of refereeing in nineteenth century mathematical journals is
examined by looking at how it was done at the Cambridge Mathematical Journal and Acta
Mathematica. Additionally the refereeing of mathematical papers at general science journals,
such as the Royal Society of London’s Philosophical Transactions, is discussed.
In the realm of book publishing, many large publishing houses hired publisher’s readers to help
them decide which manuscripts to publish. The publisher’s reader read unsolicited manuscripts
and provided advice to the publisher about which ones were worthy of publication. Publisher’s

75

readers read manuscripts on a variety of topics. While most of the known examples of
publisher’s readers were literary in influence, this chapter demonstrates that the publisher’s
reader also influenced decisions about the publication of manuscripts on scientific and
mathematical topics. Section (4) explores what is known about the publisher’s reader.
Section (5) gives a history of Macmillan and Company and demonstrates their importance as
publishers of science and mathematics. Macmillan received many unsolicited manuscripts on
mathematical topics (as demonstrated in Appendix A). Section (6) looks at what mathematical
manuscripts were considered for publication by the company, and which ones were accepted or
declined during the 1850s, 60s and 70s. Isaac Todhunter is identified as one of Macmillan’s most
important advisors on mathematics during this time. Section (7) looks at Donald MacAlister
specifically as Macmillan’s reader of mathematics in the 1880s and 90s.
Decision-making about publishing mathematics was different at book publishers compared to
how it was done at mathematical journals or general science journals. The values that were
applied to the decision-making process were unique in each case. In my conclusion, I contend
that the values applied to decision-making ultimately affected the image of mathematics
cultivated within each print medium.

2. Emergence of mathematical authors
Francis Galton once estimated that there were only three hundred scientists of any repute in
1870s Britain. Of these, perhaps forty or fifty had achieved public recognition (Meadows 2004:
1). In his look at the developing profession of science in Victorian times, Jack Meadows
estimates the pace of change in the scientific community was greatest from the 1850s to the
1870s. Increased activity was due in part to the many technological changes that facilitated
greater communication between people, for instance a reliable postal system, an extended
railway network, and the telegraph.
Technological change also arrived in the world of printing, leading to an increase in printed
matter (recall section 2 of the first chapter). There was a concurrent growth in literacy and in the
publication of materials for public consumption and for use in education. Given that the practice
of mathematics and the standards of professionalism in this subject were also in flux during the
nineteenth century, we might wonder whether an increase in publishing influenced the course of

76

mathematical knowledge in any way. Presumably there was an increase in the printed culture of
mathematics, as print culture in general, expanded. If so, who were the mathematical authors
who contributed materials to this expanded printed culture of mathematics? Furthermore, what
were the motivations for authors to produce content? What was in it for the publishers? In order
to answer some of these questions, we consider first what is known about authorship at this time.
Dustin Griffin’s article “The rise of the professional author?” proposes that since the dawn of
printing there had existed a class of learned men for whom authorship was a pastime pursued for
either pleasure or for fame. Griffin terms the members of this group the “gentleman authors”. To
this class of writers, Griffin suggests the eighteenth century added a second distinct group, the
“author by profession”. Opportunities for authors by profession grew as booksellers increasingly
looked for material to keep their presses and printers busy. However, the author by profession
was not seen as a respectable occupation, and was associated with base and foolish work. By
some estimates, the author by profession was little more than the printer’s boy, a fellow who
does menial jobs at the printing house (Griffin 2009: 140). To be writing for a living was not
particularly distinguished, and at the time it was remarked upon that this work required no skill
at all, as anyone could be a writer (Griffin 2009: 142). Some literature characterized the author
who wrote for a living as occupying a gutter profession, comparing the work to a type of
prostitution (Griffin 2009: 143).
Robin Myers concurs with this early portrayal of men and women who wrote for a living. Myers
writes that prejudice against working authors remained into the nineteenth century. She writes,
“It was not yet the thing for a real gentleman to write for a living… Gladstone… considered it
the proper thing to live on his private income and to donate the liberal fruits of his pen to charity,
rather than take the bread from the mouths of those who depended on income earned from
writing” (Myers 1983: 119).

61

61 In her article about writing for the booksellers, Robin Myers describes the middling work typically undertaken by
these little-known men (and increasingly, women) who wrote for a living. Myers described Joseph Timothy Haydn’s
work and career as fairly typical of the literary hack. Haydn worked as a political journalist in Ireland before moving
to London where he worked for a publisher, writing and revising editions of typographical dictionaries. Haydn’s
name appears nowhere in any of these volumes, and for the years of work he contributed to their production he
received a modest income and acquired no credit. Later in life he revised books of chronological tables and
contributed research that lead to a modernization of a political index. Later in life Haydn’s family narrowly escaped
penury when a stroke rendered him unable to work. Haydn’s story exemplifies how this type of work lacked reward
and respect in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century (Myers 1983).

77

Peter and Ruth Wallis’s Biobibliography of British Mathematics and Its Applications identifies
over one thousand different mathematical authors who published mathematical work in the
period between 1701 and 1760. In the introduction to this volume the Wallis’ comment that one
result of their research is that “the widespread, popular nature of mathematical culture is
demonstrated” (Wallis and Wallis 1986: v). For authors who wrote manuals about bookkeeping
or business arithmetic, how-to guides for building or surveying, textbooks of accounting or
insurance, it is conceivable that such authors may have been motivated by some financial gain
from publication as well as possibly having in mind the greater good that sharing such
knowledge could achieve. It is possible that some of the many unknown writers whose various
mathematical publications are listed in bibliographies such as the Wallis’ may have been, in
some way, authors by profession.
On the other hand, we can easily identify a group of mathematical authors whose qualities align
with Griffin’s description of the gentleman author. The ancient presses at the University of
Oxford, for instance, published mathematical books written by learned men and gentlemen
scholars throughout the eighteenth century (see Carter 1975, for a list). The press at Oxford put
out a variety of editions of Euclid, for instance, in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth
centuries, as well as works by the Savilian Professors of Geometry and the Savilian Professors
Astronomy, for instance John Wallis, David Gregory and Edmund Halley. These men may have
had things in common with Griffin’s description of the gentleman author, upon whose work a
high degree of cultural value is bestowed. Some mathematical books transcended the subject,
62

serving as symbols of nationalism and cultural achievement.

By the end of the nineteenth century, there was less of a divide between the author by profession
and the gentleman author. The schism that Griffin outlined narrowed over the course of the
nineteenth century. Simon Nowell-Smith, in writing about Macmillan’s authors in the latter
century period, argues that authors had matured somewhat in both their relationship to
publishers, and in their public image:

62

I would put Newton’s Principia for example, in this category, and I might also include some of the English
Euclids surveyed in (Barrow-Green 2006).

78

It is in the nature of the author-publisher relationship that certain themes should be
recurrent. Certain attitudes of mind have coloured that relationship since long before
Macmillans entered the trade. In the eighteenth century there were roughly speaking two
principal types of author: on one side the nobleman, gentleman or well-found scholar who
cared little for the financial rewards of writing, and on the other the poor scholar and the
Grub Street hack to whom reward was anything but immaterial. The nineteenth century, in
the middle of which the firm of Macmillan was founded, witnessed a leveling process – and
not only in authorship – in which the scholar and creative writer became of necessity, if he
was to succeed, his own man of business (Nowell-Smith 1967: 13).

As books and journals were increasingly produced and consumed within culture at large,
gentleman authors were forced to become savvy to the business of publishing. No matter what
their background, late nineteenth century authors had to navigate the publishing industry to get
published and ultimately to get ahead. Large publishers had developed sophisticated distribution
and advertising capabilities. It was in the author’s interest to align this power behind their work.
At the same time that authorship and publication were taking place in a more commercial
environment, scientific authors adopted practices that distinguished themselves. Historians
Bertrum MacDonald and Jennifer Connor note that in the nineteenth century, scientific authors
frequently undersigned their names in publications with their academic credentials, including
degrees earned, professional affiliations (alma mater, Royal Society Fellowship), current
employer and position. They note that associating professional qualifications with authorship
“reflected the desire of authors to stamp their work with authoritative, scientific credibility”
(MacDonald and Connor 2007: 181). This practice was common for research reports and other
types of original scientific articles and books, including monographs and textbooks. This may
have reflected a desire to continue to present oneself as part of the tradition of gentleman authors
in what was an increasingly commercial environment.

3. Refereeing at mathematical journals
In his brief article about the archives of mathematical journals, Jeremy Gray wrote “It should be
mentioned that the highly structured refereeing system in operation today often had no
counterpart in years gone by. Much of the refereeing was done by word of mouth, on an informal
basis” (Gray 1975: 202). Gray wrote this in 1975, and a considerable amount of writing has since

79

taken place about the founding of mathematical journals and their role in the internationalization
of mathematics. In general this work has confirmed Gray’s statement about the lack of a highly
structured refereeing process within the organization of nineteenth century mathematical
journals.
In June Barrow-Green’s history of Acta Mathematica, we learn how Gösta Mittag-Leffler, with
financial sponsorship from the King of Sweden and the help of his fellow Scandinavian
mathematicians, was able to found and maintain what would become a highly successful
international journal of mathematics (Barrow-Green 2002). The journal was begun with an
editorial board of fourteen (originally including Hugo Gyldén, Sophus Lie, Johan Malmsten, and
Hieronymus Zeuthen) and Mittag-Leffler acting as editor. However, Barrow-Green makes it
clear in whose hands control of the journal rested:
At all events, it is clear that, once publication began, Mittag-Leffler became the driving
force, and [Sophus] Lie effectively dropped out of the picture. And Lie was not the only
member of the editorial board not to play an active part in the journal’s early years. Of the
fourteen original members of the editorial board, only Malmsten and Zeuthen made any
significant contribution. It was Mittag-Leffler who shouldered the responsibilities and
Mittag-Leffler who ensured the journal’s survival (Barrow-Green 2002: 147-8).

Fortunately the journal was able to attract submissions from some of the mathematical
community’s most talented members due to Mittag-Leffler’s many personal contacts. As well,
the portrait of Norwegian mathematician Niels Henrik Abel on its frontispiece provided a
standard to which the journal sought to have its submissions aspire (Barrow-Green 2002: 140,
146). Mittag-Leffler had the ultimate say on what was published in Acta. As editor, MittagLeffler was the gatekeeper who ensured the high quality of articles in his journal.
In his dealings with German mathematician Georg Cantor, we can find an example of how
Mittag-Leffler as editor, took responsibility for the content that was published. While Cantor’s
challenging ideas about set theory had generated controversy elsewhere, Mittag-Leffler decided
to publish Cantor’s papers on set theory in Acta thinking it would be beneficial for the journal
and good for Cantor (Barrow-Green 2002: 150). While Mittag-Leffler’s support for Cantor was
sincere, he also felt some discomfort surrounding the philosophical aspects of Cantor’s
mathematics (Barrow-Green 2002: 150). In 1884, when Cantor received a letter from Mittag-

80

Leffler requesting that he withdraw a paper on the theory of ordered sets from the journal, this
decision did not come from a reviewer or the editorial board, but from Mittag-Leffler himself.
The decision to publish or not to publish was made between Cantor the author, and Mittag-Leffer
the editor. Ultimately the decision not to publish the article lead to a break between Cantor and
Acta Mathematica (Cantor did not publish any further papers in Acta), and put a strain on the
personal relationship between Cantor and Mittag-Leffler, (Barrow-Green 2002: 153).
As the editor of a mathematical journal, Mittag-Leffler held a great degree of control over what
was published, although he likely consulted, on an informal basis, his network of
mathematicians. As editor of the Cambridge Mathematical Journal, William Thomson
undertook a similarly centralized and fluid approach to decision making over what to publish.
Under his editorship informal consultations with colleagues constituted the refereeing process.
Duncan Gregory, Archibald Smith and Samuel Greatheed founded the Cambridge Mathematical
Journal at Trinity College Cambridge in November of 1837. The aim of the journal was to
publish short articles of mathematics, including abstracts of important articles from foreign
journals as well as original contributions. Gregory, Smith and Greatheed frequently contributed
work anonymously in early issues of the journal, partly to give the impression that contributions
were coming from a greater number of authors. In the early stages of many scientific journals
unattributed articles written by the editors helped fill space (MacDonald and Connor 2007: 178).
Under William Thomson’s editorship, the journal evolved into what one might recognize today
as a nascent scholarly journal. After its first decade, the Cambridge Mathematical Journal found
a larger audience and a substantial body of contributors. Some issues sold better than expected,
and the journal became a forum for many previously unpublished authors to gain a reputation
through publishing (Crilly 2004).

63

It also was a vehicle through which Thomson exerted

influence over the community for which the journal had become a hub: “Thomson recognized
the value of the journal for the mathematical community, but the fact that it was a useful channel

63

The first number of the first volume went out of print, and in 1845, the Cambridge Mathematical Journal’s
London publisher/distributor, Macmillan and Co., wrote to Thomson asking for more copies for the issues printed in
1844 and 1845 (Crilly 2004: 467, 470).

81

for maintaining a wide range of contacts in the academic community would not have escaped his
notice” (Crilly 2004: 480).
64

After Thomson became editor he put in place a series of reforms.

As part of these reforms,

Thomson began a refereeing system for articles (Crilly 2004: 480). While one might assume a
refereeing process implies the existence of criteria for the acceptance of material, in practice
Thomson did not specify criteria and there were no formal guidelines for referees. However,
some attitudes involved in the decision-making process are revealed in individual cases (Crilly
2004: 481).
In one case, then lawyer and mathematician Arthur Cayley recommended against publishing an
article on analytic geometry by Stephen Fenwick.

65

The reasons he gave against it were a lack of

originality (“almost all, if not the whole of it is known”) as well as a disorganization of the
material, which, Cayley said, lacked both an overall composition and references to generally
known geometrical theorems (Crilly 2004: 481). Crilly’s take on Cayley’s intentions as a referee
are that, as an ambitious young mathematician himself, he took his role as a gatekeeper seriously.
As such, Cayley did not hesitate to exclude inferior work from the printed record.

66

George Boole, who also refereed articles for the journal, was less forceful in his outlook.

67

While

commenting that a differential equations paper by Brice Bronwin did not contain anything
useful, he still recommended it for publication, giving the reason that “it is desirable to have

64

These reforms included a name change (to the Cambridge and Dublin Mathematical Journal), the requirement
that every article be signed by the author’s name (eliminating pseudonyms and anonymity), an affiliation with a new
publisher (Macmillan and Co.), and an expressed wish to expand the body of authors and readers beyond any
specific academic affiliation.
65

Stephen Fenwick was a mathematical master at the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich, and an editor at The
Mathematician, another mathematical journal that operated from 1843-1850.
66
67

For more about Arthur Cayley and his role in the development of British mathematics, see (Crilly 2006).

George Boole was largely self-taught as a mathematician, something that distinguished him from the majority of
English mathematicians, who were graduates of the universities at Cambridge, Oxford, Dublin or London (see Table
2, Crilly 2004: 491). After a decade of contributions to mathematics, Boole became the first professor of
mathematics at Queens College, Cork in 1849.

82

records of our own progress even in directions in which nothing is to be hoped for” (George
Boole quoted in Crilly 2004: 481).

68

In the case of both Acta Mathematica and the Cambridge Mathematical Journal, the editor held
a great degree of control over the publication of content. However, Mittag-Leffler and Thomson
were both accomplished mathematicians themselves, and also were accountable to the
mathematical community they served, as editorship of a journal was a public role. The refereeing
process, when it was practiced, consisted in the informal consultation of colleagues.
Refereeing systems were also enacted at general science journals at this time. The Royal Society
of London’s Philosophical Transactions and Taylor and Francis’ Philosophical Magazine were
general science journals that published occasional articles of mathematics. Both journals relied
on reviews by referees. The Royal Society established a formal refereeing system for
Philosophical Transactions in 1832. The system required that the Committee of Papers solicit
69

reports from Society Fellows for recommendations regarding the publication of articles.

The

surviving record of reports includes correspondence about mathematical articles considered for
publication.
Sloan Despeaux’s article about mathematical contributions to the Philosophical Transactions
demonstrates that unlike at specialized mathematical journals, the editors assumed less
responsibility for which submissions would be published (Despeaux 2011). Decisions were
70

based on whether a vote of support for an article came from the majority of referees consulted.
Sometimes mathematical articles were valued differently at general science journals than they

were at mathematics-only journals. As Despeaux observes, ‘good’ articles of mathematics were

68

Bronwin was a curate in the parish of Denby Dale in Yorkshire who wrote many papers in pure mathematics and
astronomy (Crilly 2004: 472).
69

The Committee of Papers was a subgroup of the Council, who managed the selection, editing, and publication of
papers in the Philosophical Transactions and later in the Proceedings of the Royal Society.
70

In the first decades of refereeing at the Philosophical Transactions, well-known figures of the British
mathematical community frequently served as referees. George Peacock, Arthur Cayley, Henry J. S. Smith, George
Boole, William Spottiswoode and Archibald Smith were some of these. Initially the pool of mathematical referees
for Royal Society publications was restricted to the Fellowship (and as Despeaux notes, this was a small number; in
1830 only 48 Fellows identified as mathematicians, astronomers or physicists). By 1891 it had become common
practice to also use referees who were not necessarily members of the Royal Society (Despeaux 2011).

83

occasionally passed over because they were deemed too specialized for the audience, whereas
71

‘bad’ papers were occasionally published because rejection might offend a powerful author.
Despeaux also notes that at general science journals, committees tasked with evaluating

mathematical submissions were not always capable of recognizing outstanding contributions to
72

mathematics.

Occasionally, the editors of general science journals limited the amount of pure

mathematics they were willing to print, because of concerns over cost or because the esoteric
nature of the subject was perceived as alienating the majority of their readers.

73

Extending some of the questions arising from these examples into the domain of mathematical
books, we might wonder, how did book publishers decide what mathematical manuscripts to
publish? Book publishers, like editors at general science journals, might not have been
knowledgeable enough to judge a book manuscript in mathematics. Also, the volume of
manuscripts being received by a publishing house may have been large. As examples in the
following sections demonstrate, both of these factors contributed to the employment of
publisher’s readers to help make decisions about which mathematical books to publish at some
nineteenth century publishing houses.

4. Origin of the publisher’s reader
As the volume of overall publications increased after the 1850s, it was common for British
publishers to employ publisher’s readers. The role of the publisher’s reader and the relationship
these readers formed with both the authors they reviewed and the publishers they worked for is
largely unknown. Identifying the frequently anonymous publisher’s reader has been a difficult

71

Despeaux gives two examples. Authur Cayley submitted some highly technical work that was not published in
the Philosophical Transactions because its content surpassed even the understanding of his referees, let alone the
average Royal Society Fellow. On the other hand, rejection was handled with care when the paper originated from
Sir Frederick Pollock, parliamentarian, Attorney General and Chief Baron of the Exchequer (Despeaux 2011: 236,
239).
72

Despeaux’s example is the Royal Irish Academy’s rejection of William Rowan Hamilton’s 1824 submission ‘On
Caustics’. Hamilton resubmitted an enlarged version of the article two years later as ‘Theory of Systems of Rays’.
This paper expressed fundamental ideas that contributed to Hamilton’s later fame as a mathematician (Despeaux
2011: 245-46).
73

For example, William Francis and Richard Taylor, publishers of the Philosophical Magazine, limited the amount
of mathematics included in their journal for reasons of both expense and limited readership. See the letter from
William Francis to George Stokes and the quotation from Richard Taylor in chapter two, p. 19, of the present work.

84

task. It was often the case that only the publisher-employer knew a readers’ identity. Few readers
have been identified by name in the history of publishing and bookselling (Fritschner 1980: 46).
In 1833 R. H. Horne announced the existence of publisher’s readers in his book Exposition of the
False Medium and Barriers Excluding Men of Genius From the Public (Horne 1833). Horne’s
book portrayed the publisher’s reader as a pernicious force in publishing, blaming them for
holding back works of true originality while rewarding mediocrity with publication (Horne 1833;
Fritschner 1980: 45).

74

The job of the publisher’s reader was multifaceted. The publisher’s reader had to understand the
book trade and be acquainted with the current literature. He or she had to have a familiarity with
the work of living authors, and know to what degree they were esteemed. The publisher’s reader
frequently had to assess a manuscript against the current state of the book market, providing
advice for whether the market was in need of a particular kind of book. Ultimately their job was
to recommend acceptance or rejection of a manuscript, but over time some played a role in the
development of author’s careers and the shaping of work prior to publication (Fritschner 1980:
46).
To assess the impact of publisher’s readers on the publication record is difficult, as the British
publishing industry was large and diverse. Not all publishers relied on the advice of publisher’s
readers. Additionally, since publisher’s readers have on the whole remained obscure to history, it
leaves historians, like Linda Fritschner, to speculate on their relative importance: “…reports
suggest that even the unimportant readers have left an indelible imprint on literature, authors,
publishers, and the public” (Frischer 1980: 94).
As for what role publisher’s readers may have played in the publication of scientific books,
monographs or textbooks, little has been written. At Cambridge University Press, where many
mathematical and scientific books were published, it was up to the Syndics of the Press to decide

74

In this passage Horne describes the reader as something like the publisher’s secret weapon: “there is a barrier
between an Author’s heart and the Public, be his work of what merit soever, which nothing but an accidental
contingency, of wealth, rank, interest, &c., can surmount…There is a regular, common-place turnpike to the first
step on the high road of Fame, the only toll for which is mediocrity. There is a “Secret in all trades”—a “Skeleton in
every house”— and every publisher has—his Reader! Invisible behind his employer’s arras, the author’s unknown,
unsuspected enemy, works to the sure discomfiture of all original ability” (Horne 1833: 134-5).

85
75

what material would be published.

After the 1870s, Cambridge University Press, like the

Macmillan Company, employed publisher’s readers whose reports supplemented the knowledge
and opinions of the Syndics (McKitterick 2004b: 87).

5. Macmillan & Co. as publishers of science and mathematics
Two brothers, Daniel and Alexander Macmillan, published the first Macmillan title from a
bookshop on Aldersgate Street, Cambridge in 1843. These two brothers, whose biographer
describes as having “descended from peasants”, grew their company from inauspicious
beginnings into one of the greatest nineteenth century publishing houses in London (Morgan
1943: 1). By the 1870s Macmillan equaled Longmans or Rivington in terms of production,
backlist, status and influence, despite these venerable publishing houses having been established
an entire century earlier (Eliot 2002: 11). It is remarkable that Daniel and Alexander were able to
steward a similar growth in their own company in just forty years.
In his biography of Macmillan, Charles Morgan describes the conundrum that is publishing,
before explaining how the Macmillan brothers successfully navigated it. He writes,
There are two principal aspects of publishing, the idealistic and the commercial, and the
character of a firm must largely depend on its reconciliation of them. You may put out
books because you believe someone will buy them, or you may put out books because you
believe it right that they should be available to the public, or you may put out books for
both of these reasons (Morgan 1943: 5).

The Macmillan brothers reconciled the poles of the publishing business rather well. Morgan
observes that they never operated as publishers of a particular party or sect. Although they did
support the Broad Church movement, “their interest and sympathies extended beyond it”
(Morgan 1943: 5). Daniel and Alexander were conscientious young men who were also “deeply
interested in education, having lacked it themselves” (Morgan 1943: 2). This characteristic both
shaped their publishing program and was one factor leading to its eventual success. In general,

75

The Syndics of Cambridge University Press were a committee drawn from senior members of the Cambridge
University community. With regards to how the Syndics decided on what books to publish, some insight might be
found in the minutes of the Press Syndicate, for which a fairly continuous set exists from 1696-1900 (LeedhamGreen 1973: 17).

86

the brothers’ resourcefulness, reliability and intellectual curiosity lead them to maintain a fruitful
balance between the pursuit of idealism and commercial success in publishing.
Daniel brought to the business knowledge and experience in the book trade, having been
apprenticed to booksellers in London and Cambridge from the age of ten. However, Daniel was
often limited in his abilities due to bad health. After Daniel died in 1857, Alexander took over
leadership (and lived until 1896), expanding the business in England and in other Englishspeaking countries. One of Macmillan’s characteristics as a publisher is that they offered books
in more markets than any other British publisher in the period. In the 1870s and 80s they began
operating in Canada, America, and India (James 2002: xix). They sold books into Cape Town,
Glasgow, Dublin, Leipzig, New York, Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide, Hobart, and Philadelphia
(McKitterick 2004a: 397-8). From the 1850s onwards, there was a constant exchange of books
between Britain and America in particular, and one of Alexander’s major preoccupations became
sales in the US and the lack of copyright protection for British books in other countries (Cunliffe
1998: 3).
As the business massively expanded during the last half of the nineteenth century, Daniel and
Alexander’s children rose to partnership in the company. Frederick Macmillan helped establish
the company in New York (where an office opened in 1869), India (the first books for Indian
schools were produced in 1875, and by World War One they had offices in Calcutta, Bombay,
and Madras), Canada (established 1905) and Australia (James 2002: 9). Maurice Macmillan
became partner in 1883. Malcolm and George Macmillan worked for the firm their entire lives
and by the 1880s, the third generation began to play a role in the company.

76

Macmillan’s first bestseller was Charles Kingsley’s Westward Ho! (1855). Macmillan published
works by famous literary figures, for example Henry James, Matthew Arnold, Alfred Tennyson
and William Butler Yeats. Macmillan’s New York office selected Gone with the Wind from their
slush pile. They published the children’s stories of Lewis Carroll (Charles Dodgson). Macmillan
had a strong presence in children's books, religious titles, science, academic publishing and
textbooks.

87

In 1859 Macmillan started their own review magazine, Macmillan’s Magazine, which helped to
promote their other publishing activities. Macmillan’s Magazine as well as the scientific journal
Nature (f. 1869), were founded under Alexander’s leadership. In 1886 they launched the
Colonial Library, a collection of standard works and popular fiction intended for publication in
the colonies and in India. The Colonial Library became one of the most successful publisher’s
series at the time, of which there were many (see Howsam 2000).
The Macmillans were also important industry leaders, helping to found the Net Book Agreement,
which sought to regulate the sale price of books. Macmillan bought out Richard Bentley in 1898,
and the consolidation of the Bentley publishing company into Macmillan brought valuable stock
and copyright to the business, including steel and copper plates engraved by noted nineteenth
century artists and illustrators. Macmillan is still in business today. Renamed PalgraveMacmillan the company focuses on academic publishing for higher education all over the world.
While Macmillan and Company’s nineteenth century business records were made publicly
available roughly fifty years ago, the vast majority of historical interest in Macmillan has been
focused on its literary publishing program and the publisher’s relationship with its attendant
fiction authors. The scientific side of their publishing program has received comparatively little
77

attention.

Macmillan had a strong presence in science, as well as in academic publishing and

textbooks (Eliot 2002: 24). As well as founding the general science journal Nature (f. 1869) they
also began the publication of several medical journals, such as Brain: A Journal of Neurology (f.
1878), Journal of Physiology (f. 1878), Practitioner: A Monthly Journal of Therapeutics (f.
1868) and The Journal of Anatomy and Physiology (f. 1866). Melinda Baldwin has recently shed
light on the founding and development of the journal Nature into one of the most important
vehicles for scientific communication in Britain (Baldwin 2012, 2013). Prior to that, almost
nothing had been written about Macmillan as a publisher of scientific work. Nowell-Smith’s
scrapbook about Macmillan contained nothing from Macmillan’s scientific authors. He noted the
omission thusly: “Some authors of great significance in the history of Macmillans find no place
here: the scientists, doctors and musicians…. ‘Hall and Knight’ of algebra fame, and many more.

77

Elizabeth James notes that Macmillan's scientific publishing program, as well as their industry leadership (i.e.
their role in the formation of the Net Book Agreement), has yet to be studied (James 2002: xix). For a history of how
the Macmillan Papers were acquired by the British Library and the University of Reading, see (Fredeman 1970).

88

Either their letters are of no interest or the stories they have to tell do not fall into the pattern of a
scrapbook” (Nowell-Smith 1967: 13).
It was during the early period of the Macmillan business that Daniel and Alexander met and
came to know many of their most successful authors of science and mathematics. In the 1840s
and 1850s the brothers operated a bookshop out of number seventeen Trinity Street, Cambridge.
Daniel was in poor health and the brothers were heavily in debt, but during their bookstore days
they built relationships with some of their most successful authors, many who were Cambridge
educated men or Cambridge connected men. Patrons of the bookstore grew to become Daniel
and Alexander’s guests, personal friends, and then, in many cases, the authors that they
published. Isaac Todhunter and Barnard Smith were two acquaintances the brothers met at this
time, with whom the Macmillans developed long-standing publishing relationships (Morgan
1943: 30, 37). Todhunter and Smith were both Cambridge graduates who authored successful
mathematical textbooks for Macmillan.

78

The climate of teaching and learning at Cambridge University during the nineteenth century has
been a subject frequently commented upon by historians (Crilly 1999; Rothblatt 1967; Warwick
2003; Barrow-Green and Gray 2006). Many professors had little reason to be in direct contact
with their students in the Cambridge of the 1840s and 50s. In that climate, the Macmillan’s
bookshop served as common ground, a space that both professors and students frequented.
Morgan calls the Macmillan bookshop a “little college in itself” and explains how the store
served as the locus for an entire social scene:
The old principle of bookselling and publishing had one of its last great exemplars in them,
and the men who came into the shop to buy books stayed in the publishing house to write
them. Thus they drew on the whole resources of the University and an upper room in
Number One [Trinity street] became a common-room where young men and old men
assembled to discuss books or God or social reform – but chiefly, it would appear, God –
before going into four o’clock hall (Morgan 1943: 30, 34).79

78

Macmillan printed more than 597,500 copies of Barnard Smith's Arithmetic for Schools between 1854 and 1920,
and 693,000 copies of Isaac Todhunter’s Algebra for Beginners during the period 1863-1917. See Macmillan’s first
Editions Book, p. 472, 594, Macmillan Archive, British Library, London UK.
79

The upper room in Number One Trinity Street was Daniel and Alexander’s lodging.

89

During their Cambridge bookshop days, Macmillan’s first publications in the 1840s included
mathematical textbooks that had been previously published and which had proven consistent
sales. This was a calculated investment on their part, as the right to print standard works of
instruction had long been recognized as a valuable asset to booksellers and publishers (Topham
2000a: 318-19). The earliest mathematical books published under the Macmillan imprint were
new editions of established textbooks used in the Cambridge context. These included The
Elements of Mechanics by J. C. Snowball and The Cambridge Course of Elementary Natural
Philosophy, Snowball’s compilation of a text by Thomas Lund. Both of these texts had a proven
track record of sales and had been previously published elsewhere. As a mathematical author
Thomas Lund was well known to the students of Cambridge having revised and enlarged James
Wood’s ubiquitous Elements of Algebra in some of its later editions (the fifteenth edition of
Wood’s Algebra was printed in 1857).
These mathematical textbooks were consulted by students studying for the Tripos examinations
at Cambridge, and as such were part of the Cambridge education system that presented students
80

with a normative image of mathematics.

On the title page of Harvey Goodwin’s Elementary

Course of Mathematics, Designed Principally for Students of the University of Cambridge, the
chosen quote by Francis Bacon captures something of the spirit in which Cambridge students
were introduced to mathematics. The quote reads:
As Tennis is a game of no use in itself, but of great use in respect it maketh a quick eye,
and a body ready to put itself into all postures; so in the Mathematics, that use which is
81

collateral and intervenient is no less worthy than that which is principal and intended.

When the Analytical Society attempted to alter the mathematical atmosphere at Cambridge by
introducing continental methods of analysis via their Memoirs, Charles Babbage wrote to
Edward Bromhead regarding the reception of the new mathematics by the average Cambridge

80

Joan Richards, in her book Mathematical Visions, develops the idea that the English viewed mathematics as an
empirically flawless body of knowledge. They did not, in general, regard mathematics, and in particular geometry,
as capable of growth, failure, or change. As such, mathematics held special cultural value in English culture and
society, for its ability to provide an exemplar, or norm, for truth. Richards argues that this image of mathematics was
particularly expressed in England’s educational structures, and shaped the approach to teaching mathematics at the
University of Cambridge (Richards 1988a).

man. He wrote: “Of course much nonsense is talked about them here [the Memoirs]; but I have
not heard criticism yet ventured beyond the second line of the first Memoir: of which men ask ‘is
it to be found in Jemmy Wood’ [i.e. James Wood’s The Elements of Algebra] and if not they
divide by x and are lost in the clouds of [Greek letter psi]’s which follow” (quoted in Topham
2000a: 329). This off-handed quote from Babbage is a reminder of how committed Cambridge
students were to their mathematics textbooks (such as Wood’s Algebra), and the image of
mathematics these contained. With their first mathematical publications, Macmillan chose
conservatively, following an already hewn path.
As Cambridge University Press historian David McKitterick reflected, “In continuing assured
markets in mathematics….[Daniel and Alexander Macmillan] were conservative” (McKitterick
2004a: 390). After beginning their career as mathematical publishers with republications of
already successful textbook authors, they later established a new group of mathematical textbook
authors, some of whom became associated with the firm of Macmillan in particular. As the
business became more successful in the 1860s, 70s and 80s, Macmillan expanded their
publications to include scholarly texts in addition to school and college textbooks. Macmillan’s
authors in mathematics and mathematical physics grew to include Isaac Todhunter, Barnard
Smith, George Boole, John Venn, W. W. Rouse Ball, Joseph Wolstenholme, A. George
Greenhill, William Kingdon Clifford, Peter Guthrie Tait, John Strutt (Lord Rayleigh), George
Gabriel Stokes, William Thomson (Lord Kelvin), Silvanus Phillips Thompson, James Clerk
82

Maxwell, William Spottiswoode and George Biddell Airy.

After Daniel died in 1857, Alexander expanded their Cambridge-based publishing business,
establishing an office at 23 Henrietta Street, in the Covent Garden area of London, in 1858. Five
years later Alexander would move from Cambridge to London, establishing the business
headquarters there. But for the five years between the creation of the London office and while
Cambridge remained the base, Alexander travelled to the city every Thursday for the night.
Alexander’s weekly visits to London became an occasion to gather socially with the intellectuals,
authors and scientists who mingled in Macmillan’s growing sphere. In the words of Robert
Bowes, Alexander’s nephew who operated their London premises, these get-togethers in the

82

91

Henrietta Street offices were “at home to all and sundry, when tea and stronger fluids, with
occasional tobacco, were going on” (Robert Bowes, quoted in Morgan 1943: 50).
These occasions became known as the “Tobacco Parliaments”, and were somewhat legendary
gatherings attracting both men of science, artists and writers of fiction. Some of the regular
attendees included the painter Holman Hunt, the sculptors Thomas Woolner and Alexander
Munro, and the writers Lord Tennyson, Thomas Hughes and Charles Kingsley. Among the
scientific guests were T. H. Huxley, William Sharpey, and Herbert Spencer (Morgan 1943: 5051). The talk revolved around “Darwin and conundrums with general jollity pleasantly
intermixed” (Morgan 1943: 52). At Hughes’ suggestion, a round table was made and the
signatures of some of the Tobacco Parliament attendees were engraved around its edge.

83

While Macmillan’s clout as a publisher increased with the move into London’s intellectual
circles, they continued to rely on the base that Cambridge had provided. One of the Cambridge
connections they continued to exploit was their patronage of the printing facilities at Cambridge
University Press. From the very beginning of their publishing business Macmillan had their
books handled by various printers including Richard Clay (London), Eyre and Spottiswoode
(London), and Constable (Edinburgh). Macmillan also worked closely with Richard Clay’s son,
C. J. Clay, who was employed as University Printer at the Cambridge University Press from
1854 to 1882.
Many of Macmillan’s regular orders at Cambridge University Press were either new books in
mathematics or repeated printings of successful mathematical textbooks. Barnard Smith’s
Arithmetic for Schools (1854) was ordered up almost yearly in increments of several thousand
84

copies at a time (McKitterick 2004a: 390).

Isaac Todhunter’s books Treatise on the

Differential Calculus (1852), Algebra for the Use of Colleges and Schools (1858), and Elements
of Euclid (1862) also became staples at the Cambridge press where these books were printed and

reprinted. In general Macmillan had a steady account at Cambridge. Their annual printing
expenses ranged from three to four thousand pounds per year during the 1860s (McKitterick
2004a: 396).
The Macmillan list was strong in theology and in mathematics. Even after Macmillan moved
their headquarters to London, they maintained connections to Cambridge University through
their authors, and to the press at Cambridge where they continued to print Macmillan’s books,
catalogues and prospectuses. As David McKitterick has reflected in his history of Cambridge
University Press from the 1850s to the 1880s, it was actually Macmillan that was, in effect,
acting as the university publisher for Cambridge. While the Syndics continued with their
traditional management of the press that included a small publications program, they largely
failed to evolve in response to the changing times. McKitterick observes, “The Macmillan list
was remarkable for authors from Oxford and London, from Manchester and from the Public
Schools…the firm’s future was established during these years as what would now be called an
academic publisher, a university press in all but name and organization” (McKitterick 2004a:
397).
It was the Macmillan brothers and also John Deighton – both Cambridge bookseller-publishers
of the nineteenth century – who forged new frontiers in many aspects of science publishing in
response to the changing educational needs and interests of nineteenth century Britain
(McKitterick 2004a: 32). Macmillan’s publication history demonstrates their engagement with
the growing importance of science in culture, and the way in which scientific inquiry was
increasingly pursued, shared and published (McKitterick 2004a: 32). Charles Morgan also
acknowledged Alexander Macmillan’s openness towards science and his recognition of its
increasingly important role in society: “Through [the Darwinian controversies] Alexander held a
steadfast conviction that religion and science were allies, not foes, in the interpretation and
achievement of human destiny, and the firm’s policy reflects his view” (Morgan 1943: 71).
Cambridge University Press, by contrast, continued to be lead by the Syndics whose university
traditions may have insulated them from the ways in which the cultural winds were changing.
The result was that Macmillan effectively poached much of the talent that had been trained and
molded by Cambridge away from publication with the University. Macmillan may have paid
Cambridge significant sums for their printing bills, but ultimately the printing work Cambridge

93

University Press undertook for Macmillan lead to the growth of Macmillan as publishers, leaving
the Syndics’ list of Cambridge published books atrophied by comparison. McKitterick’s
assessment of the Syndics management of the press is fairly biting in this regard:
Long before the mid-nineteenth century, the University was taking no formal responsibility
for all that it printed, save in the most indirect way. It appointed a University Printer; it
required him to print certain books agreed by the Syndics and such administrative papers as
were necessary each year for the smooth running of an increasingly paper-dependent
organization; but it left him free to use the University’s equipment as he would, for most of
his time. Such an arrangement, folly at best but actually the result of culpable neglect,
potentially left University Printers in personally very profitable positions. Much more
importantly, it permitted an active, imaginative and well-informed publisher, Macmillan, to
profit at the University’s expense, and to lay the foundations of a list that became ever
stronger as the University Press’ own meager list became ever more disabled (McKitterick
2004a: 31).

Macmillan was also innovative on the frontier that was the introduction of science into
elementary education. Charles Morgan writes about how Alexander Macmillan noticed the
influence of James Maurice Wilson on the introduction of science into the public schools
(Morgan 1943: 71). Wilson, who worked as a mathematics master at the Rugby School and then
headmaster at Clifton, served on a committee with T. H. Huxley and John Tyndall at the British
Association for the Advancement of Science to study the development of science education for
the country (Mayor 2004). Wilson encouraged the introduction of botany, geology and chemistry
into the school curriculum. In response to Wilson’s activism on this front, Macmillan began to
publish elementary school books in these areas. For his authors Macmillan sought out the most
recognized masters in every subject. Morgan notes that Daniel and Alexander’s practice of
seeking out the best names to write school-level textbooks was an expression of a deeply felt
philosophy about education (Morgan 1943: 71). Alexander once summarized his approach to
educational texts this way, “I conceive of three classes of reader. 1. A general public to be moved
by broad, strong representations of the truth. 2. A thoughtful class who demand some striking
originality, or 3. A learned class who want the pabulum suited to their special digestion”
(Alexander Macmillan quoted in Morgan 1943: 55). According to his vision, Macmillan pursued
the publication of elementary science textbooks authored by men he considered first-rate experts

94

in their fields, for instance, Balfour Stewart, Henry Roscoe, W. Stanley Jevons, Norman Lockyer
and T. H. Huxley.
In an 1854 letter to Thomas Lund, Macmillan expressed value in having the best minds write
elementary textbooks, in this particular case, elementary mathematics textbooks. In his letter to
Lund, Daniel Macmillan responds to reticence Lund had about Isaac Todhunter authoring
mathematical textbooks. Lund feared that Todhunter had plagiarized his textbook for material,
and that because Todhunter’s textbooks were also to be published by Macmillan, they would be
in direct competition with his own. In reply, Macmillan both dismissed Lund’s fears and
inadvertently confirmed them:
There is doubt that there is room enough for several first rate school books on such subjects
as algebra. We are largely sure that Mr. Todhunter will steal from no one – so your
property is safe. It is same and good for the educational prospects of England that first rate
Cambridge Mathematicians should strive to produce the best elementary works. This field
has been too long in the hands of quacks.85

Whether or not Macmillan intended to insult Lund in this letter is hard to say for sure. Macmillan
is stating that he would prefer to publish elementary textbooks by first rate Cambridge
mathematicians, simultaneously implying that either Lund was second-rate or that he would be
correct in assuming that Todhunter’s book would be in competition with Lund’s own.
Macmillan’s statement that the job of writing textbooks had been “too long in the hands of
quacks” may be an expression of the vestigial prejudice that authorship itself brought a person no
special ennoblement. Thomas Lund was a rector at Morton, Derbyshire. He was known as an
editor of Wood’s Algebra, and had been a Fellow and Sadlerian lecturer at St. John’s College.
Todhunter was Senior Wrangler and first Smith’s Prizeman in 1848 (Barrow-Green 1999: 286
f.n. 80). Senior Wrangler and Smith’s Prize were titles of mathematical accomplishment to
which Lund could not lay claim. By 1854 Todhunter had already published two books with
Macmillan, and would go on to publish many more, while Lund’s last publication with

Archive, British Library, London UK.

95

Macmillan was in 1852. Daniel and Alexander placed priority on gathering authors for
educational works who were already recognized as authoritative and important in their field. By
securing the two most important titles of mathematical accomplishment at Cambridge, Todhunter
had been recognized as authoritative and important.
Macmillan wanted to publish elementary works authored by esteemed specialists, and in these
efforts Macmillan followed in the footsteps of the educational reform movement embodied
earlier in the century by the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge. Recall that
Dionysius Lardner, in his role as series editor of the Society’s Cabinet Cyclopaedia series, had
compiled several books on scientific subjects intended to ennoble the working and middleclasses (see section 5 in chapter two). Sir John Herschel, Henry Kater, Augustus De Morgan,
David Brewster and Lardner himself wrote volumes on natural philosophy and mathematical
topics in the Cabinet Cyclopaedia series. Offering books on scientific and mathematical subjects
ranging from as little as sixpence to a few shillings, the Society for the Diffusion of Useful
Knowledge offered some of the first mass-produced publications through which academic
knowledge about science was made available to a broad audience through books. Following the
example set by the Society and its educational publications, Macmillan similarly encouraged
“first rate” men to develop introductory and elementary works in their areas of expertise.
In touch with the changing needs of education, interested in engagement with science, and
proximate to the center of English mathematical activity at the time, Macmillan became one of
the most important publishers of science in nineteenth century England. From 1843 to the turn of
the century, Macmillan demonstrated what an academic and educational publisher might do.
McKitterick reflects, “Their success, while the Syndics of Cambridge University Press slept, had
repercussions for a century” (McKitterick 2004a: 401). What they discovered and then drew out
of Cambridge was “a mine hitherto almost unworked, of the best book-producing power of the
nation, especially for educational works. There was a great want of these, and in every
generation of undergraduates were men specially fitted for writing or editing them” (McKitterick
2004a: 387).

Manuscripts on scientific and mathematical topics from
Macmillan’s “slush pile”

The publishing records of Macmillan demonstrate a large number of authors writing about
scientific and mathematical topics who were, in their contact with Macmillan, attempting to
establish a publication record. Macmillan and their publisher’s readers held a certain sway over
these authors. It was the publisher’s job to form an opinion on the quality of the work submitted,
and ultimately decide whether or not to invest capital in printing and promoting these texts.
Macmillan and their readers reviewed mathematical and scientific manuscripts to decide what to
publish. From the 1860s to the turn of the century, a new position in the chain of scientific
communication was created. Macmillan and their publisher’s readers became engaged in
choosing which scientific and mathematical books, textbooks and monographs, to publish.
Most of the manuscripts Macmillan considered for publication were written by men (and a few
women) who are now unknown or forgotten. Appendix A contains a list of the mathematical
manuscripts received by Macmillan and considered for publication in the period between 1867
and 1896. This list shows that Macmillan considered a number of elementary arithmetic
textbooks submitted by little known authors.
Another frequent subject of the unknown or lesser-known authors were popularizations of
science. In most cases these popularizations by unknown writers – to the eyes of the publisher’s
reader at least – offered nothing, perhaps less, compared with the writings of the men who had
proposed the theories themselves. Some of these popularizations had titles such as “Modern
science”, “Science explained in plain English”, “Gems of science”, “Harmonic Laws of the
Universe”, “Science and religion”, and “The invisible powers of nature”. None of these
manuscripts were ultimately published.

86

86

While Macmillan also rejected many of the arithmetic

See 56016, Records of Manuscripts Received, 1866-1883, Macmillan Papers, British Library, London UK.
Hereafter references to this collection will be given by the abbreviation MP followed by the accession number. An
anonymous reviewer wrote of one such popularization, entitled The Science of Method submitted by J. O. Connell:
“It is deplorable to think of the time which must have been spent in producing this laborious farrago – three parts of
the sentences in which are absolutely meaningless. I went over one test chapter with a thoroughly learned man in
this special subject, and he agreed with me that it was pure rubbish – not because its meaning is wrong, but because
it has no meaning. It would be a discredit to publish it” (MP 55933, Readers Reports 1871-1877, p. 5).

97

textbooks that were submitted, it was more likely that a mathematics book, rather than a
scientific popularization, rose to publication from the “slush pile”.
In contrast to the unknown authors whose names appear frequently in the records of manuscripts,
there are also many names of prominent men of nineteenth century science. These men were
frequently authors for Macmillan and also consulted as reviewers on book manuscripts written
by others. Appendix B gives a list of some of Macmillan’s readers on scientific subjects. Some
of the people Macmillan sought out for opinions were Mary Boole (widow of George Boole),
Thomas Henry Huxley, astronomer Norman Lockyer, logician William Stanley Jevons, Scottish
physicians T. Laudner Brunton and Sir David Ferrier, and Scottish physicist Balfour Stewart.
Mathematicians Joseph Wolstenholme and Isaac Todhunter were consulted about mathematics.
In 1881 Charles Darwin and Alexander Dickson were consulted regarding the possibility of
translating Ferdinand von Müller’s German botanical text Befruchtung der Blumen into
87

English.

Macmillan also turned to these figures when soliciting new material. While corresponding in
November of 1854 about acquiring Abel’s Oeuvres for George Stokes, Daniel Macmillan invited
88

Stokes to consider publishing his lectures on physics with Macmillan.

While presented by

Macmillan as a casual suggestion in passing, it was no doubt a serious offer. In 1854 Macmillan
was still a burgeoning publisher, and Stokes already held an impressive list of scientific titles.

89

This is one of several examples in which Macmillan directly solicited material from favoured
authors.

90

The record of readers’ reports also shows that Macmillan considered commissioning

translation (but not ultimately adopted) were a popular German mathematical textbook by Heiss on algebraic
problems (MP 55939, Readers Reports 1885-1886, p. 73), and an arithmetic text by an unknown author from Hong
Kong (MP 55939, p. 129).

Stokes, besides being Senior Wrangler and first Smith’s Prizeman at Cambridge in 1837, was appointed to the
Cambridge Lucasian professorship of mathematics in 1849, and served as a secretary for the Royal Society from
1854 until he became president in 1885. In 1877 Stokes published some lectures with Macmillan. This was several
decades after their initial attempt to woo Stokes as an author.
90

Alexander Macmillan pursued George Biddell Airy in 1861: “I should have great pleasure and feel much honour,
if at any time you had a book of a popular character like your Lectures on Astronomy to publish to take risk and
divide profits with you” (Macmillan 1908: 75).

98

books on particular topics. Macmillan’s circle of trusted consultants acted as referees, and in
some cases, the font from which Macmillan could source material for publication. Many of
Macmillan’s regular contributors and closest confidents were also frequent attendees at
Macmillan’s Tobacco Parliaments.
In the early days of the Macmillan business, there is evidence Todhunter served in an informal
role as Daniel and Alexander’s consulting expert on mathematics. Letters from Macmillan to
their mathematical authors in the 1850s contain oblique references that suggest Todhunter was
advising on a variety of topics with regards to the presentation, quality and form of mathematical
manuscripts for the press.

91

Todhunter’s influence over the mathematical books Macmillan

published at this time lead to Macmillan replacing some of the well-trod mathematical textbooks
they had been publishing with books by new authors. When John Hymers wrote to Macmillan
requesting they take up a new edition of his textbook on differential equations, for example,
Macmillan discouraged the idea, having undertaken, at Todhunter’s suggestion, Boole’s book on
the same subject.92 There is little direct record of Todhunter’s opinions on these matters, except
in the passages of Macmillan’s correspondence that refer to him. Likely advice was given in
93

person, as the Macmillan brothers and Todhunter lived in Cambridge in the 1850s.

After Daniel’s death and Alexander’s decision to move the headquarters from Cambridge to
London, Macmillan’s expanding organization established a system in which potential book
manuscripts were numbered, dated and recorded as received, with a note as to whether they were
reviewed by a reader, and ultimately whether they were accepted for publication or declined. In
these records one can observe that mathematical manuscripts were sent to the press with

91

In 1855, Daniel wrote to George Boole about his differential equations manuscript, commenting, “The title you
suggest to us seems very good and Mr. Todhunter to whom I showed it liked it too”. Daniel Macmillan to George

See Daniel Macmillan to George Boole, 12 September 1855, MP 55377 General Letter Book 1855, and Daniel
Macmillan to John Hymers, September 16 1855, MP 55377. It was a new edition of Hymer’s A Treatise on
Differential Equations, and on the Calculus of Finite Differences (1839), originally published by Deighton in
Cambridge and Rivington in London, that Macmillan presumably turned down.
93

See MP 55376, 55377 and 55379 General Letter Books from 1855-1856. One might observe that in their
publication catalogue, Hymers is listed as being a Fellow and Tutor at St. John’s College, Cambridge. George Boole
by comparison is listed as having more prestigious titles, such as Fellow of the Royal Society, Professor of
Mathematics at Queens University, Ireland and Honourary Member of the Cambridge Philosophical Society (see
Foster 1891: 55).

99

surprising frequency. Manuscripts on mathematical subjects (including topics in mixed
mathematics and mathematical physics) were more frequent submissions to the press than
manuscripts on any other topic in science. Next to the mathematical genre, the second most
popular science subject was chemistry, followed by botany and the life sciences, including
medicine and its related sub-disciplines such as anatomy, pathology, and surgery.

94

More work would have to be done to identify Alexander Macmillan’s closest advisor on
mathematical manuscripts in the 1860s and 1870s. Todhunter may have remained a source of
informal advice during this time. In the records of manuscripts, there is only one note of a review
95

by him. In 1873 he reviewed a manuscript on Differential Coefficients by John Newton Lyle.
In the 1870s, Norman Lockyer (who published Elementary Lessons in Astronomy with

Macmillan, in 1868) became Alexander Macmillan’s “consulting physician in regard to scientific
books and schemes” (Alexander Macmillan as quoted in Graves 1910: 262). However whether
Macmillan relied on him for mathematical expertise as well is uncertain.
The 1860s and 70s were a time of expansion by the company, and during these decades many
mathematical manuscripts were accepted for publication, although no formal review, by a
publisher’s reader or confidant (like Todhunter), is recorded in the records of manuscripts.
During this period of time books by eminent men of science were rarely turned away from the
press and in fact were seemingly expedited when they were received. Manuscripts from
reputable scientists were often accepted immediately (without a noted review) and sent to the
printer in short order. Perhaps this reflects Macmillan’s eagerness to publish what Daniel
described as first rate men of science.
Henry Roscoe’s manuscript of his lectures on Spectrum Analysis (1869) was received, accepted
and sent to the printer all on one day in April of 1869.

96

Similarly, other manuscripts seem to

have been fast-forwarded through the process of receipt, review, and response, which normally

and Theory of Political Economy by Prof. Stanley Jevons from Manchester are all marked in the
records of received manuscripts with a squiggly line running through the column were reviews

Each of these manuscripts was received and accepted by the publisher

on the same day, and sent to the printer right away. Thomas Clifford Allbutt’s manuscript on the
98

opthalmoscope was accepted on the day it was received in November 1870.

Lord Rayleigh sent

the second chapter of his book on sound to Macmillan on May 2, 1876, when it was accepted
without any note of a review.

Other authors who had manuscripts received without review

include physician J. Milner Fothergill.

During this period of time, mathematical manuscripts were also being accepted or declined.
Macmillan received the first part of W. K. Clifford’s Elements of Dynamic on September 20,
1877, on the same day it was accepted without a noted review.

the Tamworth Grammar school (outside Birmingham).
In some cases immediate acceptance took place because Macmillan had acquired rights to print
the second edition of an already published work. For instance Wolstenholme’s Mathematical
Problems had been first published by Macmillan in 1867 (containing 1,628 problems), and
104

published for a second time by Macmillan in 1878 (containing 2,815 problems).

When George

John Romanes’ manuscript on the Scientific Evidences of Organic Evolution was accepted
105

immediately in May of 1882, it was a second edition.

Macmillan received a manuscript from unknown author A. Mault, of 66 Blenheim Crescent
Kensington W, for the book Natural Geometry: An Introduction to the Logical Study of
Mathematics (1877) on October 12 of 1876. It was accepted a few weeks later on December
6.

106

While no record of its review exists, I suspect Macmillan might have sought an opinion on

it, due to the obscurity of the author and the time lapse between the receipt of the manuscript and
the date recorded when a decision was made to publish it. This unusual book was published in
1877, along with a companion product, a box of models to be used by students working with
Mault’s geometry (Foster 1891: 324).

7. Macmillan’s reader of mathematics Donald MacAlister
Sir Donald MacAlister (1854-1934) was born in 1854 in Earls Dykes East, Perth. Given
MacAlister’s later involvement in the publishing world, it is notable that Donald’s father
diverged from traditional family work (farming and fishing) to become a publishers’ agent for
Blackie & Son. This career change initiated the family’s to move to Liverpool, where Donald
grew up and attended school.
As a youth MacAlister showed early academic promise, winning the Royal Geographical Society
gold medal while attending the Liverpool Institute. MacAlister entered St. John’s College,
Cambridge, on scholarship. He took mathematics, graduating Senior Wrangler and winner of
Smith’s Prize in 1877. He was elected a fellow of St. John’s College and taught for a term at
Harrow while contemplating his career. As winner of the Royal Geographical Society medal,
MacAlister had come to the attention of Francis Galton. Galton acted as a mentor to MacAlister,
encouraging his pursuit of mathematics, specifically. Under Galton’s patronage, MacAlister
published a paper on the mathematical distribution of the geometric mean in the Proceedings of

109

MP 56016, p. 69, 70. W. Henry Bond is identified as headmaster of Barrow School, Borden, Kent.

110

Other publisher’s readers were employed by Macmillan at this time. The reader’s reports of Thomas E. Page
(active 1893-1899), Henry Stuart Jones (1895-1904), and Frederic Relton (1879-1925) are held within the
Macmillan Papers, British Library.
111
112

The first report attributed to MacAlister occurs in November of 1880 (MP 56016, p. 73).

While most of MacAlister’s reports are identified by the initials DM, DMA or DMcA, his full name appears in
(MP 55935, p. 47).

103

the Royal Society (Crilly 2004; MacAlister 1879). However, this would be MacAlister’s only
publication in mathematics, as he decided against mathematics and pursued medicine as his
occupation.
MacAlister got degrees in medicine from Cambridge, studied at St. Bartholomew’s Hospital in
London and studied abroad in Leipzig. In 1881 McAlister returned to Cambridge where he was
appointed Linacre lecturer and worked under the Regius Professor of Physic, Sir George Paget.
He graduated MD in 1884, and became a consulting physician at Addenbrooke’s Hospital. He
was recognized in 1886 with election to the Royal College of Physicians.
During the 1880s and 1890s when McAlister was active as a publisher’s reader for Macmillan,
he was also an integral part of Cambridge University and its college and university life. He
served on the council of the University Senate. From 1893 to 1904 he was a senior tutor at St.
John’s College. In 1889 MacAlister’s life was transformed when a surprising election resulted in
his representation of Cambridge on the General Medical Council, defeating the Downing
professor of medicine in the process. This position began a chapter in MacAlister’s life for which
he is now most frequently remembered: as a longstanding and successful administrator.
MacAlister remained a member of the General Medical Council for forty-four years, serving as
its president from 1904-1931, and by all accounts ruling the council “with a rod of iron” (Crilly
2004). In 1907 he was elected principal of Glasgow University, a position he held until 1929,
when he became chancellor of the University. By the time MacAlister died in 1934, he had been
recognized with thirteen honourary doctorates and made a baronet.

While the circumstances under which MacAlister became a publisher’s reader for Macmillan are
not entirely clear, it is possible that Todhunter recommended him to the job.

113

As familiar to the

Cambridge community as he was, MacAlister probably knew many of the authors whose work
he reviewed. But MacAlister worked for Macmillan as an anonymous reviewer, as was the
custom of publisher’s readers (recall Hone’s description of the publisher’s reader as secret and
“invisible behind his employers arras”).
Following this custom, MacAlister too was circumspect about his work for Macmillan. His
biography, written posthumously by his wife, does not mention this role (MacAlister 1935). In

113

MacAlister and Todhunter were “old friends” according to MacAlister (MP 55940, p. 137).

105

MacAlister’s reports for Macmillan he explains how he took steps to conceal his identity as
114

Macmillan’s reader when he consulted colleagues for their opinions about a manuscript.

As a reviewer, MacAlister was academically qualified to judge the relevance and originality of
elementary to college level presentations of mathematical subjects. He was also attuned to the
qualities of a manuscript that would be of concern to a publisher. Was there a book on
Macmillan’s backlist that already covered the subject matter? Was there a rival book already
published in the market? MacAlister’s reports attended to these questions. His reports often
identify the prospective audience for a manuscript, recommending the work as destined for
mathematicians, students, practical men or engineers. Often he declares it rubbish and therefore
not fit for any audience, in his opinion.
MacAlister’s reviews comment on the social connections or peer recognition of the author, and
he associates the author’s reputation and identity with his estimation of the book’s financial
115

success.

His judgments of authors range from descriptions like a “good man”, “a clever and

rising man of the second-rank”, “self-taught school master”, “intelligent working man”, to the
statement: “there are numerous signs that the writer though he may be a good arithmetician is not
a fully educated man”.

116

About a manuscript on light and heat, MacAlister writes that “the

author’s knowledge is book knowledge only”, furthermore recommending that due to an
unfortunate similarity between the author’s name and the author of another already well known
book “which was an atrocious piece of bungling, and is tabooed by all good teachers”,
117

Macmillan would do well to decline the work with thanks.

MacAlister also provides opinions as to whether the manuscript he is evaluating would be useful
to students or if he expects it to have a remunerative sale. Even if the work is deemed to be

114

MacAlister writes in one review, about the difficulty of consulting a Cambridge colleague for his opinion, as this
person also knew the prospective author: “If I ask him he would at once connect me directly with you, and I shall be
freer in the future if the connection is not so public” (MP 55935, p. 171).

106

neither of these, MacAlister sometimes recommends a highly accomplished work as a “credit to
publish”, implying that it would be advantageous for Macmillan to be associated with a highly
accomplished work or a prestigious author, even if the publication resulted in little financial gain
to the company.

118

About the manuscripts he did not favour, MacAlister describes these texts as in turn ill arranged,
imperfect, a boiling down, containing blunders, having a foreign style, too antiquarian, flighty,
crude, clumsy, repetitive, a book of rough notes, half-brained, made-up, or full of
misunderstandings. About a manuscript entitled “Arithmetical papers”, MacAlister recommends
119

declining the book as it offers little more than cramming tips.
Pendlebury’s book on arithmetic too verbose.

120

MacAlister calls C.

A proposal for spherical trigonometry by N. M.

McClelland is charged with bad style, a mere collection of problems set in examinations, with
meager notes, and at that not even ready for press.

121

In some cases, a book is seen to be too costly to produce. About a book “On Light” aimed at
working men and amateurs, MacAlister recommends cutting costs by skimping on engravings,
since a book for this market can be successfully sold, in his opinion, for at maximum a cost of
four shillings.

122

MacAlister’s reports also contain advice for how the form and style of material should be
presented. In many cases he discourages the “lecture-style” in which manuscripts are initially
123

presented, noting that publishing mathematics in the lecture style is passé.

118

He advocates for a

“Elliptic Functions” by W. A. Greenhill [A. G. Greenhill], H. B. Halstead’s “Elements of Geometry”, and a
book on the Calculus of Variations were recommended for publication on this basis (MP 55939, p. 54; MP 55936,
Readers Reports 1883-1884, p. 164; MP 55937, Readers Reports, 1883-1885, p. 73). Note that although the
manuscript for “Elliptic Functions” is noted in the papers as being written by W. A. Greenhill, the author was
probably A. G. Greenhill, who published several mathematical titles with Macmillan.

regrouping of the material according to natural divisions of the subject, under numbered sections
and chapter headings.

124

He suggests that large and small type be used, with propositions and
125

proofs printed larger than the body text, and boldface used to create emphatic words.

He also

insists upon continuously numbered examples. Particularly with textbooks, the inclusion of
126

problems and solutions is deemed important.

Alternatively references to solutions published
127

elsewhere, or references to standard texts, is encouraged.

With respect to diagrams, he

recommends that lines be made bold and varied with thick, thin, dotted or plain lines with
arrowheads as appropriate, and that solid figures be drawn in perspective. In general, his
128

guidance is to make mathematical illustrations “artistic rather than merely geometrical”.

The organization, presentation, and usability of mathematical texts seem to take priority for
MacAlister over the incorporation of new mathematical methods in the content. On one
occasion, MacAlister notes that presenting the differential and integral calculus side by side is a
“fresh idea”, and observes that the author A. G. Greenhill introduces “from the beginning [of the
book] the newer developments” in the subject, revealing from the start “the bigger vistas of what
great things [the student] is entering upon”.

129

This observation is made with the tone of

moderate praise. In fact MacAlister estimates this book as unlikely to have any great success.
Because so many books are published on calculus, he explains, the only room to distinguish a
new book from the others is in refining the style of presentation, rather than in the way in which
the subject itself is treated.

130

MacAlister discourages what he calls the “Euclidizing” method within elementary algebra. He
also criticizes certain math textbooks as “quite unsuited to English needs”, without explaining

further what, in his view, the English needs are.

131

More than once a textbook is deemed

132

unsuitable because it is too foreign or too French.

MacAlister was aware of contemporary

controversies about how geometry ought to be taught, and saw in this a renewed interest in the
subject, and possibly a reason for new books in this area. About one manuscript on geometry he
wrote: “Geometrical teaching is in so transitional a state just now that any attempt to reconcile
133

old and new will at least gain some hearing”.

MacAlister never elaborated on what he meant when he said that a mathematics textbook was
“too French”. One wonders whether being “too French” was MacAlister’s shorthand for the
analytical approach that was more commonly used in continental mathematics during the
nineteenth century. It has been observed that methods and theories of mathematical analysis
being developed in continental Europe were not generally integrated into the mathematical
culture of England, or at least not into the Cambridge culture of mathematics, which largely
taught mixed mathematics (“water, gas and electricity” subjects), using synthetic methods
(Warwick 2003: 434). The influence of the Analytical Society, the publication of its Memoirs in
1813, and mathematical journals like the Cambridge Mathematical Journal encouraged some
cross-fertilization between Continental and British mathematical cultures. Nevertheless, when
Bertrand Russell reflected on his mathematical training at Cambridge in the 1890s, he noted that
while studying mathematics there he had never been introduced to the work of Karl Weierstrass,
Richard Dedekind, Georg Cantor, Gottlob Frege or Giuseppe Peano (Russell 1959: 39). These
mathematicians, as well as their French counterparts, may have been emblematic of the kind of
mathematics MacAlister deemed unsuitable for what he described as “English needs”.
Unfortunately, this attitude kept English students from being exposed to important new ideas in
nineteenth century mathematics. Cambridge experienced a precipitous decline in the number of
mathematics students towards the end of the nineteenth century (Griffin and Lewis 1990: 57). A
declining interest in mathematical study at Cambridge has been linked to a culture there that

MP 55935, p. 26. About another geometry manuscript, he mentions: “Euclid and elementary geometry are being
much shaken up just now, but there are several much more promising books in the field than this” (MP 55938,
Readers Reports 1884-1885, p. 22).

109

generally did not include new results in mathematical research in the curriculum (Griffin and
Lewis 1990: 57).
In the realm of science, MacAlister’s readers’ reports display how a learned man of this era was
still assumed to have adequate knowledge to make contributions to – or judgments about – many
areas of science. In the 1880s and 90s, MacAlister reviewed manuscripts on subjects including
chemistry, trigonometry, micro-botany, mushrooms, light and heat, conic sections, orthographic
projection, the diseases of field crops and heredity. Only on a few occasions did he seek the
opinion of someone more expert than himself to judge the quality of the work.
Over the years surveyed here, MacAlister held significant sway over Macmillan’s scientific and
mathematical publishing program, although his power as a publisher’s reader was not absolute.
Macmillan did not always solicit MacAlister’s opinion, nor did Macmillan’s decision about what
to publish always align with MacAlister’s recommendation (although usually, it did). During his
time working for MacMillan, manuscripts by what Macmillan may have considered as first-rate
men still circumvented the review process. A manuscript on the “Scientific Evidences of Organic
Evolution”, written by Darwin’s protégé George Romanes, was immediately accepted without
134

review in 1882.

When a manuscript arrived from John Fiske of Harvard University –

“Excursions of an Evolutionist” communicated by the literary agent A. P. Watt in 1883 – it was
135

accepted promptly without MacAlister having reviewed it.

Although it is not known what remuneration MacAlister received for working as a reader with
Macmillan, MacAlister did not undertake this work for notoriety, as his role as a publisher’s
reader was not public. Since he was asked to read many manuscripts of which he disapproved or
was critical, one assumes he did not undertake the role solely for its pleasures. As the eldest son
in a large family with middling means, MacAlister provided for his own education, and into
adulthood he continued supporting his family, providing living and educational expenses for his
younger brothers and sisters. Perhaps financial reward was his motivation to do the work if
Macmillan was offering him reasonable compensation for it.

8. Conclusion
During the second half of the nineteenth century, Macmillan and Co. was actively reshaping the
public image of science, particularly during the height of its powers as a popular and educational
publisher from the 1880s onwards. Within Macmillan’s organization and its attendant channels
of procurement, production and distribution that encompassed its publishing empire, only a few
people at the top played a role in deciding what scientific and mathematical content would be
supported by the power that a press the likes of Macmillan could command. This model of book
publishing put the responsibility for decision-making in the hands of just a few people.
Some of Macmillan’s mathematical textbooks were astonishingly successful, with the most
136

widely produced ones rivaling Macmillan’s best-selling fiction titles in their circulation.

These books made their way all around the world, to Canada, Australia, India, the United States
and to other places with English-speaking populations. Macmillan’s textbooks presented an
English image of mathematics and promoted the authors of these texts, men associated with
English institutions (mainly Cambridge) all over the world.
Many of Todhunter’s mathematics textbooks, and those of J. Hamblin Smith, ended up in
Canada, where they were prescribed at the University of Toronto and at the Hamilton, Ontario
high school where Canada’s first notable research mathematician, John Charles Fields, was
taught. After he left Canada for doctoral and post-doctoral study abroad, Fields always testified
to the quality of education he had received in Canada, although he did note that his grounding in
Calculus had been “irremediably and fundamentally [false]” (Riehm and Hoffman 2011: 22).
This fallacious grounding was likely connected to the English mathematical textbooks that were
so widely used, and the fact that these originated from a culture that had for nationalistic and

136

Some 525,000 copies of Todhunter’s edition of The Elements of Euclid were produced between 1862 and 1903.
In comparison, 577,250 copies of the firm's top-selling fiction title (Charles Kingsley’s Westward Ho!) were printed
during the same period. Even at a time when classic math texts were being eclipsed by modern demonstrations,
Euclid’s Elements rivaled a literary work for the distinction of best-selling title for its publisher. This evidence was
retrieved from the first Editions Book, Macmillan Papers, British Library, London, UK.

111

pedagogical reasons, failed to update the representation of mathematics in their educational
curriculum.

137

What this example might confirm for us is that within each genre of the print medium
that served to express mathematical knowledge, there were separate cultures each with their own
acceptable standards. Mathematical journals were run by editors who were themselves
developers of new mathematics, and who maintained their own standards depending on what
kinds of contributors they could attract (also, frequently, the benefactor on which they depended
for the maintenance of their periodical was also an influential factor in a journal’s operations). In
his dealings with one of the most visionary mathematicians of the nineteenth century, Gösta
Mittag-Leffler recognized the importance of Cantor’s work. Mittag-Leffler, however, was
sensitive about what would appear on the public record in his journal (as were Boole and Cayley,
in their reviews for the Cambridge and Dublin Mathematical Journal). In the case of Cantor’s
work on ordered sets, Mittag-Leffler may have declined to publish Cantor’s paper because he
expected it to be controversial with Acta Mathematica’s readership, perhaps even undermining
138

his credibility as editor.

As Sloan Despeaux has pointed out, the situation at general science journals was slightly
different. The culture of mathematics developed there was often more aligned with mathematics
in the service of other sciences. Articles that explored the higher echelons of mathematical
theory were not always welcome. Editors of general science journals had to consider their
readers, many of whom did not have the skills or the inclination to read articles of mathematics.
Mathematics that was too specialized could be regarded negatively, and further, the referees who
were assigned to give advice were not always the best at identifying what new mathematics
would later become important.
At book publishers, if we take Macmillan as our only example, the situation was once again,
unique. Macmillan’s publishing program included mathematics, and developed materials for

explained in footnote 80, page 89 of this work.
138

Cantor’s mathematics was controversial. Several of his contemporaries considered Cantor’s work illegitimate
(Dauben 1977: 89-91).

112

broad educational purposes on mathematical topics. Mathematical textbooks, especially on the
scale in which Macmillan produced them, had greater reach than most other printed sources in
mathematics, and formed first impressions upon many students. However, the values that
influenced the image of mathematics presented here were closely tied to national traditions and
cultural values. As such, material that proceeded to publication frequently reinforced established
ideas. In the case of Macmillan’s mathematical books and the culture of English mathematics
that they reflected, some of these established ideas had already been proven incorrect, as both
Russell and Fields later noted.

Chapter 4
Mathematics for the World: The Business of Publishing
Mathematics at Macmillan and Company

1. Introduction
Between the 1840s and 1890s, Macmillan grew from a small business into a mature and
powerful publisher of both mathematical works and educational works in mathematics. Because
comprehensive records of Macmillan’s publishing activities remain, it is possible to draw both a
qualitative and a quantitative picture of its activities during this period. The previous chapter
provides qualitative descriptions of Macmillan’s relationship to mathematical publishing,
including descriptions of the community from which Macmillan drew their authors, a look at
some of Macmillan’s received manuscripts about mathematics that were either accepted or
declined, and the reader’s reports that were relied upon to help manage decision-making about
these mathematical publications. The present chapter takes a quantitative measure of
Macmillan’s mathematical publishing program, examining how numerous their mathematical
books may have been, and how profitable they were for both their publisher and author.
Macmillan is just one example of a publishing company that printed and sold mathematical
books. However, from this example we can learn about how mathematical authors interacted
with the book publishing industry. For instance, we may wonder if mathematical authors profited
from the successful sale of their books. Did authors who wrote school books for Macmillan also
use the publishing house to publish their more academic titles, or vice versa? If so, what was the
rationale for the author and publisher behind the publication of each type of work? Through
printing, distributing and making public the work of its authors, did Macmillan’s publishing
activities act to extend the influence of these men? Did Macmillan develop a new business model
for publishing during this period, becoming what we might describe today as an academic
publisher? This chapter casts light on quantitative and commercial aspects of publishing
mathematics in book form, as it was applied at Macmillan and Company in the late nineteenth
century.

114

The evidence presented in this chapter challenges several assumptions about scientific
publishing. It has been suggested that in general, scientific publishing was not highly lucrative
139

for either authors or publishers.

This chapter shows this was not in all cases true. Some of

Macmillan’s titles in science and in science education (specifically, mathematics education) were
their most successful, and financially lucrative, books. Science as a subject was commercially
favourable in late nineteenth century England, and this has already been signaled (if not
recognized) by the observation that most science publishing carried out at this time was done by
140

commercial, not academic, publishers.

It has also been suggested that scientific authors were motivated by the desire to advance
141

knowledge rather than by more worldly motives, such as vanity or profit.

This chapter shows

that altruism was not the only motive behind publication. Some of Macmillan’s educational
books in mathematics earned as much for their authors as Macmillan’s best-selling fiction titles
did for their literary ones. From records of Macmillan’s contracts with authors we can gage what
income authors and publishers earned from these books.
Further, it will be shown that the commercialization of mathematics in book form had an effect
on the growth of mathematical knowledge. The wide dissemination of certain versions of the
subject through the mass-production of educational textbooks may have influenced cultural
142

values placed upon mathematical knowledge.

Particularly as Macmillan was ambitious not

139

David McKitterick’s book about Cambridge University Press includes extensive sections about Macmillan. One
of McKitterick’s suggestions about Macmillan is that their fiction writers were more lucrative earners for the firm
than their authors who wrote school and university texts. He writes, “As general publishers, [Macmillan’s
publication] list included fiction, travel and poetry as well as school and university studies. …Lewis Carroll, Charles
Kingsley, Thomas Hughes, Charlotte Mary Yonge and Mrs. Craik (her husband was a partner in the firm) were all
major authors – and financially usually more important than their university counterparts” (McKitterick 2004b: 58).
140

Both David McKitterick and Jonathan Topham have found that the bulk of scientific publications in the
nineteenth century were not emanating from the university presses but rather from London publishers such as
Longmans, Macmillan or Taylor and Francis (McKitterick 2004a, 2004b; Topham 2013).
141

Bertrum MacDonald and Jennifer Connor write in History of the Book in Canada, “Few authors of scientific,
technical and medical texts were motivated by the possibility of financial benefit for their efforts. Most were
primarily interested in informing readers or producing texts that could be used for educational purposes”
(MacDonald and Connor 2007: 184).
142

In her essay about printed mathematics in early modern Europe, Robin Rider reflects, “The company of
mathematical adepts in Europe was not so extensive as to consume large press runs; and markets, especially for

115

only to serve the British book market, but to serve a world wide English-speaking market, we
might ask how Macmillan’s international trade may have influenced the progress of mathematics
through the influence that Macmillan’s mathematical books extended upon the contexts in which
these books were read and used by students, teachers and institutions of education inside and
outside Britain.

2. Nineteenth century British publishing and Macmillan
Simon Eliot has compiled several ‘bibliometric’ studies that quantitatively describe publishing
trends within the nineteenth century British book trade (Eliot 1994, 1995). Eliot has also
published one study that looks quantitatively at Macmillan and Co. in particular (Eliot 2002).
Eliot’s approach to the history of the book trade is unique. One of the major challenges of doing
book history in the nineteenth century is accounting for the sheer volume of material that was
produced. In his article about how to undertake a book historical approach to the study of
nineteenth century science, Jonathan Topham identified the abundance of material as one of the
major challenges that has discouraged scholars from attempting book history in the modern
period (Topham 2000: 562). Since its inception as a discipline, book historical studies have
focused more frequently on the early modern period, neglecting analysis of books and printed
materials as mass-produced objects. Simon Eliot’s bibliometric studies are highly useful to
modern book historians, as they provide a ground upon which one can build a contextualized
picture of British mathematical publishing, for example, using Eliot’s study of nineteenth century
British publishing as a baseline.
Eliot has provided a quantitative overview to nineteenth century British publishing in his work,
Some Patterns and Trends in British Publishing, 1800-1919.

143

In 1840 approximately 3,000

new titles were produced in that year by the British publishing industry. By 1903 almost 12,000

more elementary works, were often decidedly local and limited” (Rider 1993:108). By contrast, late nineteenth
century markets in mathematics, especially for elementary works, were global and open. Steam-powered printing
altered the economics of publishing. Mathematical publishing was affected by these changes.
143

Eliot gleaned his quantitative data primarily from lists of books in The Publishers’ Circular, Bent’s Monthly
Literary Advertiser, the British Museum’s Copyright Receipt Books and Annual Reports, The British Library
General Catalogue CD-ROM records from 1800-1919, and the Stationer’s Company Registry Books.

116

new titles or editions were produced per year. The nineteenth century witnessed immense
growth: Eliot’s study shows a four-fold increase in the amount of new book titles produced per
year between 1840 and 1903. The increase in printed matter overall however – not just book
production – reveals even more about how dominant print media had become by the turn of the
century. In 1840 England consumed about 40,000 tons of paper. By 1903 it was using 800,000
tons, a twenty-fold increase in paper consumption in sixty years. The massive increase in the
amount of paper used in one year is a result of the increased production of all manner of printed
culture, including catalogues, newspapers, magazines, pamphlets, forms, tickets, labels, posters
and books (Eliot 1994: 7-10).
Unsurprisingly, Eliot’s study of the book marketplace finds the overall production of books grew
substantially in the nineteenth century, both in the number of titles produced and in the quantities
in which these titles were printed. However, rather than consistent year over year growth, the
trend towards overall growth was punctuated by intermittent inflations or depressions in the
market coinciding with significant political-social events and economic crises (Barnes 1985).
Rather than seeing the industrial book revolution as a continuous historical progression
occupying the entire nineteenth century, Eliot conceptualizes it as a two-stage process: an initial
“distribution revolution” between 1830-55, and then a “mass-production revolution” during the
1875-1914 period (Eliot 1994: 107).
In finding that book production experienced a marked surge in the late 1840s and early 1850s,
Eliot hypothesizes that the events of the Great Exhibition in 1851, the death of Wellington (the
popular former Tory Prime Minister and Napoleonic war veteran) in 1852, and the beginning of
the Crimean War in 1854, helped to spur this increase (Eliot 1994: 8). At the same time the
Oxford movement caused a “pamphlet war on religion on an almost unprecedented scale” (Eliot
1994: 9). Eliot finds these events together boosted the number of new titles produced in the early
1850s in England. Gradual reduction on the ‘taxes on knowledge’ in the 1850s (i.e. paper duty),
similarly had an amplifying effect on print production. Eliot notes that the coming of the railway,
steam-driven presses, case bindings, and the Foudrinier paper-making machine were all aspects
that lead to the spike in production during the distribution revolution in mind-century (Eliot
1994: 107).

117

Statistics from the same sources show book production decreasing periodically, particularly
during the 1826 depression, the Crimean War, and during the First World War period from 19151918. Eliot also found that the 1855-1875 period witnessed something of a plateau in the growth
of new book production (measured in number of new titles per year).
In the late 1840s and 1850s, Eliot suggests that there was a major change in the price structure of
the book market. ‘Cheap books’, which Eliot defines as having a price of 3s. 6d. or less, rose to
dominance. Eliot notes that frequently a book’s low price correlated with longer and more
frequent print runs of these so-called cheap books (Eliot 1994: 24).
1875-1914 was another period in which the English book trade once again evolved a distinctly
new organization and shape. Between 1875 and 1900 the number of new book titles produced
annually doubled, while the amount of paper used in printing increased seven-fold (Eliot 1994:
13). The whole market for books and printed culture shifted, with print-runs of book titles in the
1880s and 90s expanding drastically. The vast expansion in the amount of copies that could be
made of books at this time signaled a mass-production revolution during the last decades of the
nineteenth century as well as the years prior to the First World War.
In the 1880s and 1890s, structural changes affected the printing and publishing industry overall,
including the development of professional writers, syndicated content, mass circulation of daily
newspapers, emergence of literary agents, the development of public libraries, the expansion of
printing capacity with the use of large web-fed rotary presses, and the founding of several writers
and publishers associations. These developments taken together, signal the maturation, in some
sense, of the publishing industry as a self-conscious and established industry. Eliot provides an
apt description of English print culture of the last quarter of the century, describing these
circumstances as “The confluence of almost universal literacy with cheap and large print runs
serving an apparently endlessly expanding international English-reading market, and, most
important of all, the absence of any other form of universally available popular entertainment,
made the period 1880-1910 a fleeting golden age…at least it must have seemed to those who
benefitted from it most” (Eliot 1994: 14).
Quantitative studies looking at print-runs of books published in the nineteenth century have not
been extensive, as Eliot notes. Eliot’s article ends by suggesting next steps for understanding the
nineteenth century book trade as consisting of further study of individual publishers’ and

118

printers’ records. From these, Eliot suggests mapping data about the number of new titles, print
runs, price and cost structure, and comparing this individual publisher data to the global picture
he has described (Eliot 1994: 107-8).
While the records for undertaking such comparisons don’t exist for every nineteenth century
publisher, Macmillan and Company’s publishing records allow for this sort of quantitative
analysis. Eliot himself even undertook a bibliometric analysis of Macmillan’s publishing history,
mapping and comparing the data from four sample years during Macmillan’s nineteenth century
operations. For titles published in each sample year, Eliot was able to collect information about
the print-runs of 75-89% of all the titles published, giving some reasonably reliable benchmarks
for how many books Macmillan was producing during various decades, and in particular, about
which books were Macmillan’s most successful titles (Eliot 2002: 23).
Unsurprisingly, Eliot’s figures show remarkable growth in the company’s production between
the first sample year (1856) and the last (1886). In 1856 Macmillan produced 41 new titles
whereas in 1886, they produced 171. However, there was a twelve-fold increase in the total
output of books printed, with 29,450 books printed in 1856, and 372,350 copies of Macmillan’s
new titles produced in 1886. This suggests, as Eliot observes, that Macmillan’s initial print run of
new titles had increased substantially in thirty years.

144

This correlates with Eliot’s overall

observation that after 1875 the “mass-production revolution” had affected the British book trade.
Macmillan, as one of London’s largest publishers at the time, also transitioned into the
publishing model of mass-production: for their most successful titles, first editions and
reprintings were ordered up in amounts of ten or twenty thousand copies at a time.
Eliot observes that the 1860-1870 period was an important decade for Macmillan, in which they
founded their future success as publishers. Even while Macmillan printed more books overall in
the 1880s and 90s, several books printed in the 1860s went on to sell at high volumes for decades
to come, enduring through longer print-runs and having greater lifetime success than their books
published in later decades. Most crucial to this study, Eliot observes that overwhelmingly
Macmillan’s greatest successes from the 1866 sample year are educational and scientific titles,

144

This number reflects total copies printed of all their new titles in the sample year, excluding reprintings from
Macmillan’s backlisted books that may have also occurred in that year.

119

suggesting that these genres were elemental to the company’s overall business success (Eliot
2002: 24).
Macmillan’s unqualified publishing successes in the year 1866 included Rev. T. Dalton’s
Arithmetical Examples (total 55,000 copies printed), T. H. Huxley’s Lessons in Elementary
Physiology (total 199,845 copies printed), H. E. Roscoe’s Lessons in Elementary Chemistry
(total 430,000 printed), Barnard Smith’s A Shilling Book of Arithmetic (total 430,000 printed),
Answers to Examples in Barnard Smith’s Shilling Book of Arithmetic (total 104,500 printed) and
Isaac Todhunter’s Trigonometry for Beginners (total 108,500 printed). These were the most
successful titles from just one year in Macmillan’s highly successful 1860s period.
Unfortunately, Eliot’s study of the general trade does not help us place Macmillan’s scientific
publishing program in a well-formed context of scientific, educational or mathematical
publishing in the overall British book market in the nineteenth century. In general, Eliot
concludes that the nineteenth century saw the replacement of books on religious topics with
books on secular topics (Eliot 1994: 58). However, his chapter providing statistics about the
growth or diminishment of particular genres within nineteenth century publishing is
unfortunately the weakest within Eliot’s overall study, a fact that reflects the limitations of the
available source material, which he himself admits (Eliot 1994: 106).
Eliot finds that titles classified as “education” fluctuate from 12% of the market in 1814-46, to
11% in 1870-9 and 1880-9, 12% in 1890-9 and then dropping to 8% in 1900-9 and to 6% in
1910-19 (Eliot 1994: 43-52). These figures are likely inaccurate, due to misclassification by
genre in The Publishers’ Circular and the other primary materials Eliot draws upon. While
Eliot’s figures do not show increasing production of books for the educational sector, important
developments in education occurred during this time. The passing of the Elementary Education
Act of 1870 began a series of reforms that lead to the institution of a system of education for all
young children in Britain. Educational books became ever more important in the 1870s and
1880s to the publishing programs of both Macmillan and Company and Cambridge University
Press. Educational titles grew to occupy a greater share of overall book production during these
decades at these two major publishers.
It is disappointing that Eliot’s study of publishing by genre is not more descriptive of how
science publishing may have grown during the nineteenth century. Eliot finds that titles classified

120

together as “arts, science, mathematics and illustrated books”, fluctuated from 9% of the
marketplace in 1814-46, to 8% in 1870-9 and 6% in 1880-9, dropping to 3% in 1890-9 before
rising to 8% in 1900-9 and to 15% in 1910-19 (Eliot 1994: 43-52). Given Eliot’s genre figures, it
is difficult to get a decisive picture of whether there may have been growth in the market share
devoted to science publishing within the British book industry as a whole in the latter half of the
nineteenth century.
What Eliot concludes with regards to Macmillan, is that the company published more books in
the pure science genre than the average British publisher, and Macmillan published more
successfully in the science and mathematical genre than most British publishers. The book trade
journal The Publishers’ Circular lists 8% of trade books as having “pure science” topics between
1870-99. By comparison Macmillan’s catalogue contained between 14-17% “pure science” titles
during a roughly similar period, 1866-1886 (Eliot 2002: 31). While knowledge about science
publishing as a whole in the nineteenth century is far from complete, Macmillan was unique in
Britain during the period for their production of scientific books.

3. Macmillan’s publication record in mathematics and science
An employee of Macmillan, James Foster, compiled A Bibliographical Catalogue of Macmillan
and Co.’s Publications from 1843 to 1889, a book issued by the company in 1891 (Foster 1891).
From this source, it has been possible to extract statistics about Macmillan’s publishing activity
by genre, breaking out what ratio of their published books were written about topics in
mathematics and science (see Table 2).
It is also possible to produce approximate sales figures for Macmillan’s published titles in these
genres, as entries in Foster’s bibliographical catalogue can be cross-referenced with listings in
Macmillan’s first editions book. Macmillan’s editions book was the place where the company
kept a record of how much stock in a particular title was ordered. In it, the amount of initially
printed copies and successive reprintings for all published book titles were recorded. The first
editions book contains information about books printed and reprinted throughout much of the
nineteenth century and into the early twentieth century. In the twentieth century subsequent
editions books were kept as well as a supplementary card catalogue recording twentieth century
printings and reprintings that extend beyond the first editions book. Statistics in the present work
were prepared using Foster’s bibliographic catalogue, and Macmillan’s first editions book only.

121

In order to identify Macmillan’s books that were “mathematical” in genre, criteria as introduced
by Peter and Ruth Wallis in their Biobibliography have been adopted here (Wallis and Wallis
1986). In their seventeenth and eighteenth century mathematical bibliography, the Wallis’
include publications on topics broadly defined as mathematical. Besides work on arithmetic,
geometry, mechanics, algebra, theory of equations, and other purely mathematical topics, the
Wallis’ include books on topics in applied mathematics as well, including astronomy, navigation,
surveying, building, dialling and clockmaking, motive power, electricity, accounting and
insurance (Wallis and Wallis 1986: v). In devising which books within Macmillan’s publishing
program were considered mathematical, a similarly broad definition of “mathematical” has been
adopted in the present study. Books have been determined mathematical by applying the Wallis’
criteria for what constitutes pure and applied mathematics as best as possible. The genre category
of a Macmillan book has been deduced largely from knowledge of its title and author.

1843-1889 (Source: Foster 1891)

145

Physics, including optics, mechanics and treatises on heat, have been included in works deemed mathematical.
Books about economics and logic were excluded from the list of mathematical or scientific publications, except
where specifically suggestive of symbolic logic, in which case these titles (i.e., works by John Venn) were included
as mathematical. Certain treatises on sound and music, where it is suggested the subject is treated scientifically, have
been included in the works grouped as mathematical.

122

Beyond mathematics, Macmillan published numerous books on scientific subjects, including on
various topics in chemistry, botany, zoology, ornithology, hygiene, entomology, natural history,
agriculture, medicine (anatomy, surgery, disease, pathology, epidemiology, pharmacology,
embryology, psychiatry, neurology), heredity, psychology, anthropology, evolution, religion and
science, meteorology, metallurgy and mining, geology, paleontology, agriculture and forestry.
From Table 1 it can be seen that approximately half of all the titles Macmillan published in pure
science were mathematical, broadly defined. Some of the mathematical topics on which they
published books included history of mathematics, mechanical philosophy, natural philosophy,
mechanics, symbolic logic, trigonometry, algebra, calculus, differential equations, determinants,
geometry, arithmetic, dynamics, statics, probability, astronomy, engineering and applied
technological subjects such as hydrodynamics, steam, magnetism, electricity, heat, sound,
telegraphy, surveying, optics, weights and measures, and approximating errors. They also
published a book about how to approximate pi and at least two treatises on quaternions.
Including their books in mathematics with their books in other areas of science, Macmillan came
close to maintaining a ratio of 20% of all titles in their publishing program being devoted to
subjects in the science genre, and 10% of all titles published being mathematical specifically.
Macmillan devoted a significant portion of its publishing program to these subjects, given that
the Publisher’s Circular, the best source of book titles and genres within the general nineteenth
century publishing industry, suggests that books on mathematical or pure science topics occupied
8% or less of all books in the marketplace (Eliot 1994: 43-51).

4. Macmillan’s mathematical books
Average initial print-runs at Macmillan varied commonly between 250 and 2,000 copies. In his
bibliometric analysis, Eliot considered all titles with accumulated print-runs of more than 10,000
copies as unambiguous successes for the company (Eliot 2002: 20). From Eliot’s study we know
that Macmillan published some of its most successful, longest-selling titles in the 1860s, and that
represented among these are a significant number of mathematical textbooks. What about the
other decades of Macmillan’s nineteenth century operations? What can be said of the success of
their mathematical titles during those years?

123

Between 1854 and 1889, Macmillan published eighty mathematical books that were printed in
quantities over 10,000, or, eighty mathematical books that we can consider unambiguously
successful for the company. Twenty-six of these titles, or roughly 33% of their unambiguously
successful mathematical books, were extremely successful, with more than 100,000 copies
printed over the lifetime in which Macmillan kept the book in print. A list of Macmillan’s
mathematical books with lifetime print runs of over 100,000 copies is given as a list in Table 2.

Table 2 Macmillan’s mathematical books with print runs greater than 100,000, 18431889 (Source: Macmillan’s First Editions Book, British Library). *Note: Price refers to
either the most stable price or the price on first printing. **Note: Some titles were
reprinted beyond the last year given here. Calculations of lifetime print-run given in this
chart were calculated from Macmillan’s first editions book only.

Unsurprisingly, most of Macmillan’s mathematical books with lifetime print runs greater than
100,000 copies were schoolbooks of one sort or another. Many of them, about half or more, were
also cheap books: according to Eliot’s definition for cheap books, they sold for 3s. 6d. or less.

125

Also notable is the list of authors in Table 2. Several of these authors of Macmillan’s most
successful mathematical and educational books were involved with the Macmillan’s as more
than just textbook authors. Balfour Stewart, Isaac Todhunter, William Stanley Jevons, J. Norman
Lockyer and Silvanus P. Thompson all served as readers for the publishing house, advising on
manuscripts and publication schemes during the years 1867-1896 (see Appendix B). As such,
Macmillan turned to their most successful and lucrative textbook authors for advice with regards
to plans for other publishing projects. After Lockyer published Elementary Lessons in Astronomy
in 1868 and became the founding editor of Nature in 1869, Alexander Macmillan referred to
Lockyer as his “consulting physician in regard to scientific books and schemes” (quoted in
Graves 1910: 262). The authors listed in Table 2 were not only the authors of successful
textbooks for Macmillan, they also held influence over the fashioning of Macmillan’s publishing
program in math and science generally.
As the next section demonstrates, a long running and successfully selling book title could result
in lucrative income streams for both author and publisher. The commercialization of
mathematics, through book publication, joined mathematical authors with book publishers as
they pursued goals that were mutually beneficial. Beyond being authors of commercially
successful textbooks, Stewart, Todhunter, Jevons, Lockyer and Thompson also used Macmillan
to publish several academic, polemical, and obscure titles with Macmillan. On an intellectual and
financial level, and occasionally also through the engagement of personal friendship, these
authors wielded influence within the publishing house, on Macmillan’s decisions about their own
books that would be published, as well as regarding the publication projects of other authors.
Lockyer, as well as being the founding editor of Macmillan’s general science periodical Nature,
also published several books with Macmillan including Why the Earth’s Chemistry Is As It Is
(part of Macmillan’s Manchester Science Lectures Series, 1877), The Education of our Industrial
Classes (1883), The Chemistry of the Sun (1887), Outlines of Physiography (1887), and The
Cycle of Sun-Spots and Rainfall in Southern India (1879).
Macmillan published several titles on economics and logic written by Jevons, including The Coal
Question (1865), The Substitution of Similars for the True Principles of Reasoning (1869),
Elementary Lessons in Logic (1870), The Theory of Political Economy (1871), Political
Economy (as part of Macmillan’s Science Primers Series, 1878), Studies in Deductive Logic

126

(1880), The State in Relation to Labour (1882), Methods of Social Reform (1883), Investigations
of Currency and Finance (1884), and The Letters and Journals of W. Stanley Jevons (1886).
Todhunter published more books with Macmillan than can be listed here: between 1843 and
1889, forty-one of Macmillan’s titles were attributed to him (see Table 4). While many of these
were textbooks aimed at an educational market, Macmillan also published more specialized titles
written by Todhunter, including History of the Calculus of Variations (1861), Researches in the
Calculus of Variations (1871), A History of the Mathematical Theories of Attraction and the
Figure of the Earth from the Time of Newton to that of Laplace (1873), The Conflict of Studies
and other Essays on Subjects Connected with Education (1873), and An Elementary Treatise on
Laplace's Functions, Lame’s Functions, and Bessel’s Functions (1875). None of these titles of
Todhunter’s went beyond the first printing.
Macmillan also published (although, without putting their name on it) Todhunter’s Answer to
Mr. Lund’s Attack (1858), in which Todhunter defended himself against public accusations by
Thomas Lund that Todhunter had plagiarized other mathematics textbooks. Lund had publicly
accused Todhunter of stealing material from James Wood’s popular book The Elements of
Algebra (Barrow-Green 2001: 197). Evidently Macmillan sided with Todhunter in the dispute, as
they published his polemic defending himself against Lund’s accusations. Although the
Macmillans published several of Lund’s textbooks previously, they replaced these titles with
works on similar subjects written by Todhunter.
For Silvanus Thompson, Macmillan published Light Visible and Invisible (1897) and
Manufacture of Light (1906). Balfour Stewart published several physics textbooks with
Macmillan, as well as The Unseen Universe, or Physical Speculations on a Future State (1875).
Co-authored with P. G. Tait but initially published anonymously, The Unseen Universe was an
attack on scientific naturalism, offering a defense of religion’s compatibility with modern
science.
The relationship built between Macmillan and these five authors in particular were multifaceted.
A lucrative partnership was forged between author and publisher with both benefitting
financially from the sale of more than 100,000 copies of a textbook. These authors also
benefitted in less tangible ways from being on favourable terms with Macmillan. In publishing
their more academic, less commercially rewarding books, Macmillan furthered their ambitions

127

and intellectual work. In some cases, by printing and circulating their polemical writings,
Macmillan gave authors like Todhuunter, Tait and Stewart a platform on which to publicly stake
an intellectual claim or defend their metaphysical beliefs.

5. Contracts, royalties, and revenues from publishing
In the latter half of the nineteenth century, the publishing industry was in the midst of a
significant maturation in its approach to writer-publisher contracts. The most common form of
contract since the eighteenth century had been outright sale, where an author simply sold their
work without conditions for a flat fee. This agreement more often than not was struck between
an author and a bookseller. It wasn’t until the early nineteenth century that the act of publishing
separated from the occupation of bookselling. From the ranks of the larger booksellers rose
publishers who sold only their own publications and concentrated on the publishing function
(Potter 1997:162). Macmillan, founded in the mid-nineteenth century, became one of the socalled ‘leviathan’ publishers whose books (along with Longmans, Rivington, Murray, etc.)
dominated much of the nineteenth century book market.
A century of change affected the practices of authors and the author-publisher relationship, just
as it formed a new landscape in which publishers conducted their business. By the lateeighteenth century, outright sale agreements evolved into more sophisticated types of contract,
agreements that were more sensitive to, and protective of, authors’ rights. In the case of a limited
sale arrangement, for example, a fee would be negotiated for a particular edition or limited
number of copies of a work (Sprigge 1890: 33). If additional copies were to be printed, the
author would receive further payments or renegotiate a further fee (Feather 2006: 133).
Increasingly, such modifications to the traditional author-publisher arrangement meant that
authors retained some control over the future uses of their work.
In the nineteenth century, the amount paid to authors for the outright sale of their work ranged
widely. In her history of the firm Kegan Paul, Trench, Trübner & Co., Leslie Howsam noted that
Henry S. King paid between £12 and £250 to acquire outright the copyright in various fiction
titles (Howsam 1993: 59). Around 1900, Cambridge University Press was paying between £40
and £70 for works purchased through outright sale (McKitterick 2004b: 83). Outright sale was
often the way in which publishers compensated editors, illustrators, engravers and other ancillary

128

artisans for their work for the publishing industry.

146

In the 1890s, Cambridge University Press

paid their editors a flat fee of £25 for the copyright of their work (McKitterick 2004b: 82).
Another common form of author-publisher arrangement was the commission agreement. With
books published on commission, the author assumed the financial risk of publication. The
publisher arranged to print, bind and distribute the book in exchange for a fee as well as possibly
a percentage of sales. With books published on commission, the publisher’s name still appeared
on the title page, making books published on commission indistinguishable from books in which
the publisher assumed the financial risk (Howsam 1993: 58). Commission offered a way for
publishers to offload some of the financial risks of publishing. Books published on commission
were generally not expected to sell beyond the first printing, or at least the publisher did not
expect sales to recoup the cost of production. Although other forms of contract increased in
popularity in the latter nineteenth century, commission remained a staple during the period. In
1899, approximately 20% of Macmillan’s offers to publish were made on the commission basis
(Eliot 2002: 44).
The dominant form of contract for much of the nineteenth century was the half-profits
agreement, although outright sale and commission persisted in their use. The emergence of a
profession of authors in the nineteenth century, along with the rise of publishing-focused
businesses, meant that writers increasingly negotiated contracts such that they were able to earn a
living from their work (Sprigge 1890). The half-profits agreement went a further step towards
recognizing and rewarding authorship as creative work. Under the half-profits system, the
publisher assumed all the costs incurred in producing a book, and then split profits with the
author in either a 50%-50% share or in a two thirds to the author, one third to the publisher, ratio
(Howsam 1993: 59). Although authors could make an income from this form of contract, authors
were not guaranteed to receive an income if the book failed to “pay out” (recover its production
costs). Unless an advance had been made, the publisher recouped manufacturing costs first,
before the author earned any income.

146

For the illustrated edition of Charles Kingsley’s bestselling book Westward Ho! Macmillan paid illustrator
Charles Edmund Brock £300 to do 100 drawings. He was paid £100 up front, and the remainder just over one month
later, presumably when the work had been completed. Agreement between Macmillan and C. E. Brock, 9 November
1894, Terms Book I, Macmillan Archive, Palgrave-Macmillan head office, Basingstoke, UK, p. 123.

129

In the latter part of the nineteenth century, authors’ unions were formed, and these organizations
pointed out that the half-profits model left authors open to abuse by publishers. It was publishers’
account books, after all, that determined when a book turned a profit. In part due to lobbying
from authors’ unions, the half-profits agreement began to fall out of favour by the end of the
century. The royalty system, which had become popular in America, slowly began to replace the
half-profits agreement in Britain. Although many variants of the royalty system existed, the basic
principle of a royalty agreement was that the author received a fixed amount of income for every
book sold, based on a percentage of the sale price of a title (Sprigge 1890: 56-7). Nevertheless,
many publishers were slow to relinquish the established forms of contract, and outright sale,
commission and half-profits remained common forms of author-publisher agreement for some
time into the twentieth century (Howsam 1993: 59, McKitterick 2004b: 83).
When in 1890 the Society of Authors published a book about the standards and practices of
publishing, outright sale, half-profits, commission and royalty were the four forms of authorpublisher agreement covered in their survey (Sprigge 1890). Macmillan employed all four forms
of contract during their nineteenth century operations. The majority of Macmillan’s nineteenth
century authors either sold their work outright or entered into a half-profits agreement. However,
Macmillan led the industry transition from half-profits to royalties by the end of the century. By
1899, the portion of Macmillan authors offered royalty agreements increased to over 44% (Eliot
2002: 47). The operation of Macmillan’s New York office influenced their transition towards
adopting royalty agreements with their British authors as well as their American ones (Eliot
2002: 48).
Macmillan’s contracts with some of their nineteenth century mathematical authors are recorded
147

in Macmillan’s business records.

From these agreements, we can judge how much income

authors earned from the eventual success, or lack of success, of a particular title. As a point of
comparison, Table 3 introduces revenues successful fiction writers received from the publication

147

Some of Macmillan’s costing records survive from the 1850s, and from these is its possible to glean information
about Macmillan’s agreements with its earliest mathematical authors. Details of author-publisher arrangements are
also revealed through Macmillan’s author correspondence. Towards the end of the century, Macmillan began to
keep a separate record of contracts in what is called the ‘Terms Book I’, although most of the agreements recorded
in the first Terms Book date in the twentieth century. Terms Books for Macmillan are kept at the Macmillan
Archive, Palgrave-Macmillan head office, Basingstoke, UK.

of popular Victorian novels. In the 1860s, established fiction writers could expect to receive
approximately £1000 for the publication of a novel. In 1856, for example, Macmillan courted
Charles Kingsley with a deal that would see Kingsley receive £1000 for the first edition of his
148

next book.

Daniel Macmillan to Mrs. Kingsley, 6 March 1856, MP 55378 General Letter-Book 1855-56. Kingsley had
proved himself a commercially successful author with the publication of Westward Ho! (1855), Macmillan’s first
best-selling fiction title. In the same year Kingsley also published Glaucus; or the Wonders of the Shore, a book of
popular natural history, which was also successful and entered into several reprintings (Foster 1891: 31).

131

Macmillan’s most successful textbook authors earned as much as or more income from their
publications as Britain’s most successful Victorian novelists did from theirs. This fact is proven
by Macmillan’s author-publisher agreements with some of their most successful authors of
mathematics textbooks, for example, H. S. Hall and S. R. Knight, whose publications appear in
the list of Macmillan’s mathematical books with print runs greater than 100,000 (Table 2). We
can compare the agreements of Macmillan’s highest earning mathematical authors with the
projected income and author-publisher agreements of other authors from a range of Macmillan’s
nineteenth century mathematical books.
By the time H. S. Hall and S. R. Knight published Algebra for Beginners in July of 1892, they
were already successful textbook authors for Macmillan, having published Elementary Algebra
for Schools in 1885, which almost immediately went into multiple editions and reprintings (See
Table 2, also, Foster 1891: 474). An agreement dated May 15, 1893, saw Hall and Knight set to
receive a royalty of 17% on the first 2000 copies of their textbook Algebra for Beginners sold in
any year, with an additional 20% royalty received on every copy sold beyond that. Between 1892
and 1924, 468,700 copies were printed, with the book selling for two shillings and sixpence.

149

Assuming this author-publisher agreement was not renegotiated at a later date, Hall and Knight
earned approximately £11,000 in royalties from Algebra for Beginners during the years from
1892 to 1924. Their contract included further royalty payments for copies sold through
Macmillan’s New York office and a 10% royalty on all copies sold of the Americanized
150

edition.

As for Hall and Knight’s Elementary Trigonometry, which was first published in December of
1893, they received an even better deal, although the book would not be reprinted quite as many
times as Algebra for Beginners. For their Elementary Trigonometry, Hall and Knight negotiated
a flat royalty of 20% on all copies sold, with a 10% royalty on copies sold through the New York
151

office.

Between 1893 and 1936, 295,460 copies of the book were printed and sold at four

132

shillings and sixpence. Assuming all of these were sold at the 20% royalty rate, Hall and Knight
stood to earn approximately £13,000 in royalties over the forty-three years the book was in print.
In 1887 H. S. Hall and F. H. Stevens published A Text Book of Euclid’s Elements for the Use of
Schools, Part I, Containing Books I and II (Foster 1891: 514). Part II of the same book, which
contained Euclid’s books three to six, followed the next year in 1888 (Foster 1891: 532). In 1888
Macmillan also published a combined volume of the two books together, containing Euclid’s
books one through six, and one year later, a second edition appeared, with Euclid’s book eleven
added as a separate volume that could be purchased (Foster 1891: 532, 554-555, 564).
Eventually all the parts of Hall and Knight’s Text Book of Euclid’s Elements for the Use of
Schools were combined to produce a “complete” edition which was issued on October 26,
1889.

152

When it came to A Text Book of Euclid’s Elements for the Use of Schools, Hall and Stevens
negotiated an even more lucrative agreement than Hall had received for either Algebra for
Beginners or Elementary Trigonometry. Macmillan made a proposal to the authors that as of 1
July 1900, Macmillan would pay a royalty of 20% on the first 10,000 copies of this book sold in
any one year, with a 25% royalty for any subsequent copies sold in the same year.

153

As 253,000

copies of the complete edition were printed between the years 1889 to 1932, the royalty Hall and
Steven’s stood to earn was almost £12,000 on the complete edition alone. Additional royalties
from the stand-alone volume of Part I amounted to roughly £2300, and from the combined
volume with Part I and II together the royalty would have been approximately £4000. Several
other editions and combinations of the book that were also published, stood to earn Hall and
Stevens additional revenue as well.
Even in the earliest days of Macmillan’s publishing business, authors of mathematical textbooks
commanded significant incomes for their work if their book came with a proven track record of
sales. In 1851 Macmillan printed 3000 copies of Thomas Lund’s A Short and Easy Course of

Algebra, which was initially sold for two shillings and sixpence.

Macmillan’s records project

the book’s gross income at £366 if the edition sold out, with the costs incurred by Macmillan on
printing, binding and advertising (and interest on the money borrowed to pay for it), being £80.
Astonishingly, Lund was compensated £230 of the net profit of £286. Lund commanded
approximately 80% of the book’s profit, as well as receiving twenty-five copies of the book
bound in cloth, as part of Macmillan’s agreement over the publication. Compared to what Lund
155

would earn, Macmillan stood to gain only £56 from the publication.

Similarly, when Macmillan acquired the right to print Lund’s A Companion to Wood’s Algebra
(12th edition, 1847), Lund was paid £950. With the gross profit from sale of the book expected
to be £1284, and costs to print, bind and advertise projected at £154 17s., Macmillan’s share of
156

the profit was comparatively little at £179 3s.

Perhaps what can be taken from these examples is that Lund commanded a product that was
virtually guaranteed to sell. As a consequence, Macmillan paid Lund handsomely for the right to
print his books. No doubt Lund’s high rate of commission also motivated Macmillan to further
develop Isaac Todhunter as a mathematical textbook author, and cease investing in Lund’s
publications. This was the course of action they eventually took in developing their list of
mathematical textbooks.

157

Contrast the fees Mr. Lund commanded for his work with that of two other authors of
mathematical books published during the same period. J. B. Phear stood to gain approximately

At some unknown later date, Macmillan raised the price to 3s. 6d. See (Foster 1891: 652) and Macmillan’s First

Early correspondence in the Macmillan Archive, British Library suggests that Todhunter was approached to
produce a volume that would replace George Salmon’s A Treatise on Conic Sections. George Boole’s book A
Treatise on Differential Equations (1859), was seen by Macmillan as replacing John Hymer’s book of the same
subject. See Daniel Macmillan to Isaac Todhunter, 26 December 1854, MP 55376 General Letter Book 1854-55,
and Daniel Macmillan to Dr. Hymers, 16 September 1855, MP55377 General Letter Book 1855.

£40 on the printing of 1000 copies of his Elementary Hydrostatics in 1852.

While Lund had

sold his work to Macmillan for a cash fee (an outright sale agreement for a limited number of
copies, or single edition, printed), Phear had struck a half-profits agreement with Macmillan. As
previously described, in a half-profits agreement, the publisher usually recouped the costs of
printing and production before it paid any income from book sales to the author.
For J. C. Snowball’s The Elements of Plane and Spherical Trigonometry (7th edition, 1852),
2000 copies were printed and sold at seven shillings and sixpence. This book had gone through
several editions elsewhere, with Macmillan first acquiring copies of it in 1845, and selling these
159

copies for 10s. 6d.

Presumably after selling these copies successfully, Macmillan invested in a

new print edition of the book in 1852. The cost to print 2000 copies of the book was £211 14s.
With the new lower price of seven shillings and sixpence, Macmillan estimated the gross profit
from this edition at £512. Snowball was paid in two installments, at one and two years following
publication, a total of £154 for his copyright in the work.

160

Macmillan’s estimated profit on the

edition was roughly on par with that paid to the author, £146 6s.
Snowball was an author from whom Macmillan had, in their early days, acquired the right to
print several textbooks that were stock and trade for Cambridge students at the time. From
Snowball, they published An Introduction to the Elements of Plane Trigonometry (received from
elsewhere in 1847), The Elements of Mechanics (2nd edition, 1846), and Lund’s edition of
Snowball’s Cambridge Course of Elementary Natural Philosophy, which had originally been
published elsewhere, and for which Macmillan acquired the right to print the fifth edition in
1846. Although Macmillan continued to reprint Snowball’s The Elements of Plane and Spherical
Trigonometry several times between 1852 and 1891, Macmillan largely moved on from authors
161

of stock and trade Cambridge textbooks, developing new authors for their mathematical texts.

They turned particularly to Isaac Todhunter, and to other authors like George Boole, that
Todhunter advised Macmillan develop.
Todhunter’s first book with Macmillan was published around the same time that Macmillan
published the above-mentioned works by Lund, Snowball and Phear. Macmillan published
Todhunter’s A Treatise on the Differential Calculus and the Elements of the Integral Calculus in
1852 (Foster 1891: 20). Macmillan printed 1250 copies, and sold them at ten shillings and
sixpence. Several editions and reprintings followed. Macmillan estimated the revenue generated
by selling out the first printing of this book would be £421 10s. The cost to print Todhunter’s
book, including printing, paper, woodcuts, boarding, advertising and presentation copies, was
fairly high compared to printing costs for the books of traditional Cambridge authors, at £206
17s. 6d. Under the half-profits contract they agreed to, Todhunter stood to gain £107 6s. 3d. from
162

the first edition.

Over time, he must have gained more than that, as the book went through five

editions, and the fifth edition (of 1871) was reprinted several times until 1923 (although
Todhunter died in 1884).

163

Recall Isaac Todhunter's book, A Treatise on Plane Co-ordinate Geometry, as Applied to the
164

Straight Line and the Conic Sections, with Numerous Examples (1855).

Plane Co-ordinate

Geometry was a beginner’s textbook. At 299 pages in length, 1250 copies were originally
ordered by Macmillan and printed at Cambridge University Press. Each book sold for ten
shillings and sixpence. The book proved to be a success and went into several reprintings. A total
of 27,750 copies were printed, the last being printed in 1888.

165

The book was distributed and

sold in London, Oxford, Edinburgh, Dublin, Cambridge, and possibly elsewhere.
In correspondence with Todhunter, Macmillan proposed several schemes of payment for this
work, depending on its eventual size and sale price. As proposed by Macmillan, the amount of

earnings due to Todhunter on the sale of an edition of 1500 copies, ranged from £110-£130.

If we assume Todhunter ended up earning the smaller amount of these figures, and that the terms
of his agreement stayed the same over the various editions and reprintings, then Todhunter (or
his estate, as the case may be) stood to gain approximately £2,127 from the 27,750 copies
eventually made of this book.
As we can see from a list of Todhunter’s books with Macmillan and their relative circulations
(Table 4), twenty seven thousand copies was in the middling range of circulation for one of
Macmillan’s Todhunter titles. As someone reflected in an obituary of him, Todhunter’s
childhood had been defined by “the bracing discipline of poverty”.

167

At death the Oxford

Dictionary of National Biography lists the value of his estate at £81,330 7s. 0d. (Mullinger
2004). We can surmise that his accumulated wealth was largely derived from the revenues he
accrued through publication. As a point of comparison, Alexander Macmillan’s probate at death
168

was £179,644 19s. 7d. in 1896 (Van Arsdel 2004).

Todhuunter’s Plane Co-ordinate Geometry was his third book with Macmillan. Already by that
time, Todhunter revealed himself as a negotiator, and demonstrated awareness that his textbooks
embodied potential future earnings. After Macmillan had proposed a scheme of payment for
Plane Co-ordinate Geometry, Todhunter wrote back agreeing, but only committing to publish
the first edition with Macmillan. In his reply, Daniel Macmillan offered the following statement:
My dear Sir, we have returned the memorandum about the Conics, its formally signed and
a copy of the same for your signature. We should have been glad if instead of the first you
but put that we were to have the first offer of future Editions in terms of what you might

think the same. One works with more heart and zeal for what is not likely to be taken
away…169

By committing only to an agreement over the first edition, Todhunter left open the possibility of
renegotiating a higher fee for subsequent editions if the book proved successful.
Most of the examples of author-publisher agreements mentioned above are for Macmillan’s more
successful educational books on mathematical subjects. But what of some of Macmillan’s
“higher” books in mathematics? For these, we can offer one early example from Macmillan’s
first years as a publisher. In 1847 Macmillan co-published George Boole’s Mathematical
Analysis of Logic (1847) with George Bell of London. 500 copies of the book were printed at a
cost to Macmillan of £31 19s 10d. The book was offered initially at the price of three shillings
170

and sixpence.

By June of 1851, only 114 copies of the book had been sold, and the book owed
171

roughly £14 of the expense Macmillan had paid for it.

While it is not known what kind of

agreement Boole had with Macmillan over the book, if he had made a half-profits agreement, he
would not yet have earned anything in the first three years the book was for sale, as Macmillan
had not yet recovered their expenses.
Similarly small sales were had with Boole’s subsequent work in mathematical logic. Macmillan
& Co. acquired the remaining copies of George Boole's Laws of Thought (1854) from Walton &
Maberly (the original publisher) in 1872. During the eighteen years it had been available, only
172

206 copies of the book had been circulated.

Macmillan’s records demonstrate the firm held two attitudes towards the publication of “higher”
books in mathematics. First of all, there was flat recognition that such books were not profitable.

Macmillan's first Editions Book shows 294 copies received in 1872. The original 1854 edition from London's
Walton & Maberly is in the British Library. While I am unable to confirm the original print run was 500 copies, this
is a reasonable estimate for the first printing of such a book at this time.

138

In 1856 Daniel Macmillan wrote to P. G. Tait, regarding the publication of his book, A Treatise
on the Dynamics of a Particle, “as these high subjects never sell enough to cover expenses we
shall be in no hurry about [its publication]”.

173

By comparison, Macmillan was often in a rush to

print or reprint a mathematical textbook when an audience was at hand to purchase it.

174

However, there was simultaneously the recognition that “higher” works in mathematics were
symbols of intellectual achievement, and that publishing these works reflected well on the
character and good reputation of Macmillan. Recall Donald MacAlister’s comment regarding
several mathematical manuscripts that he regarded as not being likely candidates for commercial
success. He nevertheless recommended these as possibly being worth taking on, as such books
would bring Macmillan prestige and credibility as a publisher of educational and learned
works.

175

Authors of books in “higher” mathematics were aware of their reduced position to negotiate
financial compensation in their publishing contract. Macmillan’s records suggest that A. G.
Greenhill, who published several books with Macmillan in higher mathematical subjects, did not
negotiate his author-publisher agreements, whereas some of Macmillan’s highest earning
mathematical authors clearly did. Greenhill’s Hydrostatics (1894) was published on the halfprofits system, as was his 1892 book, Elliptic Functions.

176

Comparing the dates between

Macmillan’s first offer to publish and the date of the signed agreement, one week difference
between the date of offer and date of agreement suggests that Greenhill did not negotiate the

“Elliptic Functions” by W. A. Greenhill [this is probably A. G. Greenhill], H. B. Halstead’s “Elements of

contract for his Elliptic Functions.

By comparison, Macmillan first proposed a contract for

Hall and Knight’s Elementary Trigonometry in June of 1889 but an agreement was not reached
until five years later in January of 1894.

178

Similarly for Hall and Knight’s Algebra for

Beginners, a contract was first proposed in June of 1889, but an agreement was only reached in
May of 1893.

179

6. Promotion and advertising
From the costing records that survive from Macmillan’s earliest days in publishing, we know
that their production costs for mathematical books included a budget for advertising, and also
frequently included the cost of presentation copies. Records indicate that Macmillan paid to
advertise Thomas Lund’s A Short and Easy Course of Algebra (1851), his A Companion to
Wood’s Algebra (1847), Todhunter’s A Treatise on the Differential Calculus and the Elements of
the Integral Calculus (1852) and Snowball’s The Elements of Plane and Spherical Trigonometry
(1852). In 1855 Macmillan planned to spend £26 on advertising for Todhunter’s A Treatise on
Plane Co-ordinate Geometry, but Daniel Macmillan wrote to Todhunter prior to its publication
that, “I fear we are sure to go a good deal beyond that sum”.

180

In the case of George Boole’s

Mathematical Analysis of Logic (1847), Macmillan budgeted for presentation copies, but did not
181

budget for advertising.

In the 1860s Macmillan expanded their capacity to advertise mathematical textbooks.
Todhunter’s books, for instance, were widely advertised by the printing of prospectuses. In 1861,
14,000 prospectuses were prepared to promote the publication of his Theory of Equations (1862)
(Barrow-Green 2001: 187 f.n. 51). In 1860 Macmillan ordered 3,000 prospectuses promoting

Barnard Smith’s Exercises in Arithmetic (McKitterick 2004a: 396). Into the 1870s, Barnard
Smith’s mathematical textbooks continued to be advertised by the circulation of prospectuses. In
October of 1871, 20,000 leaflets describing Barnard Smith’s mathematical books were printed at
Cambridge University Press with 10,000 more ordered by Macmillan in January of 1872
(McKitterick 2004a: 397).
Macmillan kept special educational lists and catalogues, and routinely offered presentation
182

copies of its books to potential volume buyers.

They placed presentation copies in the hands

of teachers who might adopt these books for their classrooms. Macmillan’s correspondence with
their textbook authors shows that they consulted over the lists of people to whom presentation
copies would be sent. For instance T. R. Birks, author of On Matter and Ether (1862) and P. G.
Tait, co-author with W. J. Steele of A Treatise on the Dynamics of a Particle (1857), were
183

consulted in this way.

Copies of the second edition of Barnard Smith’s book Arithmetic and

Algebra (2nd edition, 1856) were sent to India, to Cambridge, to Dr. Peacock, to the Committee
of the Council on Education, to Rev. I Smith, to a Mr. Hawtrey, to Rev. W. S. Wayte of Trinity
College Oxford, and to a Mr. Whittington, Master of the Proprietary School, Islington, in April
of 1856.

185

Macmillan also wrote to booksellers inquiring as to sales of their mathematical

textbooks. These letters inquired as to stock on hand, asking booksellers to give reports if a
186

particular book has ceased to garner consistent sales.

Apparently during Isaac Todhunter’s early friendship with the Macmillan brothers, his
encouragement had been one influence prompting their founding a monthly magazine (Morgan
1943: 56). In November of 1859, Macmillan’s Magazine began publication. A philosophical and
literary paper, it was the first of the shilling monthly magazines. Its pages serialized popular
fiction, including Charles Kingsley’s Water Babies and Henry James’ Portrait of a Lady
(Morgan 1943: 58). Current issues of the day, including religion and science, were also debated
in its pages, by men including W. K. Clifford, T. H. Huxley, Herbert Spencer, and Alfred Russel
Wallace. Macmillan’s Magazine successfully established itself with a readership of middle-class
English people during the 1850s and 1860s (Dawson 2004). Publication in Macmillan’s
Magazine helped raise the public profile of its contributors, many of who were also authors of
books published by Macmillan.
Macmillan went on to found several periodicals that were outlets for scientific publishing
specifically. They founded the general science journal Nature, edited by Norman Lockyer, in
1869, as well as several medical journals, including The Journal of Anatomy and Physiology (f.
1866), Practitioner: A Monthly Journal of Therapeutics (f. 1868), Brain: A Journal of Neurology
(f. 1878), and the Journal of Physiology (f. 1878). Interestingly, Nature operated at a financial
loss for the first twenty years of its publication, but Macmillan saw it as worthwhile because it
developed authors for, and patrons of, its line of scientific books (Baldwin 2012: 145). 1890 was
the first year that income from subscriptions and advertising exceeded the costs of printing the
journal. In the 1880s, Frederick Macmillan explained his view to George Macmillan that Nature
was a convenient way to advertise their scientific publications (Baldwin 2012: 154 f.n. 95).
Indeed the pages of Nature in the 1870s and 1880s contain not only advertisements for
Macmillan’s own scientific books, but also advertisements for scientific and mathematical books
published by other British publishing companies. Historians David McKitterick and Melinda
Baldwin offer similar views, concluding that in developing contributors and readers for their
books, Macmillan’s periodical publications served the company’s primary interest as a book
publisher (Baldwin 2012, McKitterick 2004a: 400). Beyond advertisements for their own books
in Macmillan periodicals, the company also advertised its books in other magazines including

142

The Athenaeum, The Educational Times, and the Publisher’s Circular (see Figures 15 and
187

16).

Macmillan’s books themselves served as advertising vehicles for the company’s catalogue of
other book titles. Percival Frost’s edition of Newton’s Principia (1854) contained extensive
advertising of Macmillan’s catalogue of books on its very first and final pages. Frost served
frequently as examiner for Cambridge’s mathematical Tripos examination, in which knowledge
of the Principia was essential. Frost’s book was recommended to students as preparation
material for this exam (Besant 1893: 18). Macmillan’s advertising in Frost’s book was intended
to attract the attention of Cambridge mathematical students.
Inside the front cover and prior to the title page is a listing of “New Educational Works from
Macmillan & Co.”. This list of ten titles includes Phear’s works on mechanics and hydrostatics,
Grant’s astronomy, Puckle’s conic sections and algebraic geometry, Snowball’s trigonometry
and Lund’s algebra (Frost 1854). A complete list of Macmillan’s Mathematical Class-Books for
Colleges and Schools is given over four pages after the end of Frost’s text, listing twenty-five
works, and signaling (as indicated in Table 1) that after a decade in business, Macmillan had
invested significantly in the publication of educational works about mathematics. This
advertisement records already published books as well as books in preparation, with some titles
accompanied by positive “blurbs” or testimonials by school masters or college tutors, or
quotations from reviews in periodicals such as The Athenaeum, Philosophical Magazine, English
Journal of Education, The Educator or Educational Times. Following the list of mathematical
class-books is an extensive 16-page catalogue of what appears to be, as of November 1854, an
alphabetical listing of all of Macmillan & Co.’s publications (See Frost 1854).
By the time Macmillan published the fourth edition of Frost’s textbook in 1883, the publisher’s
advertising had been substantially scaled back. Instead of multiple lists of books published by
Macmillan, there are only two pages of advertising at the very back of the text. Both pages are

145

Macmillan also displayed an awareness that attaching the endorsement of a celebrity scientist to
their book products was one way to sell copies of a publication with otherwise limited appeal. As
Roy MacLeod has noted, historians of book culture must be sensitive to both the actual content
of books as well as to the image and desirability (or lack thereof) of the perceived content
(MacLeod 1980:63). Both the actual content of a book, as well as the value placed on acquiring
or being associated with a book or its author, were crucial to the business of publishing and
specifically to the aspect of advertising books.
In 1881 Daniel MacAlister considered in his readers’ reports the value of publishing an English
translation of the German botanist Hermann Müller’s book Die Befruchtung der Blumen durch
Insekten. Before Macmillan took the decision to publish it, Daniel MacAlister consulted with
botanists Sydney Howard Vines and Alexander Dickson, afterwards writing to Charles Darwin
for his opinion on the value of an English translation. Vines and Dickson recommended the
translation, but could offer no opinion as to how such a book would sell. Darwin, when
consulted, wrote: “Whether it would answer for a publisher I can be of no opinion”.

188

Donald MacAlister, on the other hand, whose job it was to assess the financial sensibility of
prospective publishing projects, strongly encouraged Macmillan to connect Darwin’s name as
prominently as possible to Müller’s book as a way to make the work desirable to the English
audience. The addition of a preface by Darwin, MacAlister suggested, would be a coup, and then
Darwin’s name could be used to “striking effect” in Macmillan’s advertisements:
I thought the last thing was to get Darwin’s opinion, my own after that of Vines and
Dickson’s being only of small importance. You will see how cordially [Darwin] endorses
the recommendations of the other botanists – so that there can no longer be any doubt of
the value of the book and the importance of the translation. What however must also
interest you is the chance of a remunerative sale. My opinion about this can scarcely be of
great value, but there is one suggestion which I think if carried out would do much to
render this success less problematical. I mean that as Darwin is so much interested in the
appearance of the translation he should be asked to provide a preface or preparatory

146

introduction. This could have a striking effect on advertisements, like that of Roscoe's
name in Joule's chemistry and would do much to sell the book. In a certain way Darwin has
already done much to advertise Müller's name, for every scrap of botanical news which
Müller sends him is forthwith sent to Nature and appears in big print. There is therefore a
large circle of readers who know Müller's work and the high esteem in which Darwin
regards it. This is the fact which makes me hopeful of the translation’s success. This and
the fact of Müller’s helping to make the English book practically a new edition, should I
think tell with you powerfully in deciding. These facts were not before the previous
publisher referred to, and I think materially alter the problem of successful publication.
These are the materials on which I base my judgment and I give them to you as they are in
preference to stating the judgment simply.189

In the end, Müller’s book was translated by D’Arcy Wentworth Thompson and published in
English by Macmillan as The Fertilisation of Flowers, in July of 1883. It included a four page
prefatory note by Charles Darwin, whose name appeared prominently on the title page.
Macmillan recognized the power of scientists as public figures. They traded on that celebrity and
they helped to build it. One of the ways in which they promoted scientists as celebrity figures
was through the production and sale of engraved portraits. Several of Macmillan’s own scientific
authors were depicted in this way. Macmillan’s portrait gallery of eminent scientific figures
included physician Francis E. Anstie, botanist Joseph Dalton Hooker, chemist Henry Enfield
Roscoe, physicist George Gabriel Stokes, biologist Charles Wyville Thomson, astronomer
George Biddell Airy, physicist James Clerk Maxwell, and mathematician William Spottiswoode.
All of these men had been at one time or another, Macmillan authors.
Macmillan’s portrait gallery of eminent scientists also included engravings of people who were
not Macmillan authors. Their series of scientific portraits included depictions of Robert Wilhelm
Bunsen, Charles Darwin, Michael Faraday, William Harvey, Hermann von Helmholtz, John
Tyndall, Charles Wheatstone, James Prescott Joule, Louis R. Aggassiz, Charles Lyell, Richard

Paul had previously consulted him on the possibility of translating the work. Although he had recommended it, they
never followed through with the project.

147

Owen, William Thomson (Lord Kelvin), Lord Beaconsfield, John Couch Adams, C. W. Siemens
and Arthur Cayley (Foster 1891). These engravings were commissioned from either Charles
Henry Jeens or George J. Stodart.
Macmillan’s series of scientific portraits had been originally created for Nature, in which an
occasional series of articles celebrating “Scientific Worthies” began as an irregular series paying
tribute to great men of science. Sometimes these biopics (the portrait, along with a biographical
article), appeared while the subject was alive and sometimes as a posthumous honour. Michael
Faraday received the first tribute in the September 18, 1873 issue of Nature. Frederick Gowland
Hopkins received the final tribute in 1938, the last in a list of forty-eight scientific men who had
been so profiled (Barr 1965: 354). As well including them in the journal Nature, Macmillan
offered these portraits of famous scientific figures for sale as individual engravings. The
production and sale of such portraits offered the image of scientific greatness for public
consumption.

7. Mathematics for the world
As John Feather has noted in his history of British publishing, the book industry was one of
Britain's major conduits for foreign exchange in the nineteenth century, and during that time it
exported about 40 per cent of its total output in books (Feather 1988: x). A proportion of this
export was mathematical books. Some work has already been done on British mathematical
books produced for foreign markets (Aggarwal 2007; Chatterjee 2006). From the 1850s onwards
there was a constant exchange of English-produced books with America, Canada, India,
Australia, New Zealand, Japan and South Africa (Rukavina 2010). In the 1860s, Macmillan
specifically sold books into Cape Town, Glasgow, Dublin, Leipzig, New York, Melbourne,
Sydney, Adelaide, Hobart and Philadelphia (McKitterick 2004a: 397-8). Macmillan sold books
into more international markets than any other English publisher. As historians of book
publishing have reflected, “Macmillan’s aspirations spanned the English-speaking world, as a
general publisher, an educational publisher, and as a periodical publisher” (McKitterick 2004a:
400).
While many mathematical authors wrote textbooks that were used in schools and universities, the
scale of Todhunter’s enterprise singles him out among the mathematical authors of his time, both
within the general trade of mathematical textbooks and within Macmillan’s book list specifically

148

(Barrow-Green 2001:189). As mentioned previously, Todhunter had nearly forty titles attributed
to his name under the Macmillan imprint (see Table 4). As an example of how Macmillan’s
mathematical books circulated in the worldwide market, we might consider Todhunter’s books
as one example.

First Editions Book, British Library) *Note: Price refers to either the most stable price or
the price on first printing. **Note: Some titles may have been reprinted beyond the last

from Macmillan’s first editions book only.

In England, Todhunter’s books were featured in articles on the Mathematical Tripos contained in
nineteenth century editions of the Student’s Guide to the University of Cambridge. Twelve of
Todhunter’s textbooks were recommended as useful reading for the Cambridge undergraduate in
the 1893 edition of this guide. Todhunter’s book were used as course texts by the Universities of
Manchester, Leeds, Liverpool, Edinburgh and Bristol well into the twentieth century (BarrowGreen 2001:189). Todhunter’s books were familiar pedagogical materials within many of
Britian’s foremost centers where one might seek further education in mathematics. Todhunter
served as an intermittent examiner for the Mathematical Tripos and Smith’s Prizes at Cambridge,
and worked as an examiner for London University, the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich,
the East India Company military college and the Indian Civil Service (Barrow-Green 2011: 184).
He wrote to his wife in 1878 “there is a library of mathematical books provided by the Civil
Service Commission [of India] for the use of the Examiners. It consists of fourteen volumes, ten
of which are by myself” (quoted in Barrow-Green 2011: 184).
American editions of Todhunter’s textbooks became set texts for particular markets in the United
States (Barrow-Green 2001: 187). In 1882 the New York edition of Todhunter’s Algebra for
Beginners was the prescribed text for the public schools (i.e. government funded schools) in the
Canadian province of Nova Scotia. English-language editions also surfaced in Australia.
Between 1881 and 1885 at least eight of Todhunter’s textbooks and four of his keys were
translated into Japanese. It is suspected that the appearance of Todhunter’s books in Japanese
was in part due to Dairoku Kikuchi, who had been a student at University College, London

151

before going to St. John’s College, Cambridge in 1873. Kikuchi returned to Japan in 1877, and
became the first Japanese professor of mathematics at the newly founded University if Tokyo.
He was keen to promote a Cambridge-like education in Tokyo, and used several of Todhunter’s
textbooks at the university. Kikuchi himself subsequently wrote several of his own textbooks on
geometry (Barrow-Green 2001: 185 f.n. 35, 187 f.n. 56).
It is unlikely that the Japanese translations of Todhunter’s mathematical textbooks were
“authorized” by Macmillan or that the printing of these books benefitted Todhunter financially.
“Pirated” English books were almost as common in foreign markets as imported English ones.
International copyright agreements were not put in place until the beginning of the twentieth
century. No legal agreement or law prevented the reproduction and sale of a foreign title in a
domestic market. Although in some circles it was looked down upon as disrespectful, this
attitude did not prevent enterprising publishers from producing cheap editions of popular foreign
titles without offering compensation to the original author or publisher. Particularly in the United
States, pirating British periodicals and books was something of a sport, and a practice that
enriched many entrepreneurial printers.
A report in Nature charged The Tokio Bookselling Company of Japan of pirating copies of
English and American schoolbooks, with Todhunter’s Elementary Algebra and Euclid among the
books being reproduced. The report states: “An examination of the reprint of Todhunter’s
Algebra shows letters upside down, wrong fount letters, letters misplaced, and words improperly
spelt, testifying to the slovenly way in which the books have been printed. There is said to be
scarcely a page in the book which does not contain one or more errors in orthography, and the
mathematical formulae, which always require such care at the printers’ hands, must be in a bad
state when the ordinary words are so neglected” (Anon. 1883).
Todhunter’s mathematical textbooks enjoyed popularity in India. Macmilllan began publishing
mathematical books specifically for India in 1873. However British books were imported into
India before that. London bookseller Thacker & Co. was established in Calcutta and Bombay in
1857 and acted as bookseller and publisher to the Universities of India. By the end of the century
Thacker offered more than 200 English titles in mathematics (Aggarwal 2007: 11). However,
Macmillan was the only British publisher who published educational texts, and specifically

152

mathematical ones, for the use of Indian schools and colleges in the nineteenth century
(Aggarwal 2007: 14).
In 1876 Indian editions of Todhunter’s Mensuration and Surveying and Algebra were prepared
by Macmillan, printed in Cambridge at the Pitt Press, and then sent to India. Similarly, a special
edition of Todhunter’s Euclid was prepared for the use of Indian schools in 1877. However, there
was a need in India for mathematical textbooks in local languages, as well as in English. This
prompted the pirating and translation of English mathematical textbooks into local languages.
Todhunter’s Euclid and his Algebra for the use of Colleges and Schools were translated into
Urdu in 1871 and Hindi translations were made of Todhunter's Euclid and Mensuration between
1850-1870 (Barrow-Green 2001: 196, Aggarwal 2007:14). Todhunter's Algebra and Geometry
were translated into Bengali and his Geometry into Urdu.
Translators of British mathematical books were frequently teachers in need of material,
particularly the mathematics teachers at Agra College, Calcutta Sanskrit College, professors at
Lahore Oriental College, Benares Sanskrit College (established 1792), and Delhi College
(established 1792).
Bapu Deb Shastri taught mathematics and natural philosophy at the Benares Sanskrit College
from 1842. He was very interested in European science and translated many English books into
Sanskrit. Shastri compiled Sanskrit treatises on geometry, trigonometry, analytical geometry,
conic sections, mechanics, differential and integral calculus, and the solar and lunar eclipses.
However, most of the English books he used to prepare his treatises are not known, as he did not
generally acknowledge or refer to other works in them (Aggarwal 2007:16). It was commonly
the case that mathematical books translated into local languages did not detail their provenance.
Koonj Behary, a teacher of mathematics at Agra College, produced Hindi translations of books
covering the topics of trigonometry, arithmetic and geometric progressions, finite and infinite
series, and cubic equations. Some of these translations replaced English trigonometric terms for
specifically Hindi ones and Indian alphabet letters, rather than English ones, were used to label
the vertices of geometric figures (Aggarwal 2007:16).
Canadian mathematician J. C. Fields used several British textbooks during his time as a high
school student at Hamilton Collegiate Institute. These included a new Toronto edition of Isaac

153

Todhunter’s The Elements of Euclid for the use of schools (1876). When Fields matriculated into
the mathematics department at the University of Toronto, Todhunter’s Spherical Trigonometry
and his Theory of Equations were used in his first year as assigned texts (Riehm and Hoffman
2011: 21).
There is evidence Todhunter’s geometry textbooks were also translated into Chinese, that they
circulated in Australia, and that his Algebra for the use of Colleges and Schools (1858) was
published in Italian in 1871 (Barrow-Green 2001: 187 f.n. 55, 196).
Despite their success, Todhunter’s textbooks were criticized for their lack of originality and their
inclusion of errors. The English geometer Thomas Archer Hirst pointed out that the proof of
convergence of the binomial theorem Todhunter offered in his Algebra was invalid for certain
conditions of n. Hirst expressed surprise that Todhunter, a student and disciple of Augustus De
Morgan, would allow four editions of his Algebra textbook to be published without correcting “a
logically false demonstration of an important theorem” (Hirst quoted in Barrow-Green 2001:
188). Todhunter also faced criticism that his Algebra was imprecise in its use of language, and
that his textbooks perpetuated the confusions and errors existing in older works on the same
subjects (Barrow-Green 2001: 196).
As Barrow-Green reflects in her article about him, despite his involvement in and knowledge
about mathematics education, rather than being a supporter of reforms to mathematical teaching,
Todhunter was in fact a staunch defender of the status quo (Barrow-Green 2001: 190). The
English pedagogical status quo valued the instillation of rigorous mathematical reasoning into
students, valuing the process of mathematical instruction over the accuracy of facts or the
relevance of results.
Todhunter shared an attitude with Donald MacAlister that when it came to a mathematics
textbook, the way in which the material is presented outweighed the value of originality in the
material itself. It was their opinion that the only room for innovation in a mathematics textbook
was in the form in which the material was presented, not in its content. MacAlister went so far as
to suggest that originality would actually detract from the eventual success of a mathematics

154
190

textbook.

Subscribing to a similar philosophy, most of Todhunter’s textbooks contained little

or no original content (Barrow-Green 2001: 199).

8. Conclusion
In her article about the founding and administration of the scientific journal Nature, Melinda
Baldwin presents an interesting analysis suggesting that the age and generation of Nature’s
scientist-contributors affected how they viewed and used Nature as a publication vehicle.
Baldwin finds that the older generation of contributors, men whose lives ended around the turn
of the twentieth century, differed in their pattern of contribution to Nature compared to the
younger generation of scientists who had been born around 1850 (Baldwin 2012: 138). She
suggests that while the older generation, men like P.G. Tait, Herbert Spencer, Joseph Hooker, T.
H. Huxley, Alfred Russel Wallace and Charles Darwin, contributed book reviews or popular
pieces to the magazine, they did not see Nature as a desirable forum in which to write about their
own scientific work. The older generation had largely published and presented arguments for or
against a colleague’s scientific theory in the popular press, alongside articles on politics, religion,
literature and philosophy, in magazines like the British Quarterly Review or the Nineteenth
Century (Baldwin 2012: 143-4).
The younger generation by comparison, engineer John Perry, physicist Oliver Lodge, zoologist
E. Ray Lankester, naturalist George John Romanes, botanist William Turner Thiselton-Dyer, and
chemist Raphael Meldola, had a different attitude towards publication and how publication
related to their career aspirations. It was the younger generation, writes Baldwin, who embraced
Nature and helped turn it from a general interest periodical about science, as it had first been
intended as a periodical written by scientists for the public, into a forum in which scientists
largely communicated information to one another.

190

About a manuscript by R. Hudson Graham on “Comparative Statics”, MacAlister writes: “This
manuscript goes more fully into the subject than any other English manual. Its information is useful
though it is to be found more or less explicitly scattered over various books. In other words little but the
grouping is original. That is no draw back in a textbook.” MP 55932, Readers Reports, 1867-1882, p. 37.

155

What Baldwin’s article raises is the important fact that during the period 1850 to 1900, the world
of publishing, and the practice of science, were both evolving rapidly, and the relationships
forged between these two worlds were constantly under negotiation. A more detailed overview
of Macmillan’s advertising strategies, and the successful sale of their mathematical and scientific
books, would have to take into account how authors and audiences for science and scientific
materials, in education and intellectually, changed over these fifty years.
The present study has attempted to discover some quantitative facts about the circulation of, and
monetary remuneration earned from, Macmillan’s mathematical books. It does not escape notice
that a more interesting story, perhaps, might be to investigate further how Macmillan evolved
during this time as a scientific publisher of books and periodicals, and how the behavior and
decisions of authors and publishers reacted to the changing landscape of both science and
publishing in the last part of the nineteenth century.
The work presented here raises questions about how publication informed and changed
audiences for mathematics and science during the nineteenth century, and how authors used
publication as one of the tools that brought the practice of science further respectability,
authority, and patronage. Publication also offered a source of income for authors when few paid
positions for scientists had yet been created in university or institutional settings. Successful
textbooks or popular books on science or mathematical subjects provided a reliable stream of
income to both author and publisher. For the scientists, this could mean a supplement to a
profession with otherwise limited options for earning income. To the publisher, reliable income
from a successful book title helped subsidized new endeavors, and helped mitigate the perilous
trade of publishing and in what was an otherwise risky business.
Income generated by university-affiliated authors, for successful textbooks at least, were in fact
as lucrative to the publisher as income generated by their successful fiction authors. Under the
Macmillan model, profits from successful ventures in textbook publishing forged relationships
out of which the printing of higher books could be subsidized. For Macmillan, the books in
higher mathematics helped make their reputation as serious publishers of learned works. The
impression of intellectual rigor formed by their science books list may have helped to counter
assumptions about the credibility and erudition of the textbooks on their educational books list.
For authors of successful textbooks for Macmillan, the relationship forged through a successful

156

publishing venture might mean the publisher was more willing to risk losing money on the
publication of their more obscure or polemical manuscripts. In negotiating these author-publisher
relationships, the model of an academic publishing house, particularly one that published
science, was invented by Macmillan in this period.
Publishing, including science and mathematical publishing, was connected and influenced by
colonialism and economics. Knowledge flowed along lines and links established by geo-political
movements and international trade, price structures, and markets. Due to the increased cost of
printing mathematics, the cost to enter the market with a mathematical book was higher than for
books on other subjects. This exaggerated the cost to benefit ratio of the mathematical book. The
change in the conditions of the nineteenth century British book market, conditions Simon Eliot
sees as causing what he calls the “mass-production revolution”, meant that Macmillan, already
heavily invested in the production of mathematical textbooks, spread the English image of
mathematics around the world through the trade and export of these books.
The forces of industrialization came to dominate England’s book production, and this fact may
have influenced the forming of educational structures of mathematics in developing countries,
through the increased peddling and higher circulation of English-originated books. The English
image of mathematics, through the use of English textbooks, may have taken hold in more places
than it otherwise might have, if the industrial revolution had not driven outwards from England
an English intellectual product within the material product of the book.

Chapter 5
Enabling a Mathematical Culture: The Development of
Mathematical Printing and Publishing in Canada

1. Introduction
In 1995 Tom Archibald and Louis Charbonneau wrote an overview to the history of mathematics
from its very early beginnings in the Canadas up to 1945 (Archibald and Charbonneau 1995).
This article demonstrates that until fairly recently, mathematics in Canada existed in a somewhat
marginal and rudimentary state. Perhaps this estimate – or self-estimate, as the case may be –
that Canadian mathematics has been unimportant, marginal or rudimentary explains why only
one historical overview of mathematics in Canada has been written to date.
Most relevant to this chapter, Archibald and Charbonneau recognize that printers and publishers
served an important function in developing a mathematical culture in Canada. In order to
develop a mathematical culture, they write, three key aspects of a society play a role. First, a
population or governing regime must place value on the acquisition of mathematical skill.
Secondly, an educational infrastructure, including teachers, teaching materials, the curriculum
and its objectives, is critical in shaping and developing a local practice of mathematics. Thirdly,
they note, people who are interested in mathematics rely on the activities of the book trade:
publishers and printers make available basic mathematical knowledge.
This chapter will explore in what respect the book trade shaped the development of mathematical
practice and knowledge in Canada, focusing primarily on Anglophone Canada. In the late
nineteenth and early twentieth century, book printers and publishers in Canada were struggling to
establish themselves within a context that was structured in many ways to guarantee the
continued dominance of printed materials originating from Britain and America over Canadianoriginated materials. In so far as mathematical educators, and printers and publishers, identified
as Canadian, both communities often shared a desire to nurture local knowledge. What I suggest
in this chapter is that the development of a book and publishing trade in Canada was connected
to the development of a specifically Canadian culture of mathematics. It is demonstrated how the

158

printing and publishing of mathematics in Canada was connected to larger goals of nation
building and the definition of Canadian national identity in the years between 1850 and 1930.
Section (2) begins with a brief history of printing and publishing before Canadian confederation
(prior to 1867). Section (3) overviews scientific and mathematical culture in Canada during the
nineteenth century. The following sections look at specific examples of Canadian mathematical
authors and the publishers with whom they collaborated. (4) looks at the Montreal based
publisher John Lovell, Canada’s largest and most powerful publisher in the years leading up to
Confederation. Lovell published a successful series of English-language schoolbooks, with the
teacher and physician John Herbert Sangster authoring Lovell’s schoolbooks on the subjects of
natural philosophy, chemistry, arithmetic, algebra and mensuration. (5) looks at James Gordon
MacGregor, a native Nova Scotian who held the Munro Chair in physics at Dalhousie University
in the 1880s. MacGregor turned to London’s Macmillan and Company as the publisher for his
An Elementary Treatise on Kinematics and Dynamics (1887). Opportunities to publish science in
Canada were limited in the nineteenth century. As a result, scientists often relied on foreign firms
for the publication of their work.
The final section (6) looks at John Charles Fields, Canada’s first research mathematician, and his
collaboration with the University of Toronto Press on the publication of the Proceedings of the
International Mathematical Congress held in Toronto in 1924. Fields spent four years stewarding
this massive technical publication through the press. In doing so, Fields helped build the
University of Toronto Press’s capacity to handle mathematical printing. Because of this, after
1930, technical publications difficult to typeset and produce, could emanate from a Canadian
publisher, rather than only from abroad. I argue this development further established a
mathematical culture that was recognizably and distinctively Canadian.

2. Printing and publishing mathematics in pre-confederation
Canada
While this chapter primarily focuses on mathematical practice and mathematical printing in the
Anglophone context, the earliest examples of mathematical culture in Canada began in Nouvelle
France (or New France), in an area that is now the province of Québec. The exploration of land
and navigation of the St. Lawrence River were skills of preeminent importance to this
developing French colony. Partly to impart relevant skills in cartography and navigation, the

159

Collège de Québec was founded in 1659. For the next hundred years, the Jesuit Collège offered
mathematical courses to its priests in training, overseen by a series of hydrographers who were
royally appointed in France. Jean Deshayes, who came from France to teach astronomy and
cartography, established the first science library in New France, containing approximately fifteen
volumes including the Marquis de l’Hôpital’s famous treatise Analyse des infiniment petits pour
l’intelligence des lignes courbes (1696) (Archibald and Charbonneau 1995: 4). However, the
mathematical activity that had been established dispersed during and after the battle for New
France in 1759. After Great Britain assumed political control, the Collège closed. Afterwards the
evolution of mathematics in Anglophone and Francophone Canada developed at more or less the
same rate (Archibald and Charbonneau 1995:1).
The earliest known printing in Canada took place in 1752. At that time, the few presses that
existed in British North America served the exclusive needs of the government (Dewalt 1995:
12). Printing still barely existed by the beginning of the nineteenth century, with only nine
printing offices in British North America at the time. However, that situation was to change
dramatically. The first few decades of the nineteenth century brought great waves of
immigration, and with a larger population came economic growth and greater efforts from
residents to take control of matters of local importance. Both factors created a greater need for
printing in the colony (Dewalt 1995: 13).
Most printing that took place in nineteenth century Canada was small in scale and most printers
did not use steam-powered machines. The typical country printer would have worked one hand
press with the assistance of a journeyman and possibly an apprentice or two. In many cases the
organization was even smaller consisting only of the printer with the possible assistance of his
family (Dewalt 1995: 21). Prior to confederation, Montreal, Halifax and Quebec were the
dominant centers of printing and printed culture. Montreal was the largest printing center, with
the most heavily capitalized printers as well as the most developed infrastructure in the allied
191

printing arts, including engravers, lithographers, and a type foundry.

191

In the 1830s The Montreal Type Foundry became the first producer of type in British North America. The
Dominion Type Foundry also began its existence (in Montreal) to serve nineteenth century printers. Both firms
produced type and acted as agents for foreign suppliers, bringing in imported types, presses, and printing supplies.

160

Partly as a result, Montreal was an important cultural center, and was the place where some of
the first efforts towards initiating a local literary and intellectual culture began. In the early years
of the nineteenth century, Michel Bibaud, a Montreal-based journalist, educator and poet,
launched several historical, literary and scientific journals with the goal of ameliorating the local
intellectual climate. Bibaud wrote in his inaugural issue of the Magasin du Bas-Canada that to
his dismay, a visiting man of letters would not find one literary or scientific journal in a province
of half a million people (Parker 1985: 55). This dearth of cultural material, said Bibaud, gives the
impression that “Que parmi les Canadiens d’origine française, il n’y a pas un seul homme
capable de conduire un journal de ce genre, ou pas assez de lecteurs instruits, ou amis de
l’instruction, pour le soutenir” (Bibaud, quoted in Parker 1985: 55). Although Bibaud did not
find much success with his publications, his goal in undertaking them was to raise the cultural
level of discourse among the residents of Lower Canada (Cyr 1985).
Besides being a journalist and writer, Bibaud published one of the earliest and most successful
manuals of arithmetic in Lower Canada. Its full title is L’arithmétique en quatre parties, savoir:
l’arithmétique vulgaire, l’arithmétique marchande, l’arithmétique scientifique, l’arithmétique
curieuse, suivie d’un précis sur la tenue des livres de comptes, d’eux-mêmes et sans Maître, ou
s’y perfectionner (Montreal, 1816). The four parts of Bibaud’s arithmetic were common
arithmetic, commercial arithmetic, scientific arithmetic, and recreational arithmetic. Bibaud’s
192

text was a compilation from other sources, which he indicated in the book.

While the original

version was intended for self-study, it was also used in schools, leading Bibaud to republish the
book in 1832 as L’arithmétique à l’usage des écoles élémentaires du Bas-Canada (Bibauld
1832).

192

Bibaud’s book borrowed material from the first arithmetic published in Quebec, that is Traité d’arithmétique
pour l’usage des écoles (1809) by Jean-Antoine Bouthiller. Bouthiller studied in Montreal and worked as a
surveyor, journalist, translator, inspector of highways, and justice of the peace. His book received limited success,
perhaps because it encouraged the memorization of rules rather than comprehension (Archibald and Charbonneau
1995: 10). Nevertheless Bouthiller’s book was printed in several editions until 1864. Bibaud also borrowed material
from Francis Walkingame’s The Tutor’s Assistant, Being a Compendium of Arithmetic and Complete Questionbook
(a popular British textbook, which received a Montreal edition in 1818), Abbé Sauri’s Compendium des institutions
mathématiques de l’Abbé Sauri, and M. Despiau Choix d’amusements physiques mathématiques (London 1800)
(Archibald and Charbonneau 1995: 10-11; Bibauld 1816: i-iv).

161

Compared to Bibaud’s L’arithmétique en quatre parties, his 1832 arithmetic for elementary
schools is simplified and shortened. L’arithmétique en quatre parties is 199 pages in length
compared to his school-text which is 108 pages. L’arithmétique en quatre parties is organized
according to its four named sections, and then subdivided into numbered chapters and sections.
By comparison, Bibaud’s 1832 book is organized primarily by subject matter, and excludes his
previous treatment of logarithms, probabilities, and recreational mathematics. Bibauld’s 1832
L’arithmétique is principally pragmatic. It includes calculations of currency appropriate to the
country, complex multiplication and division focus on the calculation of pounds, shillings and
pence. A significant section on decimals and calculating decimals is included, as is the rule of
three, and sections dealing with the calculation of interest, exchange and trade.
The preface of both texts highlights Bibauld’s motivation to improve society through the
publication of these works, from which he intends the reader to learn more mathematics. Bibaud
dedicates his 1816 book to those who want to learn the subject but who lack a Master to teach
them. In dedicating oneself to the text, Bibauld says, the reader will direct himself towards selfimprovement, or at least towards maintaining mathematical skills he may have learned in school.
Bibaud’s 1832 preface also explains how he sees his book functioning in society. Priced within
reach of the less fortunate, he says, the book can be purchased by teachers, school trustees, or
given as a reward to poor children, at a time when “le nécessité de l'instruction être
universellement sentie dans la Province” (Bibauld 1832: 3). While his 1816 book notably cites
previous school-textbooks as inspiration, the preface of his 1832 edition does not include credits
to any source material.
In English Canada, apart from a few publications related to finance, mathematical printing also
developed alongside the general need to teach practical arithmetic. At first local editions of
successful American and British texts supplied the market for elementary arithmetical books.
Francis Walkingame’s The Tutor’s Assistant, Being a Compendium of Arithmetic and Complete
Questionbook, was extremely popular in Britain and America, and widely used in the early
nineteenth century (Wallis 1963).

193

193

Walkingame’s The Tutor’s Assistant was popular in Canada

The book was first published in 1751. Before the author’s death in 1783, eighteen different editions had been
produced. Longman’s continued to publish the book (along with other publishers who issues editions) throughout

162

as well, with nine Canadian editions including printings in Picton, St. John, Toronto and
Montreal (Archibald and Charbonneau 1995: 7). Six Canadian editions of Walkingame’s
arithmetic exist within the Ontario Historical Textbook Collection at the Ontario Institute for the
194

Study of Education (OISE).

In the OISE collection, each copy of Walkingame’s The Tutor’s Assistant is printed in the crown
octavo size with plain binding, however on inspection each differs from the other in its title page
or contents. Comparing the 1830 and the 1841 “stereotype edition”, the contents of “Part I:
Arithmetic in Whole Numbers”, appears in differing order although the content is the same. The
setting of the 1844 edition is once again, different from the other two. The table of contents is
presented differently in the 1844 Toronto edition with the section headings being “Integers,
Vulgar Fractions, Decimal Fractions, Superficial Mensuration” rather than “Arithmetic in Whole
Numbers, Vulgar Fractions, Decimals, Duodecimals, Questions” as it appears in the 1841
edition. Stereotyping was still fairly new technology in the first half of the nineteenth century.
These Canadian editions reflect the many differences (typographic and organizational) of local
editions when the same text was set many times at different printers.
The 1830 edition contains an advertisement for the publisher, J. A. Hosington of Montreal.
Hosington’s list of book for sale includes, as well as Walkingame’s The Tutor’s Assistant,
Simpson’s Euclid, Towles’ Astronomy, Ryan’s Astronomy, Gibson’s Surveying, Gough’s
Arithmetic, Adam’s Arithmetic, and Dilworth’s Arithmetic.
An 1849 edition of Walkingame’s The Tutor’s Assistant (a stereotype edition) hails from Picton,
announcing it was made from stereotypes plates. On the front cover is a blue paper advertisement
pronouncing “Walkingame’s arithmetic, adapted for the use of schools in Canada, Authorized by
the Board of Education, Upper Canada”. In the middle of the cover is an embossed illustration of

the nineteenth century, producing an estimated five to ten thousand copies per edition. What is thought to be the
179th edition was produced by Milner and Sowerby of Halifax (England) in 1854 and 1861 (Wallis 1963: 204).
194

Copies in the OISE collection include an 1844 copy published by Eastwood & Co. of Younge Street (Toronto),
1849 and 1853 copies published by Brewer, McPhail & C. of 46 King Street East (Toronto), an 1841 copy from
Armour & Ramsay of Kingston and Montreal, an 1830 edition from J. A. Hosington and John Campbell of
Montreal.

advertisement for the printer J. McDonald. The advertisement states that McDonald, in addition
to carrying for sale Walkingame’s The Tutor’s Assistant, offers for sale “various kinds of school
books found in the country. Bibles and testaments, Miscellaneous works such as History,
Biography, Political Philosophy, Temperance, … and stationary of every design.”
Early American mathematical textbooks were used and printed in Canada. Popular American
arithmetics include Daniel Adams’ The Scholar’s Arithmetic (1801), which later became Adam’s
New Arithmetic (1827), and Nathan and David Daboll’s Schoolmaster’s Assistant: Being a Plain
195

Comprehensive System of Practical Arithmetic (1799).

An 1834 edition of Daboll’s

Schoolmaster’s Assistant resides in the Ontario Historical Textbook Collection at the Ontario
Institute for Studies in Education.

196

The book begins with six recommendations from American

teachers hailing from Yale, Rhode Island College, and Plainfield Academy and Billerica
Academy in Massachusetts. In the preface Nathan Daboll explains that his goal with the work
was to furnish students and teachers with more examples, so that the student not be “hurried
through the ground rules too fast for his capacity” (Daboll 1834: v). Daboll’s introduction of the
Federal coin (on p. 20) within the context of whole numbers and addition is, he explains, so that
readers can acquire an understanding of money even if they don’t proceed to later sections on
fractions. In the sections on compound addition, multiplication and division, examples of how to
add quantities of sterling money (pounds, shillings, pence), time (seconds, minutes, hours, days,
weeks etc.), wine (gallons, quarts, pints), and other measures including apothecaries weight,
cloth measure, Troy weight, and avoirdupois weight show, as do many of the other examples,
how deeply rooted Daboll’s book is in the practical, local context of its readers (Daboll 1834:
44). Other parts of the book contain rules for calculating simple interest, compound interest,

195

Prior to the creation of regulated public schools, the use of textbooks was not mandated, and a plethora of
different books were used in the 1820s period. In Hamilton’s earliest public schools, Daboll’s and Walkingame’s
arithmetic books were used to teach mathematics (Smith 1905: 13). In Norfolk Country, arithmetics by Daboll,
Dilworth, Pike and Deighman were used in the classroom. The York Common School used arithmetics by
Walkingame and Gray (Parvin 1965: 9-10). Charles Hutton’s arithmetic is also mentioned by historians of education
in Upper Canada as being in common use (Parvin 1965: 12).

brokerage fees, annuities and currency exchange (particularly relevant because several states had
their own currencies at the time).
Daboll’s textbook is also subtly, but proudly, American. Various examples require calculations
involving the salary of the President. Daboll’s notes praise Congress for the wisdom of
introducing decimal currency, while other examples involve calculation of the national debt of
England (Daboll 1834: 23, 53, 69). Daboll’s Schoolmaster’s Assistant embodies the national
character of its author.
The landscape for early mathematical textbooks in Canada frequently reflected political realities.
American textbooks represented republican and democratic ideas. Motivation for the production
of Canadian textbooks often derived from a desire to displace American textbooks with books
reinforcing British loyalties. The desire to displace American textbooks was particularly present
in Upper Canada, where American books were often cheaper and easier to obtain than British
ones. In Upper Canada, printers turned out numerous copies of William Fordyce Mavor’s
English Spelling Book and Lindley Murray’s English Reader, for example, as a way of
reinforcing allegiance to British language and culture (Dewalt 1995: 19).

197

Schoolbooks of all kinds, including mathematical ones, carried symbolism communicating the
social and political identities of their authors and publishers. John Strachan, who wrote the first
arithmetic textbook for Upper Canada, Concise Introduction to Practical Arithmetic: For the
Use of Schools (Montreal 1809), was an advocate for the standardization of education and the
domestic production of textbooks (Archibald and Charbonneau 1995: 7). Strachan was an
important figure in the development of institutions of education, and was involved in the
founding of both McGill and King’s College (now part of University of Toronto). He became the
first Inspector of Schools in Upper Canada, advocating for the standardization of education and
the development of grammar schools (i.e. secondary schools) (Archibald and Charbonneau
1995:7).

197

For more about politicization and the use of text books in Upper Canada, see chapter one, “Textbooks in Upper
Canada before 1846” (Parvin 1965), particularly pp. 12-16, and pp. 29-34 in chapter two of the same.

165

When Strachan published Concise Introduction to Practical Arithmetic, he was a relatively new
resident of Upper Canada just beginning his career in education. After arriving in Kingston in
1899 to become a schoolmaster, Strachan “experienced much inconvenience from the want of
school books”, thus motivating his compiling of several treatises into this publication, for the
“greater convenience” of his school (Strachan 1809: iii). Seeing his duty as that of making “a
useful book rather than an ingenious one”, Strachan borrowed material from Charles Hutton and
Robert Hamilton, as well as compiling his own problems used in the classroom (Strachan 1809:
198

v).

When given the opportunity, Strachan says, he gives his pupils questions in Geography,

Natural Philosophy and Astronomy (as well as in arithmetic) (Strachan 1809: vi). Some of these
questions, mostly about calculating solar cycles, are included in the appendix. Several practical
topics are covered by Strachan’s treatise, including surveying, calculation of annuities, simple
and compound interest, the purchasing of stock, forms of receipt, as well as sections on the
usefulness of certain measures to the bricklayer, mason, carpenter and joiner, slater, tiller,
plasterer, painter and glazier (Strachan 1809: 175-76). As well as sections covering the usual
arithmetical operations, Strachan’s Concise Introduction to Practical Arithmetic shows how to
calculate with fractions and decimals, and introduces working with proportions, arithmetical and
geometric progressions, and calculating roots.
In the early nineteenth century it was a constant source of debate whether Upper Canada should
become a more autonomous political entity or stay a servant of the British Empire. These views
were reflected in the titles of some early mathematical textbooks. William Phillips, identified as
a teacher in ladies schools, authored A New and Concise System of Arithmetic, Calculated to
Facilitate the Improvement of Youth in Upper Canada in 1832. By contrast the title of G. and J.
Gouinlock’s arithmetic textbook makes a declaration of Imperial loyalty. A Complete System of
Practical Arithmetic, for the Use of Schools in British America, to Which are Added, A Set of
Book-Keeping by Single Entry, and a Practical Illustration of Mental Arithmetic, Federal
Money, Receipts, Bills of Exchange, Inland and Foreign, Explanation of Commercial Terms, etc.

198

Charles Hutton became a professor of mathematics at the Royal Military Academy in Woolwich. Before that, he
published several books including The Schoolmaster’s Guide, or A Complete System of Practical Arithmetic
(Newcastle Upon Tyne, 1764). Strachan may have been referring to Robert Hamilton’s Introduction to
Merchandize: Containing a Complete System of Arithmetic, A System of Algebra, Book-Keeping in Various Forms,
An Account of the Trade of Great Britain, and the Laws and Practices Which Merchants are Chiefly Interested In (2
vols. Edinburgh, 1767). Hamilton was a professor at Edinburgh University in the eighteenth century.

166

the Whole Adapted to the Business of Real Life, to the Circumstances of the Country, and to the
Present Improved State of Commerce (Hamilton, 1842).
The Methodists, who were disenfranchised by the Tory establishment from control over their
educational institutions (King’s College and Upper Canada College), founded their own
institution, Upper Canada Academy at Coburg, Ontario (later, Victoria College in the University
of Toronto). Canadian-born Methodist Egerton Ryerson, the first principal of Upper Canada
Academy, was deeply loyal to the British Empire and supported close affiliation between the
colonies (Archibald and Charbonneau 1995: 9).
The copy of Gouinlock’s arithmetic that resides in the Ontario Historical Textbook Collection
has several pages of testimonials added to the front by the publisher, Hugh Scobie. The first page
contains excerpts of praiseworthy comments about Gouinlock’s geography from various regional
newspapers, as well as from the superintendent of education from the township of Whitby as
well as Hamilton’s Superintendent of Schools. The gist of these comments are that Gouinlock’s
arithmetic is the best arithmetic to emanate from a Canadian press, and that one of its special
benefits is that it includes exchange from Canadian money to British and American money (as
well as to several other currencies). In the author’s own words, it is the best suited textbook for
the needs “of teaching, to real business, the present state of commerce, and the circumstances of
the country” (Gouinlock 1847: i).
Similar to Daboll’s arithmetic, Gouinlock introduces up front several measures, conversions and
tables that might be useful to a nation interested in natural resources and their processing. Apart
from increments used to give wool weight, hay and straw weight, lint or flax yarn measure,
several other interesting conversions are given. For example, useful in the very practical aspect
of the book’s examples, it is given that 10 skins = 1 dicker of leather, 56 lbs. = 1 firkin of butter,
120 lbs. = 1 faggot of steel, or that 500 herrings = 1 barrel, 280 lb. avoirdupois = 1 sack flour.
Calculating the quantities of goods bought and sold were important features in the examples used
in both Daboll’s and Gouinlock’s arithmetics.
Montreal dominated English and French language printing until Confederation, after which time
English language printing grew stronger in Toronto (Dewalt 1995: 15, Leroux 2007). By midcentury printing shops had been set up in small to medium sized centers including Kingston,

167

Saint John, Charlottetown, York (Toronto), Picton, Yarmouth, Mirimichi, Hamilton,
Peterborough and Sherbroke (Dewalt 1995: 15).
By the mid-nineteenth century, mechanization and industrialization arrived in the world of
Canadian printing. The Queen’s printer George Paschal Desbarats in Ottawa acquired a steamprinting machine in 1842. In Montreal, John Lovell was the first printer to apply steam printing
to trade books and periodicals in 1847. By 1867 Lovell’s operated twelve large steam-presses,
making his operation for a long time the largest in the country (Parker 1990).
In the half-century between 1800 and 1851, growth in Canadian printing had been swift. The
1851 census records 631 printers and 121 bookbinders. Moreover, printing by that time had
become an important component of Canada’s economic activity. In the 1871 census six printing
firms were ranked in the top 150 Canadian industrial establishments.

199

The building of the

Great Western and Grand Trunk railways in the 1850s connected many previously isolated
places, and allowed for the movement of people, mail, and products (including printed products)
to and from many more communities than had been previously possible. Telegraphy lines were
also laid, and roads, stagecoach services and steamships allowed information to be gathered and
distributed more cheaply and easily.
As in Britain, most of the growth in printing was related to increased periodical and newspaper
printing. In 1857 British North America had 291 newspapers on record (Dewalt 1995: 18).
Besides newspapers, printers also undertook job work and government contracts, as well as
printing ephemera, directories and catalogues. The first illustrated Massey catalogue was printed
in 1862 (Massey was a successful Canadian producer of agricultural and farming machines).
Educational primers were a common product of the early presses. These were guaranteed a large
enough sale to make them a reliable product in which to invest capital.
Throughout the nineteenth century, books were also imported into Canada. In the eighteenth
century, books were brought back to Canada during the shipping season. Travellers put books
they had brought back from abroad, up for sale. Individuals also sent orders for books with

199

These firms were Hunter, Rose & Co. (Toronto), Robertson & Cook (Toronto), James Beaty (Toronto), The
Globe (Toronto), Isaac B. Taylor (Ottawa) and John Lovell (Montreal) (Dewalt 1995: 22-23).

168

friends who were going overseas. Records of the book trade exist from even this early time in the
colony. For example, an advertisement in Halifax’s Royal Gazette from 23 June 1789 lists 230
books for sale on subjects including law, medicine, mathematics, navigation, and architecture,
200

that had been brought into the port of Halifax on the brig Ceres (Parker 1985: 16).

In the nineteenth century, publishers in the United States, Britain and France produced large
editions of standard works, especially the Bible, for export. As well as foreign-printed Bibles,
Canadian booksellers also sold book series, or “libraries”, produced by foreign publishers
(Dewalt 1995: 14). The Library of Useful Knowledge, a series produced by the Society for the
Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, is an example of such a series, containing books on subjects
including the sciences, technology, and other self-improving and practical subjects. The new
technologies of stereo- and electrotyping also allowed printing plates, from which books could
be easily reproduced, to circulate from one country to another. This allowed Canadian printers to
produce small editions of books that had proved popular or standard elsewhere.
In general, producing books domestically was more expensive than purchasing imported books.
Prior to local paper production in Canada, all the paper required by the colony for the entire year
was brought over during the shipping season. In winter the channels became locked up by ice
and stormy weather, and the colony was effectively cut off from trade (Dewalt 1995: 22). Only
almanacs, primers and catechisms, which were guaranteed a large sale, were worth the trouble to
print locally. As Dewalt reflects, “Although local paper mills had been established as early as
1804, large quantities of this essential material were still imported at great expense. Because of
the high costs of type and composition, which were incurred up front, and of paper and
presswork, which did not decline with volume, the ideal press run for a book [around 1840] was
about 1,500 copies. Few books in British North America could hope to find a market of even this
size” (Dewalt 2007: 89).

200

James Raven develops an interesting overview to the importing of books to North America in the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries (Raven 1997). While focusing mainly on New England, it does contain some data for the
importing of British and European books into Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, and Canada.

169

In the nineteenth century several local mills began producing paper.

201

At first local paper was

wove paper made out of rags and linen. But the industry largely moved on to develop paper from
wood pulp in the 1860s and 70s. This paper was used to make wrapping paper and newsprint, but
little to no writing or fine book paper was produced in Canada (Dewalt 1995: 38). Printer’s ink,
another necessary material for printing, was imported until the 1870s.

3. Mathematical and scientific culture in Canada
Despite the many technological changes that ameliorated the conditions of communication, local
book production, travel and trade, mathematics in Canada remained in a nascent state for many
years. Over the course of the nineteenth century, mathematical education became more rigorous,
with more opportunities for students to study advanced mathematics and garner some insight into
the purer side of the subject. Archibald and Charbonneau note that mathematical research of any
sort in Canada remained modest until at least the 1930s or after. Factors contributing to the
difficulties included a lack of direct contact between mathematical educators within Canada,
compounded by their lack of contact with mathematical researchers abroad. Canadians were held
back on all fronts, according to the necessary conditions for a mathematical culture, as defined
by these authors. They note that an extensive exposure to mathematical literature was difficult to
come by. Little value was placed on the pursuit of pure research, and the tiny mathematical
community was fully engaged with teaching and widely geographically separated (Archibald and
Charbonneau 1995: 20).
Scientists at the time confirm the view that Canadian science in general was in a rudimentary
state. James Loudon wrote in 1877, as President of the Royal Canadian Institute, that “The
growth of science in Canada, though progressive, is still in a rudimentary state, and stands in
want of increased stimulus, both from public and private sources. We have yet to see developed
the large and liberal spirit that prompts private citizens to devote their fortunes to the endowment
of seats of learning and the foundation of museums, observatories, and free public libraries …the
work of building up science has but yet commenced in this country” (Riehm and Hoffman 2011:

201

For instance, the Argenteuil Paper manufactory (founded 1804), the Acadian Paper Mill (founded 1819), James
Crook’s mill in West Flamborough U. C. (founded 1827), and the Eastwood & Skinner mill on the Don River, York
(now Toronto, founded 1827) (Parker 1985: 49).

170

68).
In his inaugural address to the Royal Society of Canada in 1881, President William Dawson, the
Nova Scotian geologist and natural historian, lamented that science in Canada had been hindered
by the “evils of isolation”, and a lack of books, libraries, publications, professional structures,
special collections, and employment for men wishing to pursue science. Dawson reflected, “…It
is a time of breaking-up ground and sowing and planting, not a time of reaping or gathering
fruit…in science and in literature, in art and education…we see only the rudiments and
beginnings of things, but if these are healthy and growing, we should regard them with hope”
(Dawson 1883: 6).
One of the critical factors Dawson cited as retarding the growth of science in Canada was a lack
of a printed culture of science. This dearth of a printed culture included a lack of sources for
learning and for research. Dawson reflected that as a boy his access to scientific books and
202

publications was scant.

However, it wasn’t just scientific sources that Dawson said were

missing. Dawson also remarked at length upon how the lack of a capacity to publish new
scientific results in Canada had several detrimental effects on one’s scientific career.
In his address Dawson remarked at length on the lack of availability for adequate scientific
publication in Canada. He made three points about the importance of publication. First, he noted
that difficulty with securing publication in some cases lead to the loss of priority for the
scientist’s work. Furthermore, if the quality of the printing is poor, then the work itself is often
also assumed to be of inferior quality, and this can lead to the marginalization of one’s scientific
work. A scientific publication may gain credibility because it has received sumptuous
presentation, whereas a badly printed one may be overlooked. Lastly, the inability to publish
results also meant that Canadian accomplishments are permanently lost or forgotten. Quoting
from Dawson’s address:
Again, means are lacking for the adequate publication of results. True we have the reports of
the Geological Society, and Transactions are published by some of the local societies, but the

202

As the son of a bookseller from Pictou Nova Scotia, Dawson’s access to books and printed materials had
probably been better than most (Sheets-Pyenson 1995: 17).

171

resources at the disposal of these bodies are altogether inadequate, and for anything
extensive or costly we have to seek means of publication abroad; but this can be secured only
under special circumstances; and while the public results of Canadian science become so
widely scattered as to be accessible with difficulty, much that would be of scientific value
fails of adequate publication, more especially in the matter of illustrations. Thus the
Canadian naturalist is often obliged to be content with the publication of his work in an
inferior style and poorly illustrated, so that it has the aspect of inferiority to work really no
better, which in the United States or the mother country has the benefit of sumptuous
publication and illustration. On this account he has often the added mortification of finding
his work overlooked or neglected, and not infrequently while he is looking in vain for means
of publication, that which he has attained by long and diligent labour is taken away from him
by its previous issue abroad. In this way also it very often happens that collectors who have
amassed important material of great scientific value are induced to place it in the hands of
specialists in other countries, who have at their command means of publication not possessed
by equally competent men here. The injury which Canadian science and the reputation of
Canada sustain in this way is well known to many who are present and who have been
personal sufferers (Dawson 1883: 8-9).

Dawson’s suggestion that Canadian scientists saw their work produced in Canada in “an inferior
style” and “poorly illustrated” giving it an “aspect of inferiority” compared to work done
elsewhere, is a particularly lucid and provocative suggestion. Making Canadian culture for
Canadians often involved lesser production values compared to producers serving bigger
markets. As printing historian Brian Dewalt also observed, this economic reality impacted
Canadian cultural producers regardless of whether the genre in question was literary or scientific:
“Canadian [publishers] competed with British and American competitors who used rapid
cylinder presses and industrially produced wood engravings to splash their pages with richlooking and impressive illustrations” (Dewalt 1995: 39).
Dawson advocated that the new Royal Society of Canada acquire the means to publish its own
Transactions as one way to ameliorate the status of Canadian science (Sheets-Pyenson 1995:
194). The first Proceedings and Transactions of the Royal Society of Canada was published in
1883, and proudly noted that it was printed in Canada with Canadian-made materials. With some
irony, however, the Canadian wood-pulp paper on which it was produced is now brittle and
disintegrating. The longevity of this important landmark in Canadian science may not be great.

172

The author notes that the copy she viewed was kept unceremoniously in a storage area of a
library basement, not in a special collection. The fact that our earliest local publications are not
well preserved today (compared to prized special collections containing mostly rare books from
other locales) perpetuates judgments of poor value to be made about Canadian contributions to
culture and history.
As President of the Royal Society of Canada, William Dawson, and James Loudon, as President
of the Royal Canadian Institute, expressed dismal views of the state of science in Canada.
External attitudes reinforced this self-assessment. When the British Association for the
Advancement of Science proposed to hold their 1884 annual meeting in Canada, 141 members
protested the location. While Canada may not have been a convenient location for a scientific
meeting of primarily British membership, the question was raised whether Canada deserved to
play host to such a prominent scientific meeting. An article in the Times observed, “a meeting in
Canada would merely be a glorified picnic of important men of science, who could have no
serious purpose in visiting Canada, a land not great in science…humbler men and less advanced
thought would serve equally well for her instruction” (Quoted in Riehm and Hoffman 2011: 23).
Nevertheless, the British Association did meet in Canada, holding their 1884 meeting in
Montreal, and returning to meet in Toronto in 1897. Reports about the 1884 meeting suggest it
was a success. Nature reported “the addresses are quite up to the average” (Anon. 1884a: 410).
With regards to Prof. Lodge’s lecture on “Dust”, Nature’s report on the meeting suggested “He
did well to speak strongly to a practical people of the rewards of pure scientific research, though
we trust that one result of the meeting will be to open the eyes of the Canadians to the utility of
substantially encouraging such research” (Anon. 1884b: 439). In a speech to attendees, the
Governor-General Lord Lansdowne said, “In a young country [scientific] pursuits are conducted
in the face of difficulties, competition and with material activity necessarily absorbing the
attention of a rapidly developing community. We may claim for Canada that she has done her
best, and has spared no pains to provide for the interests of science in the future. She has
scientific workers known and respected far beyond the bounds of their own nation” (Anon
1884b: 439).
Despite the positive tone of Lansdowne’s words, Canadian born and educated scientists faced
prejudice from within Canadian institutions, as well as from outside of them. When James

173

Loudon, a tutor of mathematics at the University of Toronto, was proposed in 1875 for
appointment to the Chair of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy, he faced opposition on the
grounds that his birth and education in Canada disqualified him for the position. The standard at
the time was for such positions to be filled by men from Scotland or Britain, who had trained
there. In 1875, responsibility for university appointments resided with the Ontario Legislature. A
letter-writing campaign saw over seventy letters sent to the Legislature in support of Loudon
assuming the position. When Loudon did assume the Chair of Mathematics and Natural
Philosophy at the University of Toronto, he was the first native-born Canadian to achieve the
title of Professor at an English-language Canadian university (Riehm and Hoffman 2011: 16).
If the practice of science in nineteenth century Canada was difficult and limiting, the practice of
original mathematics was non-existent. Loudon for example, ascended the ladder into university
administration after becoming Chair of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy. While he was a
devoted and lifelong advocate for Canadian science, he published little to no original science or
mathematics (Riehm and Hoffman 2011: 21). At the turn of the century, the prospect of
expanding the horizons of Canadian mathematics can be identified strongly with a few trailblazing individuals, most of whom had travelled abroad to study and brought their knowledge
and experience of research back to Canada (Archibald and Charbonneau 1995: 27). John Charles
Fields is the most renown of these individuals.
When John Charles Fields (1863-1932) graduated from the University of Toronto in 1884, no
Canadian University offered a PhD in mathematics. Many of Canada’s mathematics teachers
were British, at a time when British universities did not grant doctorates, either. Fields’ desire to
pursue a doctorate signaled his high opinion of research, as it was not required to obtain
employment (Barnes 2007: 8).
In his lifetime Fields recorded many firsts in Canadian mathematics (further biographical details
on Fields are given in section 6 of this chapter). During his tenure as mathematics professor at
the University of Toronto, Fields supervised Samuel Beatty, the first person to attain a doctorate
in mathematics from a Canadian university, in 1915. Fields was the first Canadian to publish a
research monograph in mathematics, the book, Theory of the Algebraic Functions of a Complex
Variable (1906). However, Fields’ book was not published in Canada, but overseas in Berlin by
Mayer & Müller and in Uppsala, Sweden by Almqvist & Wiksell (Riehm and Hoffman 2011:

174

63-4). While his monograph received lukewarm reviews abroad, the perception of Fields within
Canada was that “he was respected as a research mathematician and it was accepted that, though
his work could not possibly be understood by the public, it could be admired” (Riehm and
Hoffman 2011: 77).
Despite all that he had accomplished for mathematics in Canada during his lifetime, Fields still
admitted (in 1932) “…progress in mathematics in Canada up to the present has not been all that
might have been hoped for, things look more promising for the future. There is a small but
increasing group of the younger men who are interested in mathematical research, and some of
the latter appointments have been encouraging” (Archibald and Charbonneau 1995: 1).
We can find many accomplished scientific workers who were born, lived and worked in Canada,
of whom Fields was one, who turned to foreign publishers and publications to handle their
monographs and journal articles. William Dawson self-published works on geology and
203

paleontology in Nova Scotia as well as abroad in Edinburgh and London.

Dalhousie’s Munro

Chair of Physics James Gordon MacGregor turned to Macmillan and Company who published
his 1887 treatise on kinematics and dynamics in London and New York (section 5 of this
chapter).
It has been observed that many publications in science that did occur within the Canadian
context (i.e., printed in Canada) remained obscure and did not have a wide impact (MacDonald
and Connor 2007: 182). Moreover, the authors of those Canadian publications also remained
unknown, as Bertram MacDonald and Jennifer Connor have noted in their article about scientific
authorship in History of the Book in Canada. No known biographical information exists for more
than 51 per cent of the authors listed in a bibliography of Canadian scientific writings published
before 1914 (MacDonald and Connor 2007: 182). Despite the majority of scientific articles,
books or reports published in Canada on record being signed by the author (not published
anonymously), “Many authors were obscure…leaving little mark in Canadian history”
(MacDonald and Connor 2007: 181).

203

William Dawson’s Acadian Geology was published in 1855 in Edinburgh, London and Pictou, Nova Scotia, by
Oliver and Boyd and William Dawson (Sheets-Pyenson 1995: 33-35). In 1868, Acadian Geology was reprinted by
Macmillan and Co. of London, who also published a supplement to it in 1878 (Foster 1891: 170, 336).

Authors who sought recognition at home or abroad sought out American or European publishers.
Luckily for Fields, years of attending international conferences and study abroad meant that he
had an excellent network of friends in the international mathematical community. In 1902 Fields
returned from his post-doctoral work in Europe to take up a teaching job at the University of
Toronto. At this time Fields sent the manuscript for his book, Theory of the Algebraic Functions
of a Complex Variable, to Gösta Mittag-Leffler, editor of Acta Mathematica, asking for advice
regarding its publication. Mittag-Leffler recommended the Berlin publishing house of Mayer &
Müller, who had published some of Karl Weierstrass’s work. Mayer & Müller accepted Field’s
book and typeset it, but when the book encountered delays because the press was busy with other
work, Mittag-Leffler offered to facilitate its printing at the same press that printed for Acta
Mathematica, Almqvist & Wiksell Ltd., in Uppsala, Sweden. As Elaine McKinnon Riehm and
Frances Hoffman note in their biography of Fields, he visited both Berlin and Sweden in order to
oversee the book’s production, and “bulky manuscripts and proofs crossed the Atlantic; and
finally, in 1906, [the book] appeared” (Reihm and Hoffman 2011: 62).
Archibald and Charbonneau’s reasons for the slow development of mathematics in Canada echo
closely the reasons given by Dawson in his address to the Royal Society of Canada. The lack of
access to the most up-to-date sources and experts, as well as the difficulty to create a printed
record of accomplishment, are significant aspects of the history of mathematics and science in
Canada: “Reasons for the lack of research late in the nineteenth century are not hard to find.
While in fields such as physics and chemistry it was still possible at that time for a relatively
inexperienced student to undertake experimental work of a meaningful sort, participation in
mathematical research at an international level required an extensive exposure to the literature
and, ideally, to working research mathematicians. Such literature was difficult to come by in
Canada. Furthermore, there were few rewards for engaging in research beyond personal
satisfaction” (Archibald and Charbonneau 1995: 20).
The next three sections will continue to examine the themes outlined here by looking at the
examples of three scientific men, also published authors, in whose lives and experiences we can
see the Canadian context evolve over the three generations. John Herbert Sangster (1831-1904)
was born in England but educated in Canada. He worked for many years as a teacher in Canada’s
developing public education system before publishing a series of successful Canadian
schoolbooks on mathematical and physical topics. James Gordon McGregor (1852-1913) was

176

born in Nova Scotia and trained in natural philosophy and physics in Edinburgh, Leipzig and
London. He returned to take up a uniquely well-endowed chair of Physics at Dalhousie
University in Halifax, where he remained an engaged and active researcher. He published his
monograph with Macmillan and Company in London. John Charles Fields, whose monograph
was published abroad in 1906, worked towards furthering of the cause of science and
mathematics in Canada for the next twenty years. His involvement with the publication of the
Proceedings of the International Mathematical Congress, Toronto, August 11-16, 1924, at the
University of Toronto Press during the years 1924-28 is examined in section (6).

4. John Lovell, John Herbert Sangster and Lovell’s series of
schoolbooks
John Lovell (1810-1893) was born in Ireland and immigrated with his family to a farm outside
Montreal in 1820. Lovell moved to the city of Montreal in 1823 where he got his start in the
printing business. He apprenticed with printer Edward Vernon Sparhawk at the Canadian Times
and Weekly Literary and Political Recorder, and subsequently worked for several Montreal
newspapers including the Montreal Gazette and L’Armi du people, de l’ordre et des lois. He cofounded the tory newspaper the Montreal Daily Telegraph. After the 1837 Rebellion (The
Patriot’s War, to Quebecers), Lovell quit the newspaper publishing business and began to focus
on job printing, as well as publishing books, magazines, and directories (Parker 1990).
With his brother-in-law Lovell created the first successful literary magazine originating in British
North America. The Literary Garland published poems, stories, illustrations and musical
compositions by local writers and artists, including John Richardson and Susanna Moodie.
Lovell also collaborated on the first children’s magazine in Canada, Snow Drop, or Juvenile
Magazine, which ran for a brief period in the 1850s.
As a book publisher, Lovell had broad ranging tastes. He published poetry, law, history, music
books and sheet music, religious works, and Canadian fiction in English and French. In his
publications Lovell attempted to nurture a national literature, but cannily protected himself from
almost certain financial loss with a stable income from rewarding printing contracts. Lovell also
specialized in directories and gazetters which served a local market and for which there was no
foreign competition. Lovell eventually gained a lucrative contract to print for the Legislative
Assembly, which lead to his establishment of offices in Toronto and Quebec. In 1853 his

177

Toronto office employed 41 people in addition to apprentices. His Montreal site employed 30
people.
From the late 1850s Lovell began publishing school textbooks, and by the 1860s he began
marketing these under the moniker Lovell’s Series of School Books, the first set of Canadian
textbooks for Canadian schools.

204

John Herbert Sangster was the author of the arithmetic,

algebra, natural philosophy, and chemistry books in the series. Lovell’s schoolbooks were
successful and assured a large sale, as for several years Lovell was the only Canadian publisher
who had a native book approved by the catalogue of authorized textbooks. In order to be eligible
for government grants, schools had to adopt textbooks from this list.

205

John Herbert Sangster had an interesting personal involvement with the development of public
education in Canada before becoming a successful textbook author. Sangster was born in London
England. His family immigrated to York via the United States. He arrived in Upper Canada 1836
and his family settled on a large piece of land northeast of the city of York (now Toronto). A
studious youth with an appetite for mathematics, he attended Upper Canada College and in
November of 1847 entered the Toronto Normal School (i.e. training college) where he was the
second person to ever receive a certificate there as a Common School Teacher. Apparently
Sangster had come to the attention of the Chief Superintendent of Education, Egerton Ryerson,
through a paper Sangster had written on algebra, which had impressed Ryerson. Subsequently
Ryerson appointed Sangster as second master in the Provincial Model School in 1848 (Bailey
1981: 179).

204

In her history of authorized textbooks used in Ontario schools, Viola Parvin cites Strachan’s A Concise
Introduction to Practical Arithmetic (1809) as the first textbook written especially for students of Upper Canada
(Parvin 1965: 6). In the period prior to 1846 schools used a great variety of mathematical textbooks many of which
originated in Britain and America. The first textbook series sanctioned for use in Upper Canadian schools were the
Irish National School Books, selected by the newly instituted Board of Education in 1846. The Irish series included
several books in mathematics, including Arithmetic, Key to Arithmetic, Arithmetic in Theory and Practice,
Elements of Geometry, Mensuration, and Appendix to Mensuration. For the next twenty years, until Lovell began
his schoolbook series, the Irish National books remained the only authorized textbooks in the province (Parvin 1965:
26).
205

By 1867 Sangster’s Natural Philosophy, and National Arithmetic in Theory and Practice (Adapted to the
decimal Currency) were on the approved list.

178

Sangster began his career in education under tumultuous circumstances in which major changes
were being made to educational infrastructures in Canada West (previously, Upper Canada). In
1840 the Act of Union brought together the governance of Upper and Lower Canada, which
stimulated many bureaucratic overhauls, including the installation of Egerton Ryerson as the
Chief Superintendent of Education for the Province of Canada in 1844, and the creation of a
Board of Education to oversee the development of education in the Province. In 1847 an Act was
passed granting cities and towns larger powers in the governance of Common Schools, and
municipal governments responded by setting up Boards of Trustees (Smith 1905: 21). These new
governance structures brought about major changes to the educational landscape. Centralized
“model schools” were set up, run by teachers who had received formal teacher training, with
children organized into separate classes, whose work then received grading. Hamilton’s Central
School, for example, was a two-story building with twelve rooms with the potential to
accommodate 1,000 students. It was the first school of its kind in British North America (Bailey
1981: 179; Smith 1905: 68).
Changes were not received without controversy, however, as the local schools and teachers that
had been operating prior to these reforms were largely displaced by the new system. Sangster
became the first Principal of Hamilton Central School in 1853 (Smith 1910: 90). At the time,
taking on the Principalship of the school was considered a risky proposition given the hostility to
the venture expressed by the local community. However Sangster persevered and served as
Principal from 1853-1858, forging a new school and applying a new educational structure that
came to be regarded, eventually, as a success (Bailey 1981: 179). Sangster was only twenty-one
when he accepted the job. He later reflected, “I staked all on the venture. I came to introduce a
new system of education. Failure meant to me much more than personal disaster”.206
At Central, Sangster taught the senior boys division arithmetic, algebra and Euclid, natural
philosophy and astronomy. He would have worked extensively with the Irish National
schoolbooks series, as these were the approved books used in the school (Smith 1905: 29).

179

In 1858 Sangster accepted the position of assistant teacher at the Model Grammar School of
Toronto. This was the provincial model for secondary schools. Sangster served as headmaster
from 1865-1871. It was during these Toronto years that Sangster developed and published his
textbooks for Lovell’s schoolbook series on mathematics, physics and chemistry (Bailey 1981:
179). The library at the Toronto Grammar School contained two thousand volumes to which
scholars had free access, something Sangster may have profited from when he prepared his
textbooks for publication.207
Two copies of the first edition of Sangster’s National Arithmetic are held in the Ontario
Historical Textbook Collection. The first edition was printed in 1860 by Lovell in Montreal and
sold simultaneously by the bookseller R. & A. Miller in Montreal and in Toronto. In the preface
to the work, Lovell explains how his textbook fills a need within Canadian education: “it has
been the constant aim of the author to present to Canadian teachers and students as a [sic]
thoroughly reliable Treatise on the Theory and Practice of Numbers, and as an Arithmetic, in
some degree, commensurate with the higher qualifications of teachers and the improved methods
of instruction now generally found in our schools” (Sangster 1860a: 3). Sangster locates his book
as designed to serve the new school system, one in which teacher qualifications were mandatory
and multi-room graded schools replaced the one-room schoolhouse.
By the time of the National Arithmetic’s publication in 1860, Sangster and Egerton Ryerson
were good friends. According to Sangster, Ryerson himself requested Sangster write a
mathematical book designed for the new school system (Sangster 1860a: 3). Sangster’s book was
one of the first Canadian textbooks on the approved list, along with a few other Canadian books
written by either friends of Ryerson or members of the Council of Public Instruction. Having
one’s textbook placed on the approved list was essentially a form of patronage, as such books
were guaranteed a large sale. The fact that all the Canadian books on the list were written by
people closely connected to Ryerson and the decision-makers who made the list, did not escape
scrutiny or public notice, and in fact drew much public criticism (Parvin 1965: 39).

180

Sangster’s aim with the National Arithmetic, he explains, was merely to adapt the Irish National
treatise on arithmetic to the decimal currency and abbreviate some of the more tedious rules.
While admitting to borrowing liberally from “whatever [textbooks] he considered good”, he also
claimed authorship: “so many alterations and improvements suggested themselves…the Treatise,
as at present issued, is, in all essential respects, an entirely new book” (Sangster 1860a: 3).
From the three earliest copies of Sangster’s National Arithmetic present in the Ontario Historical
Textbook Collection, it appears that the book may have received several reprintings in the first
year alone. One of these books contains a four page advertisement from Lovell dated December
1859, which advertises forthcoming schoolbook titles in geography, history and grammar as well
as First Book of Arithmetic, also to be authored by Sangster, listed as “in preparation”. In the
advertisement, several of the schoolbook titles are advertised as “in preparation” in the year
1859. This suggests Lovell was a publisher more than happy to capitalize on what he perceived
to be a successful and profitable bandwagon: the production of textbooks for the approved list.
The final page of the advertisement announces R. & A. Miller as exclusive agents of Lovell’s
National School Books series, branding themselves as the “National School Book Depot”, and as
located on St. François Xavier Street in Montreal and on Yonge Street in Toronto.
The second edition of the National Arithmetic appeared in 1860. A few changes were made to
the second edition. While a small list of errata was included in the first edition, these errors had
been corrected in the second. A small publisher’s note says, “the rapid sale of the book having
necessitated another edition, these errors have been corrected; and the Publisher has the
satisfaction, in issuing this edition, of stating that it has undergone the most rigid and careful
revision at the hands of the Author. The next edition will be printed from Stereotype Plates”
(Sangster 1860b: 8). On the title page, the book now added the moniker “Sanctioned by the
Council of Public Instruction for Upper Canada” as well as the note “Second edition: Carefully
revised and corrected”.
In the preface to the second edition, Sangster thanks his fellow teachers in Canada for the kind
and welcome reception they have given the book. The second edition also contains three pages of
publisher’s advertising bound into the end of the book. The first page provides testimonials from
several Canadian newspapers as to the quality of Sangster’s book. Also interesting to note in the
following pages are the speed at which Lovell was adding to their schoolbook series. The

181

advertisement, dated April 1860, noted ten new titles in their schoolbook series listed as “just
published”, three in preparation, and two in the press.208 Sangster must have been busy in 1860
as his Elementary Arithmetic and Notes and Exercises in Natural Philosophy were listed as “just
published” in April of that year, with his Key to the National Arithmetic listed as “in press” at the
time and his Elementary Treatise on Algebra described as “in preparation”.
By the time the third edition of Sangster’s National Arithmetic was released in 1862, Lovell had
established itself as a major publisher of textbooks, with Sangster as their major author in
mathematics and science. In 1862 they had fourteen schoolbook titles available, with six more in
progress. English textbooks printed from stereotype plates were also printed in Canada and
offered for sale by Lovell.209 An 1866 edition of the National Arithmetic wrapped in a Lovell
advertisement dated 1870 shows that Lovell had twenty-nine textbooks in their school books list
by that time, with ten of these, on subjects such as arithmetic, algebra, natural philosophy and
inorganic chemistry, written by Sangster. In the same 1870 advertisement is the first appearance
of a motto Lovell’s had created for themselves. The motto promotes a buy local buy Canadian
sentiment. The wrapper on the book has a border, and within the border is printed the phrase
“Encourage home talent. Encourage home industry. Encourage home production. Encourage
Lovell’s series of school books” (Sangster 1866). Its placement within the boarder literally
surrounds the title of the book with this sentiment.
Canadian confederation in 1867 joined the Province of Canada with New Brunswick and Nova
Scotia, creating a federal Dominion of Canada with four provinces: Ontario (formerly Canada
West), Quebec (formerly Canada East), New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. Within this context,
Lovell’s schoolbook series of the 1860s, and its attendant motto, aligned with the country’s
emerging national identity. John Herbert Sangster, who had cut his teeth in the school system as
Principal at Hamilton’s Central school, was well placed to write books for the series. Sangster

was an experienced teacher, and he held a position at one of the most important schools in the
most populous area of the country.
Connections to the social and political realities of the nation are not hard to find in Sangster’s
textbooks. The title pages make mention of nationality: National Arithmetic, in Theory and
Practice; designed for the use of Canadian Schools (3rd edn. 1862); Elements of Algebra;
Designed for the use of Canadian Grammar and Common Schools (1864). Sangster was also
identified on the title page as affiliated with the Normal School for Upper Canada.
John Lovell, who since the beginning of his career had shown support for local writers, was
conscious of how a series of Canadian schoolbooks could be valued for nationalistic reasons. In
his promotional materials for Lovell’s Series of School Books, Lovell wrote: “The undersigned
[has] long felt that it would be highly desirable to have a Series of Educational Works prepared
210

and written in Canada and adapted for the purpose of Canadian Education”.

One of the

testimonials offered to recommend Sangster’s National Arithmetic explains the rationale behind
developing this textbook, specifically:
We hail with much satisfaction the appearance of this work, rendered absolutely
necessary by the recent introduction of the Decimal Currency into Canada. For a long
time the want of a Canadian Treatise on Arithmetic, combining the above mentioned
system, with the application of the Modern Scientific methods of analysis and formulae,
to the elucidation of the various rules, was felt. Dr. Ryerson, conscious that such a work
was needed, requested the Author to adapt the Arithmetic published by the Irish Board of
Education, to the Decimal Currency of Canada, and to abbreviate some of the tedious
reasons for the rules there given. Mr. Sangster in complying with the request of the Chief
Superintendent of Education, transcribed ten or fifteen pages from the commencement of
the original work, but finding so many “alterations and improvements” necessary,
“abandoned” the design and determined to write a new Treatise on the subject. The
admirable volume which now lies before us is the result of that determination.211

This endorsement is included in a back page of Sangster’s National Arithmetic (Sangster 1862), under the
heading “Opinions of the Press on the National Arithmetic”, and was reprinted from the Brant Country Herald,
Canada West.

183

In his prefaces to both the National Arithmetic and his Elements of Algebra, Sangster described
his works as containing many original and first-published problems. However, it is clear these
textbooks (as most algebra and arithmetic textbooks), were compilations of previously published
materials on the subject. In his preface to the arithmetic, Sangster wrote “as it was the sole object
of the Author to prepare a complete text-book on the subject of Arithmetic, he has not hesitated
to adopt whatever he considered good, either in the Irish National or in the numerous other
excellent works on the subject” (Sangster 1962: 3). In his preface to the Algebra, Sangster wrote
that in selecting problems that had been previously published, “the author has, he believed, in
every case rigidly adhered to the rule, adopted by Todhunter, Colenso, and others, of not
inserting a problem unless it had already appeared in at least two British authors – in which case
it is to be regarded as common property” (Sangster 1964: v).
Sangster ran as a candidate for the Council of Public Instruction in 1874. During his campaign,
the Toronto Printers Hunter Rose & Co. published a pamphlet for the Public School Teachers
strongly favouring the election of candidate Goldwin Smith over Sangster (Hunter Rose 1874). It
seems that Sangster had not endeared himself to the Public School Teachers Association of
Ontario. The booklet charges Sangster with obtaining an improper divorce, with a career in
education directed solely towards obtaining personal profit, and with improper conduct towards
female students at the Toronto Normal School. A short except offers a taste of the venomous
tone of the pamphlet: “From what we have observed of Dr. Sangster’s career, his principle seems
to have been to engage in no undertaking that was not of pecuniary benefit to himself. All his
efforts in connection with education have been made with a view to making money; and are we
to suppose, therefore, that he had been spending the past year perambulating the country, giving
lectures on education, &c, from pure devotion to the profession? …the teachers of Ontario, who
know him, are not so gullible as to believe it” (Hunter Rose 1874: 6). Although Sangster
redressed the accusations in his own public statement, he lost the election to Goldwin Smith.

Indications are that Lovell’s series of schoolbooks did make Sangster rich. Following his defeat
in the election Sangster left teaching to take up medicine, eventually setting up practice in Port
Perry (Parvin 1965: 38). His “Beechenhurst” residence, a fairly lavish looking estate Sangster
built in Uxbridge County, is featured in an Ontario illustrated atlas from 1877 (Beers 1877: 29).

James G. MacGregor’s An Elementary Treatise on
Kinematics and Dynamics (1887)

James Gordon MacGregor was born in Halifax and graduated from Dalhousie University in
1874. He went on to do further graduate work in Europe, studying natural philosophy in
Edinburgh and Leipzig. He became a Doctor of Science from University of London in 1876. He
returned to Halifax in 1876 to take a position at Dalhousie, but taught physics at a public school
for a time while Dalhousie lacked the funds to pay for his salary. In 1879 Nova Scotian
industrialist George Munro liberally endowed a chair of physics at Dalhousie, and MacGregor
was hired to fill the seat. His new position was fortunate. The George Munro Chair of Physics
paid $2,000 yearly, a royal amount when the premier of Nova Scotia was only paid slightly more

185

at $2,400 per year (Waite 1994: 125).

212

As Munro Chair, MacGregor continued his research and

was active in the community. He gave public demonstrations of physics experiments as
amusements at public university events (Waite 1994:182).
MacGregor had an intense temperament and was driven in his work. His laboratory at Dalhousie
was simple and he built much of his own equipment. When winter temperatures in Halifax
demanded it, he would go about his laboratory business in his overcoat (Waite 1994: 190). His
biographer P. B. Waite describes him as a “radical in spirit, disliking rules and regulations almost
on principle”, but also as a person with boundless passion for both research and the education of
his students (Waite 1994: 190). He was concerned with the maintenance of scientific research
funding and suitable laboratories in his home province of Nova Scotia. He supported the efforts
towards consolidating the various colleges in Halifax partly because he thought one large
university could provide a higher caliber science education (Waite 1994:146).
Waite described MacGregor as a born researcher. He published some 50 papers, mostly in
dynamics and kinematics. Some of these papers appear in the Transactions and Proceedings of
the Royal Society of Canada, in which, in the first few volumes, he was a frequent contributor.
MacGregor spent his summers at the University of Edinburgh laboratory of Peter Guthrie Tait.
Tait was a prominent Scottish physicist, and co-author of the famed Treatise on Natural
Philosophy by Tait and William Thomson, which redefined the subject after its publication in
1867. In the preface to An Elementary Treatise on Kinematics and Dynamics, MacGregor
mentions several works by Tait as influential on the composition of his own treatise (MacGregor
1887: vii). In 1901 MacGregor succeeded Tait in the Chair of Natural Philosophy at the
University of Edinburgh (Waite 1998).
An Elementary Treatise on Kinematics and Dynamics (1887) is MacGregor’s only published
book. The book was prepared and published in London by Macmillan and Co. during his time as
Munro Chair at Dalhousie University in Halifax. On the frontispiece, MacGregor is described as:

212

A native of Pictou Nova Scotia, George Munro immigrated to New York where he made his fortune publishing
successful reprints of popular British books such as Dickens, Thackeray and Bronte, songbooks, handbooks, and the
first dime novels. As no international copyright agreements existed at the time, American printers did not pay British
authors or publishers for printing and selling these books (Waite 1994: 124).

186

James Gordon MacGregor, M.A., D. Sc., Fellow of the Royal Societies of Edinburgh and of
Canada, Munro Professor of Physics, Dalhousie College, Halifax N.S (MacGregor 1887). It was
an impressive list of titles. The book was sold for 10s. 6d (See Foster 1891: 518).
Interestingly, it appears that MacGregor had no special connections to Macmillan, and that his
book rose to publication from the pile of unsolicited manuscripts they received. This was
something of an accomplishment particularly as MacGregor did not live in the United Kingdom.
Sometime in the summer of 1886 MacGregor’s initial proposal came to the attention of Donald
MacAlister, reviewer of scientific and mathematical manuscripts for Macmillan and Company.
His impression of the book, as MacGregor had seemingly proposed it, was favourable, and
MacAlister suggested that Macmillan follow up with MacGregor for more information. Quoting
his reader’s report:
I wonder whether Prof. MacGregor knows Lodge’s elementary Mechanics (Chambers). His
description of the proposed book seems to me to apply very well to Lodge, whose work has been a
great success and practically occupies the ground as an elementary work. If Prof. M’s book is less
elementary or in other words more Mathematical, there is a good deal in what he says as in the need
for it, and I should certainly like to see the MS [manuscript]. Perhaps the best thing would be to ask
him how his work compares with Lodge’s, sending him a copy in case it has not reached Nova Scotia.
His answer would be a very useful piece of information.213

MacGregor evidently was contacted, and ended up sending something that was more descriptive
of the contents of the book. To this, MacAlister wrote:
I saw from Prof. MacGregor’s syllabus that his work was much more advanced than Lodge’s. It is
however on the same lines, and if when the MS comes it proves at all up to my expectations it will be
well worth securing. As to pictures it would be an advantage to have them done as carefully and on
something of the same plan, as those in Greave’s Statics, to which if acceptable the book would form
as I take it a companion volume.214

After MacGregor sent a full draft of the manuscript, entitled Kinematics and Dynamics, it was
accepted for publication in September of 1886. After finally having read the entire manuscript,

187

Macmillan’s reviewer of science and mathematics, Donald MacAlister, wrote an unusually
positive and effusive evaluation:
I find this to be a really excellent work, up to the most modern standard, and clearly conceived and
expressed. There should be no hesitation in accepting it. I would suggest that it be brought out in the
style of Greave’s Statics, to which it is an admirable companion: that the same style of printing
(large & small type, paragraphs emphatic words etc.) be adopted, and that Prof. MacGregor be
requested to furnish as good drawings for the engraver as he can manage, using thick, thin and
dotted lines freely, making the lines to scale where necessary, and generally making the diagrams
artistic rather than merely geometrical. A collection of miscellaneous examples at the end would
perhaps make it go better at the Universities, but this may want a second edition which ought soon to
be called for.

The book came out on September 27 1887, in a run of 2000 copies, from type (not electrotype)
and printed by Robert MacLehouse at Glasgow University Press. MacAlister was right that a
second edition would be called for. Five years later a second edition was released on June 3,
1902, in a run of 1000 copies. The text was electrotyped “with many alterations” in December of
1904. And in June of 1909, 500 more copies were printed from those plates (with “many
215

alterations” further noted). The plates were destroyed in April of 1924.

While publishing such a book surely did not make MacGregor rich, selling something close to
3500 copies of this book was something that no Canadian publisher at the time could have
imagined, especially for a book aimed at students training in university level physics. His
authorship of this book, and its publication with a large and notable London publisher, may have
helped Macgregor with his appointment to Edinburgh University in 1901.
MacGregor was not the only early Canadian to have a mathematical book published out of the
country with Macmillan and Company. Nathan Fellowes Dupuis (1836-1917) who originated
from the area around Kingston, was educated at the University of Queen’s College, receiving his
BA in 1866 (one of a graduating class of eight), and his MA in 1868. In 1868 he began teaching
chemistry and natural history at Queens, later switching to teach mathematics in 1880 (Archibald
and Charbonneau 1995: 19). He published Junior Algebra in 1882 (John Henderson & Co),

which was identified on the title page as his Queen’s College mathematical course. He then
transformed this book into The Principles of Elementary Algebra which he published with
Macmillan and Company’s New York branch in 1892, and which, in the back pages advertising
the book, received several testimonials by American college mathematics teachers. Dupuis also
published Elements of Synthetic Solid Geometry with Macmillan in New York in 1893, and
Elementary Synthetic Geometry of the Point, Line, and Circle in the Plane with Macmillan in
London in 1889 (Foster 1891: 551).

6. John Charles Fields and the University of Toronto Press
Out of the context of Canadian science and science publishing described so far, I would like to
suggest that a fairly major event paving the way for better opportunities to publish technical
science and mathematics in Canada was the printing of the Proceedings of the International
Mathematical Congress, Toronto, August 11-16, 1924, at the University of Toronto Press, in
1928. J. C. Fields initiated Canada’s role in the hosting the 1924 International Mathematical
Congress, and he was responsible for the production of the Proceedings that would follow. He
raised the money to pay for its publication and acted as the general editor.
Born in 1863 to a leather tanner and schoolteacher, Fields was raised in the industrial city of
Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. As a mid-sized city, Hamilton provided Fields with a bustling
environment that, despite its cultural immaturity, had ambitions to become a city of some
distinction. Notably for Fields, Hamilton built two model public schools in the mid-century that
Fields benefited from attending: Hamilton Central School and Hamilton Collegiate Institute.
Fields attended the Central School from 1869 to 1876, when he was age six to thirteen. In 1876
he entered Hamilton Collegiate Institute. At that time, George Dickson, a University of Toronto
graduate, was principal, and W. H. Ballard taught mathematics. The school’s science teacher was
J. W. Spencer, who had received his PhD in geology from Göttingen, Germany. Both Spencer
and Dickson (a chemist, who also instructed Fields) were active in their respective fields. Under
Ballard and Dickson’s tutelage, two students from Hamilton Collegiate Institute went on to

189

receive PhDs in mathematics, J. C. Fields and Milton Haight.216 More generally, students from
Hamilton Collegiate Institute had remarkable success in the matriculation examinations for the
University of Toronto (Riehm and Hoffman 2011: 13). Fortunately for John Charles Fields, the
circumstances of primary and secondary education during his youth provided him with an
aspirational environment.
Fields was successful in mathematics from his early days. He won a mathematics gold medal in
the University of Toronto’s entrance exams of 1880, and continued to win mathematical prizes in
subsequent years of his undergraduate study. James Loudon was the only professor in the
Department of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy when Fields was a student at the University
of Toronto. Not known for producing new results in mathematics, Loudon was nevertheless
known as the author of mathematical textbooks used in Canadian schools, and as an advocate of
Canadian science. Loudon was a mentor to Fields. After Fields returned from Europe, Loudon
hired him at the University of Toronto. They were both were dedicated to the cause of advancing
science and mathematics in Canada, and worked towards this goal through involvement with the
Royal Canadian Institute.
Given the lack of options for continuing mathematical study in his home country, in 1884 Fields
headed for Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. James Joseph Sylvester was no longer
present while Fields was a student there, but the dynamism Sylvester had created remained and
influenced Fields’ doctoral experience. His primary mentor was Thomas Craig, with whom he
studied theory of functions and differential equations. After a brief stint of teaching in America,
Fields went to Paris and Berlin for an extended period of further study. He returned to North
America in 1900, when Loudon (at that time, President of the University of Toronto) hired him
as a mathematics lecturer. Fields continued to work in the mathematics department at the
University of Toronto for the rest of his life, becoming Research Professor in 1923.
After publishing his lone monograph in mathematics, Theory of the Algebraic Functions of a
Complex Variable in 1906, Fields’ productivity as a researcher slowed, and he began devoting

216

Like Fields, Milton Haight went on to study mathematics at University of Toronto and then to Johns Hopkins for
his PhD. After that, Haight set up the mathematics and physics program at the Imperial Agricultural College at
Sapporo, in Hokkaido, Japan, before returning to Canada, where he spent the rest of his career teaching high school
(Riehm and Hoffman 2011: 13).

190

more time and energy to the cause of developing science and mathematics in Canada. He was
active in the affairs of the Royal Canadian Institute from 1904 until his death, serving as both
Vice-President and President. While the Institute was a forum to promote science publicly, and
hosted events at which scientists would present results, Fields also tried to make the Institute a
vehicle for serious scientific research. While several efforts were made, including an initiative to
found a Bureau of Scientific and Industrial Research, not enough money was secured, either
through philanthropy or government sources, to get an institution supporting pure research off
the ground.
Fields had always been a passionate traveller and an attendee of many international mathematical
and scientific meetings. He attended the British Association for the Advancement of Science
meetings in Glasgow (1901), Dundee, Scotland (1910) and Australia (1914). In 1902 Fields
travelled to France, Norway and Sweden, attending the Abel Centenary (celebrating the life of
Norwegian mathematician, Niels Henrik Abel). In 1905 he visited Berlin and Sweden while
overseeing publication of his book. Other trips included Dublin (1908), Winnipeg (1909), Berlin
and Sweden again (1911), and Cambridge for the Fifth International Congress of Mathematicians
(1912) (Riehm and Hoffman 2011: 50).
As a frequent attendee of international meetings, Fields had his first experience organizing one
when he chaired the local committee in charge of the Toronto meeting of the American
Association for the Advancement of Science in 1921. It was at this meeting that Fields first
caught wind of dissention among members of the American Mathematical Society over the
invitation that had been made to host the 1924 International Mathematical Congress in the
United States.
Beginning in 1919 and lasting for a minimum of twelve years, the constitution of the
International Research Council (and therefore, of the International Mathematical Union) required
that scientists from countries belonging to the former Central Powers be barred from
participating in all activities, of which the International Mathematical Congress was one (Riehm
and Hoffman 2011: 120). This requirement seemed plainly absurd to many members of the

191

American mathematical community, as it necessitated the exclusion of prominent German
mathematicians from the 1924 Congress.

217

The 1924 meeting was a political hot potato. Seeing that the American organizers were in trouble
over the meeting, Fields saw an opportunity that could further the cause of Canadian
mathematics. He volunteered himself, and Toronto, as alternative hosts for the Congress. By the
autumn of 1922, the Americans decided that the best course of action was to pass the Congress
over to the Canadians. Fields’ decision to organize the 1924 International Mathematical
Congress in Toronto meant his acceptance of the required exclusions. It is somewhat surprising
Fields so readily volunteered to organize a meeting that to many eyes was illegitimate and not
truly international. Fields esteem for German intellectualism, and his firm belief in
internationalism, would have conflicted with the requirements of exclusion. However, hosting
the conference, even in its compromised state, did serve his goal of furthering the cause of
Canadian science.
In order to secure financial support for the meeting, Fields wrote frequent letters to Canada’s
highest political offices. In order to convince politicians and other potential supporters to finance
the event, Fields emphasized hosting the meeting and publishing the proceedings as an
opportunity to develop a level of mathematical professionalism in Canada that had not
previously existed. In his campaign to secure funding, Fields corresponded with then Prime
Minister of Canada William Lyon Mackenzie King. In June of 1925, Fields wrote to King,
extolling the benefits that publication of the proceedings would bring. In the best possible light,
Fields communicated that working on the proceedings is
A great opportunity for the University of Toronto to place itself on the international map and
therewith help the reputation of the University and that of Canada in the scientific world.
There are, I may say, only three or four other presses on the continent which would be
qualified to undertake the work. I have hopes also of obtaining for our University Press the

217

The decision to exclude German mathematicians from the International Mathematical Union was not accepted
by everyone. Prominent British mathematician G. H. Hardy made his opinion known that he would not stand by as a
“re-organization on a political instead of a genuinely mathematical basis” took place (quoted in Riehm and Hoffman
2011: 122). An appeal from the neutral nations (what became known as the “Groningen Action”) urged scientists to
reconsider a ban on German science. For more about the politicization of the International Mathematical Union see
(Riehm and Hoffman 2011: 115-25) and (Lehto 1998).

most important mathematical printing in America, which is that of the American
Mathematical Society. This would be facilitated if the Press successfully handled the
Proceedings of the Congress and this I am sure it can do.218

By October 4, 1926 Fields was writing to the Finance Minister of Canada, J. A. Robb:
We are not yet done, nor shall we be done for some time to come, with the scientific
meetings held in Toronto in August 1924. The Press of the University of Toronto has been
busied with the printing of the Proceedings…for over a year now and still has hundreds of
pages to print. The printing is of the most difficult technical character and it means much to
the prestige of Canada in scientific circles that we have a press that can undertake the task.
The Proceedings will be much more than a record of the work in the Congress. They will
be found in the principal libraries (university, public, industrial) of the world and will
constitute a source of reference for research workers not alone in mathematics but in the
many other branches of science on the applied side which were represented in the
programme of the Congress.219

At the time when the University of Toronto Press handled the composition and production of this
two-volume, nearly two thousand page work, it had been scarcely a decade since the Printing
Committee at the University of Toronto had even authorized the establishment of a publishing
arm of the university press.

220

Fortunately for Fields, the University of Toronto Press was in a

uniquely beneficial position as an academic publisher. The entire business operation of the Press
consisted of a printing plant, a university bookstore, and a distribution service, and the profits
from these aspects of the business were turned around and invested in its publishing branch. This
would benefit Fields when the project of printing the Proceedings ran over budget. In 1925

193

Fields personally guaranteed the cost of the work in excess of what funds were being held by the
221

University Bursar for the project.

On 1 February 1928, four years after the International Mathematical Congress had taken place in
Toronto, volume one of the Proceedings was complete, at 935 pages in length. On November 27
of 1928, volume two was ready, completing the entire work. Small gratuities were given to R.
South and W. Cranston, the typesetters who worked on the book at the University of Toronto
Press. The Toronto engraver Owen Staples was paid $50 for four etchings used as illustrations.
Both volumes were bound in dark blue cloth with Canada’s coat of arms embossed in gold on the
front cover (see plate 2).

In design and organization, Fields took guidance from the proceedings of previous International
Mathematical Congresses. There had been six Congresses prior to the 1924 Toronto meeting:
Strasbourg in 1920, Cambridge in 1912, Rome in 1908, Heidelberg in 1904, Paris in 1900, and
Zurich in 1897. The proceedings from each of these meetings followed a similar form. However,
in choice of font and typographical style, the University of Toronto Press and Fields followed
closely the proceedings from the 1912 meeting printed at Cambridge University Press (Hobson
222

and Love 1913).

Some differences are notable. Not every editor offered a foreward to the proceedings, but Fields
did. The tone of the preface communicated the burden Fields endured in his preparation of this
work. It had been the only Congress proceedings that had taken four years to produce. The others
before it had been published within a year, with the exception of the proceedings of the Paris
1900 meeting, which were published in 1902. Perhaps because of the controversy under which
the 1924 meeting occurred, the Toronto volume offers a prefatory note stating that regulations of
the International Research Council and International Mathematical Union were adhered to by the
host institution. In its oblique reference to the constitution of these governing bodies, Fields
distanced himself from what was a morally complicated Congress, deflecting responsibility for
the exclusions away from himself and host institution University of Toronto.
The two volumes of the Toronto proceedings are impressive tomes. The first volume contains
lists of all the participants of the Toronto International Mathematical Congress, as well as
opening remarks and speeches given, the program of activities, and a group photo of the
attendees in front of University of Toronto’s Convocation Hall. Also included is an
acknowledgement of funding sources (a feature unique to the Toronto Proceedings). Among the
other notable extra-mathematical material included is a most interesting map, showing the
“transcontinental excursion” on which Fields and willing participants travelled by train from
Toronto, Ontario to Victoria, British Columbia and back, after the Congress (see figure 14).

222

Compare (Hobson and Love 1913: vol 1., 67) and (Fields 1928: vol. 1, 85). Their title pages and choice of font
are also quite similar, as is the layout of articles.

195

Scientists who had attended the British Association for the Advancement of Science meeting that
had preceded the Congress attended the transcontinental excursion along with mathematicians.
The train trip stopped at the new universities to the west, University of Manitoba, Saskatchewan,
Alberta and British Columbia, where delegates were welcomed with displays of scientific
equipment, lectures, receptions and banquets (Riehm and Hoffman 2011: 154). While the
Proceedings includes no account of the excursion besides this map, the depiction of the amount
of land which was then and is still the origin of much of Canada’s wealth and identity, offers a
powerful symbol to the reader of what Canada offered the world.

Victoria, August 17 to September 3, 1924; places where stops were made are indicated

196

In November 1928 the University’s Printing Committee, who oversaw the university press,
extended formal congratulations to Dr. Fields “on his splendid work in editing this large and
difficult work”. The feeling was mutual. Fields later wrote about his experience with the press, “I
can never be sufficiently grateful to my two printers for their unstinted devotion and for the
persistence of their efforts, always in the sequel crowned with success, to produce the
typographical results which I desired. The spirit shown by them is reminiscent of the guilds”.

223

Fields also thanked R. J. Hamilton, then manager of the University of Toronto Press, in his brief
prefatory note to the work.
For the collected papers that make up the bulk of the work, Fields remarked that despite his best
efforts, heterogeneity was the norm: “here and there a national trend is in evidence, while the
man in applied science does not always have the same idea as the pure mathematician with
regard to the use of mathematical symbols” (Fields 1928, Vol. 1: 7). Fields made the decision to
arrange papers into the subject areas into which he felt they most naturally belonged, rather than
alphabetically or in the session in which the author had presented. Volume one includes all the
papers communicated to Section I: Algebra, Theory of Numbers, Analysis (67 papers), and
Section II: Geometry (36 papers). Volume two contains all the communications to remaining
sections. This includes communications to Section III: Mechanics, Physics, Astronomy,
Geophysics (51 papers), Section IV: Electrical, Mechanical, Civil and Mining Engineering,
Aeronautics, Naval Architecture, Ballistics, Radiotelegraphy (47 papers), Section V: Statics,
Actuarial Science, Economics (24 papers), and Section VI: History, Philosophy, Didactics (16
papers).

198

Fields’ biographers repeatedly make the point that Fields’ health suffered due to his combined
efforts to host the Congress and undertake the completion of the proceedings. Fields’ prefatory
note to volume one is none too light-hearted, and reflects the reality of a job completed rather
than the enthusiasm of his earlier letters to politicians selling the event. In the preface he states
that his role as editor “was an unexpected and none too welcome task”, but one nevertheless
undertaken solely by Fields when the General Secretary of the Congress, J. L. Synge, left
Toronto (Fields 1928, Vol 1: 7).
Seeing the project through was not easy. By 1926 the funds that had been set aside for the
printing had already been exhausted, and the printing committee was requesting from Fields
“some assurance of what the final amount will be, and the proposed style of the publication, and
how payment is to be met”.

224

Records of the Printing Committee note that some delays with the

work may have been due to Fields’ ill health.

225

In the years 1924 to 1928, Fields served as

editor on the project (selecting, compiling, proofreading, correcting, corresponding with authors)
and raised enough money to pay for printing it.
The final cost of the Toronto proceedings was just over $15,000 (Riehm and Hoffman 2011:
160). This was a large amount when the average annual salary for a worker in Canada in the year
1928 ranged from $1,100 – $1,900 (Meltz 1999: Table E41-48). $15,000 was also a large sum
given that the initial budget for the entire Congress had been $55,000. The magnitude of the
undertaking had kept growing as papers continued to be received long after sessions were over.
Fields had to approach both the Provincial and Federal Governments, along with the Carnegie
226

Corporation, for more money.

In 1928 the University’s Printing Committee decided to assign

$2000 from that year’s publishing earnings towards the printing account of the International
Mathematical Congress, which must have come as a relief to Fields.

In Eleanor Harmon’s book celebrating the centenary of the University of Toronto Press, the
chapter “The Printing of Mathematics” describes the press’ specialization in this rare
typographical art. Written by Roy Gurney, this chapter acknowledges the Proceedings of the
1924 Congress as the beginning of mathematical printing at the Press. Gurney writes, “The first
major mathematical publication undertaken by the Press was the Proceedings of the Pacific
Congress of Mathematics [sic] in 1924-28. Even today, this 1941-page work, in two volumes,
would be a major publishing project, equivalent in length and complexity to about ten or twelve
issues of the Canadian Journal of Mathematics; for a plant the size of the Press at that period, it
228

was an impressive accomplishment” (Gurney 1961: 127).

It was certainly an achievement that the Proceedings were published in Canada. However, as the
most research-oriented mathematical publication to be issued in Canada to date, the Proceedings
may still have been out of the reach of aspiring local mathematicians or mathematics students
who could have potentially found interest or inspiration in this work. In a “Special Offer to
Ontario Teachers” flyer issued by the University of Toronto Press in the 1930s, the list price for
these two beautiful and learned volumes was $10, about four times the cost of every other book
in the flyer.

229

Although Fields had been full of promise when he had suggested to J. A. Robb

that the Proceedings would be acquired “in the principal libraries of the world”, one wonders
how many librarians or teachers ever purchased it.
Nevertheless, the publication of the Proceedings paved the way for the University of Toronto
Press to become Canada’s most capable mathematical printer in the twentieth century. Soon after
its printing was completed, the skills of the Press’ composition room were sought for the
typesetting of other mathematical works. In 1928 Macmillan Company of Canada approached
the press about composing a new edition of Hall and Knight’s Trigonometry, as they were

228

Gurney’s chapter gives the incorrect title for the Proceedings, perhaps confusing Field’s 1928 book with the
Fifth Pacific Science Congress, which took place in Victoria and Vancouver in June of 1933, and for which the
University of Toronto Press also printed the papers and proceedings. See University of Toronto Press Scrap-book,
A89-0009, Box 36, University of Toronto Archives.

“unable to have [the composition work] done elsewhere in Toronto”.

Prof. Beatty from the

Mathematics department contacted the press regarding printing a book about Determinants
written by Dean Metsler (a University of Toronto alumnus), which the press agreed to print at
cost.
When the Canadian Journal of Mathematics was launched in 1949, the University of Toronto
Press served as printer. In Gurney’s essay about mathematical composition at the press, he notes
that by 1950, their capacity for mathematical typesetting was “severely taxed”. This motivated
the press’ investment in equipment from Lanson Monotype Company for four-line formula
setting, which allowed for the setting of mathematics using a keyboard and a caster (Gurney
1961: 127). Professor G. de B. Robinson, managing editor of the Canadian Journal of
Mathematics at the time, apparently spent many hours helping the press perfect this system.
Several symbols had to be specially punched for use with the caster, and a new integral sign in
particular, which was drawn and cast from scratch, cost $98 (regular symbols cost 98 cents)
(Gurney 1961: 131).
Fields’ intent around his entire efforts with the Congress was to help build cultural value in, and
recognition for, mathematical research in Canada. Although the book itself, Proceedings of the
International Mathematical Congress, Toronto, August 11-16, 1924, may have been a white
elephant, it was, as other local publications in mathematics had also been, symbolic of national
achievement. However, in working with the University of Toronto Press on the Proceedings,
Fields built their capacity to print higher-level mathematics. This had a useful and lasting legacy
to the mathematical community in Canada, and in this, Fields may have seen some fulfillment of
his wish to ameliorate mathematical culture in Canada.

7. Conclusion
Through the episodes discussed here, I hope to have shown how the publication of mathematics
in Canada was pursued despite the many odds stacked against it. Mathematical culture in Canada
was made possible by repeated investments on the part of individuals dedicated to both the
growth of mathematics as a subject and Canada as a country. While these investments took many

201

forms, local book publishers and the printing trades assisted in the growth of a mathematical
culture in Canada by providing the publishing services necessary for both mathematical
education and in some cases, mathematical authors whose own work required publication. The
printing and publishing industry was essential to the pursuit of a mathematical culture that was
identifiably Canadian.
In the years 1820 to 1930 when Canada was developing as a nation, publication was often tied to
motives that were connected with developing national identity and culture. Early local textbook
production was cultivated in part by political motives to combat the use of American educational
materials. At the same time, popular British or American mathematical textbooks were appended
with testimonials, introductions and problems written by local educators in order to
“Canadianize” the material for use in Canadian schools. Lovell’s schoolbook series was
motivated by a desire to have, in John Lovell’s words, books “written in Canada and adapted for
the purpose of Canadian Education”. Fields undertook the organization of the International
Mathematical Congress and the publication of its proceedings in part because of what these
activities would mean for the building up of value for mathematical research in Canada.
Historically, Canadians suffered from a lack of options to fund the publication of scholarly work.
Printers and publishers in Canada were disadvantaged by serving a smaller population saturated
with printed matter from the United States and from Britain. In a competitive marketplace,
printers had less capital to invest in financially neutral or money-losing projects as mathematical
publishing projects were likely to be. The same equation of investment and return applied to
scholarly publishing in general. With the Canadian printing and publishing industry at a
disadvantage, less investment could be made in the creation of books that could develop
Canadian culture at large or scientific culture specifically. James Loudon, as President of the
Royal Canadian Institute, noted in 1877 that Canada, unlike the United States, had not become a
place where science was endowed by the large personal fortunes of private citizens. This was
still the case when J. C. Fields worked to found a Bureau of Scientific and Industrial Research in
the early twentieth century, or to fund the International Mathematical Congress. The publishing
industry could rarely support the printing of Canadian science, nor could individual patronage be
counted on as a reliable source of financial support for these projects.

202

English mathematicians enjoyed the advantages of a robust printing trade in their home country.
In England, large publishers like Macmillan acted as agents for their mathematical authors,
acquiring hard to get copies of mathematical journals and books. For example, Macmillan
acquired copies of the German mathematical journal Journal für die reine und angewandte
Mathematik (often referred to as Crelle’s Journal) and Annales de mathématiques pures at
231

appliquées (also known as Annales de Gergonne) for William Spottiswoode on his request.

Macmillan also acted as an agent for George Stokes, when he was looking to acquire Abel’s
Oeuvres complètes.

232

It seems unlikely that Canada’s nineteenth century publishers would have

been connected enough with the European sources of mathematical publications to act as
acquiring agents for special publications needed by aspiring Canadian mathematicians in this
way. Acquiring up-to-date mathematical literature was expensive and difficult, for English
mathematicians and more so for Canadians, who were further removed from the European
origins of this literature.
Material culture, or in the Canadian case a lack of it, was critical to the pursuit of truth, and to
the practice of pure research. Books and printing were important elements in the material culture
of knowledge creation, in the dissemination of that knowledge, and in the formation of a
scientific culture that could nurture the development of it. Scientific knowledge has always
required material culture for its creation, be that instruments that aid the perception of our raw
senses, or in this case, the specific fonts, woodcuts, illustrations, and printing technologies, that
allowed scientists to express themselves to one another through print. What we can conclude in
the Canadian case, is that maturation of a local printing and publishing industry, and J. C. Field’s
work with the University of Toronto Press in the 1920s to develop mathematical printing there,
were essential elements to the development of an indigenous mathematical culture in this
country.

231

Macmillan acquired copies of Annales de Gergonne at the request of William Spottiswoode. They also offered
to supply him with copies of Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik (also known as Crelle’s Journal),
although he declined the offer. See Daniel Macmillan to William Spottiswoode, 31 January 1855 and 6 February

Chapter 6
Conclusion

1. The communications circuit
The study of book history and print culture, and the approach to history offered by this
discipline, has inspired the present investigation into the development of mathematical
knowledge through its representation in printed texts. As mentioned in the introduction to this
thesis, Marshall McLuhan and Elizabeth Eisenstein pioneered the idea that communications
media, and the printed book in particular, might transform and affect knowledge that has been
recorded and transmitted within these objects. In subsequent writings Adrian Johns, Robert
Darnton, Donald MacKenzie and others have revised and challenged assumptions about the
intrinsic qualities of print, and how these qualities have shaped cultural values and knowledge
formation.
In his 1982 essay “What is the history of books?”, Darnton proposed a model to aid the analysis
of how books operate in culture. His communications circuit offered a vision for the textual life
cycle of book production, showing how a text moves from author to publisher, printer, shipper,
bookseller, and reader (Figure 17). The reader completes the circuit of the text, as readers
themselves become authors. A text’s interaction with its readers and the public informs the
behavior of future authors. As Darnton writes, the communications circuit “transmits messages,
transforming them en route, as they pass from thought to writing to printed characters and back
to thought again. Book history concerns each phase of this process and the process as a whole, in
all its variations over space and time and in all its relations with other systems, economic, social,
political, and cultural, in the surrounding environment” (Darnton 1982: 67).

This thesis has aspired to discover more about nineteenth century British mathematics by asking
and answering questions arising from the study of book history and print culture, and applying
these questions to the history of mathematical books and publishing. Looking at Darnton’s
communications circuit as a general approach, we can see that the questions asked and
investigated in this thesis relate mostly to the top, center and right-hand side of the diagram.
Chapter two examined mathematical printing using nineteenth century technologies and looked
at how publishers and authors overcame these difficulties in reproducing mathematical texts.
This chapter attended to questions arising from the application of technologies and techniques of
printing to mathematics. Chapter five highlights how the capability of local printers and the
circulation of printed matter in Canada affected knowledge production. Both these investigations
relate to the right-hand side of Darton’s circuit.
Denoted by a simple double-sided arrow at the top of Darton’s flow chart, the author-publisher
relationship is revealed in chapter three as encompassing a fairly complicated network of behindthe-scenes processes and negotiations. Chapter four examines how economics, the law and
publicity affected mathematical book publishing. An examination of books sales, author-

205

publisher contracts and advertising demonstrated how very pragmatic, business-oriented aspects
of the book trade influenced Macmillan and Co.’s publishing program of mathematical books.
These aspects of the current thesis relate to the center and top of Darton’s circuit.
As a whole, the present study has shown what impact printing technologies and the practices of
the publishing industry have had on the creation of mathematical books. It has examined what
influence printing and publication had on the resulting record of mathematics available in print.
A study of mathematical communication through the availability of printed materials in libraries,
through booksellers, agents, shippers and bookbinders, etc., would be a valid and intriguing
complementary study to the present one. Such a study would answer questions arising from the
bottom and left hand side of Darnton’s communications circuit.

Figure 20 The ‘reading’ man, from Richard Corbould Chilton’s Helluones Librorum
(Devourers of books), aquatint by Francis Jukes, engraving by J. K. Baldrey (Source:
Topham 2000: 318)

206

In nineteenth century Britain and Canada, books were central tools used by scholars and students
in knowledge production. Figure 18 shows Richard Chilton’s Helluones liborum, in which a
Cambridge ‘reading’ man is depicted. The student is depicted hunched over a desk, reading a
page in a mathematics book with the assistance of a magnifier and candlelight. Quill and inkpot
rest nearby, as well as paper on which the reader has made notes. Pinned to the back wall is a
poster entitled Halley’s Scheme for the Transit of Venus. Several other books, open and closed,
as well as discarded single sheets of paper are strewn around this spartan room. Everything about
the composition of this image, from the lighting to the centrality of the student in his reading
activity, suggests that it is less in the world and more inside the text of his books where this
student is residing.
Perhaps the reader depicted in Chilton’s Helluones liborum will become a writer himself one
day, completing Darnton’s cycle of how culture and knowledge is developed through print. What
this image does not depict is what the present study has aimed to reveal. The centrality of
publisher and printer, shipper, and bookseller to the printed book is absent from this image,
however their role in producing the tools of scholarship is central. Publishers and printers have
been as important as authors and readers in the transmission and shaping of knowledge. The
printing and publishing industry is the invisible presence in Helluones liborum, and critical to the
culture of books, authorship, and reading. The intense interaction between reader and book,
knowledge and learning, has been mediated through them.

2. Mathematics in popular culture
Peter and Ruth Wallis' Biobibliography of British Mathematics and Its Applications, Part II
complies multiple editions and reprints of more than 10,000 mathematics-related titles published
between 1700 and 1760. One of the most important results arising from the Wallis’ work has
been recognition that the vast majority of authors and titles in their bibliography are completely
233

unknown today, even to scholars of science and mathematics (Topham 2000a: 566).

The

Wallis’ work demonstrates how many mathematical documents we deem historically important
today were scarce in their own time, and that many publications that were voluminously

233

Wallis’ Biobibliography contains entries by 1,090 different authors.

207

produced, and perhaps influential within the culture of mathematics during their own time, have
long since been forgotten. The Wallis' bibliography treats the printed culture of mathematics
with an egalitarian spirit. All works they considered mathematical are catalogued, regardless of
whether we deem them retrospectively as important. Quite rightly, they observe “most histories
concentrate on the few works which contributed new knowledge and ignore the much larger
number of less innovative works” (Wallis 1974: 449). Taking stock of the large number of less
innovative works is, however, critical to the task of relating advances in knowledge to their
proper historical context (Wallis and Wallis 1986: v). In contrast to the mainstream history of
mathematics that has been available, the Wallis’ work documents and recognizes the widespread,
popular culture of mathematics during the eighteenth century.
The present study has revealed historical facts of similar value. In chapter three (and Appendix
A), it is shown how scores of unknown authors were actively submitting mathematical
manuscripts for possible publication with Macmillan. More mathematical manuscripts were
received and reviewed for Macmillan than manuscripts in any other area of science. A study of
Macmillan’s records from approximately 1870 to 1890 demonstrates a widespread, popular
engagement with mathematics by authors hoping to create new works. One wonders whether the
explosion of printed matter in the nineteenth century, particularly the initial distribution
revolution, may have facilitated a more widespread engagement with mathematical ideas, given
that mathematics was increasingly available in print to readers of different classes and
backgrounds.

234

Darnton’s communications circuit recognizes books as agents capable of intellectual influence.
An increase in the available printed matter relating to mathematics, concurrent with an overall
increase in printed matter generally, may have nurtured a growing popular interest in
mathematics in nineteenth century Britain. An increase in printed matter about mathematical
topics in mid-century might have intensified public curiosity about mathematics, creating

234

Recall Simon Eliot outlines two revolutions in nineteenth century printing and publishing in England. He terms
a spike in print production during the 1830-55 years, the “distribution revolution” (Eliot 1994: 107). This period was
followed in the late 1840s and 1850s by a major change in the price structure of the book market, with the
introduction of cheap books (which Eliot defines as having a price of 3s. 6d. or less). In the 1880s and 90s printed
production expanding drastically. Eliot has named this phase the “mass-production revolution” (Eliot 1994). See
chapter four, section (2), of the present work.

208

audiences for literary works that imaginatively engaged with mathematical ideas, such as Edwin
A. Abbott’s Flatland (1884) and Charles Howard Hinton’s Scientific Romances (1884-1886).
Linda Dalrimple Henderson has noted that an increase in popular and non-specialist writings
about non-Euclidean and multi-dimensional geometries from the 1860s onwards inspired new
trends in spirituality, occultism, theories of perception, fiction and visual art (Henderson
235

1983).

In the 1830s several mathematical books were published by the reform societies, the first
publishers of mass-produced books for the middle classes of England. Through the application of
steam printing to book production, Herschel's books on natural philosophy and astronomy, De
Morgan's book on probabilities, and Lardner's many contributions to the Cabinet Cyclopaedia
236

series were produced in large quantities.

The application of steam printing to these books

made them available at cheaper prices than mathematical books produced in earlier times. The
novel Crotchet Castle parodies popular engagement with such books in the 1830s. Recall the
fictional character of the cook, who falls asleep while reading hydrostatics “in a six-penny tract,
published by the Steam Intellect Society” (Peacock 1831: 19).
These early mass-produced books on mathematical subjects may have nurtured a generation of
mathematical readers, who later became Macmillan’s (now unknown) prospective authors on
mathematics. The technological capacity to mass-produce books on mathematical subjects may
have had an influence on nineteenth century commonplace engagement with mathematics. Could

235

Henderson notes that non-Euclidean geometry inspired artists to reconsider the importance of linear perspective,
to consider how objects appeared deformed within geometries of non-zero curvature, and that overall these new
ideas undermined belief in absolute truth (as the discovery of hyperbolic geometry had undermined the importance
of Euclidean geometry). She explores how non-Euclidean geometry and the fourth dimension influenced the
fictional writings of authors Oscar Wilde, George MacDonald, Lewis Carrol, Joseph Conrad, Ford Madox Ford,
Gaston de Pawlowski and H. G. Wells. She describes how the fourth dimension inspired new ideas in spiritualism,
including Theosophy and “hyperspace philosophy” as advocated by Maurice Boucher, P. D. Ouspensky and Charles
Hinton Howard. Henderson devotes several chapters to a discussion of how geometrical ideas influenced the modern
art movements of Cubism and Futurism, focusing on the work of Marcel Duchamp in particular.
236

The titles within the natural philosophy section of the Cabinet Cyclopaedia series (Society for the Diffusion of
Useful Knowledge) included Augustus De Morgan's book An Essay on Probabilities and on their Applications to
Life Contingencies and Insurance Offices (1838), Dionysius Lardner's contributed volumes on heat, hydrostatics,
and electricity, as well as Treatise on Arithmetic Practical and Theoretical (1834) and A Treatise on Geometry and
its Application in the Arts (1840), astronomer Sir John Herschel contributed Astronomy (1833) and A Preliminary
Discourse on the Study of Natural Philosophy (1831), David Brewster contributed Optics (1831), Henry Kater coauthored with Lardner a volume on Mechanics (1831). For more see chapter two, section (5).

209

the increasing availability of mathematical books have improved numeracy, engaged minds on
these subjects, and increased the curiosity and respect for mathematical practitioners prior to the
institution of a public education system that included mathematics as a routinely studied subject?
Might authors who submitted manuscripts on astronomy to Macmillan in the 1870s, have read
Herschel’s 1833 book on the same subject, and been influenced by it? Books released in large
circulations permeated daily, lived experience. Through these works, a very many people had a
chance to come into contact with some aspect of mathematics, mixed mathematics, or physical
science. Early mass-produced books on mathematical subjects may have influenced a generation
of readers and writers, inspiring increased interest in, and possibly further cultural respect for,
mathematics and science.

3. Authors, typographic culture and mathematics in print
Florian Cajori's account of mathematical notation throughout history remains the most thorough
and authoritative book on this subject. However, Robin Rider has helpfully pointed out that
Cajori’s book, while exceedingly thorough, conceives of only one agent in the evolution of
mathematical texts over time, that agent being the author. A History of Mathematical Notations
only mentions the title, author and nationality of each work studied, it does not record the
printers or publishers (if applicable) who produced it, nor does it address the effect the
materiality of printing may have had on the choice of particular mathematical symbols or
notations used in printed works (Cajori 1928). Robin Rider, by contrast, has aimed in her work to
highlight the role of printers and publishers in the appearance of eighteenth century mathematics
in print. In doing so Rider recognizes the book as a communications medium requires its own
examination.
Darnton’s model of the communications circuit recognizes that several players influence the
creation of a book besides its author. Rider similarly recognizes the importance of “typographic
culture” and its impact on the appearance of mathematics in print. Acknowledging Rider’s
“typographic culture” (and Darnton’s circuit) means asking how “printing with moveable type,
the production and reproduction of images by artists, engravers and block cutters, the work of
translators and editors, and the efforts of publishers to identify and reach a market for their
goods” may have had joint agency with the author of a text on the mathematics that eventually
appeared, as well as how it appeared, in print (Rider 1993: 92).

210

The present study reveals how both author and “typographic culture” affected the presentation of
mathematical texts in the nineteenth century. Isaac Todhunter’s close collaboration with
Macmillan over the production of mathematical illustrations, and the general attention to detail
with which he paid to how his work was presented, is representative of one type of author whose
agency shaped the appearance of mathematics in print.

237

On the other hand, mathematical books

were influenced by decisions within the publishing house. As an advisor on mathematics at
Macmillan and Co., Isaac Todhunter and then Donald MacAlister were consulted on what
mathematical texts to publish, and in Todhunter’s case, were directly responsible for bringing
forward new authors for publication (for instance, George Boole). MacAlister had a list of
qualities he required of mathematical texts, including requirements for their organization,
typography, and referencing. With respect to diagrams that were to be produced for Macmillan’s
mathematical books, MacAlister recommended mathematical diagrams be aesthetically pleasing
238

in appearance, using a variety of descriptive lines and figures drawn in perspective.

These details of publication, such as decisions about which works get published and the visual
presentation of the work in print, were important. As William Dawson noted, the quality and
professionalism of a publication reflected on the perceived quality of its content. Essentially
Dawson recognized what McLuhan and Eisenstein point out about communications media; that
the medium of communication influences the reception of the content by the public. Both
Dawson and MacAlsiter accepted as fact that a badly produced text would be overlooked, no
matter its intellectual quality. If the printed treatment was poor, then the work itself was often
assumed to be of inferior quality as well. On the other hand, more credibility could be given to a
publication if it received a sumptuous or professional visual presentation, in its use of
illustrations or in its typographical presentation (Dawson 1883). Authors were aware of this, and
struggled to achieve the best possible presentation of their work. We can list many Canadians (J.

237

See chapter two, section (10). Also, recall June Barrow-Green’s study of Todhunter, which also reveals that he
demanded high production values from his published work, and was known to pick over publication details,
including where to have the best woodcuts produced, etc. (Barrow-Green 2001: 189).
238

See chapter three, section (7).

211

C. Fields and J. G. MacGregor are examples) who sought publication abroad for their books,
239

because Canadian printed or published books were seen as second rate.

In her book The Printing Press as an Agent of Change about how printing revolutionized
European culture, Eisenstein goes so far as to suggest that “editorial decisions made by early
printers (with regard to layout and presentation) probably helped reorganize the thinking of
readers. The thoughts of readers were guided by the way the contents of a book were arranged
and presented. Basic changes in book format might well have lead to changes in thought
patterns” (Eisenstein 1979: vol. 1, 70-71). She goes on to say “increasing familiarity with
regularly numbered pages, punctuation marks, section breaks, running heads, indexes and so
forth helped to reorder the thought of all readers” (Eisenstein 1979: vol. 1, 81). While Eisenstein
may go too far in assigning the printing press primary causal agency in reshaping European
intellectual thought, Florian Cajori’s opposite vision of the author as sole agent of change ought
also be amended. A printed text is the result of the combined effort between the author and the
author’s collaborators within the typographic culture that shaped its production.

4. Economics, book production and the image of mathematics
During J. C. Fields’ time in secondary school at the Hamilton Collegiate Institute, and during his
undergraduate education at the University of Toronto, we know what mathematical books were
assigned to him for study.240 As a student of mathematics in Ontario from 1869 to the early
1880s, Fields mostly worked with mathematical textbooks of British origin (including several
Macmillan publications), some of which had been “adapted” for the use of Canadian schools,
and one of which was French.

241

Although Fields always testified to the quality of education he

had received in Canada, he did note that his grounding in calculus had been wrong. He later
commented, looking back on his Canadian education, “Fifteen years after I had received my

239
240
241

See chapter five section (3) and (5).
For a list of books Fields studied in high school and university, see (Riehm and Hoffman 2011: 15-17, 21).

The Canadian adaptation of British mathematical textbooks typically consisted in the inclusion of an
introduction by a well-known local teacher of mathematics, testimonials about the book excerpted from local
sources (newspapers, or familiar educational authorities), and the inclusion of examples of local familiarity or
interest. Rarely if ever was the main body text of a mathematical book changed in Canadian adaptations.

212

grounding in the calculus I discovered, I am ashamed to say, in a German University, the
University of Berlin, that it had been taught to me falsely, irremediably and fundamentally
falsely” (Fields quoted in Riehm and Hoffman 2011: 21-22).
During his time as a mathematics student at Cambridge in 1890-93, Bertrand Russell similarly
found his mathematical education involved practices and materials that were, he later discovered,
outdated or false. As a Cambridge mathematics student, he had never studied nor heard of the
work of Weierstrass, Dedekind, Cantor, Frege or Peano (Russell 1959: 39). He later reflected
that “the ‘proofs’ that were offered of mathematical theorems were an insult to the logical
intelligence” and “my teachers offered me proofs which I felt to be fallacious and which, as I
learned later, had been recognized as fallacious” (Russell 1956: 20, 1959: 37-8). Russell, like
Fields, reeducated himself after his undergraduate education, exerting much effort to cure
himself of his “Cambridge parochialism” (Griffin and Lewis 1990: 65).
Much has been written about the use of mathematics within English society as a norm for truth,
and the stifling effect this value had on the educational context for mathematical teaching at
Cambridge and on the development of nineteenth century English mathematics (Barrow-Green
and Gray 2006, Griffin and Lewis 1990, Richards 1988a, 1988b). We might wonder why the
broader English culture of mathematics was so resistant to change, when several English
mathematicians, like W. K. Clifford, Arthur Cayley and James Joseph Sylvester, were
knowledgeable about continental mathematical ideas.
Thomas Kuhn’s classic book The Structure of Scientific Revolutions invests considerable
importance in the role of textbooks in the maintenance and definition of what Kuhn characterizes
as “normal science”. Normal science, as defined by Kuhn, is the practice of problem solving
within parameters set out by an accepted approach to phenomena or group of theories. Kuhn sees
practitioners operating in normal science mode as engaged in tackling problems and gaps within
a theoretical structure that has already been accepted as the core theory or approach (Kuhn 1970:
24). Kuhn suggests that in science, more so than in other fields, core values are maintained by
the pedagogical use and production of textbooks:
to an extent unprecedented in other fields, both the layman’s and the practitioner’s knowledge
of science is based on textbooks and a few other types of literature derived from them [i.e.
popularizations, philosophy of science]. Textbooks, however, being pedagogic vehicles for the

213

perpetuation of normal science, have to be rewritten in whole or in part whenever the
language, problems-structure, or standards of normal science change (Kuhn 1970: 137).

The activity of normal science and the reflection of that body of values and principles in the
textbooks it produces, comes for Kuhn at a considerable cost to the overall development of
science. That cost is the suppression of “fundamental novelties”, because these are necessarily
subversive of the basic intellectual commitments of those invested in normal science (Kuhn
1970: 5).
While Kuhn goes on to make several further claims about the role of textbooks, what is relevant
to the present study is Kuhn’s assertion that textbooks are connected with the maintenance of
vested interests in a particular scientific program. Kuhn’s point is that scientists who have
become successful within the structure of status quo scientific practice continue to perpetuate
and profit from the maintenance of that belief system.
This thesis amplifies Kuhn’s now classic observation from the history of philosophy of science
by adding that publishers, too, were invested in perpetuating status quo science through the
continued production of successful textbooks. Particularly in Britain, where industrialization was
applied to book production, publisher’s profits from the sale of cheap reproductions of alreadysuccessful textbooks were substantial. By comparison, the development and production of new
mathematical textbooks meant a loss of expected profit on the sale of established textbooks. For
example, in their early years of business, Macmillan and Co. took risks on the creation of new
pedagogical materials in mathematics (particularly under the guidance of Isaac Todhunter),
because at that time, developing this new material helped Macmillan establish a niche in the
book market. However, as their business matured and became more successful, their pattern of
mathematical textbook production became more conservative, they continued to print their
established textbooks in large quantities, pushing these books into ever expanding global and
colonial markets. This activity helped perpetuate a moribund image of British mathematics in
Britain as well as overseas in Canada.
In Macmillan’s records we can see that the publisher, motivated by a desire for profitability and
successful economics, made decisions that maintained the status quo in the printed record of
mathematics. In some cases a publisher’s actions interrupted what might have been a path
towards change in mathematics. When a mathematical textbook was nearly out of print,

214

Macmillan frequently recommended reprinting it right away. Reprinting sometimes contravened
the wishes of the author, who requested alterations and improvements. The publisher postponed
alterations and improvements for a second edition to be produced later, while copies of the first
edition continued to be profitably sold.

242

As their reader of mathematics, Daniel MacAlister chose to recommend for publication at
Macmillan textbooks that fit within the received image of British mathematics, books that he felt
were appropriate to English pedagogical needs.

243

In this act, he was also an agent of the

maintenance of status quo English mathematics, and the values about its habit of study that were,
toward the end of the nineteenth century, suppressing the adoption of fundamental changes that
had come to the subject in France and Germany. As the British approach to mathematics was
perpetuated in part through the use of these pedagogical materials, aspiring mathematicians in
Britain and Canada were introduced to an image of mathematics through an education system in
which British textbooks played an important part. After their education at Cambridge and in
Canada, Fields and Russell had to un-learn certain parts of their mathematical training and excise
errors in the mathematics that had been presented to them before they could go on to make new
contributions or discoveries in calculus, algebra or logic.

5. Fashioning a history of science publishing
In the year 2000, Jonathan Topham described science publishing in nineteenth century Britain as
“a vast and largely unexplored territory” (Topham 2000b: 562). While undertaking the history of
science from a publishing history perspective is not new, it is an approach just beginning.
Because so little has been known about the history of nineteenth century science publishing,
certain assumptions have been made about nineteenth century scientists as authors and the
publication of their works. This thesis challenges or proves erroneous some of these
assumptions.

242
243

See Daniel Macmillan to Isaac Todhunter, 3 November 1854, MP 55376, General Letter-Book, 1854-1855.
See chapter three, section (7).

215

David MacKitterick’s erudite history of the Cambridge University Press includes several
chapters about Cambridge’s other publisher of importance, Macmillan and Company. In these
chapters he suggests that Macmillan’s literary authors were more important, both financially and
in their cultural influence, than their scientific authors. He writes
As general publishers, [Macmillan and Co.’s] list included fiction, travel and poetry as well
as school and university studies. …Lewis Carroll, Charles Kingsley, Thomas Hughes,
Charlotte Mary Yonge and Mrs. Craik (her husband was a partner in the firm) were all major
authors – and financially usually more important than their university counterparts (emphasis
mine, McKitterick 2004b: 58).

This opinion has been offered more than once by historians of publishing. While numerous
studies in the history of literary authorship exist, there has been a comparative non-interest in the
history of scientific (or mathematical) authorship. This study proves that publishers profited from
the publication of science, both financially, through book sales, and culturally, by associating
themselves with the prestige of recognized authorities on scientific topics. Several facts suggest
this point. Macmillan, a commercial publisher with no access to university subsidies, was the
most active publisher of science in nineteenth century England. Publishing science and
mathematics was profitable, as demonstrated by the fact that nineteenth century science
publishing took place primarily at commercial publishers who operated within a free market
setting (Topham 2013; McKitterick 2004a: 32, 397). A quantitative study of Macmillan’s
mathematical publications (see chapter four), demonstrates how profitable the publication of
mathematical textbooks were for Macmillan. Macmillan’s investment in mathematical textbooks
and their authors were just as important for the company, if not more important, than their
investment in bestselling works of fiction and their literary authors.
Historians of the book have also naively assumed that “few authors of scientific, technical and
medical texts were motivated by the possibility of financial benefit for their efforts. Most were
primarily interested in informing readers or producing texts that could be used for educational
purposes” (MacDonald and Connor 2007: 184). While this statement may not be completely
incorrect, to date such opinions have been based largely on assumptions rather than knowledge.
As demonstrated in chapter four of this work, some mathematical authors were motivated by the
expectation of profit from their publications. Science publishing was not purely altruistic.

216

Historians who have undertaken the study of science publishing have revealed that scientific
authors often had agendas to push, livelihoods to forge, vanities to preserve, and careers to
pursue.

244

All these factors came together in scientists’ interaction with the publishing industry

and their use of publication and printed media to advance these goals. Scientific authors did not
lack the foibles and motives that affected writers of fiction, literature, poetry or other subjects.
The same reality of producing printed knowledge within a capitalist marketplace shaped
scientific authors and their publications as it did literary authors and their works of fiction.
Further studies of scientific publishing will reveal why and how scientific authors leveraged the
publishing industry to achieve their ends. Did scientists network with publishers in order to
establish organs of scientific communication, to pursue profits from their intellectual property, to
help form a reputation, leave a legacy, or achieve prestige? How did scientific authors use
publishing as a way to legitimize and publicize the respectability of their profession? Further
work in history of science publishing will help to definitively answer these questions.

244

In her article about the development of the International Scientific Series, Leslie Howsam discusses how
Victorian men of science T. H. Huxley, John Tyndall and Herbert Spencer harnessed nineteenth century book
publishing to broadcast a particular brand of Darwinism (Howsam 2000). In describing how scientists interacted
with the machinery of publication, Howsam notes that scientific books, articles and papers do not emanate
unmediated from the minds of their authors. Rather, she writes, “the bland package of a printed and bound book may
conceal a complex history of networking and power-broking among authors and publishers” (Howsam 2000, 187).

Mathematical manuscripts received by Macmillan, 1867-1896

The following table is a record of mathematical manuscripts Macmillan and Co. recorded
between the years 1868 and 1896 to keep track of received manuscripts and corresponding
readers reports. The following list was compiled from the Records of Manuscripts (MP 5601656018) and Readers Report books (MP 55931-55940). A year, author or action given in brackets
indicates some uncertainty in my interpretation of the paper records. DM, DMcA, and DMA are
variations on the initials of Macmillan’s reader of science, Donald MacAlister (see chapter 3).
Records appear to be fairly complete between the years 1880 and 1896, while in the 1860s and
1870s the records appear haphazard.

B. Some of Macmillan’s readers of science, 1867-1896
The following table lists some of Macmillan’s readers on scientific topics during the years 1868
and 1896. This list was compiled from the Records of Manuscripts Received and Readers Report
books from the Macmillan Papers, British Library. This is not a comprehensive list. However, it
does reveal some of Macmillan’s trusted advisors on scientific topics, and reflects how
frequently, and in what years, these readers were active. I have made some assumptions in
producing this list of reviewers, as in some cases I deduced a full name from initials or a
shortened form given in the records.
