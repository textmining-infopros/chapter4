DISCIPLINARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FACULTY
IN LIBRARY USE AND PERCEPTIONS

Cynthia M. Thompson, Candidate for the Doctor of Philosophy Degree
University of Missouri-Kansas City, 2014

ABSTRACT

Current literature provides little in terms of general faculty use or
perceptions in relation to the library. In many institutions, liaisons reject the results
and recommendations of these studies as not generalizable to their specific
situation and instead are reactive, responding to the immediate needs of the most
vocal individual faculty members in the disciplines with which they work. The
purpose of this study is to provide a level of detail on faculty use and perceptions
that does not currently exist for librarians and administrators making decisions
regarding the future of the academic library. In particular, this study develops
profiles of faculty use and perceptions of the library for specific academic disciplines
and helps librarians and administrators identify differences and similarities in
disciplines relating to faculty use and perceptions that can then determine future
strategies. While many commonalities existed between disciplines, differences were
also apparent. General groupings of disciplines within the humanities and the
iii

sciences tended to have more in common with each other than those in the social
sciences, although differences existed within these as well. Library administrators
and liaisons looking to make better decisions relating to services and collections can
utilize the distinctions to understand some priorities for individual disciplines.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Thanks are due to such a large number of individuals that I cannot possibly
thank them all. First, I benefited greatly from the constant support from my advisor,
Dr. Carolyn Thompson. Through times both of little progress and of frantic progress
you have provided guidance and encouragement. Any obstacles either of us faced in
the years during which we have collaborated on this project were never obstacles in
your eyes, which always helped me to see them as surmountable. I appreciate your
patience with my unsteady pace, and your thoughtful consideration of my work.
I would also like to thank the other members of my committee, Dr. Tamera
Murdock, Dr. John Budd, Dr. Bonita Butner, and Dr. Nicholas Peroff. Your individual
and varied perspectives were instrumental in the development of my research, and I
am grateful that I will continue to work with you as I continue at UMKC.
My colleagues at UMKC have also been fantastic support, particularly Dean
Bonnie Postlethwaite, who always saw the value in this project and provided me
with the flexibility I needed to finish, and Molly Mead who never stopped asking me
for progress reports, regardless of how little I wanted to provide them.
Thank you to my wonderful reviewers, Dominique Newland and Heather
Thompson, who spent their valuable time to provide input on everything from
presentation of data to typos. I owe you far more than cupcakes.
Most importantly, my husband, Greg Thompson, and all of my family have been
of incredible support throughout this entire process. To Shaun, who was born near
xv

the beginning of this project, and to Alexandria, who will be born shortly after the
conclusion, Iâm very much looking forward to more time with you. And Greg, your
patience as I binged on writing for extended periods, your humor throughout my
many rants, and your utter confidence that I would finish were the main forces that
helped me through these years. I am absolutely positive that I could not have done
this without you, and am so fortunate to have you.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION AND PROBLEM STATEMENT

Academic libraries of today must demonstrate their value in the academy,
and thus it is critical that they ground their decisions in research. Evidence-based
decision making is a well-established practice in some areas and industries, but one
that has yet to gain widespread traction in libraries. In an era of questioning every
penny spent, this is dangerous in education, but more so in libraries. For decades,
academics, librarians, and others have predicted the demise of the library. The
theory that electronic information is going to completely replace print is the most
frequently cited reason and is at the core of nearly every critique (Hellman, 2010;
Lancaster, 1978; Technology Review, 2010); in his âAcademic Library Autopsy
Report,â Sullivan (2011) outlined how the digitization of collections and integration
of information literacy into university curricula, both major goals of libraries, would
eventually make libraries obsolete. But instead of accepting their ultimate demise,
librarians have responded to changes in technology by offering an ever-evolving
range of new and enhanced services to meet the information needs of the
increasingly electronic world, and by reinforcing their value as experts in finding
and understanding information to students, faculty, and their communities
(Association of College and Research Libraries, 2010; Maloney, Antelman, Arlitsch, &
Butler, 2010).

In 1931, Ranganathan set forth his five laws of library science:
ï·

Books are for use

ï·

Every reader his book

ï·

Every book its reader

ï·

Save the time of the reader

ï·

A library is a growing organism

The use of the word âbookâ is characteristic of why the rise of electronic information
seems like such a threat to some, because as in Ranganathanâs laws, the book has
traditionally been considered central to the purpose of libraries. Replace the word
book with something more generic and the principles ring true today, and illustrate
why, rather than disappearing from the academic landscape, libraries will continue
to grow and change. Libraries of today âselect, acquire, synthesize, disseminate,
interpret, apply, and archive information. They enable users to navigate, discover,
obtain, understand, use, and apply informationâ (Neal & Jaggers, 2010, p. 57). In
their 2010 Perceptions of Libraries report, De Rosa et al. reported that 56% of
college students use library resources, and 24% consult a librarian. The proportion
of students using their library regularly increased to 22% in 2010 from 15% in
2005, and according to the American Library Association Office for Research and
Statistics, the number of visits to libraries increased more than 13% between 1994
and 2008 even with a period of declining library use in the 1990s (2013). To

2

continue this pattern of growth and adaptation in modern academia, libraries must
understand the constituent groups with which they work.
Faculty in particular are a driving force in the university. They often have a
strong role in shared governance, particularly in decision-making with regard to
curriculum development but also in the more general discourse relating to the
future of higher education (Altbach, 2005; Bess & Dee, 2008; Gappa, Austin, & Trice,
2007; Longin, 2002). While librarians are considered a part of this group in some
institutions (American Association of University Professors, 2006; Bolin, 2008a;
McGowan & Dow, 1995; Savage, 1982), this does not change the fact that in nearly
every university there are librarians1 in roles that rely heavily on their partnerships
with other faculty to forward the goals of their library (Christiansen, Stombler, &
Thaxton, 2004; Frank, Raschke, Wood, & Yang, 2001; Rodwell & Fairbairn, 2008;
Thull & Hansen, 2009). Thus, it is critical that librarians understand the faculty in
their institutions in order to reach their goals, as well as to demonstrate the value of
the academic library to this crucial group (Association of College and Research
Libraries, 2010; Badke, 2005; Beaky, Besosa, Berry, Martinez, & Bradley, 2012;
Doskatsch, 2003; Frank et al., 2001; Lipow, 2003; Longin, 2002; Stebelman, Siggins,
Nutty, & Long, 1999).

For simplicity, librarians, including those with faculty status, will henceforth be referred to as
âlibrarians,â and all other faculty will simply be referred to as âfaculty.â

One of the primary ways librarians partner with faculty in their colleges and
universities is through the liaison relationship (Carpan, 2011; Cohen, 1995;
Livingston, 2003; Rader, 1999; Thull & Hansen, 2009). The primary identifying
characteristic of a liaison librarian is the responsibility of acting as a communication
link between the library and the rest of the university. In different institutions,
liaisons may also be responsible for a variety of related tasks including selection of
materials for the library collections, information literacy instruction to students,
provision of in-depth research consultations, and curriculum development (Cataldo,
Tennant, Sherwill-Navarro, & Jesano, 2006; Doskatsch, 2003; Glynn & Wu, 2003;
Lindstrom & Shonrock, 2006; Rodwell & Fairbairn, 2008; Winner, 1998). In most
cases, liaisons have responsibility for a number of disciplines, and the independence
with which to determine the best way to meet the needs of faculty and students
within each of those disciplines. The liaisonsâ independent authority to determine
their strategies for meeting the needs of faculty (and by extension, students), and
the individualized way in which they make these decisions, is the impetus for this
research.
Statement of Problem
Current literature provides little in terms of general faculty use or
perceptions in relation to the library. Case studies and small-scale surveys of the
faculty at a single institution are somewhat common (Bury, 2011; Cannon, 1994;
Cohen, 1995; Ducas & Michaud-Oystryk, 2004; Jo, 2012; Storie & Campbell, 2012;

4

Thomsett-Scott & May, 2009; Yang, 2000), and conversely, there are some largescale studies that look at faculty use and perceptions overall or by discipline
grouping (generally humanities, social sciences, and sciences) but do not provide a
level of detail that would likely be useful to an individual liaison making decisions
about the individual disciplines they serve (Christiansen et al., 2004; Heterick &
Schonfeld, 2004; Housewright & Schonfeld, 2008; Schonfeld & Housewright, 2010;
Thull & Hansen, 2009). In many institutions, liaisons reject the results and
recommendations of these studies as not generalizable to their specific situation
and instead are reactive, responding to the immediate needs of the most vocal
individual faculty members in the disciplines with which they work (Genoni,
Haddow, & Ritchie, 2004). Additionally, there is a lack of literature on the needs of
individuals in any given discipline. Jones (2012) completed an extensive review of
the literature on disciplinary differences and found that while there is much
research in some areas on disciplinary differences, âthere remains much we donât
know about these differencesâ (p. 23). Disciplinary differences in relation to library
and research material use are one of those areas that is severely lacking in research.
As librarians seek to establish their services and collections as integral in the
modern academic environment, it is critical that they understand the needs and
perceptions of those involved in the discourse relating to their futures, and use this
understanding in planning, decision-making, and their everyday work. In a study of

5

administrators in higher education, Lynch et al. (2007) state the critical nature of
this:
â¦ the days of the library's ability to control what is important are gone.
Serving a public good is no longer enough to ensure funding and
administrative support. To secure support, the library must now
demonstrate how it serves the university mission. (p. 226)
The importance of this is further reinforced in the Association of College and
Research Librariesâ efforts toward better communicating the value of academic
libraries, particularly with their commissioned study completed by Megan Oakleaf,
âThe value of academic libraries: A comprehensive research review and report,â and
regular and consistent follow-up to that report.
Purpose and Significance
The purpose of this study is to provide a level of detail on faculty use and
perceptions that does not currently exist for librarians and administrators making
decisions regarding the future of the academic library. In particular, this study aims
to develop profiles of faculty use and perceptions of the library for specific academic
disciplines. It will help identify differences and similarities in disciplines relating to
faculty use and perceptions that librarians can then use to determine future
strategies.
For libraries to make grounded decisions relating to the liaison relationship,
they must understand the faculty with whom they are trying to work. Evidence-

6

based decision-making is critical in developing sound strategies for transformation,
and it is only recently emerging as a major arena of library literature. The reactive
and instinctive strategies embraced by librarians historically are not sustainable,
particularly as resources become scarce. This study delineates the patterns for
faculty in individual disciplines relating to use and perception of the library, which
could lead to better understanding of how library resources can be allocated to the
greatest benefit, and which library services need to be focused where. The findings
of this study will be beneficial for administrators in higher education and librarians,
and could have significant implications for strategic and budgetary decisions
relating to academic libraries.
Research Questions and Hypothesis
The overarching research questions of this study are as follows: How do
faculty members in disparate disciplines use the academic library? How do faculty
members in disparate disciplines perceive the academic library? In answering these
questions, this research aims to investigate the following hypothesis: Differences in
perceptions of the library and use of the library exist between disciplines, as well as
when considering demographic characteristics including age, sex, title, experience,
and primary role as a research or teacher. In this study, perceptions include
perceptions of the current role of the library, perceived dependence on the library,
and negative perceptions of the continuing relevance of the library; use includes the
frequency with which one engages in information seeking behaviors, level of

7

comfort with digital material, and use of library resources for research. Through
exploring this hypothesis and developing disciplinary profiles, a better picture will
emerge to illustrate how faculty use and perceive the library, and help to inform
how libraries can best respond to faculty in individual disciplines.
Definition of Terms
Collection Development: The selection of library materials.
Discipline: An academic field in which one is engaged in teaching or research. This
can be general (e.g. humanities, social sciences) or specific (e.g. psychology,
education, American history). In this study, discipline is used in the specific sense
unless otherwise indicated.
Embedding: Librarians partnering with another faculty member to fully integrate
the librarian and information literacy/library instruction into a course.
Evidence-based Librarianship: âA sequential, structured process for integrating the
best available evidence into making important decisionsâ (Eldredge, 2012).
Faculty: Although many librarians are faculty in their institutions, this study will use
the term to refer to non-librarian faculty unless specifically indicated.
Interdisciplinarity: Applying two or more academic disciplines to a project or area of
study.
Liaison: A librarian who, as a part or the entirety of their responsibilities, works to
connect the library with a particular group of faculty in their institution.

8

Librarian: A library professional, generally someone who holds a masterâs degree in
library science of some form.

CHAPTER 2
LITERATURE REVIEW

As academic libraries of today must demonstrate their value in the academy,
it is critical that they are able to ground their decisions in research. Evidence-based
decision making is a well-established practice, but one that has yet to gain traction
in libraries. While this research intends to add to the literature for this type of
decision making, it also follows the principles of evidence-based librarianship (EBL).
The first step in EBL is to establish the question, which in this case is to determine
how faculty members in disparate disciplines use and perceive the academic library.
Next is a thorough and critical literature search to find possible answers to that
question. This literature review provides an overview of the topics surrounding
major aspects of this study. It begins with a brief overview of the organizational
structure of higher education, then positions the library within that structure.
Following is a discussion of organizational change in higher education with a focus
in libraries, including the major impetuses for change, and trends in managing
change and setting strategy. Because faculty are the population of interest in this
research, this review closely examines the changing face of faculty including
demographics and current issues, and perceptions and behaviors. Differences
between disciplines are also addressed in detail, as this is the subject of interest.
Then, it will provide more extensive background on the librarians who work with
10

other faculty in a university, and finally will discuss the literature relating to the
intersection between all of these various topics, the faculty needs and perceptions of
libraries.
Organizational Structure in Higher Education
Organization of higher education is an anomaly in organizational theory. In
judging the structure based on best practices and theory, they are very poorly run,
but they are also generally very successful (Birnbaum, 1988). Currie and Shepstone
(2012) attribute this to the contrast between entrenched hierarchies and the
mission of creating new knowledge and ideas, and that âthe pursuit of simultaneous
contradiction has been found to be highly successful in colleges and universities in
coping with conditions of uncertainty, complexity, and turbulenceâ (p. 59). As with
most organizations, there is not a single framework that applies perfectly to
academia. However, the bureaucratic model of organization is particularly relevant
in studying higher education, as is the political framework as defined by Bolman and
Deal (2008).
Bureaucratic Characteristics
In 1922, Max Weber described the model of a bureaucratic form of
organization as an ideal, and it remains today as one of the most prevalent
organizational structures. It has come under fire for perceived shortcomings of slow
process and lack of individualized decision making; in his writings from 1977 to the
present, Hummel has claimed that bureaucracy strips individuals of their sense of

11

self, a common critique. In spite of this criticism, a well-run bureaucracy can be an
efficient and effective organizational structure. The aim of a Weberian bureaucracy
is an efficient organization with rational, impersonal, and objective decision-making
opportunities. In their comprehensive study of the organization of higher education,
Bess and Dee (2008) highlight five Weberian characteristics that are of particular
importance in higher education. While each fits most colleges and universities fairly
well, none fit perfectly; hence the assertion that institutions of higher education are
poorly organized models of bureaucracy.
The first characteristic, the division of labor (specialization), is evident
clearly in academic and non-academic units, disciplinary delineations, and the
specializations of individual faculty. Additionally, beginning in the 19th century,
professional societies and organizations created a community of specialization that
held firm in higher education. A necessary counterpoint to this specialization is
communication and coordination between the specializations, which ensure a
cohesive experience. While communication within a unit is generally at least
minimally sufficient, institutions of higher education rarely communicate well
across units. This is generally characterized in the literature as silos, or the loosely
coupled systems of higher education (Birnbaum, 1988; Weick, 1976).
Routinization, standardization, and formalization are aspects of procedural
specification in Weberâs model, and it is the formalization that is most common in
higher education. Each of these terms relates to a form of consistency, in that having
12

written, common, standard procedures are an effective tool in a well-run
bureaucracy. These are often seen in the modern university as the course catalog
and policies relating to all aspects of an institutions functioning. From a faculty
memberâs perspective, this is particularly useful in acting as a buffer between
faculty and administrators, as it can minimize accusations of preferential treatment.
Impersonality meets the same goal, as treating everyone with equality both
prevents one from receiving favorable treatment, but also protects from arbitrary
negative treatment. However, policies are not always applied uniformly, and the
aforementioned lack of communication may result their being ignored completely.
The fourth characteristic Bess and Dee discuss, meritocratic promotion, is
also common in higher education. For academic appointments, promotion and
tenure are part of a highly formalized process based on a peer analysis of a faculty
memberâs work, and for non-academic staff, performance and longevity often factor
into promotion. Both systems have been called into question, particularly
promotion and tenure, but they still hold a strong place in academia.
Finally, a clear hierarchy is a critical hallmark of an effective bureaucracy.
According to Altbach, âthe American academic system is enmeshed in a series of
complex hierarchies. These hierarchies, framed by discipline, institution, rank, and
specialty, help to determine working conditions, prestige, and in many ways,
orientation to the professionâ (2005, p. 296). The hierarchy may not be clear, as
would be ideal under Weberâs framework, but its presence is inarguable. It is most
13

apparent in most administrative and non-academic units, as there are usually clear
lines of reporting. In contrast, the hierarchical structure for faculty is complicated.
There may be a formal hierarchy based on rank and leadership positions, but the
power and responsibility of faculty governance groups in forwarding the
institutional mission and contributing to major administrative decisions varies
greatly between institutions and on individual issues.
Coordination between the levels of the organization is crucial to an effective
bureaucracy, but academic institutions are often differentiated to the extent that
communication can be difficult, and the lack of a clear hierarchy can make it difficult
for one, particularly one new to an institution, to understand where communication
and coordination must occur. Departments, schools, and even colleges within a
single institution frequently function in silos, avoiding contact with other units
unless necessary. Thus the basic communication required in bureaucracy breaks
down often and, in extreme cases, does not exist. Even though the model is not
perfect, it is still apparent that the primary mode of organization in higher education
is bureaucratic with a strong hierarchy.
Politics and Culture
Bureaucracy is not the only organizational structure evident in academia;
academic institutions also display political characteristics. According to Bolman and
Deal (2008), politics in an organization is âthe realistic process of making decisions
and allocating resources in a context of scarcity and divergent interestsâ (p. 190). In

14

recognizing a university as a political organization under this definition, it is clear
that any organizational change in higher education, including additional resources, a
curriculum shift, or a major policy change, must address political climate. By
forming coalitions, taking advantage of negotiation, and generally being aware of
political implications of any request, one is much better able to navigate the complex
hierarchy of higher education, while at the same time acting outside of it (Birnbaum,
1988; Bolman & Deal, 2008).
To be successful within the political structure of an organization, one must
understand the culture of the institution. Organizational culture is the recognition
that humans are individuals, and that they
â¦do not necessarily behave in individually predictable ways but do gravitate
toward some socially influenced states. This approach â¦ is more fruitful
especially for the examination of complex organizations composed of selfdetermining professionals, such as colleges and universities and their
libraries. (Budd, 2012, p. 37)
Recognizing the influence of politics and culture in an organization is vital in
understanding why, while bureaucracy in higher education is so technically flawed,
it still continues to function as an effective organization.
Organizational Structure in University Libraries
Structurally, the academic library is much like the university itself: organized
functionally and by discipline, with an even more deeply embedded hierarchy and

15

bureaucracy. The basic configuration of most libraries is functional, with what is
traditionally known as public services (e.g. instruction, service desks, and
circulation) separated out from technical services (e.g. acquisitions, cataloging, and
preservation) and administration, with all units reliant on a mix of professional,
paraprofessional, and support staff.
Unlike most other units within colleges and universities, the library is
inexorably tied into nearly every facet of the institution. Thomas Benton recently
stated, âmore than any other class of professionals in higher education, librarians
possess a comprehensive understanding of the scholarly ecosystem. They know
what's going on across the disciplines, among professors and administrators as well
as studentsâ (2010, para. 3). Because of this, changes in the university culture and
the culture of individual units within the academic community in which it resides
are reflected in the library.
The area in which the library most closely mirrors that of other academic
units within a university is in a reference department, sometimes known as
research services, liaisons, or subject specialists. In this type of department there is
generally a structure of subject specialists who have assignments corresponding
with the academic units on campus. In most cases, a single librarian serves multiple
units on campus, but the structure is generally disciplinary in nature. In some cases,
the department in which liaison librarians work is reflective of the overall structure
of the university; where the university has highly siloed academic disciplines, the
16

individual liaisons are also often siloed. The increasingly interdisciplinary nature of
faculty work can break down these divisions, and makes it critical that these
librarians work together so that they can better meet the needs of interdisciplinary
researchers (Budd, 2012). The work of these librarians is tied closely to this
research, and the individual work of liaisons is discussed in detail below.
Organizational Change
The overall organizational structure of individual institutions in higher
education is unlikely to change in the next ten years. The importance of hierarchy
and bureaucracy are too heavily entrenched in higher education to see a vast shift,
and cultural change often takes a deliberate effort before it can occur (Cameron,
1984; Cummings & Worley, 2008; Schermerhorn, Hunt, & Osborn, 1997). However,
a lack of a general structural shift does not indicate a lack of any change.
Government and market pressures are the major impetuses for change in American
higher education today, and there is little doubt that they will continue to have an
impact on various aspects of organizational structure. The cause of current issues
facing the organization of higher education is primarily economic. Because
American higher education âis a marketâdriven aggregation of institutions
competing for students, resources, and statusâ (Fairweather, 2009, p. 15), it must be
responsive to changes in the market. While change in a large bureaucracy
sometimes takes decades, it is still a constant presence in higher education, and
universities have necessarily become more nimble in more recent years.

17

Competition for resources between and within institutions has produced a climate
that has already sparked dramatic change in higher education. Declines in state
funding have required colleges and universities to become increasingly frugal. In
some cases this has led to a more entrepreneurial institution, because of
âinstitutional decisions to require academic units, especially professional schools
like business and law, to become self-supporting through tuition revenues or
private giftsâ (Zusman, 2005, p. 123). The rapidly changing technologies of
education have also pushed for organizational change, primarily in libraries.
Technology and Organization in Libraries
The most significant impetus for change in the academic library is not
economics, as it is in most of the university, but technology. While financial
difficulties have certainly shaped decisions made in many libraries, with the rapid
growth of technology the process by which libraries fulfill their mission has evolved
significantly in the last fifty years. In their landmark 1945 work, Wilson and Tauber
describe a library with no technology more sophisticated than a telephone or a
typewriter, but still note that âprovision for flexibility to permit adaptation to
changing conditions isâ¦ of great importanceâ (p. 465). This spirit of flexibility has
carried through; rather than allowing technology to render libraries obsolete, Bell
and Shank asserted nearly sixty years later that:
Academic librarianship has excelled at grasping the significance and
potential of technology as a powerful force in transforming our profession

18

and what we contribute to higher education... we have largely maintained...
the ability to balance technology with humanism and an overarching focus on
student-centered service. (2004, p. 373)
The historic structure of the library has become inadequate as libraries have
developed new services and programs in response to new technologies. It is
outdated and not flexible enough to accommodate the state of constant change.
Thus, the current trend in the structure of libraries is a complete and drastic
restructuring.
As technological change began to reshape the demands placed on libraries,
reorganization initially manifested in the creation of new positions and the
restructuring of individual departments. First, libraries channeled funds into
librarians dedicated to electronic resources, systems and other technology related
areas (Eustis, Kenney, & Rounds, 1996). As the needs of institutions evolve, libraries
continue to develop and rework positions to support those needs through new
positions supporting the growth of programs like distance education, educational
technology, and the virtual library presence (Beck & Bonous-Smit, 2008; Budd,
2012). While it is an easier change, simply creating new positions is rarely sufficient
to accommodate the changing environment in which libraries operate. Eventually,
these incremental changes may lead to a complete library restructuring. In a 1996
study of library reorganization attempts, Shaughnessy found a common thread in
reorganization, that âlibraries must be organized to deal with the extraordinary
19

changes that are occurring in their environmentâ (p. 252). This is of particular
importance in library technical services departments, which are generally charged
with acquisition of resources and developing tools for access to those resources. In
this area of libraries, entire departments have been eliminated because of the shift
away from print materials (Eden, 2009), traditional cataloging schemes have been
totally rewritten (Blythe, Gunther, & Spurgin, 2013), and new technologies require
maintaining new tools to access information (Rathemacher, Cerbo, & Li, 2011).
Increasingly, though, entire libraries are also reorganizing so that they can be more
nimble. âAs emerging information technologies have been incorporated, the library
is less an archive and more an organism. . . . Such libraries tend to be characterized
by a genuine focus on the purpose of libraries, rather than on their inner workingsâ
(Budd, 2012, p. 110).
Structural Trends in Library Organization
There are a variety of trends in the development of new structures in
libraries. This review will address four: the adoption of organizational development,
team management, the institutional information model, and the unbounded model.
These trends are not mutually exclusive; more than one can influence the
organizational evolution in any given academic library.
Organizational development. Organizational development includes facets
of nearly every other trend in this discussion, and highly values coaching, creativity,
facilitation, self-management, and teams as keys to organizational success

20

(Cummings & Worley, 2008). Adoption of organizational development in business
started in the 1960s, but it only began to influence libraries in the early 1990s and
the initial impact was generally informal. Shermerhorn, Hunt, and Osborn (1997)
found that a delay in adoption of organizational development was largely due to the
inflexible structure of the parent institution. However, the same forces for change in
other industries also brought organizational development into academic libraries:
technology and economics (Holloway, 2004). Because strategy and vision are at the
core of organizational development, it is crucial that libraries looking to integrate
this strategy develop a culture of assessment and evidence-based practice (Russell,
2008). A study of Association of Research Libraries (ARL) institutions found that the
use of organizational development is common across institution types, even if they
do not use that particular terminology (Parsch & Baughman, 2010).
Team management. A team-based model was one of the first dramatically
different models adopted in a large university library, and one that leans heavily on
organizational development. Under the leadership of Carla Stoffle, the University of
Arizona undertook a massive reorganization in 1993 which eventually led to an
almost complete flattening of the organization with a network of teams reporting
directly to the dean, and continues to serve as a model for libraries exploring this
structure. The effort was coordinated by a consulting team from the Association of
Research Libraries, and one key component that has been imitated since is the high
level of staff involvement both in planning and implementation (Andrade &
21

Zaghloul, 2010; Bender, 1997; Shaughnessy, 1996). The approach divided librarians
and staff into functional teams that in many ways mirror the functional departments
that are so traditional in libraries. The structure within those teams, however, is
much more organic than the traditional hierarchy, which lends the structure its
flexibility. Additionally, librarians and staff also serve on a variety of crossfunctional teams that are even more flexible, and able to form and dissolve based on
the differing needs of the libraries (Bender, 1997; Budd, 2005; Diaz & Pintozzi,
1999; Giesecke, 1994; Shaughnessy, 1996). The University of Arizonaâs team-based
model includes many characteristics evident in organizational development, and it
is important to note that one of their team leaders is a key scholar in that area.
Institutional information. Other trends in library organizational structure,
as discussed here and outlined by Budd (2012), are far more specific. The first, the
institutional information model, positions the library as a partner with other units
in the institution with an interest in information. This is sometimes a formal
partnership, but is more often informal. In this model, libraries join with divisions
like information technology, institutional archives, educational technology, and
instructional media to collaborate on policy and share expertise. While the
advantages of this kind of approach could be immense, as the currently divergent
information environment merges, the resulting unit could be unwieldy, and
individual units are often culturally incompatible. Hayes (1993) identified several
potential downfalls of formal collaboration between these units, but âas information
22

technology becomes more pervasive in instruction and research, the absence of a
collaborative model could have deleterious effects on effective teaching, learning,
and inquiryâ (Budd, 2012, p. 123). Many libraries have found great success in this
model, and it is possible that increasing budget pressures will lead to more formal
partnerships (Barth, 2011).
Unbounded model. Another model is the unbounded model, commonly
known as the library without walls. This does not necessarily indicate that the
library has no physical space, but rather that it not rely upon a space. While this
model is not specific to a particular structure, it describes a library that âmust be a
flexible organization, able to respond to members of the academic community on
the basis of the nature of individual needâ (Budd, 2012, p. 124). This means that
collections must be accessible in whatever way the user needs, and requires that
librarians understand the intricacies of information and access so that they might
understand how to best serve the user. As online education and distance learning
gain importance in higher education and users desire more ubiquitous access to
library resources and services, this model will gain in prevalence. Already
characteristics are apparent in most libraries.
Evidence-Based Librarianship
As with models of organizational change, approaches to organizational
change take many different forms. Decisions in libraries, as in other institutions, are
often reactive. The majority of the literature in libraries is âoverwhelmingly

23

restricted to anecdotal accounts and descriptions of âreal lifeâ or âhow we did itâ case
studies, rather than founded on systematic empirical researchâ (McGuinness, 2006,
p. 574). Decision-making within libraries is reflective of this, as practitioners âhave a
deep resistance to reading research, based on a perception that theory is unlikely to
assist them with day-to-day decision making in their workplaceâ (Genoni et al.,
2004, p. 56). A recent systematic review of the literature surrounding one issue of
interest to libraries, relationships between librarians and faculty, found that of 304
articles published on the topic, only 77 (25%) reported on research projects. Of
those, only two actually assessed the nature of the relationship (Phelps & Campbell,
2012). Because so much literature is centered upon anecdotal accounts and case
studies, decision-making in libraries can be difficult. A number of trends propose
various methods for decision-making, including strategic planning, visioning, total
quality management, and preferred futuring (Brophy, 2005; Budd, 2012; Currie &
Shepstone, 2012; Dougherty, 1997; Eustis et al., 1996; Michalko, Malpas, & Arcolio,
2010; Russell, 2008). However, libraries have increasingly begun to take a more
research-intensive approach, utilizing theories and approaches to organizational
change in their planning, as well as systematic research.
Evidence-based librarianship (EBL) is gaining traction as a core foundation
for decision making in libraries. The key value of EBL is in its flexibility, and the
ability to draw from evidence and a variety of theoretical frameworks in the
development of a strategy to help libraries move forward in a more deliberate way.
24

In his recent overview of the evolution of EBL, Eldredge (2012) defines it as a
âsequential, structured process for integrating the best available evidence into
making important decisionsâ (p. 139). What began as a call to mirror the tenets of
evidence-based medicine (Eldredge, 1997) has since become a sub-discipline of
librarianship in its own right (Eldredge, 2013). The result of this has been an
increase in the research output of librarians, and greater adoption of research and
theory in practice.
Currie and Shepstone (2012) tie theory and evidence together in their 2012
analysis of culture and change, as they discovered that âmining the cultural evidence
provides rich organizational data to inform planning" (p. 52). Still, there is a
disconnect between research conducted, and its use in practice, due in large part to
the lack (or perceived lack) of relevant research (Genoni et al., 2004). A 2012 report
on the three-year Research in Librarianship Impact Evaluation Study to determine
how research impacts library practice found that this perception continues to hold
true, but that when practitioners and researchers work in concert, research in
librarianship can have a measurable impact on the success of library programs and
services (Cruickshank, Hall, & TaylorâSmith).
The Faculty
Another key group of interest in this study is the faculty, another aspect of
organization in higher education that has begun to see dramatic change. The faculty
role has evolved immensely over the last two hundred years, and while it has been

25

relatively stable for the past fifty, the faculty role is once again facing major change.
Professionalization of university faculty started in the 1820s as they shifted from
itinerant tutors to permanent fixtures, evidenced by the strong voice of faculty
defending their curricular model in the 1828 Yale Report (Altbach, 2005), then later
in the nineteenth century with the shift from generalists to specialists. By the end of
the nineteenth century, the idea of the faculty member as an expert with specialized
training gained traction (Schuster & Finkelstein, 2006). As faculty became more
expert in their fields, they began to question the practice of allowing the
administration of the institution to set curriculum. They began slowly, by petitioning
and arguing for changes that they believed were necessary to maintain academic
integrity, and by inserting themselves into the academic decision-making process.
With the formation of the American Association of University Professors
(AAUP) in 1915, university faculty developed a sounding board for grievances with
their administration. At the same time, faculty began to demand a more formalized
role in the governance of their institutions. The AAUP set forth various guidelines
defining the role of faculty in the administration of their institutions, particularly in
hiring, promotion, and academic policy. However, it was the 1940 Statement of
Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure that solidified the structure that is
often seen as the norm today, with faculty providing teaching, research, and service
in a tenure track role. Schuster and Finkelstein (2006) summarized the traditional
structure well, as a âformalized âlockstepâ from graduate studyâ¦ into a first full-time
26

position was followed by progression through the academic ranks to tenure,
culminating in a full professorship. The typical professor served many years at the
top rank and retired at or around 65â (p. 161). Tenured and tenure-track faculty
generally report to a department chair, who in turn reports to a dean. Shared
governance is a critical component, in which a faculty senate or other governance
body is responsible for representing the perspective of the faculty to administrators,
and for serving as a forum for discussion.
Complex hierarchies exist within this basic structure, some actual and others
perceived, based on program popularity, ability to attract external funding, and
political ties and priorities within an institution. With a simple formal structure and
a complicated social structure, it is not surprising that the organizational structure
of the faculty remained much the same through the end of the twentieth century.
However, the same pressures that are forcing rapid and drastic change generally in
higher education are also having a direct impact on faculty. Altbach (2005) argued
that faculty have failed in many ways to justify their current structure, and âfew
have effectively argued that the traditional autonomy of the faculty and faculty
control over many aspects of academic governance should be maintainedâ (p. 289).
As academic institutions make adaptations due to their changing climate, âthere will
be subtle organizational shifts that will inevitably work to diminish the perquisites,
and the authority, of the academic professionâ (p. 296).

27

Contingent Faculty
One of the most notable changes is the rise of part-time faculty, adjuncts, and
non-tenure-track (NTT) faculty, grouped together as âcontingency faculty.â Figure 1
demonstrates how the proportion of tenured and tenure track faculty has declined
over the past thirty years, while the proportion of contingent faculty has seen a
sharp increase.

28

Johnson (2003) eloquently criticized the shift as undervaluing university
faculty and marginalizing the often underpaid and unstable population of contingent
faculty. Amacher and Meiners (2004) just as effectively defended the change in
faculty makeup as a part of necessary reform in the tenure structure, arguing that
the traditional tenure structure contributes to lower quality research and teaching.
Regardless of whether the change is an improvement, such a drastic alteration in the
status of faculty brings structural transformation. The main change is basic, in that
those faculty who are tenured or tenure-track are often outnumbered in their
departments, thus changing the cultural dynamics of an institution. Another arena in
which this shift is evident is in governance, as there has been some debate regarding
the participation of NTT faculty in governance. In their landmark study, Baldwin and
Chronister (2001) conducted a thorough analysis of the situation of NTT faculty,
utilizing data from the National Survey of Postsecondary Faculty, a survey of a
variety of institutions, a review of institutional policy documents, and site visits to
twelve institutions representative of the overall sample. Their research found that
fewer than half of NTT faculty were permitted to participate in campus government,
with much lower representation at research and doctoral universities. This can
contribute to a loss of dedication to institutional mission, as NTT faculty not
involved in institutional level affairs can easily lose sight of the global picture. This is
even truer for part-time faculty, who are often juggling several part-time
appointments and likely feel no loyalty to an individual institution (B. Johnson,
29

2003). A qualitative analysis of contingent faculty, including interviews and
document analysis at 30 institutions that are working toward improving conditions
for this group as well as observation of public list-servs, found a number of
challenges, but provided strategies and potential for creation of a single faculty,
including regular and contingent faculty (Kezar & Sam, 2013).
While there have been many attempts to analyze the policies surrounding
part-time and NTT appointments, there still exists no true standard. The AAUP
advocates for this group, lumped together with adjuncts, teaching assistants,
postdocs, and others, as contingent faculty, but advocacy for a group with limited
rights and institutional regard has proven to be a challenge. However these
concerns are eventually addressed, it does not appear that the shift toward this new
population of faculty will reverse.
Shared Governance
Shared governance has also been a target on its own. Typically in higher
education there exists a system in which faculty have a say in administrative
decisions through a body often known as Faculty Senate, and in which they have
final decision making authority for curricular issues. Generally it has been
acknowledged as positive, as decision making can be informed and well-balanced.
However, this too has been criticized. Even for full-time, tenured or tenure-track
faculty, it can be difficult to fully understand the complexity of the governance of an
institution:

30

â¦many observers contend that faculty lack the necessary information,
training and/or education, and professional disposition to be effective,
efficient participants in a governance process which must focus on
fundamental issues of a mission, structure, programs, people, and resource
allocation with a sense of urgency and decisiveness. (Longin, 2002, p. 214).
For contingent faculty, there is even greater concern, although for the opposite
reason. They have not been systematically included in shared governance, and it is
generally the opinion of both opponents and defenders of the shift toward
contingent faculty that this can only hurt the shared governance system (Baldwin &
Chronister, 2001; Chait, 2002; Cross & Goldenberg, 2009).
Shifting Priorities: Teaching or Research
As the status of faculty shifts, priorities often change as well; additionally
shifting priorities are a part of the reason for changes in faculty status. While some
NTT faculty are hired specifically for research purposes, many more are hired
exclusively to teach, and part-time or adjunct faculty rarely have any support for
research and professional development (B. Johnson, 2003). Teaching, research, and
service have long been the three pillars of the faculty role, with teaching and
research taking priority. However, the emphasis placed on either teaching or
research has been the source of debate for decades. The current trend is a shift
toward demand for faculty to focus their efforts on teaching, partly because of the
demands of students and administrators, but also because of a decline in funding for

31

research in many disciplines (Altbach, 2005). Additionally, the scholarship of
teaching and learning, first outlined by Boyer (1991), makes an eloquent case for
the critical role of teaching in the pursuit of scholarship. This is not consistently
applied across disciplines or institutional type, as high research productivity is still
associated with prestige, but research is once again becoming the domain of the
premier research institution as teaching becomes more highly regarded elsewhere.
However, this shift is far from complete, and may not be permanent. Link,
Swann, and Bozeman (2008) showed in their quantitative study of scientists and
engineers at 150 extensive research universities that faculty still spend slightly
more time on research than on teaching, and other research has shown that while
faculty are spending more time on research, they also spend more time on teaching
(June & Mangan, 2011; Millem, Berger, & Dey, 2000). In terms of faculty perceptions
of their roles, there is clearly a trend toward a priority on teaching. The Ithaka
instituteâs study of faculty asked if they thought of themselves as primarily a
teacher, a researcher, or somewhere in between. While a third ranked themselves as
somewhere in between (33.4%), a much higher percentage ranked themselves as
teachers (40.5%) more than researchers (24.7%) (Schonfeld & Housewright, 2010).
Tenure
While legislators and students are interested in how faculty spend their time
for reasons of perceived worth, faculty themselves must carefully manage their time
in order to ensure that they are meeting the requirements for tenure. The tenure

32

system has come under attack many times, notably in the 1970s and again in the
1990s, by students and community members who believed that tenure promoted
and encouraged mediocrity. Major changes to the system did not occur during either
of these periods, other than a partial implementation of post-tenure review
(Altbach, 2005). Today, tenure is under attack from a source closer to home: faculty
and universities themselves (Byrne, 1997; Chait, 2002; Magrath, 1997; Riley, 2011;
Ruch, 2001). However, it is not always the case that these critics of the tenure
system argue for the complete abolition of the system. It is not uncommon to find
advocates for tenure reform arguing for structural change in the university itself
(Chait, 2002), or at least just changes to the system (Amacher & Meiners, 2004). The
core of what tenure advocates promote is academic freedom, while those who
would abolish the tenure system argue that there are better ways to defend the
rights of faculty. Even though there have not yet been any direct changes to the
tenure system, the shift to contingent faculty may eventually make this argument
inconsequential.
Distance, Online, and For-Profit Education
Just as economic concerns and the subsequent rise of contingent faculty
instituted a drastic shift in the structure of the faculty, the current rise of distance
education, online education, and for-profit colleges is having a similar effect. The
shift in venue is a part of the shift in status, but there are other implications as well.
As institutions push for more online and distance education programs, they are

33

more likely to require their faculty to integrate technology-based teaching methods
into their coursework (Gappa et al., 2007). This has changed the face of how faculty
teach, and has increased demands on faculty to add online course development to
their pedagogical skillsets. Kim and Bonk (2006) found that among the more than
500 surveyed individuals âbelieved to have relevant experience with and insights
into the factors affecting the present and future state of online education,â (p. 24)
the ability to develop or plan a high-quality online course was the most important
skill for an instructor in this area. The development of Massively Open Online
Courses (MOOCs) are a part of this movement toward more online education, as
faculty work toward development of these courses. Some for-profit institutions have
demonstrated the viability of a completely different model of faculty life: the
complete abolishment of tenure and faculty governance. In most for-profit
institutions, the tenure structure does not exist. This is not surprising, as most of the
early critics of the tenure system came from the business world, and these are the
men and women leading for-profit colleges and universities (B. Johnson, 2003). It is
likely that this trend will continue, as more colleges and universities recruit their
leadership from outside of academia.
Interdisciplinary Research
A final trend that has the potential for a major structural shift is an increase
in interdisciplinary research. As it becomes more apparent that this type of research
is both useful and profitable, more researchers seek opportunities for this type of

34

research and more institutions have begun to include it as a part of their
institutional mission (Brint, Turk-Bicakci, Proctor, & Murphy, 2009; Feller, 2006). In
many cases, interdisciplinary research includes faculty from disciplines within the
same general area. In this instance, it is not likely to cause many major changes.
However, as more partnerships develop between previously siloed units within an
institution, those silos may begin to break down. The typical university structure,
with academic units loosely coupled into a larger institution, could become much
more closely tied together (Feller, 2006; Hackett, 2000; Rhoten, 2004). Colleges and
universities have started to build interdisciplinary labs, with faculty assigned in the
same space from two or more units that might never have spoken in a more
traditional lab. SÃ¡ (2008) set forth a proposal for completely altering the structure
of American higher education to reduce the barriers to interdisciplinary research.
While he recognized that structural change is more likely to occur at the
departmental level, SÃ¡ advocates for incentive grants, steering structures, and
changes to the faculty recruitment and evaluation in order to support
interdisciplinarity at the institutional level. Currently, only one major institution,
Rockefeller University, is organized with interdisciplinarity at its core, rather than
as an added level of structure on top of the traditional disciplinary arrangement
(Abbott, 2001; Hollingsworth & Hollingsworth, 2000).

Academic Status of Librarians
While National Center for Educational Statistics data shows that the overall
decline in full-time employment for faculty is not currently reflected in library
staffing (D. M. Davis, 2011), many of the current discussions of changes among
faculty in higher education do apply. The Association of College and Research
Libraries advocates for librarians to hold faculty status. Their standards state that
âcollege and university libraries should adopt an academic form of governance
similar in manner and structure to other faculties on campusâ (2007). Because many
librarians hold tenure, the structure faces similar scrutiny to that of other faculty,
and they are a part of discussions surrounding the continuing relevance of shared
governance, shifting priorities, tenure, and the impact of new models for higher
education. However, for librarians, the criticism is even bolder. Many opponents of
faculty status for librarians argue that librarians do not meet the standards to be
faculty (McGowan & Dow, 1995) and one academic librarian referred to faculty
status for librarians a âmockery of the professionâ (Cronin, 2001). In Australia,
academic status for librarians ended in the late 1980s (Allen, 2011), but in the
United States, research and the debate on status has been a source of contention in
the field for many decades (Allen, 2011; Church, 2003; Cook, 1981; Cronin, 2001;
Dunn, 2013; Farkas, 2005; McAnally, 1957; Savage, 1982; Welch & Mozenter, 2006).
Some believe that all academic librarians should be regularly appointed
tenured/tenure-track faculty, while others believe librarians should simply be

36

professional or administrative staff. Many librarians fall somewhere in the middle
and are a part of the contingent faculty group.
A number of small-scale studies have been conducted in an attempt to
determine the depth and breadth of faculty status during a snapshot in time (Bolger
& Smith, 2006; Lowry, 1993; Park & Riggs, 1993; Vix & Buckman, 2012), whether
other faculty in an institution believe librarians should have some form of faculty
status (Budd & Coutant, 1981; Cook, 1981; Divay, Ducas, & Michaud-Oystryk, 1987;
R. T. Ivey, 1994; Oberg, Schleiter, & Van Houten, 1989; Wyss, 2010), and two have
analyzed the psychological and political framework surrounding the issue
(Christiansen et al., 2004; Fleming-May & Douglass, 2014). Samples, parameters,
and findings varied greatly between these studies, forming no solid patterns. Even
where faculty status exists for librarians, there are many ways it is defined. Bolin
(2008a, 2008b) conducted two extensive analyses of the different status types of
academic librarians, primarily at larger institutions. She analyzed existing data,
primarily on library websites, and described and categorized the way librarians are
classified at American research libraries. According to Bolin, Librarians generally fit
into one of four categories: faculty with professorial ranks, faculty with other ranks
with tenure, faculty with other ranks without tenure, and non-faculty (professional
or academic staff).
The arguments supporting tenure for librarians focus on equating the role
librarians provide in supporting the academic missions of colleges and universities
37

with the role of regular faculty (Coker, vanDuinkerken, & Bales, 2010; Murray-Rust,
2005; Welch & Mozenter, 2006), although some also look at the importance of
tenure in elevating the perception of librarians in the minds of regular faculty
(Badke, 2005). Some opponents argue that academic status or tenure are
unimportant (Applegate, 1993; Farkas, 2005), while others argue that faculty status
is not appropriate, as the additional pressures prevent them from performing their
work as librarians (Anthony, 2010; Biggs, 1981; Carver, 2005; Cronin, 2001; C. M.
Johnson & Lindsay, 2006). The actual impact of tenure and faculty status on the
success of an institution is not firm. One study found that tenure for librarians could
partially predict the quality of an institution (Meyer, 1999), while another found the
opposite (Bolger & Smith, 2006). Because of this polarization on the topic of faculty
status for librarians, it is unlikely that a resolution is forthcoming.
The Liaison
Discipline comes into play most directly with libraries in the liaison
relationship, in which librarians are assigned to individual academic departments.
In larger libraries, there may be multiple liaisons assigned to a single department,
but more often an individual librarian is responsible for working with several
departments. Liaison programs vary widely, with different roles and
responsibilities. Their single uniting factor is communication, but there are a
number of additional roles that are common (Henry, 2012).

38

One common role of liaisons is in support of collection development. While
some institutions employ bibliographers whose responsibilities are strongly
focused in this area, it is more commonly a single part of a liaisonâs list of
responsibilities. This can include selection of collections, removal of material from
collections, and policy development relating to library resources (Liaison with Users
Committee Collection Development and Evaluation Section, 2010). A less common
role of a liaison is curriculum development, including supporting academic units in
accreditation processes, integrating information literacy ideals into course design,
and involving librarians in instruction through affiliate and adjunct appointments
(Rader, 1999; Winner, 1998). Pritchard (2010) discussed how a librarian might
leverage her liaison role as a means to exerting more influence over curriculum
development.
Information Literacy
The vast majority of the library literature regarding the role of the liaison
looks at the liaisonâs role in research and instruction. This includes services like
reference help and individual consultations, classroom instruction both as a
supplement to a credit-course and as a stand-alone course, and the development of
library instruction materials. In this role, the liaison is most effectively able to
support the research and instructional mission of a university through information
literacy instruction. Information literacy is one of the primary goals of academic
libraries outlined by the Association for College and Research Libraries (ACRL), and

39

âis the set of skills needed to find, retrieve, analyze, and use informationâ (American
Library Association, 2011). For years, case studies on finding ways to provide
information literacy instruction has been a primary focus of the general body of
library literature related to liaisons (Cohen, 1995; Doskatsch, 2003; Glynn & Wu,
2003; R. Ivey, 2003; Owusu-Ansah, 2004).
A relatively new development in the instructional role of the liaison
relationship is embedding. While there are a number of types of embedding,
librarians fulfilling this role are generally fully integrated into a class, learning
community, research team, or other group, which allows for their expertise to be
utilized more fully. They provide immediate, personalized service based on the
needs expressed by individuals in that group, and generally have a presence
throughout the course of a class or research project (Carlson & Kneale, 2011; Gilbert
& Bennett, 2009; Lindstrom & Shonrock, 2006).
Evaluation of Liaison Programs
As budgets diminish and demands on libraries increase, many libraries are
beginning to evaluate the future of their liaison programs. In an attempt to place a
greater emphasis on the individual relationships between liaisons and other faculty,
some libraries are expanding their program to include non-academic units (Dahl,
2007). Others are rethinking the liaison program in general. One common means of
analyzing and determining the future of a liaison program is a program evaluation
(Tennant, Cataldo, Sherwill-Navarro, & Jesano, 2006; Yang, 2000). Sanders, Welch,

40

and Mozenter (2000) reported on an evaluation of individual student and faculty
needs at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, and followed this up with a
complete restructuring of their program. In two separate articles in the same
journal, Tennant, Cataldo, Jesano, and Sherwill-Navarro (2006) looked at both the
liaison program and the liaison librarians. The authors first evaluated their program
in general, and then evaluated whether subject-specific credentials made an
individual liaison more successful. Finally, some evaluations attempt to determine if
a liaison program is sustainable at all. The embedded librarian model is frequently
evaluated in this way, because there is much concern that the amount of time spent
building relationships is not sustainable or applicable on a broader, university-wide
scale (Rodwell & Fairbairn, 2008; Tumbleson & Burke, 2010).
Perceptions of Libraries and Librarians
Whatever the nature of relationships between librarians and other faculty,
there is library literature addressing perceptions of that relationship. Most of the
literature looking at teaching faculty perceptions of librarians focuses on case
studies illustrating the relationships related to collaboration, particularly library
instruction (Bury, 2011; Cannon, 1994; Doskatsch, 2003; Ducas & Michaud-Oystryk,
2004; Haynes, 1996; R. T. Ivey, 1994; Yang, 2000). Notably, Manuel, Beck, and
Molloy (2005) interviewed 21 faculty at their institution who utilized librarianprovided instruction in their classes, and found a mainly positive interpretation of
the relationship. One aspect that the authors addressed was why faculty members

41

choose to have librarians teach the library instruction classes, rather than
attempting to do so themselves, and they learned that faculty members who use
library instruction view the librarians as experts. In a more recent study looking at
nursing educators and librarians, Schulte (2009) found in a survey of 112 nursing
educators in Florida and Indiana that both librarians and faculty were open to
collaboration, but that faculty tended to view this collaboration in a narrow
framework, limited to traditional library services like library instruction. Because
librarians often wish to expand their role on campuses and in collaboration with
regular faculty through greater involvement in the teaching and process of research,
this perception can create a barrier for librarians. Badke (2005) looked at these
relationships from a cultural framework, and he contends that faculty culture is a
barrier that prevents librarians from fulfilling their goal of creating information
literate students.
Some research exists looking at how librarians perceive their relationships
with faculty. Older commentary and research discusses at great length the perceived
conflict between librarians and other faculty (Biggs, 1981; Kellogg, 1987; Lanning,
1988; Marchant, 1969; Weaver-Meyers, 2002). More recently, Christiansen et al.
(2004) looked at these relationships directly, in a series of brief surveys, interviews,
and focus groups with both faculty and librarians at public and private institutions.
It discovered that librarians generally felt marginalized in their relationships with
regular faculty, while faculty tended to have positive perceptions of that
42

relationship. In their study, Given and Julien (2005) found similar concepts. They
looked at list-serv postings, then provided an analysis of perceived relationships
between teaching faculty and librarians from the perspective of the librarian. It
found that many librarians hold a negative view of the faculty in their institutions,
and that librarians overall projected âimages of troublesome, arrogant faculty, who
have little understanding of librariansâ rolesâ (p. 36). A similar but more
optimistically stated recent article proposed that librarians should âcease being at
the service of facultyâ to develop more collegial relationships (Meulemans & Carr,
2013, p. 81).
Disciplinary Differences
There is very little research regarding how faculty in disparate disciplines
use and perceive the library. Much of it focuses on information literacy, including
two studies at the same Canadian university, nearly a decade apart (Bury, 2011;
Cannon, 1994). Additional research relating to perceptions of libraries and
librarians delineated disciplinary differences, but by the general disciplinary
groupings of humanities, sciences, social sciences, and interdisciplinary studies
(Cook, 1981; J. Y. Davis & Bentley, 1979; Heterick & Schonfeld, 2004; Housewright &
Schonfeld, 2008; Housewright, Schonfeld, & Wulfson, 2012; Schonfeld &
Housewright, 2010; Weetman DaCosta, 2010) rather than more specific disciplinary
analysis.

43

While the differences in how faculty in diverse disciplines use and perceive
the library are not well-documented, there are a number of studies delineating
disciplinary differences in other areas. Most utilize some type of classification
scheme to group similar disciplines (Braxton & Hargens, 1996). The most commonly
used is the model developed by Biglan in 1973 which utilized a three-dimensional
model, although the two most commonly cited dimensions are soft/hard, and
pure/applied. This model has been used to examine disciplinary differences in
technology adoption (Guidry & BrckaLorenz, 2010), research methods (Alise, 2008),
retention (Barnes, Agago, & Coombs, 1998; Xu, 2008), teaching and grading (Barnes,
Bull, Campbell, & Perry, 2001; Braxton, Olsen, & Simmons, 1998; Colbeck, 1998;
Nelson Laird, Schwarz, Kuh, & Shoup, 2006; Nelson Laird, Shoup, Kuh, & Schwarz,
2008), leadership (Del Favero, 2006; Kekale, 1999), and even conflict and ethics
(Braxton & Bayer, 1999; Hearn & Anderson, 2002; Kidwell & Kidwell, 2008). While
Biglanâs methodology in developing the framework has been questioned, as has its
continuing relevance (Brew, 2003; Gibbons, 1998; Rowland, 2002), it remains a
major part of the literature of disciplinary studies. Another framework researchers
often utilize in classifying discipline was developed by Smart, Feldman, and
Ethington (2000), and is an adaptation from vocational research conducted by John
Holland. This framework is more of a typology, which is useful in its ability to map
disciplines to the following broader areas: Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Creative,
Social, Enterprising, and Conventional. Research using the framework based on
44

Holland includes studies on diversity (Umbach, 2006), socialization of graduate
students (Thompson, 2003), technology (Weisenfeld & Ott, 2011), and teaching
methods (Smart, Ethington, Umbach, & Rocconi, 2009; Smart & Thompson, 2001;
Smart & Umbach, 2007; Umbach, 2007). While these typologies are useful, the
interest of this study is in specific discipline, a less common type of analysis but one
that is reflective of the way libraries structure their work with faculty (Seifert &
Umbach, 2008). Jones (2012) cites the importance of delving deeper into the more
finite differences between disciplines, as âthe assumption of most classification
models is that faculty within these sub-disciplines have very similar values and
attitudes. This, however, might not always be the caseâ (p. 23).
Summary
Despite the seemingly unchanging overall organizational structure in higher
education, individual areas of colleges and universities are facing a period of drastic
change. New priorities, different populations, and fewer resources have forced parts
of the academic institution to grow and change, sometimes slowly and in other
times very quickly. Economics and technology have brought about major changes in
faculty roles within the broader organizational structure, and in the core structure
of academic libraries. As librarians work with faculty to be a part of this evolution,
they must have a better understanding of their use and perceptions, and use clear
evidence in decision making to shape a positive future. This research adds to that
evidence by looking at the intersection of these facets in a study of how faculty use

45

and perceive the library, which in turn provides further guidance in organizational
change and development throughout libraries.

CHAPTER 3
METHODOLOGY

Introduction
The objective of this study is to determine how a faculty memberâs discipline
is related to their perceptions and use of their university campus libraries. This
study aims to use descriptive data to assess differences between disciplines on the
basis of six factors relating to perceptions and use of the library. Additionally, this
study utilizes comparisons between a number of demographic factors including age,
sex, title, experience, and personal perception of their primary role (as a teacher,
researcher, or both) to explore whether they are significant. The six factors relating
to faculty perceptions and use of the library are as follows, and defined in detail
below:
Perceptions of Libraries
1. Perception of the current role of the library;
2. Perceived dependence on the library; and
3. Perceptions of the continuing relevance of libraries.
Use of Libraries
1. Frequency of information seeking and use;
2. Level of comfort with digital material (e-books and electronic journals); and

47

3. Use of library resources (catalogs and databases) as a starting point for their
academic research.
Hypothesis
This study aims to address the following hypothesis: Differences in
perceptions of the library and use of the library exist between disciplines, as well as
when considering demographic characteristics including age, sex, title, experience,
and primary role as a research or teacher. In this research, perceptions include
perceptions of the current role of the library, perceived dependence on the library,
and negative perceptions of the continuing relevance of the library; use includes the
frequency with which one engages in information seeking behaviors, level of
comfort with digital material, and use of library resources for research.
Research Design
This study will utilize data from the Ithaka S+R 2009 Faculty Survey,
henceforth referred to as Ithaka 2009 (Schonfeld & Housewright, 2011). The survey
is conducted by Ithaka S+R, a non-profit research and consulting firm focused on the
ongoing transition to digital formats in academia and publishing. Every three years,
researchers with Ithaka S+R revise and distribute the Faculty Survey to a sample of
faculty at colleges and universities in the United States that grant bachelorâs degrees
or higher, excluding faculty in the health sciences. The researchers utilize a
marketing firm, MDR, to obtain the sample, which is randomly selected from the

48

MDR database. Faculty members in the sample are mailed an introductory letter,
then a survey questionnaire booklet.
Survey Booklets
In 2009, 35,184 faculty were sampled, and 3,023 (8.6%) complete booklets
were returned and included in the final dataset. Two different booklets were
randomly distributed to the sample, with the intent of keeping the overall survey
shorter to encourage completion. The rate at which respondents returned the
booklets was nearly even, with 50.7% (n = 1532) returning booklet A and 49.3% (n
= 1490) returning booklet B. Both groups of respondents had similar sample
demographics in terms of sex, age, and academic rank, as well as discipline. Booklet
A included 66 unique questions (including sub-questions), Booklet B included 14
unique questions, and 64 questions appeared in both booklets. Both surveys asked a
variety of demographic questions, as well as questions in three major areas: the
evolving role of the library, perceptions and comfort relating to the format of
scholarly works, and use and perceptions of institutional repositories. Because
nearly all of the survey questions relating to the questions specific to this research
on perceptions and use of the library were unique to Booklet A, and questions
unique to Booklet B were on issues outside the purview of this research, only the
1532 respondents using Booklet A are included.

49

Ithaka 2009 Report
Schonfeld and Housewright summarized the results of the survey in âFaculty
survey 2009: Key strategic insights for libraries, publishers, and societies,â a 2010
report that addressed three major themes: the changing role of the library, format of
scholarly works, and the importance of scholarly communication. Some of the major
themes included in this study were addressed in the report. However, while it was
offered as a possible branch of analysis for the study, the researchers did not
address the differences between individual disciplines, just the general groupings.
Differences may exist between faculty in specific disciplines within the general
disciplinary groupings used in the Ithaka 2009 report, and this research aims to
determine how distinct those differences may be.
Analysis
SPSS is the primary data analysis tool for this study, and is supplemented by
images generated in Tableau data visualization software. The study data files are
from the Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR)
repository. The research utilizes principal component analysis, a form of factor
analysis, to develop several constructs based upon the data in the Ithaka 2009
instrument. These constructs help to synthesize the lengthy instrument into a series
of themes relevant to this research. Descriptive statistics including averages and
95% confidence intervals, a statistic showing a range of values that will contain the

50

populationâs true mean 95% of the time, describe the disciplines for development of
a profile and examination of differences for hypothesis testing.
Study Sample
The population for this study is non-librarian faculty members at colleges
and universities in the United States that offer bachelorâs degrees or higher,
excluding faculty in the health sciences. Survey respondents were asked for general
demographic and institutional data, as well as about their role in the institution and
for some basic information about their career. Because the sample is random, it is
likely to be representative of the overall population (Warner, 2008). While there
were two separate booklets utilized in the study, only using respondents who
completed Booklet A answered the questions relevant to this research, reducing the
sample (N = 1532). Visual comparisons of the age, rank, and sex of the sub-sample
used in this research to the overall faculty population as reported by the Integrated
Postsecondary Education Data System (U.S. Department of Education National
Center for Education Statistics, 2009) show that the sample is similar to the
population with slightly higher sampling of the older demographics and more
advanced ranks, as well as some difference between sex from the overall population
(see Table 1).

The majority of the sample respondents were male (55.48%, n = 850), and
the academic rank of professor was the most common (37.21%, n = 570).
Additionally, respondents provided their age and experience. Respondentsâ age
ranged from 22 to 87 and on average had been at their current institution for 14.02
years and in their field for 22.91, although outliers and unrealistic data were
excluded. The mean age of survey respondents was 51.26, with over half (55.48%, n
= 850) 50 or older (see Table 2).

Upon examination of cross-tabulated data, it is apparent that while the age
and years of experience increase progressively as expected through the traditional
ranks of tenure-track faculty, this is not the case for those identifying as adjunct
faculty, lecturers, or other. Figure 2 shows a scatterplot of age by years in the field.
Assistant professors ( ) tend to be clustered along the lower end of the
age/experience, full professors ( ) are more clustered near the top end, with
associate professors ( ) near the middle.

Figure 3 shows adjunct professors, lecturers, and those who marked NA and
Other on the same scale as Figure 2. The clustering evident in the scatterplot for the

55

This seems to indicate that there is a very wide range of respondents in these four
classifications. Compounded with the fact that these four classifications are
generally considered together in the literature, for the purposes of this study, the
ranks of lecturer, adjunct professor, other, and NA are recoded into the single
classification of Other/Contingent faculty. A cross-tabulation of age, experience, and
rank (Table 3) further demonstrates the logical progression through the ranks from
assistant to full professor as well as descriptive statistics for the newly created
âOther/Contingentâ group.

Another common distinction among faculty is their perception of their
primary role, either as teacher or as a researcher. Approximately 4 of 10
respondents identified more as a teacher than as a researcher (41.58%, n = 637),
although the largest single group of respondents identified as equally a researcher
and a teacher (Table 4).

Interestingly, when self-identification as a teacher or researcher is tabulated
against title (Figure 4), it appears that identification as a researcher drops at the
rank of associate professor. Because research productivity has an established
correlation of higher rank indicating higher research productivity (HardrÃ©, Beesley,
Miller, & Pace, 2011; Tien & Blackburn, 1996), this may merit further analysis.

Primary Variable: Academic Discipline
The primary variable of interest for this study is academic discipline. Though
respondents to the Ithaka 2009 survey were directly asked to provide discipline,
they were able to select as many as they felt appropriate and did not have an
opportunity to rank their primary discipline. Most chose one discipline (n = 1135,
74.09%), but respondents selected as many as 9 (see Table 5).

Because there is no way of knowing the primary discipline for those who selected
more than one, this research distinguishes only those respondents who selected a
single discipline; respondents who selected more than one discipline are a part of
the numerical analysis, but are not a part of the discussion. Additionally, the most
selected discipline among respondents with only one discipline was âOtherâ (n =
143), which is problematic because these respondents cannot be tied to a single

59

group. Thus, while this group is included in analysis, it is of limited usefulness in
addressing the goals of this research. Because descriptive statistics did not show any
appreciable difference between the âOtherâ respondents, and those selecting
multiple disciplines, they are analyzed as a single large group. Finally, the area
studies disciplines (African, African-American, American, Asian, India, Latin
American, Middle East, and Slavic/Russian Studies) had very small samples sizes
individually, and thus have been merged into a single discipline so that they might
be included in this analysis. Table 6 lists the frequencies for individuals who only
selected one discipline as they are analyzed in this research.

Current Role of the Library
One aim of the Ithaka 2009 research was to discern the respondentsâ views of
the modern libraryâs role. Because sub-questions divided the question regarding the
current role into separate questions for each of the five roles, this is studied as five
separate variables. Earlier studies from Ithaka S+R asked faculty how important it

61

was to them that their library serve as a starting point for locating information for
their research (âGatewayâ), a purchaser of resources they need (âBuyerâ), and as a
repository interested in archiving, preserving, and tracking resources (âArchiveâ)
(Heterick & Schonfeld, 2004; Housewright & Schonfeld, 2008). In addition to these
three roles, the 2009 iteration of the study also asked if respondents found it
important for their libraries to support and facilitate their teaching (âTeaching
Supportâ), and to provide active support that helps increase the productivity of their
research as well (âResearch Supportâ). Both the teaching and research support roles
are relatively new for most libraries (Frank et al., 2001; Glynn & Wu, 2003; OwusuAnsah, 2004). The varying importance of each of these roles are analyzed as a part
of the profiles. For each question, respondents were given a scale of one to six, with
a score of one identified as âNot at all importantâ and six as âExtremely important.â
Because each of these individual roles of the library are of interest to this research,
they are not a part of construct development in the principal component analysis.
Demographic Characteristics
While this study aims to assess how faculty in different disciplines use and
perceive the library, other demographic characteristics may influence how faculty
use and perceive the library. The Ithaka 2009 instrument includes several questions
related to these characteristics, including age, sex, title, experience, and primary role
(as a researcher or as a teacher). Some characteristics like age, title, and experience
are likely to be highly intercorrelated. Because of this, a variety descriptive analyses

62

are necessary to describe the interplay between these characteristics, and they have
been examined along with the variables relating to use and perception of the library
(Field, 2009).
Ethical Considerations
To ensure maximum protection of human subjects, the University of
Missouri-Kansas City research office reviewed this study and found it to be not
human subjects research (see Appendix B for determination). All data was originally
collected anonymously, and the data is limited in such a way as to make it
impossible to determine any respondentâs identity. Additionally, the data is
available to all members of the ICPSR at http://doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR30001.v2,
thus it is not a protected dataset.

CHAPTER 4
RESULTS

This chapter includes a description of the analysis and results for this study,
including the initial data screening for missing data and assumptions, the Principal
Component (PC) Analysis used to develop constructs for the final descriptive
analysis, and the complete descriptive analysis to answer the overarching research
questions:
1. How do faculty members in disparate disciplines use the academic
library?
2. How do faculty members in disparate disciplines perceive the
academic library?
A brief discussion of the results for the descriptive analysis is included in this
chapter, and numerous tables and figures illustrate the responses of faculty in each
discipline as well as for the demographic characteristics.
Data Screening
Missing Data
Missing data exists throughout the data set, and upon initial observation, it
appears that the missing data are generally random. Frequency distribution tables
and a visual analysis reinforce this, as does the SPSS Missing Values Analysis.
Seventy-seven cases did not include discipline, and as this is the major dependent

64

variable for the study, those cases are not a part of this analysis. The majority of the
analysis in this study is descriptive and unlikely to be skewed by missing data, so no
missing values have been replaced (Warner, 2008). For the principal component
(PC) analysis, cases with missing values were excluded listwise (Field, 2009). To
ensure that these missing values did not alter the results, a second set of analysis
included SPSS Missing Values Analysis imputation using EM (expectationmaximization) estimation, but there was no difference in the results.
Screening for Assumptions
Principal component analysis, the first statistical test to be conducted in this
research, requires that a number of assumptions be met. Univariate outliers, which
are scores that are far different from most others on a single variable, were
examined using frequency distributions and standardized z scores. Because z scores
are standardized scores expressed in standard deviations, it is much easier to
identify those that are far away from the mean. Three outliers for age were
identified, and because they were illogical next to the other responses, they were
imputed with the mean for cases with the same title. Next, variables were checked
for normality by examining skewness and kurtosis. Scatterplots were utilized to
check for linearity for each component. Finally, an R. correlation matrix found that
the correlations differ significantly from zero, important for analysis as there needs
to be some (but not high) correlation between variables for the PC analysis (Warner,
2008).

65

Principal Component Analysis
The process for defining the variables, including reduction of factors for the
development of constructs, is defined below. While some of the variables of interest
for this study were direct questions in the Ithaka 2009 instrument and are
addressed in the methodology chapter (current roles of libraries, discipline and all
demographic characteristics), there is a high number of variables in the study that
address faculty library use and perceptions of libraries (n = 47) that are of interest.
Principal component (PC) analysis, which is similar to factor analysis, attempts to
distill a large number of variables into a smaller number of latent constructs
(Warner, 2008). For this analysis, the default criterion was set to retain only
components with eigenvalues greater than 1, with varimax rotation and suppressing
variables that had coeffecients with an absolute value below 0.4. The Kaiser-Meyer
Olkin measure verified sampling adequacy (KMO = .83) which is considered
âsuperbâ (Field, 2009). Bartlettâs test of sphericity Ï2 (406) = 28652.83, p < .001 also
indicate that correlations are sufficient for PC Analysis. An initial analysis of all 47
variables indicated 18 factors, although not all were directly related to the interests
of this study. Based on the initial results, additional models excluding variables and
components that were not as directly related to the research questions revealed the
same components as the initial model, but with higher coefficients and greater
significance to the research questions. The final model (Table 7) indicated that the
31 selected variables formed 7 separate components with eigenvalues greater than

66

1 that fit well with the literature and research questions. These variables are listed
in full in Appendix A. Additional analyses utilizing maximum-likelihood extraction
and direct oblimin rotation produced identical results and are thus not reproduced
here.
In the final factor solution after rotation, the seven components accounted
for 78.6% of the variance in the dataset. Communalities for variables were generally
high, ranging from a low of .70 for library catalogs and discovery tools becoming
less important because of free online access, to .92 for current dependence on the
library for research. None of the items were complex, as none of the items had large
loadings on multiple factors. Each component is discussed in detail below including
the relation to the hypotheses.

Use of Libraries
Frequency of information seeking and use. Component 1 is also one of the
most complex, as it includes a larger number of variables with high correlations
(ranging from .90 to .72). These include searching for information within oneâs
discipline (question 7.5), searching for information outside of oneâs
discipline(question 7.4), and specific use of materials: using non-article journal
materials (question 7.8), using electronic collections to prepare for teaching
(question 7.6), accessing known journal articles(question 7.1), using references to
locate other materials (question 7.9), browsing online tables of contents (question
7.2), applying mining to journal collections (question 7.7), and giving assignments
that utilize electronic collections (question 7.3). While this seems to be a disparate
list of a number of items, they all relate to the use of information for research and
teaching. Each was phrased in such a way as to ask frequency, rather than
importance, and thus Component 1 is entitled Frequency of Information Seeking and
Use.
Level of comfort with electronic journals and books. It is a common
assumption in libraries that faculty in different disciplines have different
preferences for the format of their material, particularly when it relates to electronic
formats (Camacho & Spackman, 2011; Clark, 2013; McClamroch, 2011; Shepherd &
Arteaga, 2014). Questions from the Ithaka 2009 instrument relating to comfort with
digital materials loaded together into two separate components, one relating to

69

journals (Component 2) and the other relating to books (Component 7). Because
electronic books are still an emerging format, this separation is logical. The Ithaka
2009 report found that âunlike the case of journals, where many faculty members
are willing to imagine that within a few years, electronic surrogates will largely
replace print originals, virtually all respondents dismiss the notion that e-books will
displace print originals in a relatively short timeframeâ (Schonfeld & Housewright,
2010, p. 23). Even with this separation, there are a number of questions regarding
the respondentsâ comfort with print or electronic formats. Several parts of question
3 (a, b, c, e, and m) ask a range of questions relating to the respondentâs thoughts on
cancelling or discarding print journals in favor of electronic journals, and each of
these loaded into Component 2 with coefficients ranging from .83 to .76. Fewer
questions address the issue of electronic books, but questions 5a-8, and 5b-9 which
refer to the importance of electronic books to oneâs research now and into the
future both loaded into Component 7 with coefficients of .91 for both. For this study,
these two separate components are referred to as Level of Comfort with Electronic
Journals and Level of Comfort with Electronic Books.
Use of library catalogs in the research process. This component brings
together four variables relating to importance of online library catalogs in research.
Four separate questions directly asked this, relating to catalogs at oneâs own library
(questions as well as other libraries, and relating to current and future importance.

70

With coefficients ranging from .84 to .80 and clear commonality, this component is
referred to as Use of Library Catalogs in the Research Process.
Use of library databases in the research process. Another related
component looking at a different type of resource libraries provide loaded into
Component 4. Four questions, two relating to use of abstracting and indexing
databases (questions 5a.6 and 5b.6) and databases of academic journals (questions
5a.5 and 5b.5) now and in the future comprise this construct, with coefficients
ranging from .86 to .76. This component is henceforth referred to as Use of Library
Databases in the Research Process.
Perceptions of the Library
The bulk of variables relating to this aspect of the hypotheses are taken
directly from the Ithaka 2009 instrument, as discussed in Chapter 3. Those
questions related to the current roles of the library as Gateway, Buyer, Archive,
Teaching Support, and Research Support. However, the PC analysis resulted in the
development of two additional constructs in this area.
Negative perceptions of the continuing relevance of libraries. This
construct, Component 5, includes three separate questions asking respondents if
library funding should be redirected (question 3f), if librarians are becoming less
important (question 3j), and if library catalogs are becoming irrelevant (question
3l). These questions clearly address perceived lack of importance of the library and
librarians. It has long been the prediction of demagogues that because of electronic

71

access to information, libraries will become irrelevant in the near future (Hellman,
2010; Lancaster, 1978; Sullivan, 2011; Technology Review, 2010), making this
concept relevant both statistically and in the literature. Thus, this component is
entitled Negative Perceptions of the Continuing Relevance of Libraries.
Perceived dependence on the library. Two additional questions related to
perceptions of the library loaded into Component 6, with high coefficients of .92 and
.91. These asked directly how dependent one was on their library for the research
they conduct, first now (question 4a), then in five years (question 4b).
Hypothesis Analysis
Because this research aims to determine disciplinary differences on a variety
of aspects relating to library perception and use, each of these aspects is addressed
separately. The large number disciplines and relatively small samples sizes within
each of these indicate the use of descriptive statistics for analysis, and comparison
of 95% confidence intervals, a statistic showing a range of values that will contain
the populationâs true mean 95% of the time, is an effective way to identify
disciplinary differences.
Use of Libraries
Frequency of information seeking and use. This component is comprised
of variables addressing how often one uses information. Because of the nature of
these constructs, the mean for the component is zero, with a relatively small range.

72

Examination of means reveals a narrow range of responses, with most below the
general mean of zero (see Table 8).
From the means, it is apparent that most disciplines had a frequency of
information seeking and use below the mean, excepting only Education (M = .19, SD
= 1.89), Religion (M = .16, SD = 1.90), and Political Science (M = .03, SD = .36). The
group of respondents selecting Other or selecting more than one discipline also had
above average responses (M = .10, SD = 1.42). Additionally, visual examination of
the 95% confidence intervals reveals that those disciplines with responses below
the mean had extremely narrow confidence intervals, indicating that groups with
lower than average means had less variance within their group, while those
approaching or above the mean tended to have broader intervals, indicating greater
variance (see Figure 5).

From the means, it is clear that some disciplines are more comfortable with
electronic journals, with Public Policy/Health Policy (M = .68, SD = 1.14), and
Business (M = .63, SD = .1.01) showing far more comfort than others, although
Public Policy/Health Policy had a very small sample (n = 4) so this data may not be
meaningful. At the other end of the spectrum, Art History (M = -.62, SD = .92) and
Theater (M = -.59, SD = 1.02) have the lowest average scores. The social sciences
disciplines are very mixed on their comfort with electronic journals and the sciences
are generally comfortable with electronic journals exceptions, but the humanities
across the board show less comfort with electronic journals. Visual examination of
the 95% confidence intervals (excluding disciplines with very small samples, n < 5)
demonstrates that while differences exist, most responses across disciplines in this
area will fall within the same general range. Most confidence intervals for this
variable encompass the mean, excepting Art History, Theater, and Literature, for
which the entire 95% confidence interval was below the mean, and Business,
Physics, Engineering, Education, and Psychology, for which the entire confidence
interval is above the mean (see Figure 6). Notably, the upper bound confidence
intervals for the humanities disciplines rarely breach the mean, and those that do
only do so by a small margin.

From the means, it is clear that some disciplines are more comfortable with
electronic books, with Public Policy/Health Policy (M = .49, SD = .90), Education (M
= .44, SD = .87), and Theater (M = .40, SD = 1.06) showing far more comfort than
others, although it is worth noting that Public Policy/Health Policy had a very small
sample (n = 4). At the other end of the spectrum, Philosophy (M = -.62, SD = .92),
Geography (M = -.37, SD = .99) and Physics (M = -.36, SD = .98) have the lowest
average scores. These extreme values are found in a variety of subject areas, thus
there are no clear trends in any of these areas that point toward strong
commonalities in a broad discipline area. Visual examination of the 95% confidence
intervals (excluding disciplines with very small samples, n < 5) show wide intervals
across all disciplines, reflective of a broader dispersion of opinions on this topic.
Most confidence intervals for this variable encompass the mean, except Physics and
Philosophy, for which the entire 95% confidence interval was below the mean, and
Theater and Education, for which the entire confidence interval is above the mean
(see Figure 7).

For this construct, the general disciplinary groupings of humanities and the
sciences do appear to be more similar than for some others. The three disciplines
using library catalogs most frequently, Art History (M = .57, SD = .63), Music (M =
.45, SD = .97), and Literature (M = .39, SD = .83) are all from the humanities, and of
those with the least use of library catalogs, Geology (M = -.67, SD = 1.02), Physics (M
= -.58, SD = 1.13), and Economics (M = -.57, SD = .84), two are from the sciences.
Additionally, all humanities disciplines has means above zero, while all of the
disciplines in the sciences have means below zero. As with other constructs, the
social sciences are mixed.
Visual examination of the 95% confidence intervals (excluding disciplines
with very small samples, n < 5) show wide intervals across all disciplines, reflective
of a broader dispersion of opinions on this topic. Most confidence intervals for this
variable encompass the mean, excepting Geology, Physics, Economics, Biology, and
Law, for which the entire 95% confidence interval was below the mean, and
Religion, Education, History, Art History, and Literature, for which the entire
confidence interval is above the mean (see Figure 8).

From the means in each discipline, it is clear that some disciplines are more
frequent users of library databases, with Sociology (M = .38, SD = .87), Psychology
(M = .33, SD = .70), Business (M = .28, SD = .68), and Education (M = .27, SD = .65)
reporting the highest means. At the other end of the spectrum, Theater (M = -.69, SD
= 1.42), Geography (M = -.52, SD = 1.13), Anthropology (M = -.49, SD = 1.14), and
Music (M = -.48, SD = 1.20) have the lowest means. These extreme values are found
in a variety of subject areas, thus there are no clear trends in any of these areas that
point toward strong commonalities in a broad discipline area. Visual examination of
the 95% confidence intervals (excluding disciplines with very small samples, n < 5)
show wide intervals across most disciplines, reflective of a broader dispersion of
opinions on this topic. The confidence intervals generally narrow as use of library
databases for research increases, indicating that those disciplines are more
consistent in their use of these resources. Most confidence intervals for this variable
encompass the mean, excepting Theater, Geography, and Anthropology, for which
the entire 95% confidence interval was below the mean, and Education, Business,
Psychology, and Sociology, for which the entire confidence interval is above the
mean (see Figure 9).

Figure 9: 95% Confidence Intervals for Use of Library Databases

Demographic analysis. In addition to examining each variable relating to
Use of Libraries by discipline, this study also aims to identify any demographic
differences. Figure 10 demonstrates differences by age, which shows somewhat
distinct patterns. The upper two age categories (70 and older) have higher means
for Frequency of Information Seeking and Use, indicating that this demographic has
greater information needs than others. Additionally, there is a clear decline in level
of comfort with electronic formats as respondents age, with the only variation in
respondents aged 40-49 relating to electronic books. Finally, excepting the youngest
grouping, library catalogs (which generally find print materials) show a steady
increase in use with older demographics, whereas library databases (which
generally find electronic materials) show a steady decrease in use. This is consistent
87

with the findings for level of comfort with electronic materials. Similar results are
evident in respondents when grouped by academic title (Figure 11) and by time
spent in the field (Figure 12).

88

Figure 10: Responses by Age for Library Usage Variables

89

Figure 11: Responses by Academic Title for Library Usage Variables

90

Figure 12: Responses by Years in Field for Library Usage Variables

Another characteristic of respondents that showed differences in responses
for library use was their self-identification as primarily a teacher, primarily a
91

researcher, or some combination. Interestingly, rather than seeing a higher
frequency of information seeking and use for researchers and less for teachers as
might be expected, only respondents identifying equally as teachers and researchers
had a mean score above the overall mean of zero.

Figure 13: Responses by Primary Role for Library Usage Variables

92

Differences by sex also exist in variables relating to library usage. Figure 14
shows mean responses to each library use variable for each men and women,
illustrating that while the difference between mean responses is not great, means
are above the overall average of zero for nearly all variables for men, while they are
universally below that overall average of zero for women.

Perceptions of the Library
Importance of the role of the library as Gateway. This item explores how
important faculty in different disciplines indicate the library to be as the starting
point for research. For this question, respondents were given a scale of one to six,
with a score of one identified as âNot at all importantâ and six as âExtremely
important.â The entire sample (N = 1517) responded with a mean of 4.52, median 5
(see Table 13).
From the means in each discipline, it is clear that some disciplines place
greater emphasis on the role of the library as Gateway, with Womenâs Studies (M =
5.5, SD = .71), Art History (M = 5.19, SD = 1.16), Area Studies (M = 5.13, SD = 1.31),
and Public/Health Policy (M = 5.00, SD = 1.16) all reporting means at or above 5,
although it is worth noting that Public/Health Policy and Womenâs Studies had very
small samples (n = 4 and n = 2, respectively). At the other end of the spectrum,
Physics (M = 3.09, SD = 1.63), Law (M = 3.96, SD = 1.57), Biology (M = 3.93, SD =
1.96), and Economics (M = 3.93, SD = 1.86) all have means below 4. These extreme
values are found in a variety of subject areas, thus there are no clear trends in any of
these areas that point toward strong commonalities in a broad discipline area.
Visual examination of the 95% confidence intervals (excluding disciplines with very
small samples, n < 5) demonstrates that while differences exist, most responses
across disciplines in this area will fall within the same general range. The exceptions
are Physics, which has no overlap with most disciplines, and Education, Area

95

Studies, and Art History, which have no overlap with Biology and Economics (see
Figure 15).

Figure 15: 95% Confidence Intervals for Library as Gateway

Importance of the role of the library as Buyer. Respondents also provided
input on their perception of the importance library in paying for resources they
need, âfrom academic journals to books to electronic databases.â Respondents were
given a scale of one to six, with a score of one identified as âNot at all importantâ and
six as âExtremely important.â The entire sample (N = 1517) responded with a mean
of 5.57, median 6 (see Table 14). This role has consistently been ranked with the
highest level of importance by faculty , thus the relatively small range and consistent
confidence intervals are consistent with the previous research (Schonfeld &
Housewright, 2010).

Visual examination of the 95% confidence intervals (excluding disciplines
with very small samples, n < 5) demonstrates the cross-disciplinary importance of
the buyer as library. Theater, Economics, and Mathematics do not overlap with Area
Studies and Philosophy, but even there, the difference is minimal (see Figure 16).

Figure 16: 95% Confidence Intervals for Library as Buyer.

To better compare disciplines, Figure 17 shows the percentage of
respondents in each discipline who selected each of the six rankings of importance.
This even more clearly illustrates how highly this role is ranked across disciplines,
with no fewer than 75% of respondents in any given discipline ranking the
importance at least at a 5.

Importance of the role of the library as Archive. Another traditional role is
that of the archive, described in the Ithaka 2009 instrument as a repository
interested in archiving, preserving, and tracking resources. For this question,
respondents were given a scale of one to six, with a score of one identified as âNot at

101

all importantâ and six as âExtremely important.â The entire sample (N = 1517)
responded with a mean of 5.04, median 6 (see Table 15).

For the role of the library as archive, the general disciplinary groupings of
humanities and the sciences do appear to be more similar than for some other roles.
The three disciplines placing the greatest importance on this role, Literature (M =
5.75, SD = .64), Music (M = 5.47, SD = .94), and Art History (M = 5.40, SD = 1.12), are
all from the humanities. The disciplines placing the least importance on this role are
distributed between sciences and social sciences: Physics (M = 4.17, SD = 1.58),
Economics (M = 4.45, SD = 1.36), and Business (M = 4.50, SD = 1.24). Visual
examination of the 95% confidence intervals (excluding disciplines with very small
samples, n < 5) demonstrates that while differences exist, most responses across
disciplines in this area will fall within the same general range. The exceptions are
Literature, which has no overlap with more than half of the other disciplines, and
Anthropology, Philosophy, and Art History, which have no overlap with Physics,
Business, and Economics (see Figure 18).

For the role of the library as teaching support, the general disciplinary
groupings of humanities and the sciences do appear to be more similar than for
other roles with sciences finding it uniformly less important than average, and the
humanities disciplines generally finding this role more important. However, of the
three disciplines placing the greatest importance on this role, Public Policy/Health
Policy (M = 5.75, SD = .50), Art History (M = 5.51, SD = .91), and History (M = 5.27,
SD = 1.09), only one is from the humanities, with the other two in social sciences.
The disciplines placing the least importance on this role are uniformly in the
sciences: Physics (M = 4.17, SD = 1.58), Economics (M = 4.45, SD = 1.36), and
Business (M = 4.50, SD = 1.24). Visual examination of the 95% confidence intervals
(excluding disciplines with very small samples, n < 5) demonstrates that while
differences exist, most responses across disciplines in this area will fall within the
same general range. Religion, Literature, History, and Art History have no overlap
with Physics, Geology, Business, Engineering, Mathematics, Chemistry, Economics,
and Public Health; Geology and Physics additionally have no overlap with Theater,
and Physics lacks overlap with the above listed disciplines, plus Biology, Area
Studies, Psychology, Anthropology, Education, and Political Science. Additionally,
confidence intervals in this role are generally larger, reflecting greater variance in
responses (see Figure 19).

Visual examination of the 95% confidence intervals (excluding disciplines
with very small samples, n < 5) demonstrates that while differences exist, most
responses across disciplines in this area will fall within the same general range. The
exceptions are Physics, which has overlap only with Economics, Public Health,

Figure 20: 95% Confidence Intervals for Library as Research Support

Negative perceptions of the continuing relevance of libraries. This item
was a developed construct from the factor analysis. Because of the nature of these
constructs, the mean for the component is zero, with a relatively small range. The
110

nature of the questions comprising this component was negative (e.g. âthe role
librarians play at this institution is becoming much less importantâ), so a positive
mean indicates support for the perception that libraries are becoming irrelevant,
while a negative mean indicates a perception that libraries continue to be important.
Analysis by individual disciplines reveals a wide range of responses.
In this construct, the general disciplinary groupings of humanities and the
sciences have similar results, with disciplines in the sciences generally reporting a
stronger move toward the growing irrelevance of libraries, and the humanities
disciplines uniformly finding the opposite. However, indicating the most support for
relevance of libraries, History (M = -.52, SD = .79), Literature (M = -.52, SD = .28),
and Anthropology (M = -.41, SD = .92), only one is from the humanities, with the
other two in social sciences. The disciplines placing the least importance on this role
are uniformly in the sciences: Engineering (M = .69, SD = 1.07), Physics (M = .43, SD
= .96), and Chemistry (M = .40, SD = 1.23). Visual examination of the 95% confidence
intervals (excluding disciplines with very small samples, n < 5) show fairly strong
delineation between groups (see Figure 21).

Figure 21: 95% Confidence Intervals for Continuing Relevance of Libraries

While there are no clear boundaries dividing disciplines into groups,
disciplines in this area could easily be placed into three groupings: disciplines
wherein the entire CI is below the mean of zero, those that encompass the mean,
and those that are entirely above the mean, which would result in the groupings
listed in Table 19.

Perceived dependence on the library. This item is the final developed
construct from the factor analysis. Because of the nature of these constructs, the
mean for the component is zero, with a relatively small range. Analysis by individual
disciplines reveals a wide range of responses both above the mean, indicating higher
dependence on the library, and below the mean, indicating lower dependence (see
Table 20).
From the means, it is clear that some disciplines are more dependent on the
library, with Public Policy/Health Policy (M = .61, SD = 1.22), Biology (M = .44, SD =
.96), and Classical Studies (M = .41, SD = .90), although it is worth noting that Public
Policy/Health Policy had a very small sample (n = 4), so their results are likely not
generalizable. At the other end of the spectrum, Music (M = -.49, SD = .94 and
Physics (M = -.42, SD = 1.09) have the lowest average scores. These extreme values
are found in a variety of subject areas, thus there are no clear trends in any of these
areas that point toward strong commonalities in a broad discipline area. Visual

114

examination of the 95% confidence intervals (excluding disciplines with very small
samples, n < 5) demonstrates that while differences exist, most responses across
disciplines in this area will fall within the same general range. Most confidence
intervals for this variable encompass the mean, excepting Physics, for which the
entire 95% confidence interval was below the mean, and Literature, Classical
Studies, and Biology, for which the entire confidence interval is above the mean (see
Figure 22).

Figure 22: 95% Confidence Intervals for Dependence on the Library

Demographic analysis. In addition to examining each variable relating to
Perceptions of Libraries by discipline, this study also aims to identify any
demographic differences. While noticeable differences between disciplines were
evident for the variables relating to role of the library, means for demographic
characteristics revealed no clear patterns. However, the two constructs relating to
perceptions did have some interesting differences to note. First, Figure 23 indicates
that with the sole exception of the oldest demographic, perceived dependence on
the library declines as faculty age, while their negative perceptions of the relevance
of libraries increases. Similar results are apparent when examining responses by
years in field (Figure 24).
117

Unlike the library usage variables, responses by title revealed a slightly different
pattern, with the greatest dependence and lowest negative perception among the
middle rank of associate professor (Figure 25).

Figure 25: Responses by Academic Title for Perception Variables

Finally, when examined by sex, the difference between mean responses is not
great, but means are positive for men on both variables, while they are negative for
women, indicating that male respondents may have more positive perceptions of
libraries (Figure 26).

CHAPTER 5
DISCUSSION

As with most of higher education, academic libraries are facing rapidly
declining budgets and changing priorities. Libraries are reliant upon excellent
relationships with faculty and administration in their institutions to establish
relevance and maintain funding. One major part of this is the liaison relationship,
which generally helps maintain communications between the library and faculty.
Liaisons have responsibility for working with faculty on many facets of libraries,
ranging from collections decisions to establishing the right balance of
communication. To make grounded decisions in these areas, liaison librarians must
understand the faculty with whom they work. Because librarians as a whole have
historically been reactive and instinctive, this research aimed to provide more
evidence for librarians and administrators to use in delineating how best to work
with faculty in individual disciplines. Better understanding of faculty use and
perceptions lead to a better understanding of how library resources can be allocated
to the greatest benefit, and which library services need to be focused where. At its
core, this research sought to answer the question of how faculty members in
disparate disciplines use and perceive the academic library, and hypothesized that
differences in perceptions and use of the library exist between disciplines, as well as
when considering demographic characteristics.
121

This research utilized data from the 2009 Faculty Survey conducted by
Ithaka S+R (Ithaka 2009), analyzing the disciplinary distinctions in greater detail
than the original report. Principal component analyses reduced the survey from
thirty-one variables into seven factors, plus an additional five variables that
provided meaningful results as for this research as originally asked. Descriptive
analysis produced some interesting groupings in finding differences and similarities,
as well as illustrative data that librarians can use for guiding decision-making.
Most existing research relating to disciplinary differences in libraries either
focuses on a single discipline, (Bury, 2011; Cannon, 1994; Cohen, 1995; Ducas &
Michaud-Oystryk, 2004; Jo, 2012; Storie & Campbell, 2012; Thomsett-Scott & May,
2009; Yang, 2000) or on general disciplinary groupings, primarily sciences, social
sciences, and humanities (Christiansen et al., 2004; Heterick & Schonfeld, 2004;
Housewright & Schonfeld, 2008; Schonfeld & Housewright, 2010; Thull & Hansen,
2009). One goal of this research was to establish new disciplinary groupings based
on patterns evident in the analysis, but few new patterns emerged. In some cases,
commonalities between disciplines confirmed those traditional groupings, although
many exceptions exist, and some possible new subgroups emerged for the social
sciences. For the sake of simplicity, this discussion will first focus on each of these
general groupings individually and will examine the specific disciplines and
differences within those groupings, as well as some overall themes across those
disciplines.
122

Science Discipline Profiles
General responses to questions about both use and perceptions of libraries
are somewhat consistent throughout the sciences, and consistent with each other.
The science disciplines ranked actual use of libraries lower than average, and their
negative perceptions of library relevance are consistent with this lack of use.
Because of this, it may not always be necessary to study the disciplines within the
sciences as separate groups. However, differences did exist primarily for Biology,
Chemistry, and Engineering, which had greater dependence on the library, placed
greater importance on their role as a Buyer, expressed higher Use of Library
Databases, and yet had greater negative perceptions of continuing library relevance.
Because of this, these disciplines merit further research and attention. It may be the
case that faculty in these three disciplines believe strongly in the role of the library
today, but because of greater moves toward open scholarly communication in those
fields, believe that the role of libraries will begin to diminish.
Physics also emerged as a distinctly different discipline, primarily because
they consistently used the library less and found it to be less relevant than other
disciplines to an extreme. In many cases, Physics was the sole discipline to lack
overlap with others due to consistently low use and perception of libraries. This is
likely due in part to wider adoption of open access repositories in this discipline,
like arXiv and the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory/National Aeronautics and
Space Administration Astrophysics Data System (SAO/NASA ADS). Additionally, the

123

esoteric and theoretical nature of Physics is more pronounced than in other
disciplines, which generally creates a culture of independence not just within the
discipline, but among individuals, leading those faculty to be less likely to recognize
any need for assistance. Indeed, it may be the case that faculty in Physics generally
need little overt support and attention from library liaisons, who can work with
them on an as needed basis.
Use of Libraries
In some aspects of this study, the science disciplines grouped together very
well, showing much commonality. For constructs relating to library use, the sciences
as a rule had lower than average scores for Frequency of Information Seeking and
Use, Use of Library Catalogs, and Use of Library Databases (excepting Engineering
for Use of Library Databases). Responses were more mixed for the constructs
relating to format preference â whether they are comfortable using electronic
journals and books. This division is logical, as electronic journals and books may not
necessarily be provided by the library, but rather through open access resources or
individual subscriptions, both of which are more prevalent in the sciences than
other disciplines.
The degree of comfort with electronic journals and books were more mixed.
For electronic journals, most of the science disciplines reported above average
comfort, excepting only Mathematics, and Chemistry was only just above the mean,
indicating that these two disciplines may have less comfort with electronic journals

124

than faculty in other science disciplines, while still remaining close to average.
Moreover, Physics and Engineering were among the disciplines with the highest
level of comfort with electronic journals, as the bulk of faculty in these disciplines
responded with above average comfort. This general comfort with electronic
journals paired with a lack of interest in the libraryâs role as an archive in science
disciplines could indicate that shifting periodical collections from print to electronic
will be a welcome move by those faculty, and that little time and money should be
spent on print.
Electronic books have more mixed support among the science disciplines, as
Biology, Engineering, and Mathematics have above average comfort, whereas
Chemistry, Geology, Physics, and Geography all have comfort levels below the
overall mean. However, the width of confidence intervals for this construct are
generally high enough that it appears as though there are no real patterns at the
time of this survey. Further analysis of level of comfort with electronic books over
time will likely reveal more stability, but at the time of this survey the format is
likely too new for disciplinary patterns to solidify as much as they have for
electronic journals. Analysis of later iterations of the Ithaka Faculty Survey as they
become available may reveal more stability in this area.
Perceptions of the Library
In perceptions of the library, the sciences grouped together as having less
interest than average in the role of the library as a Gateway for their research, as

125

Teaching Support, and as Research Support. These three items all represent
different aspects of similar services in libraries, and indicate less of an interest
across the sciences in services like information literacy instruction, discovery tools,
and research guides. However, in the roles of the library as Buyer and as an Archive,
the sciences were less uniform. For the role of the library as an Archive, only
Geography was an exception to a less than average perception of the importance of
this role among the sciences. This may be indicative of less importance among these
disciplines in historical information, or also may be reflective of current trends in
the sciences to provide disciplinary archives outside of libraries. Finally, the role of
the library as a Buyer was rated as highly important across the board for all
disciplines, so while half of the science disciplines rated this role lower than
average, the average was still well above five on a six point scale.
Two constructs also examined perceptions of libraries, one addressing
negative perceptions of the continuing importance of libraries, the other looking at
perceived dependence on the library. For the negative perceptions on the
continuing relevance of the library and librarians, the sciences again tended to place
less importance than other disciplines excepting Geology and Geography. Generally,
this does not necessarily indicate a lack of support for libraries among the sciences,
as the range of responses (as indicated by 95% confidence intervals) was wide.
However, the majority of responses for faculty from Engineering, Chemistry, and
Biology supported negative perceptions of library relevance. Interestingly, on the
126

construct relating to perceived dependence on the library, only those three
disciplines showed greater than average dependence. This is an apparent
contradiction, expressing greater dependence while indicating that libraries are
losing relevance. One possible explanation would be that the construct relating to
relevance was developed from questions asking specifically about library staff and
materials whereas the dependence construct is developed from questions that
asked directly how dependent one is on their library, there may simply be a
disconnect in how these faculty perceive different aspects of the library. This seems
to indicate a greater need for librarians to reach out to faculty in those areas.
Humanities Discipline Profiles
As a general rule, humanities disciplines had more positive perceptions of
libraries, found them to be more important, and used them more. The most
traditional library roles (Buyer, Archive, and Gateway) and library resources
(Library Catalogs) were in general more important to these faculty. However, the
performing arts in particular seemed to find less importance in some facets of
library services, likely because of an emphasis on performance and creativity rather
than research. Because of this, it may be necessary for libraries to better
communicate how they can serve that type of discipline, through the provision of
resources to help enhance the creative process and by better marketing services
that support the scholarly side of a performance degree.

127

Use of Libraries
Like the sciences, disciplines in the humanities (Art History, Classical Studies,
Literature, Music, Philosophy, Religion, and Theater) show commonality in some
factors in this research. For the component relating to Level of Comfort with
Electronic Journals, humanities disciplines were uniformly below average, whereas
in Use of Library Catalogs, they were above average. The upper bound 95%
confidence intervals for the humanities disciplines rarely breach the mean, and
those that do only do so by a small margin. Although there is more variation among
level of comfort with electronic books, the amount of variance generally in this
component is significant enough that clear patterns are not fully evident. Only
Philosophy showed somewhat uniform discomfort with the format. These patterns
are consistent with each other, as library catalogs are generally most frequently
used to locate print collections. However, it is important to recognize that while a
discipline may have below average comfort with a specific format, this is not
necessarily an indicator of preferring print over electronic â simply that there is less
comfort among faculty in those disciplines than others.
Frequency of Information Seeking and Use as a general rule across
disciplines revealed little variation from the mean, with most disciplines slightly
below, and a small number slightly above. In the humanities, only Religion and
Literature had above average information seeking behaviors, with Literature only
slightly above the mean. Additionally, these two items had among the widest

128

confidence intervals due to a small number of very high scores from individual
respondents, so little meaning can be gleaned from this information.
The most distinct disciplinary differences for the humanities are evident in
Use of Library Databases. The two performing arts disciplines, Music and Theater,
were among those reporting the least use of this type of resource. Theater reported
much lower use of these resources than other disciplines, as the entire confidence
interval, though wide, is still below the overall average. While Musicâs confidence
interval did just barely encompass the general mean, it also had a lower bound low
enough to rival that of Theater. This could be indicative of the type of resources
most important in those disciplines, and certainly merits attention by librarians
working with faculty in those disciplines.
Perceptions of the Library
Disciplines in the humanities also found some common ground for variables
relating to perceptions of the library. Faculty in these disciplines generally placed
greater importance on the roles of the library as a Gateway and as an Archive, and
had lower Negative Perceptions of the Continuing Relevance of Libraries. The
importance of the Archival role of libraries to humanities faculty is consistent with
common perceptions, as is the general support of library relevance. Additionally,
while some humanities disciplines were among the lowest average responses for
the role of the library as Buyer (Theater and Music), this role was rated as highly

129

important across the board for all disciplines, and the average was still above five on
a six point scale with a median of six.
Perceptions of the importance of the two newer library roles, Teaching
Support and Research Support, were also generally positive. Art History and
Literature in particular found great value in Research Support from their library,
while Music had an extremely broad range of responses in this area, indicating
mixed extremes. Religion, Literature, Art History, and Theater had noticeable higher
support for the role of Teaching Support. Librarians who have had limited success in
developing programs for teaching and research support may have better luck
starting with faculty in these disciplines.
Finally, the most mixed reactions for faculty in the humanities came in
relation to the Dependence on the Library construct. Faculty from Classical Studies,
Literature, and Philosophy generally had the highest dependence, while most others
floated around average. However, Music had very few responses above the mean,
even with more variance than any other discipline. This is consistent with responses
generally lower than average from Music faculty on other variables relating to
perception, and could indicate that librarians may need to focus greater attention on
determining what services and resources may be of greater value to faculty in this
group.

130

Social Science and Area Studies Disciplines
The social science disciplines in this study (Anthropology, Area Studies,2
Business, Economics, Education, History, Law, Political Sciences, Psychology, Public
Health, Public Policy/Health Policy, and Sociology) had very little in common as a
group. Only on the two factors for which responses across the board were very
similar â supporting the role of the library as a Buyer and a very narrow range of
responses for Frequency of Information Seeking and Use â did all social sciences
disciplines have similar responses. However, some patterns and groupings were
apparent based on examination of all data for the social sciences disciplines.
Generally, Law, Public Health, Economics, Business, and Sociology found the library
to be less important, while Area Studies, History, Political Science, and Education
had more positive perceptions and more frequent library use. The remaining three
disciplines, Anthropology, Psychology, and Public Policy/Health Policies were very
mixed with little in common both with each other and with the other social sciences
disciplines.
Use of Libraries
Faculty in the five social science disciplines that overall ranked libraries as
less important were not uniformly negative regarding use of libraries. They
uniformly used catalogs less often than average and were among the least

Area Studies had very small sample sizes and little to compare within itself as a disciplinary
grouping. Because it is more similar to the social sciences than the other general disciplinary
groupings it is included in this part of the analysis.
2

131

comfortable with electronic books. However, excepting Law, these users were
consistently more comfortable with electronic journals and used databases more
than the overall mean. Because of this, it is possible that the best way to begin
developing relationships with these faculty could be to focus in on electronic journal
collections and library databases, which could lead to greater awareness and
adoption of other library services and resources.
The other six social science disciplines, including those who generally had
positive impressions of libraries and those who were more neutral, had various
responses to library use variables. Anthropology had quite a bit of variation in
responses to these variables, but generally was less comfortable than average with
both electronic books and journals, and used library catalogs and databases less
frequently. Only History joined Anthropology in a lack of comfort with electronic
journals, Psychology in a lack of comfort with electronic books, and Public
Policy/Health Policy with less frequent database use. Public Policy/Health Policy,
Education, and History stand out with their consistently above average use of
library catalogs.
Perceptions of the Library
It is in variables relating to perceptions of the library that social sciences
disciplines showed the clearest grouping. Law, Public Health, Economics, Business,
and Sociology consistently found the five roles of the library to be less important
than average. The only exception was in the role of Buyer, for which responses were

132

high across disciplines. Additionally, these five disciplines had greater negative
perceptions of the continuing importance of libraries than average (excepting Law,
which was just above the overall mean) and lower dependence on Libraries
(excepting Economics, which had one of the higher means overall). While this
appears to indicate that these five disciplines find the studied roles of libraries to be
less important, there was enough variation in the scores that this may be a
premature assumption, and further research with larger samples would be
necessary to determine if this pattern continues.
The three disciplines showing the most support for libraries on studied
variables were Area Studies, Education, Political Science, and History. These
disciplines not only had the greatest positive perceptions of libraries in the social
sciences, but also had some of the highest overall scores. History faculty in
particular were more consistent than many disciplines in their positive perceptions,
with little variance in their scores even in variables that tended to be less consistent
like Teaching Support and Research Support. Education faculty similarly had less
variance than other disciplines although not quite as dramatic a difference as
history, which is surprising because of the broad variation between different fields
in education. The single anomaly was in Area Studies. While the faculty in this
discipline had among the highest scores for the various roles of libraries, and for
Dependence on the Library, they also had some of the greatest negative perceptions
of the Continuing Relevance of Libraries. This could indicate that faculty in Area
133

Studies use libraries in a productive and positive way currently, but believe them to
be heading toward irrelevance in a manner similar to Biology, Chemistry, and
Engineering.
The final three disciplines, Anthropology, Psychology, and Public
Policy/Health Policy exhibited some logical patterns within themselves, but no
patterns with each other or the other disciplines. They each also had generally more
variance than other social sciences disciplines, indicating a wider range of responses
from the faculty. For Public Policy/Health Policy, the sample was very small, so
further research would be necessary to draw any conclusions at all. Psychology
faculty generally had somewhat less variance, but consistently had responses close
to the overall mean. However, in Dependence on the Library, Psychology had one of
the highest overall means, paired with a 95% confidence interval that was also
almost entirely above the mean. Thus, while Psychology faculty may not place any
particular emphasis on specific roles of libraries, overall they find themselves highly
dependent on them. Further research may reveal precisely what these faculty value,
and provide some insight on how librarians might better work with them. Finally,
Anthropology faculty generally placed considerably greater importance on the
collections-based roles of libraries (Buyer and Archive) and on the continuing
relevance of libraries than other disciplines, while placing at or below average
importance on the remaining service based roles. However, because of the greater
variance among responses, this likely also would need further research to verify.
134

Demographic Variables
While demographic differences relating to library use and perceptions have
not been established in library literature, exploratory analysis in this study sought
to determine whether some common assumptions regarding demographic
differences hold firm, and also to see if additional differences may exist. A common
assumption among librarians is that library use and perceptions are sensitive to
generational differences, which held firm for most of this research. This analysis
demonstrated a general decline in level of comfort with electronic formats and
greater use of library resources and services that focus on print formats as
respondents age, with the reverse true for resources and services focused on
electronic format. Research in other areas of technology use have consistently
shown this to be true, so these findings are not surprising. The most notable
anomaly in this pattern is that faculty in the 20-29 age category were more similar
to faculty in the 50-79 age group in terms of library database use, in that they used
them less than average. This could be due to the recent widespread adoption of nonlibrary databases like Google Scholar, a freely available and searchable aggregation
of scholarly articles. Alternatively, these less experienced faculty may simply not
have yet learned that the databases they search are provided by the library, and
believe them to be either freely available or provided by some other entity. Because
of this, it remains critical for librarians to work with students and faculty in
understanding not only that many of the resources they search are provided by their

135

library, but also that those resources may not remain available after graduation or
when connecting to the resources remotely.
Also related to age and amount of time in the field, perceived dependence on
the library declines as faculty age, while their negative perceptions of the relevance
of libraries increases, indicating a general decline in the relative importance of
libraries to faculty in older demographics. Similar results are apparent when
examining responses by years in field. This could be due to a number of factors,
including a greater sense of independence and understanding as faculty become
more experienced in research and locating information, general disdain for the shift
toward electronic collections and services among those who have less comfort in
that format, or other reasons that may be revealed in further research.
A surprising finding for this research relates to differences by sex. For nearly
every construct in both library use and perceptions, means are above the overall
average of zero for men, while they are universally below that overall average of
zero for women. While the range of difference between these mean responses is
very small indicating that these findings are likely less meaningful than they initially
appear, the pattern is interesting enough to merit further attention by librarians on
differences by sex in use and perceptions of the library.
Limitations of the Study
As with any research, this study is inherently limited. All data was selfreporting, and findings are based on the assumption that respondents understood

136

the questions and answered them honestly. As with any survey research, there
could be some response bias in that only faculty with a particular bias or with
extreme views returned the instrument (Cone & Foster, 2008). Finally, this
particular instrument was a lengthy paper survey sent by mail, which may have
further limited the responses.
Additionally, the use of secondary data further limits this study. The
instrument was designed to examine key strategic issues affecting academic
libraries, rather than to answer any particular research question. Because of this,
much of the survey was not related to the research questions of this study, and
conversely some data that may have been helpful for this research was not a part of
the instrument. In particular, faculty were prompted to select as many disciplines as
they liked, which resulted in an inability to distinguish a faculty memberâs primary
from secondary disciplinary associations. This, paired with the large number of
options from which faculty could select their disciplines, resulted in relatively small
samples for each discipline. Either the selection of a primary discipline association
or rank ordering the significance of each discipline to oneâs personal association
would have enriched the disciplinary analysis. Furthermore, data relating to
institution type including Carnegie Classification, institution size, and library type
would have provided an additional level of detail that may have proved useful.
Finally, construct development could have been strengthened with more direct

137

questions relating to the nature of those constructs, particularly those relating to
comfort with electronic books and journals.
Finally, the nature of the analysis paired with the small samples sizes limit
the generalizability of this study. Results from the general sample and disciplines
with larger sample sizes may be generalizable to the population of university
faculty, but profiles for the disciplines with smaller samples may not be
generalizable at all. Sample sizes for individual disciplines ranged from 1 to 105,
limiting the type of analysis available to compare groups. Descriptive statistics are
useful in developing profiles but do not indicate significance, and may not be
specific enough to draw conclusions for a larger population.
Conclusions and Suggestions for Further Research
This research study focused on several factors relating to perceptions and
use of library materials and services. It examined perceptions of various roles of the
library, as a Gateway or starting point for research, as a Buyer of research materials,
an Archive serving as a repository, and in providing Teaching Support and Research
Support. It also looked at developed constructs assessing negative perceptions of
the Continuing Relevance of Libraries, Dependence on the Library, Frequency of
Information Seeking and Use, Level of Comfort with Electronic Journals and
Electronic Books, and Frequency of Use for Library Catalogs and Databases. While
many commonalities existed between disciplines, differences were also apparent.
General groupings of disciplines within the humanities and the sciences tended to

138

have more in common with each other than those in the social sciences, although
differences existed within these as well. Library administrators and liaisons looking
to make better decisions relating to services and collections can utilize the
distinctions to understand some priorities for individual disciplines.
Recommendations and suggestions for application of the disciplinary differences to
liaison approaches and activities throughout this discussion provide a starting point
for these liaisons and administrators, who can begin to fine-tune their planning for
work with faculty in their institutions.
Additional analysis of past and future Ithaka S+R Faculty surveys may more
firmly establish the differences evidenced in this research, or could delineate trends
as attitudes and technologies change. While this research was in progress, the
institute released their 2012 survey report, analysis of which would be
complementary to this research (Housewright et al., 2012). In some cases, more
careful analysis of faculty in individual disciplines will enrich the body of research
available to help librarians in their decision-making processes. Finally, the needs
and preferences of individual faculty at any given institution will vary. It remains
critical for librarians at all levels to maintain strong communication with the
constituencies they serve so that the general knowledge of research such as this can
support the best decisions at their own local colleges and universities.
