ABSTRACT

SCHOOL LIBRARY ADVOCACY: PERCEPTIONS OF BUILDING
INFLUENCE
Elizabeth A. Burns
Old Dominion University, 2014
Director: Dr. Gail K. Dickinson

Hartzell (1997) suggests that many in the school community do not know the
value the school library program contributes to the educational landscape, and
stakeholders cannot articulate the roles and responsibilities o f the school librarian.
Advocacy for a school library program is the deliberate and sustained effort to foster
understanding o f the program while influencing the attitudes of key stakeholders. It
includes raising awareness, increasing knowledge and gaining influence for the position
o f the school librarian. The national professional organization for school librarians, the
American Association o f School Librarians (AASL), maintains a multi-tiered definition
o f advocacy, with marketing and public relations existing under the definition o f
advocacy. This leads to varied understandings o f advocacy among practicing school
librarians and there is a lack of consistency in how school librarians interpret and engage
in the practice o f advocacy.
This study examines the advocacy beliefs o f school librarians and the advocacy
activities in which they engage in practice. It also explores the relationship between
school librarians’ espoused practices of advocacy and their activities-in-use within their
program. Finally, this study explores the perceived success o f advocacy strategies used
in school library programs by both the school librarians and their co-teacher and

administrator stakeholders when engaging in advocacy for their program.
Using a mixed methods approach, a national sample o f practicing school
librarians working in 36 o f the 100 largest school districts in the US were surveyed. A
smaller criterion sample o f survey respondents was interviewed, along with a co-teacher
and administrator from each site, using phenomenological methods to examine the lived
experiences o f the participants in their school setting. Findings indicate the participants
in this study had difficulty distinguishing the difference between the definition and
activities o f advocacy, marketing, and public relations as identified by AASL.
Additionally, practicing school librarians had difficulty understanding advocacy in the
context o f the school library program. Among those school librarians who have a more
mature understanding of advocacy, common strategies were used in their settings to
change the perception of stakeholders. These strategies include revitalizing the position
o f the school librarian, emphasizing the teaching role of the school librarian, focusing on
innovation, and ensuring relevance o f the school library program so it meets the needs of
today’s learner. Demographic variables were analyzed and reported as predictors of
advocacy success from the survey population. Additionally, participants reported
perceived measures o f formal and informal success in their settings.
Keywords: school libraries, advocacy, theories of practice, phenomenology

CHAPTER ONE
INTRODUCTION
"There is only one thing worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked
about”Oscar Wilde
School library professionals act as invisible collaborators in the teaching
profession (Hartzell, 1997). An integral component o f a strong school library program,
they provide learning opportunities and leadership that adds value to the school
community (AASL, 2012). Best practice challenges 21st Century school librarians to
integrate standards with classroom curriculum standards and then work with teachers to
develop collaborative information literacy instruction (AASL, 2009; AASL, 2007b; Doll,
2005; Vanneman, 2011). At the same time, school librarians have traditional program
administration duties, such as maintaining a collection relevant to the needs of the school
community, establishing library policy, and organizing the resources o f the library
collection in a manner that promotes independent use and lifelong learning (AASL&
AECT, 1988 &1998; AASL, 2009; NEA & ALA, 1969).
School librarians lament that the school community does not know what they do
or value their program. Hartzell (1997) contends that the school community rarely knows
the true value that school librarians bring to the educational landscape and many
educators are, in fact, unaware of the benefits the school library program has to offer.
Most stakeholders cannot articulate the roles and responsibilities o f the school librarian
(p. 25). This lack o f awareness may be the primary reason others in the school are not
supporting the vital role the school library program plays in the education o f students. To
ensure that others in the school community are aware of the benefits o f a strong school

2

library program, under the direction o f a qualified school librarian, school librarians must
be vocal advocates.
The number o f school librarians has declined nationally in recent years (Keaton,
2012). In the past 5 years, there has been a downward trend of -4.27% in the staffing of
school libraries by certified school librarians (ALA, 2013b). When faced with difficult
budget cuts, those in power often see the position o f school librarian an easier cut to
make than other teaching or resource staff (ALA, 2013b). Because o f this trend in
position elimination, it is a critical time that school librarians know the benefits of
advocating for their program. This will ensure the school library program is considered
essential to student learning by all stakeholders. This will ensure that the school library
program is rallied around and protected by and for the patrons who use their services
(Kenney, 2008; Ewbank, 2012).

Advocacy in the School Library
Advocacy is discussed as an essential best practice in the school library field.
Both the American Library Association (ALA) and its school library division, the
American Association of School Librarians (AASL) have dedicated resources and
toolkits for advocacy (AASL, 2006a; ALA & AASL, 2003; ALA, 2013a). These
resources o f the national professional organizations are available to assist school
librarians as they implement their own building-level advocacy plans.

Both ALA and AASL have committees dedicated to advocacy resources and
education. The Committee on Library Advocacy (COLA) for ALA maintains a
repository of advocacy resources, Advocacy University, (ALA, 2013a) that contains a
variety of materials for school and public libraries. The American Association o f School

Libraries Advocacy Committee maintains two separate toolkits (AASL, 2008). The
Crisis Toolkit contains materials and resources for those schools that are in danger o f
losing funding for their library staff or resources. The second is a Promotion and
Wellness Toolkit, created to assist school librarians develop advocacy initiatives before
there is a crisis so that stakeholder relationships can be fostered. Another beneficial
function o f the AASL Advocacy Committee is the planning o f educational opportunities
related to being involved in advocacy at all levels, as well as developing a comprehensive
plan for ongoing advocacy activities. These resources provide basic training in advocacy
to those new to the profession or those who may need a quick reference on the field’s
expectations o f advocacy.

Each o f these organizational supports are beneficial to the field however, there is
a lack o f consistency in understanding and practicing advocacy by school librarians.
Though the term advocacy is widely used, rarely does it carry the same connotation
across multiple audiences. In recent studies, (Bums, 2014; Ewbank, 2011) practitioners
had different perceptions of advocacy. Ewbank (2011) documents the variety of
understandings, definitions and practices of advocacy in the school library field. These
diverse understandings o f advocacy often align with marketing the school library to
facilitate collaboration and program awareness. Frequently activities such as book fairs,
family library events and creation of library websites are mentioned as advocacy
activities (Bums, 2014; Ewbank, 2011). Few participants identified activities structured
as relationship-building opportunities completed in addition to required duties expected
for building a quality library program.

AASL maintains a tiered definition of advocacy. Definitions o f Public Relations

4

(PR) and marketing co-exist under the definition o f advocacy. AASL defines advocacy
as the “on-going process o f building partnerships so that others will act for and with you,
turning passive support into educated action for the library program” (AASL, 2007b).
Program advocacy goes beyond simple program promotion and requires deliberate,
consistent relationship-building efforts. School librarians must build influence for their
position and their program if they hope to build relationships with stakeholders that
influence others to act in support of the library program (Hartzell, 2003a). However,
advocacy is not an innate practice. Similar to most teaching beliefs, it is learned through
a combination o f prior knowledge, observation and training (Hartzell, 2007; Schulz,
2008).

Ensuring that school librarians are empowered to advocate for their programs
prior to entering the profession is essential. ALA lists advocacy as a competency o f basic
knowledge all librarians should know and be able to apply (ALA, 2008). Preparation
programs are tasked with introducing pre-service librarians to the concept o f advocacy
(AASL& NCATE, 2010). Colleges and universities accredited to license pre-service
school librarians follow the established program standards o f the National Council for the
Accreditation o f Teacher Education (NCATE). There are five NCATE standards for a
School Library Media endorsement. Standard four, Advocacy and Leadership, addresses
the advocacy standards school library candidates are required to meet in order to fulfill
the licensing requirement. The NCATE definition o f advocacy states, “Candidates
identify stakeholders within and outside the school community who impact the school
library program. Candidates develop a plan to advocate for school library and
information programs, resources, and services” (AASL & NCATE, 2010).

5

Therefore, it is expected that school librarians have the knowledge and
understanding o f advocacy and can engage in the activities the professional field defines
as advocacy for the school library program. However, there remains little research
examining effective practitioner implementation of advocacy in the field. Haycock
(2003a) and Oberg (2006) discuss the perceptions o f other stakeholders when school
librarians advocate for their programs. It is only Ewbank (2011) who examines the
practices o f school librarians themselves for an understanding of how school librarians
conceptualize the actions o f advocacy. While the school library field has the expectation
advocacy is understood and implemented by school librarians, little research exists to
determine practicing school librarian’s cohesive understanding of advocacy.

Purpose and Research Questions
Although national professional library associations have developed advocacy
resources and advocacy training is required prior to licensing of new school librarians,
the findings o f Bums (2014) and Ewbank (2011) showed there was a lack o f consistency
in how school librarians interpret and engage in the practice o f advocacy. Further, multi­
tiered definitions o f advocacy available on the national professional organization website
(AASL, 2007b) lead to varied understandings of advocacy among practicing school
librarians. A comprehensive search o f ERIC, Education Research, and Library Literature
and Information databases revealed there has been no empirical research studying
practices school librarians define as activities o f advocacy, as well as no research linking
the effectiveness o f these advocacy efforts to school library programs. This study
examined the advocacy beliefs of school librarians and the activities in which they
engage in their practice. It also explored the relationship between school librarian’s

6

espoused practices o f advocacy and their actual activities o f advocacy within their library
program. Finally, this study also explored the perceived success of strategies used in
school library programs by the school librarians, as well as their stakeholders, in
engaging in advocacy for their program.
This study was guided by the following research questions:
1. How do practicing K-12 school librarians define advocacy?
2. What advocacy activities do practicing K-12 school librarians enact?
3. To what extent do practicing school librarians’ understandings of advocacy align
with their advocacy activities?
4. To what extent are K-12 school librarian’s advocacy efforts perceived successful
by themselves and by their co-teachers and administrators?

Overview of the Methodology
The research questions were addressed using an explanatory sequential mixed
methods research design (Creswell, 2012). This study combined a quantitative measure
to identify those activities school librarians report they engage in on a regular basis with a
phenomenological qualitative examination o f school librarians’ perceptions and beliefs
on what behaviors are most effective to determine the perceived success of program
advocacy.
To identify common advocacy practices o f a large sample o f practicing school
librarians, a quantitative measure was distributed to a national population o f school
librarians employed in US public schools. This questionnaire instrument allowed for a
broad understanding o f the advocacy strategies in use in the field. A phenomenological
approach (Moustakas, 1994) was used to explore the lived experiences of a smaller

7

sample o f participants and describe the strategies they enact in practice as they engage in
advocacy activities within their school setting.
To examine the first two questions, the researcher gathered data from survey
responses and questionnaires. A modified measure based on the survey developed by
Myers and Sweeney (2004) in the counseling field was used to collect data from a
population of practicing school librarians in large districts with school library
supervisors. The survey instruments were analyzed to solicit the understandings o f
advocacy at the school level, as well as the activities of advocacy reported by
practitioners.
The 100 largest school districts in the nation, identified by the National Center for
Education Statistics (Sable, Plotts, and Mitchell, 2010) were used in this study. From this
population, the 80 districts with library supervisors were contacted. Library supervisors
in each o f these districts were asked to distribute the survey to all school librarians in
their district. Each school librarian in the population then had the opportunity to
voluntarily participate in the survey.
Though a delimiting factor, distribution through supervisors ensured there was no
preference in sampling to those practitioners engaging through professional organization
email listservs. Not distributing through a professional listserv was a decision employed
to solicit participation from each school librarian in a district regardless o f outside
affiliation or level of advocacy engagement. This method o f distribution also helped
reduce the chance the invitation to participate would be rerouted by a spam filter since
the email would be distributed through the district’s internal system. All employed
school librarians in each district were sent the invitation.

s
The third and fourth research questions were explored in a qualitative manner in
addition to the quantitative survey responses. Building upon the responses gained
through the survey instrument, the study employed phenomenological qualitative
research methods to examine the lived experiences o f the participants (Hays & Singh,
2012). Using a small criterion sample of six participants, qualitative data were collected
through semi-structured interviews with school librarians whose responses indicated
higher levels o f advocacy engagement. This analysis provides for thick description
(Geertz, 1973) o f advocacy actions perceived as successful. For the purposes o f this
sample, the definition o f success was specific to the individual and the unique
circumstance of the advocacy engagement and environment. Perceived success was
measured through self-report of the participant and recorded. Additionally, a co-teacher
and an administrator for each participant were interviewed to discuss their perceptions of
the school librarian’s success.
In total, eighteen participants representing six sites were interviewed to explore
their experiences with school library advocacy. Advocacy behaviors and beliefs were
noted and further explored through this qualitative data. The data were gathered and
coded and themes were identified. This led to the exploration of subthemes as noted in
chapter 4 on findings.

Theoretical Framework
School libraries and school librarians are just one component o f the larger
educational system. They comprise one distinct function o f the organizational
composition of modern-day schools. The researcher investigated school library advocacy
through the theoretical framework developed by Argyris and Schon (1974). Their

9

theories o f action models were created in the context of social systems such as a school
setting. As a theoretical perspective, the framework suggests that employees within an
organization can conceive o f an accepted course of action based on their education,
personal beliefs, and organizational norms and these espoused actions would be
verbalized as preferable. However, their theories-in-use, or the actions they actually take,
may be different (Argyris & Schon, p. 7).
Ewbank (2011) found that most school librarians’ espoused theory supported
engagement in advocacy. While 81% of respondents in her study reported that advocacy
was very important to the future o f the school library profession, half o f the respondents
reported not engaging in advocacy activities. School librarians are able to identify and
espouse advocacy practices, but many librarians’ theories- in-use do not show their
engagement due to perceived barriers such as lack o f time, unavailability of resources,
and lack o f priority.

This study explored the difference between school librarian’s espoused theories o f school
library advocacy and their theories-of-use when engaging in activities to advocate for
their library program. Advocacy is an often discussed, yet rarely well defined as a
practice in the school library world. When asked if they understand advocacy and its
importance, most school librarians articulate assumptions about themselves, others, and
the situation (Argyris & Schon, 1974), but have more difficulty applying advocacy to
their own practice. As school library literature shows (Bush, 2007; Hand, 2008; Johns,
2007; Leverett, 2001; Logan, 2006), practicing school librarians will form a theory o f
how to advocate, primarily focusing on program promotion. However, studies indicate
(Bums, 2014; Ewbank, 2011) school librarian theories-in-use show they advocate for
their programs to a lesser degree, citing barriers such as time, fear and lack o f resources
as obstacles.

Conceptual Framework
There is currently a dearth o f empirical research examining school library
advocacy actions in K-12 school libraries. Though thought leaders in the field have
written extensively on the subject, most discussion in the field focuses on how to engage
in program promotion (Bush, 2007; Hand, 2008; Johns, 2007; Kerr, 201 l;Leverett, 2001;
Levitov, 2007). In order to investigate the success o f advocacy within the library
program, it is necessary to explore those actions that place the school librarian in an
influential role within the school community. This study attempted to explore the
actions and strategies of advocacy in practice through the examination o f a school
librarian’s understanding o f advocacy.

12

To guide this study, it was first necessary to identify those actions that school
librarians identified as actions o f advocacy. Using Hartzell’s framework o f building
influence (2003a), those actions that were described as activities beyond simple program
promotion that create a position o f power for school librarians were specifically
examined to identify school librarians engaging in high levels of advocacy within a
school library setting. The tactics developed by Hartzell as means to build influence with
the various targets, or stakeholder groups, were used to initially identify those
participants engaging in higher levels o f advocacy.

Figure 2. A visual hierarchy o f HartzelTs (2003a) tenets o f for building influence.

Hartzell’s (2003a) framework establishes the first stage of building influence as
fostering the relationships required to gain library advocates. To gain influence
necessary for support, Hartzell outlines the above three actions in which school librarians
must engage to build influence for their position and thus create support among their

13

stakeholders. Haycock (2003a) reminds school librarians that teachers and principals
often see them as support staff and it is critical for this perception to be changed. School
librarians must be ready to show their acceptance o f this role and shed negative
stereotypes. If stakeholders within the school view the position of school librarian as
indispensable, they will not support defunding the position or destaffing. They will
ensure that the school library program is maintained as an essential program in their
schools. To gain this type of support, school librarians must advocate for their position,
which supports student achievement using evidence-based practices. Finally, school
librarians must demonstrate they are capable and willing to become leaders within the
school. Leverett (2001) contends that school librarians must be willing to become leaders
not only within their own schools, but also within the field o f education. This framework
directly correlates to the AASL advocacy definition of school librarians building
relationships with stakeholders so that together they can advocate for school library
programs. It furthers that message by ensuring that school librarians are first
demonstrating that they are seen as vital and instrumental to the school community and
places school librarians in influential leadership roles where their message is more likely
to be heard (Hartzell, 2003a).

Delimitations/Assumptions
Currently, there is no state or national database to reach all school librarians.
Dissemination o f information is often dependent upon affiliation or membership in state
and national organizations and those areas with district level library supervisors. Because
o f this, reaching a broad school librarian sample required delimitating factors. In order to
obtain a sample that represents school librarians o f varied socioeconomic, geographical,

14

and professional engagement levels this study drew from a purposive sample (Patton,
2002) of those school librarians who work within a large district managed by a library
supervisor who maintains an electronic communication list by which all librarians in the
district have equal access. These email distribution lists were used to distribute the
quantitative survey measure to all librarians, providing equal chance for all librarians in
the district to have the opportunity to respond regardless o f type of school, location and
professional membership affiliation. The use of large school districts with library
supervisors introduced the assumption that there was some level of advocacy support of
school libraries by virtue o f a district level school library position.
Due to the identified demographic characteristics o f the sample population,
participants also represent those school librarians working in large, predominantly urban
districts. There was the assumption that all participants were practicing school librarians.
School library participants self-identified their certification status on the distributed
survey questionnaire.

Potential Implications of the Proposed Study
This study examined the advocacy beliefs o f school librarians from 36 districts,
representing 17 states. This study engaged practicing, state-certified school librarians in
a conversation in which they describe their understanding o f advocacy and the level to
which they are advocating for their school library program. It also offers insight into
what advocacy initiatives school librarians are implementing into their practice.
Responses provide insight into the perspectives that school librarians and their co­
teachers and administrators have regarding the effectiveness of advocacy actions being
implemented in the field. This will add to the school library literature as the field

15

attempts to define expectations of advocacy for school librarians and explore effective
advocacy strategies at all levels.

Definition of Terms
Advocacy: A deliberate and sustained effort to foster understanding o f the school library
program while influencing the attitudes of key stakeholders. It includes raising
awareness, increasing knowledge, and gaining influence.
School Librarian: A person with an endorsement or certification that includes extensive
professional preparation in the field o f school librarianship. Note: The terms school
library media specialist, school librarian, teacher- librarian, and just librarian, are used
interchangeably in the literature.

School Library Program: The integration o f the services coordinated by the school
librarian including, but not limited to, those within the school library. For the purpose of
this study the definition includes the purposeful hiring of a highly qualified, state certified
school librarian employed in the school library program.

School Library Supervisors: A district-level instructional leader who coordinates the
development, operation, and evaluation of library services to promote student
achievement and teacher effectiveness of school library programs within a school district.

Summary
With few exceptions, there has been little to no empirical research in the field of
school library advocacy. Because o f this, it is difficult to document previous theory from
the current body o f research literature. Often, the researcher draws on the perspective of
thought leaders and those working in the profession of the school library field to

16

understand the historical and current perspective o f advocacy in the field. In the
following literature review a more detailed discussion on the historical use o f advocacy
and its influence on the profession will be explored. Additionally, current methods o f
school library engagement will be described. Finally, information on the conceptual and
theoretical perspectives will be presented.

CHAPTER TWO
REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE
This study’s purpose was to examine practicing school librarians’ understandings
o f advocacy and the advocacy activities they implement into their practice. It also
explored the relationship between school librarian’s espoused practices o f advocacy and
the advocacy practices in which they engage in practice. The study also explores the
perceived success of strategies used by school librarians engaging in advocacy for their
program. This study was guided by the following research questions:

1. How do practicing K-12 school librarians define advocacy?
2. What advocacy activities do practicing K-12 school librarians report?
3. To what extent do practicing school librarians’ understandings o f advocacy align
with their advocacy activities?
4. To what extent are K-12 school librarian’s advocacy efforts perceived successful
by themselves and by their co-teachers and administrators?
The following literature review explores the topics related to this purpose in an
effort to provide context for the how the school library field views the practice o f school
library advocacy both historically and currently. It also contributes an understanding of
how school library advocacy interacts with the school library program.
First, a historical overview of school libraries is provided to establish the setting
for advocacy. Next, the history of the term advocacy is addressed to establish its
meaning and context since beginning use by those in the school library field. The lack of
empirical literature on the topic o f school library advocacy requires an examination o f the
perspectives o f thought leaders in the profession. The researcher will also review the

18

current advocacy engagement of school librarians as documented in professional
journals. Relevant scholarship will establish the conceptual framework o f the study.
Drawing from the literature, the researcher will explore the perception and practice o f
advocacy by school librarians using the three tenets o f Hartzell’s (2003a) framework for
building influence for the position of school librarians through advocating for a strong
library program. Advocacy will then be examined in the context of how school librarians
form their advocacy beliefs and are trained to advocate for their programs prior to
licensure, as well as the continued levels o f resources and support available to practicing
school librarians. The researcher will explore evidence-based practice as an initiative in
the school library field used to gather support for the school library program. The review
o f literature will include an exploration of the theoretical framework o f the theories o f
action demonstrating a dissonance between the espoused theories o f advocacy and those
theories-in-use o f practicing school librarians. This framework will build on the model
established by Argyris and Schon (1974).
Advocacy will be explored in different educational contexts. Advocacy efforts in
other educational subject areas will be examined. Finally, this literature review will
investigate the position o f school library supervisors and their impact on the school
library program.

Advocacy In Context
Advocacy and School Library Standards
School libraries have long occupied a place in public schools. The traditional
school library space was a room designed to house resources. Between the years of 19601998 school library programs expanded their resources, in response to federal funding

19

reforms and implementation practices initiated by new national standards for school
libraries (AASL 1960; NEA & ALA, 1969; AASL & AECT, 1988, 1998).
Lyndon Johnson’s presidential administration first passed the Elementary and
Secondary Education Act (ESEA) in 1965. The goal o f this legislation was to ensure that
all elementary and secondary schools had school libraries o f reasonable quality (Frase,
1975). Prior to the implementation o f ESEA, up to 80% o f students in public schools
attended a school with no centralized school library (Frase, 1975, p.28). Title II o f ESEA
(1965) authorized $100 million dollars in categorical funding for school libraries.
Categorical programs are those that establish definitive national objectives and strictly
limit the recipients in how the federal funds are used (Frase, 1975). Frase distinguishes
that this is in contrast to block funding that allows recipients far greater discretion in how
they allocate funds (p. 1).
Initially, ESEA funds were used exclusively to purchase books, but later
audiovisual materials were added to collections. The title o f media center was adopted in
favor o f school library as collections became more diverse and materials were acquired
in multiple formats. In 1969, the National Education Association (NEA) and the
American Library Association (ALA) created the Standards For School Media Programs
(NEA & ALA, 1969). This set o f standards provided for a written statement addressing
collection development policy and procedures. Additionally, the standards set a
minimum expectation o f staffing o f a school library. One qualified media specialist (per
250 students) would be staffed in a school library to implement and oversee the school
library program (NEA & ALA, 1969). Finally, this set o f standards addressed the need to
teach information literacy skills. The purpose of the standards was to provide students

20

and teachers with the resources and media services to which they are entitled (Sullivan,
1986).
The library standards were updated again with the publication o f Information
Power: Guidelines fo r School Library Media Programs in 1988. Information Power
(1988), jointly published by the American Association of School Librarians (AASL) and
the Association for Educational Communications and Technology (AECT) was pivotal in
establishing an influential role for school librarians within the school environment. These
guidelines portray the school library as an environment o f learning that supports the
learning goals o f teachers and faculty and creates an environment conducive to academic
support and success. The revised Information Power: Building Partnerships fo r
Learning (AASL & AECT, 1998) details several components that establish a successful
school library program. Though not one o f the specific roles outlined, this resource
promotes the opportunity for school librarians to engage in leadership roles with the
purpose o f strengthening the school library program. Through the promotion of building
partnerships for learning (AASL & AECT, 1998, p 47) collaboration, leadership and
technology were emphasized as integral to building effective school library programs. By
becoming a leader and interacting with others in leadership positions (school
administrators, those on school improvement teams, curriculum leaders) the school
librarian promotes the library program as a central resource for the learning community
while connecting with stakeholders and gathering their support. This provides the
opportunity for school librarians to express the importance o f information literacy across
the curriculum and to advocate for an increased role for the school library serving the

21

needs of all students in a diverse manner at a variety of levels within the district (AASL
& AECT, 1998, p. 125-126).
With a focus on standards based reforms in education, the role o f school librarians
incorporated more teaching duties. The library standards established and implemented
through Information Power (1998) clearly identified the roles of school librarians to be
that o f teacher and instructional partner, along with manager o f the library program (p. 5).
They provided an opportunity for school librarians to articulate the responsibilities o f
their position as facilitators o f student achievement to the school community in such a
way as to build an influential place in the educational setting and raise awareness for their
program.
Advocacy and School Library Funding
Though separate funding for school libraries was established with the legislation
o f ESEA, political support for categorical funding did not last. Congress began to merge
funding for all school programs into block grants. When categorical funding fell out of
favor in the mid-1980’s, funding for school libraries was greatly diminished (Simon,
1993). ESEA was eventually replaced with No Child Left Behind in 2001, which did not
provide federal money for school libraries (No Child Left Behind Act o f 2001, 2008).
Though there have been attempts to reauthorize ESEA and Senator Paul Simon proposed
the Elementary and Secondary School Library Media Act in 1993, no national legislative
endeavors have met with success to ensure school libraries have federal support
(Henderson, 1995; Long, 2000). The Ford administration proposed continuing to support
school libraries as one component under the general support program for elementary and

22

secondary schools (Frase, 1975), but school libraries have not realized the federal funding
support they had in the 1960s again.
In 2007 the 110,h congress introduced the Strengthening Kids Interest in Learning
and Libraries (SKILLS) Act. The intent o f this legislative advocacy, which was
supported by both parties o f congress and endorsed by AASL, was to improve literacy
through school library funding (Whelan, 2007). The act provided support for school
library staffing and resources, “ ensuring all schools have highly qualified librarians and
the resources needed to keep up with the rapid changes in technology” (Whelan, 2007,
pi 5). Though proposed, this legislation has never gotten the requisite support needed.
As categorical funding for school libraries ended and continued funding support
was less certain, the school library field established an increased focus on the need to
advocate for the library program. Both ALA and AASL established committees dedicated
to the development and implementation o f advocacy goals and resources (AASL & ALA
2003; AASL, 2006; COLA, 2009). These committees attempt to assist school librarians
as they create advocacy plans. Though the field has recognized a need to engage in
advocacy, there has been no systematic research agenda on the topic (Ewbank & Kwon,
2014).

Practitioners (Cutler, 1896; Douglas, 1959; Gaver, 1957; Thomas, 1976) within
the field have included advocacy activities o f building educated support for the school
library into their practice. Mary Salome Cutler (1896), an early school library educator,
acknowledged the need to build stakeholder relationships as a means to build influence
for the library. She was an early proponent o f seeking meaningful relationships with
community members to encourage community support of the school library. The

23

implementation o f Standards fo r School Library Programs in 1960, which reflected a
significant change to the school librarian’s role, prompted Mary Peacock Douglas (1959)
to highlight library program requirements and ways the school community could support
their implementation. These new standards had an emphasis on student services and the
school librarian’s responsibilities as an instructor and teacher. Mary Gaver’s (1957)
work called for the support o f a school library in each school to support the requirements
o f these changes. Lucille Thomas (1976) developed a school library awareness initiative
in the state o f New York that brought together school librarians and multiple
stakeholders. The intent o f this initiative was to raise awareness o f the potential o f the
school library among educators and community members. All participants had the ability
to make recommendations for improving the quality of the school library program.
Though promotional activities were occurring, they were not widespread and little
progress was made encouraging other school librarians to participate.
In the early 1980’s school librarians began to use the term "advocacy"
(Manheimer, 1981; Birch, 1981) to define the actions of promoting and gathering
influence for their library programs. The specific activities defined by this term varied
greatly. Birch (1981) suggests advocacy must go beyond simple program promotion and
awareness in attempt to advertise school library programs that include acts o f public
relations. This would include soliciting the involvement o f parents in school library
events and articulating library budgets at school board meetings (p. 4). Birch
distinguishes that when advocating, the school librarian is acting in the role o f library
advocate, not teacher, whose primary loyalty is to the cause she is advocating for. She is
therefore not trying to educate, but to influence her stakeholders. For this reason, she

24

noted the message that is crafted by the school library advocate was particularly
important.
In an effort to unify the message at a national level, then president o f ALA,
Arthur Curley launched the advocacy initiative Library Advocacy Now in 1994. This
campaign was designed to promote advocacy by establishing a network o f library
advocates willing to speak on behalf o f libraries and library legislation (Curley, 1994).
His initiative contained a plan to train others across the nation to be library advocates.
This initiative brought advocacy to the attention o f many in the field, and is still active as
an email discussion list monitored by the American Library Association’s Committee of
Library Advocacy. While this campaign did produce a training guide for advocacy
(Merola, 2008), the handbook remains only one of the resources available through the
professional organization in their online repository.
In 1998, after the implementation o f the powerful new set o f library standards,
Information Power: Building Partnerships fo r Learning, Ken Haycock & Pat Cavill
(1999) attempted to rally the national organization to refocus their advocacy efforts and
develop advocacy resources with a single, clear message. Their intent was that the field
progress beyond the activities of simple promotion for the school library program and
instead align more with activities that focus on building influence for the school librarian
and emphasize leadership roles. Haycock further emphasized that advocacy efforts
would need to involve a network of support that extends beyond the school in which the
librarian works and go into the community (Haycock, 1994, pp. 31). Though this was
fully articulated in his study on future directions for the national organization with Cavill

25

(1999), the field has yet to establish such an advocacy agenda (K. Haycock, personal
communication, March 8, 2013).
Definition o f Advocacy by the Profession
The American Association o f School Librarians currently maintains a fractured,
multi-tiered definition o f advocacy. AASL defines advocacy as “The on-going process of
building partnerships so that others will act for and with you, turning passive support into
educated action for the library program” (AASL, 2007b). Though it contains
characteristics o f general advocacy, some practitioners have aligned this definition with
actions o f political activism in their understanding and practice (Johns, 2007; Kirkland,
2012; Schuckett, 2004). This definition coexists in AASL publications with definitions
for public relations and marketing. AASL defines public relations as “One-way
communication o f getting the message across -who we are, what we do, when and where,
and for whom” (AASL, 2007b). This public relations definition aligns more closely with
many practitioners in the field who are promoting their library program. It emphasizes
what school librarians have to offer the school community (Hand, 2008; Hunter &
Applegate, 2009). Marketing, defined as “a planned and sustained process to assess the
customer's needs and then to select materials and services to meet those needs” is also
consistently articulated as advocacy. Bums (2014) found that practicing school librarians
often aligned their understandings of advocacy with this definition o f marketing when
describing providing a quality program as a key element o f advocacy.
The original 2003 AASL @ your Library Special Committee was charged with
creating the definitions and intended for them to exist along with training on advocacy.
The intent o f placing all three definitions together was to show the nuances in in language

26

between AASL's understanding and approach to advocacy opposed to the definition o f
advocacy by the parent organization o f ALA (D. Levitov, personal communication,
January 25, 2014). Levitov acknowledges that training was initially provided to AASL
members on a broad scale through conferences with the launch of the AASL Advocacy
Institute in 2007. This training would lead to a deeper, focused understanding of
advocacy not as easily achieved through a self-directed exploration o f resources.
While these three definitions have different intents, they form the basis of
AASL’s advocacy committee initiatives. This committee is currently tasked with
creating a toolkit o f resources to be used by school librarians who are in danger of
program cuts or elimination (AASL, 2008a). It also maintains a toolkit o f resources to
help school librarians create and maintain positive stakeholder relationships and develop
public relations messaging for their programs so that their program does not encounter
hardship (AASL, 2008b). Other intended outcomes of this committee include the
creation o f a boot camp that provides advocacy training for new school librarians or any
school librarians that seek initial help in creating an advocacy plan using resources that
are readily available. Levitov maintains, “Unfortunately the toolkits and related
resources are not well organized or easily used. They are a bit overwhelming.” (D.
Levitov, Personal communication, March 3, 2014).

Conceptual Framework
Building Influence fo r the Position o f School Librarians
Despite attention from state and national organizations, there remains little
consistency in the field o f what activities constitute advocacy. School librarians,
therefore, have varied perceptions on advocacy in their practice. Ewbank (2011) found

27

that while most supported the need for advocacy, only half o f respondents participated in
advocacy activities. Most often practitioners identify advocacy as promotion o f the
school library program and awareness of resources (Kerr, 2011; Levitov, 2007).
Promoting what goes on in the school library and making stakeholders aware o f the
programs and resources is usually not enough to help others outside the school, or even
those outside the school library, understand how valuable and integral to student learning
the school library can be (Hartzell, 2003b; Kerr, 2011). Many people not working in a
school may not even understand the difference between school librarians and library
technical staff (Amey, 1995; Dickinson, 2006). Levitov (2007) actively promoted the
activities she used in her school library to encourage a robust program, until realizing that
the promotions were short lived and did not have the sustained support that true advocacy
requires to make a program feel essential to stakeholders. True advocacy is when those
who are not the school librarian speak up on behalf o f the program or position (AASL,
2008b).
Hartzell (2003a) contends that school librarians must build influence for their
program and their position through creating relationships with stakeholders. These
influential relationships then have the ability to provide educated support for the library
program. The first tenet o f Hartzell’s framework is facilitating change for the position of
school librarians. Advocacy is multifaceted and includes sharing with other’s the unique
role that a school librarian holds. People tend to rely on stereotypes and their own
experience with school librarians when they do not have other information to draw on
(Oberg, 2006; Johns, 2007). If stakeholders and policymakers are to support a program,
they need to understand the program’s function and how it impacts the academic success

28

o f students (Haycock, 2003b). The lack o f understanding o f the school library program
by others in the school building, especially school administrators, continues to be an
obstacle school librarians face. Building positive relationships with teachers is a good
first step in building influence and redefining the school library position, because
teachers will then become advocates willing to speak on behalf of the importance o f the
library for the success o f their students (Hartzell, 2003a; Johns, 2007).
Slusser (2011) notes the flaw in assuming school librarians do not have to worry
about their job simply because they are doing their job and doing it well. School
librarians must educate their stakeholders about the position. Anytime the school
librarian speaks for his or her program, he advocates for the program (Williams, 2006).
Leverett (2001) suggests that only those who know and understand the issues relevant to
school libraries and their importance will be able to adequately represent them. School
librarians themselves need to be part o f the vocal group (Johns, 2007), but they must have
a relevant message. This will, in turn, facilitate actions required for stakeholders to
become advocates for the programs in a time o f need. They must be able to articulate the
benefits o f a strong school library program and the services o f a qualified school librarian
(Braxton, 2003; Levitov, 2012; Martin, 2012). School librarians must be able to clearly
articulate the strengths o f their own program. Kirkland (2012) warns if the school
librarian cannot demonstrate the program’s worth, it is impossible to expect
administrators, as well as decision and policy makers, to understand it putting the
program at risk.
The second tenet of Hartzell’s (2003a) framework requires that other stakeholders
have the perception that school librarians are indispensable resources. After establishing

29

the role o f school librarians as teachers and instructional partners in addition to program
managers, school librarians must foster the relationships they build with school personal
to demonstrate how their role facilitates student achievement.
One way to improve influence for the position of school librarian in the building
is to increase contact with teachers and take advantage of opportunities to discuss ways
the library can support classroom curricula (Hartzell, 2003a). This assists in the shift of
the school librarians’ role to that o f teacher and instructional partner (Zmuda, 2006).
Administration can support this by allowing time for the school librarian to attend grade
and curriculum meetings and granting time for professional development with other
school librarians and attending functions outside the school day such as PTA and parent
functions (Church, 2008). Support for additional help in the library is also important so
the library can remain open and accessible if the school librarian must be out of the
physical space during the time the library is open.
An advocacy message must be articulated in a way that demonstrates need for the
position and an effect on student achievement (Hunter & Applegate, 2009; Kachel,
DelGuidice, & Luna, 2012; Kirkland, 2012). Ultimately, in the world o f school libraries,
the goal o f advocacy is building support for facilitating student achievement (Braxton,
2003; Hartzell, 1997; Hunter & Applegate, 2009). Librarians must be able to articulate
the value o f the educational impact they have on students and do so in a manner that is
meaningful to their stakeholders (Kirkland, 2012). Though much is said about the loss of
school library positions and reduction in library space and support staff, the ultimate goal
of advocacy is to provide exceptional school library programs that positively enhance
student learning (Tilley, 2011).

30

Church (2008) describes the critical need for school librarians to advocate for
their program. A key finding in her study was that school librarians must be trained to
advocate for their instructional role in the school environment so that others, particularly
administrators and collaborating teachers are aware o f the valuable role school librarians
play in supporting student achievement. While teachers and school administrators may
acknowledge the role that school librarians play in the education of students (Haycock,
2003a) parents and students must also be aware of the unique contribution school
librarians make to the educational experience of students. Lau (2002a) suggests that the
best way to make school librarians more valued is for them to better articulate how they
directly impact student learning.
Library advocacy proponents (Plunkett, 2010; Hunter & Applegate, 2009) stress
that advocacy must be seen as advocating for students, not necessarily programs.
Plunkett suggests using data on student achievement to substantiate this claim and
suggests having at least two facts memorized and ready to recite to stakeholders
whenever they have the opportunity to discuss the library program. Plunkett (2010) &
Hand (2008) suggest that school librarians stress the importance of their services by
showing they are indispensable.
Oberg (2006) and Hartzell (1997) each suggest a weakness in increasing
awareness for the influence o f school librarians and their programs is that school
librarians are not widely represented in educational literature. They tend to publish
articles for other school librarians, not for general teachers or administrators outside the
library field. This perpetuates the reality that others do not understand what is going on

inside the library. School librarians must craft their message to reach the appropriate
audience (Kerr, 2011; Kirkland, 2012).
Throughout the professional literature (Applegate, Schuster & Thompson, 2012;
Hand, 2008; Haycock, 2003b; Kerr, 2011; Johns, 2007) it is further established that
relationships must be built with local stakeholders, such as teachers and parent groups, so
that these groups will in turn advocate for the library program and demonstrate the
necessity o f the program.
The final tenet o f the framework is that school librarians must overcome their
ambivalence about taking on positions of leadership. One aspect of the school library
position is developing the disposition of educational leader- this should be evidenced not
only as a leader within the confines o f a school, but within the field o f education.
Administrators emphasize the need for instructional leaders who are able to provide inservice to teachers and take the lead position in collaborative sessions to plan and
facilitate co-teaching opportunities (Hartzell, 2003a; Zmuda, 2006)). Lance (1999) found
leadership relationships are easiest to establish if first demonstrated at a school level.
Hartzell (2003a) states school librarians must seek leadership opportunities; even
if they are ambivalent about the elevation in power these opportunities will afford them.
Everhart (2007) notes leadership is an innate aspect to the jo b because school librarians
are one o f the few professionals in the school responsible for each student. As such, they
have a responsibility to advocate for greater learning opportunities for everyone in the
building. This can be accomplished by working with students, as well as teaching peers,
as school librarians work to develop lessons and supply resources that support classroom
curriculum (Everhart, 2007, p. 55).

32

One way for school librarians to establish a position o f influence is to lead
professional development sessions at the school or district level. Other opportunities
include positions on school leadership teams, school and district curriculum committees
and technology projects (Hartzell, 2003a). Successful engagements at the school level
will lead to further opportunities to demonstrate leadership and build an influential
reputation (Branch & Oberg, 2001). When school librarians engage in influential
behaviors, this evidence must be used to support the work o f the school librarian and
build a network o f supporters (Kerr, 2011; Levitov, 2007).
Advocacy in Librarian Education
Kaaland (2012) discusses a need to “develop a culture of advocacy” if the school
library profession is going to acquire the skills and resources required to maintain a
dedicated advocacy agenda in which all school librarians can be successful. One facet of
this culture is that advocacy is on-going (Barron, 2003; Hand, 2008; Hartzell, 2007;
Levitov, 2007). This includes ensuring that new school library professionals are trained
in advocacy during the certification process.
The standards o f the profession state that school libraries will be staffed by
qualified school librarians (AASL, 2006b, AASL, 2009). School librarians are typically
certified teachers, meeting state defined licensing requirements established by the state
Department o f Education in which they work. The National Council for Accreditation of
Teacher Education (NCATE) is the current accrediting agency for most educator
preparation programs. CAEP will become the new professional accreditation
organization for teacher education programs in the United States and hopes to raise the
quality o f preparation through rigorous evidence based support for preparing competent

33

and qualified professional teachers (CAEP, 2014). Through a de facto consolidation
process, NCATE and the Teacher Education Accreditation Council (TEAC) have become
subsidiaries o f CAEP, each maintaining recognition by the US Department o f Education
and Council for Higher Education Accreditation for the purpose of maintaining the
accreditation o f educator preparation programs until programs come up for review under
CAEP. School librarians completing programs from NCATE, soon to be CAEP,
accredited schools meet advanced preparation requirements.
There are five standards addressed in the NCATE guidelines: Teaching and
Learning, Literacy and Reading, Information and Knowledge, Advocacy and Leadership,
and Program Management and Administration (AASL & NCATE, 2010). When the
school library standards began to place importance on the roles teacher and instructional
partner, research began to focus on those contributions the school librarians brought to
teaching and learning (Branch and Oberg, 2001). Though advocacy is also a standard in
which pre-service school librarians must demonstrate competence to meet the
requirements o f an NCATE program, the school library field has yet to establish a
research agenda examining the practices of school librarians in this area.
The education o f teachers is a recursive process (Jarvis- Selinger, Pratt, & Collins,
2010; Pajares, 1992). Teachers move from the role of learner to instructor, forming their
beliefs and philosophies along the way. A teacher’s belief system guides their theory of
professional practice. Building on Lave and Wenger ‘s (1991) situational learning model,
Tsangaridov & Sullivan (2003) suggest that individuals who are new to the school library
field form their perceptions and understandings of school library advocacy on the
activities and definitions already established in the field. Through this process their

beliefs on teaching and advocacy are contextualized and their values are created by what
they see, as well as hold in prior knowledge.
In the case o f school librarians, many work as the solo practitioner in their school
setting, so the challenge can be significant to find examples o f advocacy in practice. In
The Trouble with Ed Schools, Labaree (2006) discusses the solitary work o f a teacher.
Nowhere in the school has this been more evident than the role of the school librarian.
School librarians not only often work in a room by themselves, but they are then the only
professionals in the building aware o f the duties and responsibilities o f their job. School
librarians seeking a model o f advocacy must purposely seek to find it.
Tsangaridov & Sullivan (2003) warn that because o f this uniformity o f practice an
understanding o f advocacy may be difficult. More often a novice school librarian is
certified with only minimal training or an antiquated perception of advocacy ideas based
on previous life perceptions, or more experienced newcomers challenge the views and
behaviors of established members o f the organization prematurely (Schultz, 2008). This
further creates misunderstandings of the practice o f advocacy in the field.
Without training or mentorship, school librarians often are left to explore
resources found on their own. Levitov warns some attend ALA advocacy sessions that
present advocacy with an intent different from the published AASL definition. Those
sessions may not meet the needs o f a school librarian or align with the AASL definition
as it was intended. This leads to further misunderstandings in the field. (D. Levitov,
personal communication, January 25, 2014).

35

Advocacy Planning and Resources
Shannon (1996) finds that school librarians are not adequately prepared to be
powerful advocates for their program. School librarians do not naturally know how to
advocate for their program and must seek resources for assistance. However, Ewbank
(2011) found 26% o f respondents mentioned inadequate resources for advocacy as a
barrier to advocacy. Resources within the school library field frequently focus on
building a quality school program or advise school librarians on the benefits o f promoting
their activities to raise awareness for the role of the school librarian.
A systematic, developed plan for advocacy that can be implemented and carried
out for a long period o f time is most appropriate (Haycock, 1994). Due to the lack o f a
consistent definition in the school library field, it is difficult for professional
organizations to develop definitive goals and strategies when developing advocacy
resources. This, in turn makes it difficult for school librarians to establish an advocacy
plan. Establishing an advocacy plan and assembling resources is essential as one o f the
first steps for successful advocacy (Hunter & Applegate, 2009; Johns, 2007).
The professional organizations of ALA and AASL each have toolkits and
websites dedicated to assist school librarians in creating advocacy plans for their
programs. The Toolkit fo r School Library Media Programs (2003) developed jointly by
ALA and AASL provides some structure to implement a strong advocacy initiative. This
resource offers guidance and suggestions for building support for a school library
program with multiple stakeholders in a user-friendly format. Practitioners looking for
usable templates and practical advice from those established in the field can use this
toolkit as an initial resource for implementing advocacy in their own school setting,

36

though it is has not been updated in the last decade and the intent o f the content remains
diversified between marketing one’s program and political outreach. Other advocacy
resources are available through the website o f both organizations, but practitioners must
be proactive in seeking them for their personal use.
Recent initiatives by both ALA and AASL have attempted to reconcile the
fractured structure o f their resources. ALA introduced Advocacy University (ALA,
2013a), which serves as a repository o f advocacy resources members can access for all
types o f libraries. These resources can be beneficial when establishing an advocacy plan
or for use in a time o f crisis. AASL has both resources and tools devoted to advocacy
(AASL, 2006a). AASL divides advocacy resources according to user purpose. The
Crisis Toolkit (AASL, 2008a) has resources and tools for use at to be access at a time of
duress. The Promotion o f Health and Wellness Toolkit (AASL, 2008b) assists school
librarians in establishing relationships to promote program growth while fostering
stakeholder relationships. Though divided by user purpose, both can be found on the
organization website.
While these resources exist through the national organizations, some practicing
school librarians report they are not aware o f them (Bums, 2014). The print format o f
many resources may discourage some who already feel they are short on time (Ewbank,
2011). Instead they may be seeking more authentic, practical advocacy resources;
success stories and practical advice from those with successful advocacy messages is
desired (Bums, 2014).

37

Evidence-Based Practice
Evidence-based practice in education is a concept developed from the medical
field. The concept comes from the problem-solving clinical practice o f using evidence to
identify, appraise, and care for individual patients (Sackett et al, 1996). This included
combining individual experiences with best available evidence from research. It has
expanded to many other disciplines since then, to include education.
Within the educational field, leaders rely on a research-based framework for
decision-making, followed implementation of services for the school community. These
services are based on clearly stated standards and objectives that demonstrate the impact
o f outcomes and services (Todd, 2003). At the school level, Loertscher and Todd (2003)
identify benefits to evidence-based practice relative to advocacy.
Using the principles o f evidence-based practice allows school librarians to make a
visible contribution to learning. Carl Harvey (2010) encouraged finding the best way for
school librarians to document what was happening in the library then using the most
appropriate tool to get the word out to reach the widest audience. Communications of
compiled and documented evidence o f student learning outputs with all stakeholders can
be shared on a regular, continuous basis (Hunter & Applegate, 2010). These continuous
shared reports make a school librarian’s contribution to student learning visible to all
stakeholders.
The school librarian’s teaching role is emphasized when using evidence-based
practice. The school librarian demonstrates a commitment to learning outcomes and
displays library goals and library actions that have a clear student learning focus. Hunter
and Applegate (2009) suggest sharing specific skills (aligned with state and national

38

learning standards) that school librarians teach and are not taught elsewhere in the
curriculum, as well as highlighting collaborative lessons and numbers o f classes taught.
Evidence-based practice demonstrates that funds invested in the school library
were worth it since there is a data-based measure o f student achievement. It also provides
evidence that continued funding is necessary. Langhome (2005) encourages school
librarians to articulate evidence o f student learning with budget requests delineating
resources that further support curriculum objectives and teacher goals in regular reports
to administrators. This emphasizes the position o f the school librarian as instructional
partner, as well as clearly conveys the educational role the library program has in
facilitating student success.

Theoretical Framework
Action theory establishes a framework to explain the relationship between a
person’s values and beliefs and the actions enacted based on those beliefs. Espoused
theories o f action are those that individuals claim to follow, while theories-in-use are
those theories that can be inferred from an individual’s actions (Argyris, Putnam &
Smith, 1985, p.82).
Argyris and Schon (1974) used a case study methodology in educational settings
to test the effectiveness o f theories-in-use. Their findings indicate that most theories-inuse run counter to educator’s espoused theories (Argyris & Schon, 1974, p. 66). The
theories-in-use models of Argyris and Schon are characterizations o f how theory applies
to human interactions.
To create structure for examining the advocacy activities o f practicing school
librarians, Argyris and Schon’s (1974) theory framework was used in this study.

39

Espoused theories comprise the values, beliefs and definitions of advocacy produced by
the school library field which school librarians claim drive their actions. Theories-in-use
are those advocacy activities that can be inferred from the actions o f school librarians
(Argyris & Schon, 1974). In this study, theories-in-use relate to the activities and actions
o f advocacy which are explicitly reported through the survey responses o f the
participating school librarians. Further they are the beliefs then enacted by practitioners
as self-reported and described in personal interviews, as well as the interviews with their
administrators and teaching colleagues.
Espoused Theories o f Action
Espoused theories were examined by investigating the understandings and beliefs
o f advocacy engagement in a school setting. Thought leaders (Hand, 2008; Hartzell,
1997; Harvey, 2010; Johns, 2007; Kerr, 2011; Levitov, 2007) espouse the practice of
advocacy in library literature. Drawing on these stated beliefs in professional journals,
practicing school librarians are able to align their personal philosophies and beliefs to
create an advocacy position.
Espoused theories o f action could be seen in the area of stakeholder support as
well. Popular stakeholder opinions suggest a strong belief the school library plays a
positive role in the overall value of the school (Lau, 2002b; Haycock, 2003b). Lau’s
(2002a) study o f school administrators found 80% felt the school library plays a positive
role in the overall value o f a school. However, this finding may simply reflect the most
acceptable answer. When asked to back up their statements, only 41 % o f the
administrators surveyed said the school library had a positive effect on student
achievement. This finding suggest that there is belief that administrators would rather do

40

without the library in favor o f using the resources on other things viewed more directly
beneficial (Lau, 2002a).
Haycock (2003b) reported similar findings. While teachers and administrators
expressed that school librarians were critical to student success, they needed to be
reminded o f the unique value school librarians contribute to student learning.
Additionally, community stakeholders, like parents, were unaware o f school librarians
educational role and instead viewed them as support staff (Haycock, 2003b). School
communities espouse that the library programs are important, but in practice their
knowledge o f the program suggests that they may not be true advocates able to speak in
support o f the program.
Theories-in- Use
Theories-in-use o f participants were identified by analyzing responses to open
response items on the survey questionnaires. These were augmented by semi-structured
interviews conducted with practicing school librarians as well as their school
administrators and a teaching colleague.
Pajares (1992) notes that those beliefs pre-service teachers hold are the best
predictors o f the theories-in-use they will enact as they enter practice. Therefore, the
actions of a school librarian are directly affected by their beliefs. These beliefs are
influenced by their perceptions and judgments (p. 307). Ewbank (2011) found that 42%
o f participants either didn’t advocate or found advocacy unsuccessful and 62% cited a
lack of time as an obstacle for advocacy. School librarians participating in advocacy may
believe that their actions are not valuable and/or will not be successful enough to warrant
their time.

41

Graber (1996) suggests that teachers traditionally reject new approaches in favor
of traditions they personally valued or previous teaching. Because o f this, it is important
to establish a strong advocacy agenda early in the training o f pre-service school
librarians. This will ensure that advocacy becomes not only an espoused theory, but also
a valued belief that translates into a theory-in-use for practicing school librarians (Graber,
1996).

Advocacy in other Teaching Disciplines
Advocacy is a concern in other teaching areas within the educational system. The
counseling profession has a more mature advocacy agenda than school libraries. Eriksen
(1999) suggests advocacy activities contributed to establishing school counselors as
respected professionals in the school environment. Because it could not be assumed that
the interest o f school counselors would be protected in laws, policy and practice of
schools if school counselors did not take actions to advocate for themselves and their
profession, school counselors implemented positive advocacy initiatives. These advocacy
efforts allow school counselors to practice without the constraints and multiple duty
assignments that are different from what they are trained to do (Field, 2004).
According to Field (2004) there is sparse literature identifying and measuring
essential advocacy behaviors for school counselors. There is even less available to
distinguish how advocacy for those behaviors is developed. Similar to the school library
field, resources for school counselors are available but advocacy lacks definitional
clarity, as well as an understanding o f how advocacy behaviors are learned.
Similar to school libraries, school counseling literature demonstrates a need to
advocate for the profession, rather than the position or the program in times o f crisis

42

(Field, 2004). Eriksen’s (1999) study suggests a need for a clear sense o f professional
identity when advocating for the counseling profession. Establishing relationships with
stakeholders and those with whom the advocacy message is intended is beneficial in the
implementation o f creating awareness for the program. Building a strong stakeholder
support system is critical in establishing advocacy initiatives (Eriksen, 1999; Field,
2004). The language that is developed in an advocacy message must be clear, so that it
meets the target’s needs. Finally, school counseling literature (Field, 2004; Eriksen,
1999) suggests a strong need for demonstrated leadership in advocacy among school
counselors.
The school counseling profession has found that clear articulation o f the
profession, as well as duties of the position help to establish an advocacy agenda. Lack
o f a clear definition o f the position leads to obstacles of advocacy (Field, 2004; Eriksen,
2009). Obstacles to advocacy in the counseling profession can be similar to those in the
school library. Obstacles can be a lack o f communication among stakeholders and a
perceived lack o f value in the program (Eriksen, 2009).
Other curricular areas that have developed a position on advocacy are music and
physical education. The need for advocacy in these areas stems from a perceived lack of
value for courses not emphasized through standards-based education initiatives (Block,
2010; Mark, 2005; Stanec, 2008). Under the mandates o f NCLB, PE and arts education
are considered nonessential (Center on Educational Policy, 2007). However, studies
(Grissom, 2005; Nelson & Gordon- Larsen, 2006; Trost, 2009) show a positive
correlation between physically active students and their scores on reading and math
achievement tests. (Trost, 2009) suggests that students are more focused and alert for

43

learning after engaging in physical activity during the school day. Physical activity also
leads to an increase in on-task behavior. Among some of the benefits cited by proponents
o f music education are benefits in academics, as well as success in life. Students
involved in music education have demonstrated increased math scores, increased
attendance in school, and lower occurrence of substance abuse (Petress, 2005). These
effects on student achievement have prompted educators in the fields o f music and PE to
initiate advocacy campaigns for their programs.
The school library field can gain a broader understanding o f successful advocacy
strategies in a school setting by examining the advocacy initiatives and motives o f these
two curricular areas. Those advocating for music programs initiated their agenda by
preparing facts about the value of the music program in schools for administrators
(Block, 2010; Mark, 2005). Mark (2005) states the goal o f music education advocates
was to ensure that policy makers understand why music education is important to
students, communities, the nation, and civilization (p. 95). Advocates, therefore, must
persuade stakeholders o f the value and importance o f music education. Trost & van der
mars (2009) suggests that physical education advocates argue to policy makers a
balanced rationale that includes the impediments an unhealthy lifestyle will have on
economic productivity if workers are not healthy and fit enough to work. Stanec (2008)
suggests that physical education is more valuable than physical activity alone. The
argument is not whether or not PE is essential; it is the promotion of a healthy lifestyle.
PE helps promote a healthy lifestyle and helps counter the national epidemic o f childhood
obesity. PE educator advocates articulate this position through documented evidence
(Stanec, 2008), similar to evidence-based practice in the school library program. Further,

44

similar to advocacy in the school library, access is an essential understanding for those
advocating for physical education. Barriers exist for many students who do not have
opportunities for physical activity outside o f the school day.
Advocacy in these curricular areas has begun, but continues to be a challenge.
Though advocacy is an ever present need in music education, Elpus (2007) contends that
many music educators feel unprepared to engage in advocacy. Music educators often
seem unable to prepare a compelling advocacy argument when faced with cutbacks or
elimination. Similar to the school library field, the music profession does not currently
possess the training and tools necessary to advocate effectively. Effective resources are
not prevalently available through the national organization. Resources from professional
organizations, such as pre-made PowerPoint’s, may not be the most effective resources
for establishing an advocacy toolkit and enacting an advocacy plan (Elpus, 2007).
Instead the field needs to highlight the importance o f choosing allies and creating a
unified message.
In an effort to improve advocacy in the field, continued research is needed to
support why advocacy is needed for programs such as the arts and PE. There is a need to
design and implement advocacy training seminars in the field. These should contain an
emphasis on how to build alliances and key partnerships in local communities. Having
data available to report to administrators and other stakeholders with decision-making
power is important to provide evidence o f the positive impact of music programs. Elpus
(2007) acknowledges the problem may be less with refining the message, than with the
fact the music educators themselves are doing the advocating. The profession has not
built advocacy to the point others are speaking on behalf o f the program. Music teachers

45

must keep stakeholders, such as parents, in the loop. This will help establish a support
system (Elpus, 2007). Music educators must also be involved in establishing resources
that will be beneficial in enacting advocacy.
Final concerns lie with those programs being immediately affected by funding
and staffing cuts. Block (2010) contends that those in music education need to hang on
to their programs, even if some cuts are made to the program during times o f financial
hardship, so that when economic times improve the program is still available and can be
rebuilt. Though music educators must remain proactive throughout the advocacy
process, the emphasis needs to be on the program rather than the teacher. This can be
difficult when cuts are being made and jobs are less secure.
Through examining advocacy in other curricular areas, school librarians observe
strategies that have been implemented in educational settings. These examples help
school librarians identify next steps in the advocacy process, such as the realizing the
importance o f a stakeholder presence in advocacy. Advocacy within other education
fields provides a context for advocacy in the school building and among educators.
School librarians can draw upon these examples as they build support for their position.

Support of Library Supervisors
School districts operating with active, involved library supervisors have
additional support for school library programs above the school level. School library
supervisors provide a cohesive vision for the district and serve as an additional advocate
for the school libraries. Library supervisors in larger districts can be part o f a team
working in the district superintendent’s office. Bundy’s (1970) report analyzing the
characteristics o f school library supervisors found this group to be somewhat different

46

from other administrators. School library supervisors are predominantly women. Even in
1970, 80% o f the participants surveyed were women. Additionally, most had previous
teaching experience and were affiliated with professional organizations (p. 6). These
characteristics serve to highlight the demographic differences between school library
supervisors and those in other district supervisory roles.
The American Association of School Librarians includes employing a qualified
school library supervisor as a component o f the published position statement o f a
successful school library (AASL, 2012b). AASL classifies the responsibilities o f a
library supervisor to be “those of a leader, teacher, administrator, and communicator”.
As such, a supervisor’s involvement with school librarians impacts the program
significantly as they function as curriculum consultants, evaluators and administratorseach having different levels o f investment and understanding in the importance that the
school librarian and school libraries play in the overall importance o f impacting student
learning.
A library supervisor’s primary responsibility is the direction o f the school library
programs for a school system. In this capacity supervisors serve as leaders o f curriculum
innovation and instructional technology relevant to the school library field. Supervisors
should be transformational leaders (Coatney, 2010). They may have a significant vision
for the school librarians under their supervision and will guide them through professional
development. AASL (2012b) suggests that it is the role of the library supervisor to
provide a framework for implementing and developing a vision for the district school
library program based on the research from the school library field and guidelines
established from state and national professional organizations.

47

The library supervisor serves as instructional leader, modeling best practices for
those school librarians in the district. As facilitator o f the library program, the school
library supervisor collaborates on curriculum, and helps to implement a cohesive
program. Beyond providing professional development, the supervisor ensures that
student success is the primary focus o f the school library program (AASL, 2012b).
The library supervisor o f a district is also the program administrator o f the
district’s school library program. The individual in this position evaluates the district
program, establishes action plans based on research for best practice, and serves as
administrator o f the budget. Additionally, the district supervisor is in a position to
manage personnel and plan and facilitate professional development for district school
librarians (AASL, 2012b; Bundy, 1970). Supervisors participate in the selection o f new
librarians. They are also involved in the evaluation process of school librarians (Bundy,
1970). Even when this is minimized, this creates a hierarchical structure between school
librarians and district supervisors. Supervisors describe their role as recruiting, training,
and re-training staff on new library concepts (Bundy, 1970). Program development and
service improvement were also mentioned. This establishes their position outside the
school library and within the bureaucracy o f the district offices.
Supervisors in Bundy’s (1970) study also had a large role as liaison between
school librarian and school system administrators. They were involved in budgeting and
materials collection. In this way they served as advocate for the school library program
with other stakeholder groups.
As library supervisor, it is important to be able to effectively articulate the
mission and needs o f the school library program. It is also important to effectively

48

articulate a school library’s importance. The supervisor, in their unique position, may at
times be the only person having the opportunity to speak on behalf o f school librarians
and the school library. Most school library supervisors report to the assistant
superintendent for instruction. Some may report directly to the superintendent. The
school library supervisor acts as liaison between all stakeholder groups in the school
community and must serve as advocate (AASL, 2012b). It should be noted, however,
that school library supervisors are in an advisory role with little authority (Bundy, p 62).
There is an understanding, however, that individual librarians are responsible to the
principals, with no direct line of authority from the supervisor or coordinator of libraries
to the librarian (p 62).

Summary
The lack o f empirical research in the area o f school library advocacy leaves
practicing school librarians without direct guidance or a clear definition o f their
expectations. This literature review has established a historical context for advocacy in
the school library field as well as other areas in education. The study was framed using
the theoretical lens o f Argyris and Schon’s theories o f action, implying that most
practitioner’s and stakeholders espouse one set of beliefs about school library advocacy
but hold a different theory-in-use in practice in their school library program. Relying on
thought leaders in the field has helped to establish ways practicing school librarians
perceive advocacy, as well as enact advocacy in practice. This has been demonstrated
using the three tenets described in the conceptual framework of Gary Hartzell, Building
Influence fo r the School Librarian, and supported by the need for evidence-based
practice.

CHAPTER THREE
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY
As stated in the previous chapters, the intent of this study was to explore
practicing school librarian understandings of advocacy and the advocacy activities they
implement into their practice. It also explored the relationship between school librarians’
espoused practices of advocacy and the advocacy practices in which they engage within
their library program. The study also explores the perceived success o f strategies used by
school librarians engaging in advocacy for their program.
This study was guided by the following research questions:
1. How do practicing K-12 school librarians define advocacy?
2. What advocacy activities do practicing K-12 school librarians report?
3. To what extent do practicing school librarians’ understandings o f advocacy align
with their advocacy activities?
4. To what extent are K-12 school librarians’ advocacy efforts perceived successful
by themselves and by their co-teachers and administrators?
This chapter provides discussion o f the research methodology. It begins with a
discussion and rationale for the mixed methods design of the study. An overview o f the
measure used to survey practicing school librarians is described. This is followed by the
procedures for data collection and analysis of this measure. Next, the qualitative
component o f data collection is described. Procedures for sample selection, data
collection, and analysis o f qualitative data are addressed, including strategies to ensure
trustworthiness.

50

Mixed Methods Design
Rationale
When conducting research in social science, the research method is often
determined by the particular questions the researcher seeks to answer (Creswell, 2012).
To gain insight into the overall practice o f school librarians and then, in turn, attempt to
gather additional information about the lived experiences o f a smaller sample of
practicing school librarians engaging in advocacy within their practice, a mixed method
design was selected to investigate the proposed questions. The explanatory sequential
mixed model design was appropriate for this study as the researcher first intended to
collect quantitative data to provide a broad description of the research problem and then
conduct more specific qualitative analysis to refine the understanding o f the participants
(Creswell, 2012, p. 542).
To aid in selection of methodology, the researcher conducted an extensive
literature review to examine current research and ideas o f thought leaders in the school
library field. Additionally, the researcher identified current advocacy resources available
to practicing school librarians through the professional library organizations, American
Library Association (ALA) and American Association o f School Librarians (AASL).
This allowed the researcher to determine thoughts in the field and consider appropriate
research methods.
Creswell (2012) defines research as a process of understanding a topic, adding
knowledge, and seeking ways to improve practice. Creswell (2012) contends that to gain
a broad understanding of the topic using preset questions developed based on the current
understanding and practice in the profession, a quantitative measure should be used (p

51

13). However, Hays and Singh (2012) suggest to gain an understanding in context, a
qualitative approach is best applied (p. 4). For these reasons, it was determined that a
mixed method approach would be used for this research study. The researcher elected to
distribute a survey to obtain quantitative data because of the desire to reach a widespread
population in an efficient manner (Dillman et al.2009; Schutt, 2006). Then, from the
responses on the survey, a smaller sample o f participants was selected via criterion
sampling to participate in the qualitative aspect o f the study.

QUANTITATIVE DESIGN
Surveys are a process by which numerical data is gathered and then statistically
analyzed to identify trends (Creswell, 2012, p 376). Surveys are frequently used to
gather exploratory information. Consequently, they are a time efficient method for
collecting data from large populations to begin to develop an understanding o f the topic
being explored (Schutt, 2006). There are multiple benefits to using a survey to collect
data. When distributed electronically, there is potential for a large distribution area.
Surveys can assist with identifying individual attitudes and beliefs o f participants.
Additionally, the anonymous nature o f a survey allows participants to be more
forthcoming in their responses (Dillman et al., 2009).

Questionnaire Survey
For this study a questionnaire-style survey was employed. The survey instrument
used was an adaptation o f an instrument created to measure advocacy engagement in the
counseling field. This survey was developed by Myers and Sweeney (2004) and was
modified for the school library field in 2011 by Ann Ewbank.

52

An instrument’s validity is the degree to which it measures what it is intended to
measure (Creswell, 2012; Leedy & Ormrod, 2010). Meyers and Sweeney developed the
instrument based on an analysis o f professional literature in the counseling field. The
survey was modified for the school library field in 2011 when used for analyzing the
practices o f school librarians (Ewbank, 2011). During Ewbank’s study, the survey was
used with a pilot sample prior to use with the study population. Therefore, this
instrument was field tested for validity in two settings (Ewbank, 2004; Myers &
Sweeney, 2004).
For this study, the researcher modified the survey (See Appendix A) to include
additional opportunity for open response and to elicit participant responses o f
understanding o f the AASL definitions o f advocacy based on previous research in the
area o f school library advocacy (Bums, 2014). Because o f these modifications,
additional measures o f ascertaining construct validity were applied. Crocker & Algina’s
(2008) model to construct and test a valid measure in the social sciences was followed.
This model had previously been effectively applied to the development o f a selfadvocacy questionnaire in the counseling field and therefore was an appropriate approach
for this study.
The initial steps o f the model included defining the purpose o f the measure and
item construction. The purpose o f the instrument for this study was to determine the
participant’s knowledge o f advocacy. It further hoped to explore the strategies employed
by the participants as they engage in advocacy within their practice. To this end
questionnaire items identified behaviors that represent the purpose. The study used a
modified version o f an established survey questionnaire (Myers & Sweeney, 1994;

53

Ewbank, 2011). Advocacy behaviors were also contextualized by the theoretical
framework o f the theories-of-action used to enact advocacy by school librarians (Argyris
& Schon, 1974) and the conceptual framework of advocacy in the school library field
(Hartzell, 2003a). Response selection was either selected response or open response.
Demographic questions on the survey instrument were selected response questions.
Those questions that solicited information about individual advocacy practices contained
more open response choices to better allow for the unique experiences o f the school
librarians to be captured. The survey was then pilot tested with one school district for
content validity, as well as distribution method.
The final steps o f Crocker and Algina’s (2008) model were then implemented.
Instrument reliability is the degree to which an instrument produces the same results each
time (Creswell, 2012; Leedy & Ormrod, 2010). Because the survey instrument was only
slightly modified from its original form and has been successfully implemented in other
studies (Myers & Sweeney, 2004, Ewbank, 2011), as well as a pilot study for this
research, there is internal consistency reliability of the test. Additionally, Cronbach’s a
(Cronbach, 1951) (See Table 1) was calculated to determine the reliability coefficient of
each construct. None of the pilot participants reported unclear language or a necessity to
reword any questions. Therefore, the survey was not modified from the pilot version.

Pilot Study
In order to establish validity o f the survey measure, as well as to gather initial
support for the method o f distribution and provide rationale o f the proposed study, a pilot
study was completed. A criterion sample was selected. Participants in the pilot sample
were school librarians employed in one district o f the 100 largest school districts, were
overseen by a district school library supervisor, and lived close to a city with a large
population, in a coastal state - as was a predominant factor o f the larger study population.
Additionally, pilot participants represent a sample o f convenience since the district is
located in close proximity to the researcher’s university and contact with the district
supervisor was easily facilitated. Therefore this sample provided a representative pilot
population.
Identical distribution protocol was used when piloting the measure, distributing
the survey link through the district school library supervisor and soliciting voluntary
responses from all practicing school librarians in the district. The district school library
supervisor was contacted for participation as the pilot district for the study. She
forwarded the request to her district Director o f Curriculum & Instruction and District
Director o f Research, who then authorized participation. Per the research protocol, the
researcher sent an email to the district school library supervisor to be forwarded to each
school librarian employed in the district on day one of the study. Participants were
informed o f the rationale and purpose of the study in the introductory email (See
Appendix B). They were also informed that they were acting as a pilot population and
should not only complete the survey as participants, but that they would have an
opportunity to address question construction at the conclusion of the survey. The email

55

included a link to the survey. A reminder email (See Appendix C) was sent to the district
library supervisor one week later and forwarded to the email distribution list o f school
librarians to encourage participation o f those who had not yet responded.
Pilot Findings
Pilot survey results were analyzed using frequency o f selections and content
analysis, as well as descriptive statistics. O f the 89 school librarians employed in the
county, 46 responded to the survey for a total response rate o f nearly 52%. The
participants had a mean 20 years experience in education (range = 3-33) and a mean 13
years school library experience (range = 0-33). O f the 42 participants who responded to
the question, 34 held a master’s degree while 8 had a bachelor’s degree; all held valid
state certification (See Table 2).
School library advocacy was a familiar topic to the participants. The pilot
population felt strongly that advocacy was very important (91.43%) or moderately
important (5.71%). This was likely due to the fact that the majority (61.9%) reported
involvement in a situation where school library positions or funding were threatened,
reduced, or eliminated in the last three years. Those who provided further clarification
explained that library assistant positions had been reduced or eliminated, library hours
were shortened and budgets for library resource purchases were cut. School librarians in
the pilot sample had a diverse understanding o f advocacy. This was indicated in their
varied definitions o f advocacy. The survey asked participants to articulate their own
definition o f advocacy and then to align their understanding with one o f AASL’s tiered
statements on advocacy, PR and marketing. While 64% aligned their understanding o f
advocacy with AASL’s published definition o f advocacy, “the ongoing process of

56

building partnerships so that others will act for and with you, turning passive support into
educated action for the library program” (2007), one third (33.33%) o f the participants
aligned their understanding with AASL’s definition o f marketing. However, analysis of
the forty-two respondent’s personal definitions o f advocacy revealed only one participant
used the word partnership in their personal definition of advocacy. The word support
was used only 7 times and one of those uses carried a negative connotation, “We are not

supported.” Likewise, on-going was only stated once. Advocacy as a process was
mentioned by only two respondents. Therefore, though the majority o f participants may
have aligned their understanding to the appropriate definition of advocacy, when asked
earlier in the survey to define advocacy, they did not speak to the principles o f advocacy
stated in the AASL definition.

Only one participant aligned her understanding with AASL’s definition o f Public
Relations, “ One-way communication of getting the message across: who we are, what
we do, when and where and for whom” (2007b), though 5 participants specifically used

communication as a term to describe advocacy. Further, additional definitions similarly
align to the PR definition though they do not specifically use the word communication.
Nine participant responses developed around a needs-based assessment similar to the
AASL definition o f marketing, “a planned and sustained process to assess a customer’s
needs and then select materials and services to meet those needs: know the customer’s
needs, who are they? What do they need? When and where can we best deliver it? What
are you willing to pay? ($)” (2007b). These definitions focused on determining specific
patron need and aligning library services. One additional definition simply addressed
funding.
Additionally, the pilot population’s espoused understandings o f advocacy often
did not align with their advocacy activities. The pilot sample perceived the greatest
advocacy need (82.9%) to be publicizing the services school libraries and librarians
provide. Often activities o f advocacy got lumped into a nondescript category of
“promoting library activities”. Though activities o f advocacy are designed to build
partnerships and gain educated support for the library program, even those participants
who aligned their beliefs o f advocacy with these ideals and rate advocacy as highly
important do not engage in most of these activities.
Implications o f Pilot Study and Future Directions
The findings from this pilot study affirmed the need for greater exploration o f the
topic o f advocacy. Preliminary findings from this pilot study demonstrate advocacy is

58

not readily defined and understood by practitioners. There is disparity between what
practicing school librarians understand advocacy to be and how they engage in activities
to advocate for their program. This is in part due to lack o f a cohesive definition put forth
by our profession organization around which advocacy strategies can be built.
Expanding this research to school librarians working in various geographic areas
will help identify a more nationally holistic view o f advocacy for the field. Additionally,
qualitatively exploring the unique experiences o f those school librarians perceiving
success in understanding and engaging in advocacy for their school library program will
help identify strategies to build upon. This will help establish a clearer understanding of
advocacy and reposition practitioners to align their practice.

Study Sample
In order to reach a large, national group o f school librarians, the researcher
selected a purposive sample population. A survey was distributed to individuals
employed as school librarians working in the top 100 largest districts (See Appendix E).
The researcher used information from the Department of Education’s statistical analysis
to identify the largest school districts in the US (Sable, Plotts, & Mitchell, 2010). From
this population, districts were identified for participation based on availability o f library
supervisors. The researcher used information available on public websites to identify
district-level school library supervisors or contacted school systems by phone or email
when necessary to obtain the name and contact information o f the individual employed in
this role. 80 districts were identified as employing a district-level supervisor.
Demographic information for these communities is included in Appendix F.

59

Supervisors in these 80 districts were contacted with a request for participation in
the study (See Appendix F). Thirty-two supervisors never responded to the request
despite multiple attempts at contact. Ten supervisors responded that they would not be
able to support the request o f participation, citing their school districts are not supporting
outside research at this time. Three supervisors did not forward the emails directly, but
directed the researcher to a comprehensive email database o f district school librarians.
Six districts requested their own internal research review be completed. The researcher
completed five o f these requests. The one not completed would not have a review board
meeting until after data collection was scheduled to end. One district served as the pilot
population. Therefore, a total o f 36 district supervisors emailed the link to the survey to
their school librarian email roster (See Table 3).

The link to the survey, available on Surveymonkey.com was distributed to each
school librarian in the district through his or her school library supervisor. The
population for the study included 815 school librarians in the 36 districts. Practicing
school librarians at the elementary, middle and high school level completed the survey.
Only school librarians at the school level were included since the goal o f the study was to
explore the advocacy engagement of school librarians.
The 100 largest school districts comprise less than 1% of all public school
districts, but enrolled 22% of the students attending public schools in the United States
(Sable, Plotts, & Mitchell, 2010). This represents a diverse mix of students. These
districts served 35% o f the public school students identified as Black, Hispanic,
Asian/Pacific Islander, American Indian, or two or more races (Sable, Plotts, & Mitchell,
2010). These school districts had a disproportionately high number o f free and reducedpriced lunch eligibility students, with 56% of students eligible compared to the national

62

average o f 45% (Sable, Plotts, & Mitchell, 2010). While this sample population may
represent some underfunded, large urban areas, suburban populations are also
represented.
The districts participating in the study ranged in size. The largest district, NY
City Public Schools, served close to one million students while the smallest in the study,
Shelby County School District in Memphis, had a population that averaged closer to
50,000 at the time data were collected (Sable, Plotts, & Mitchell, 2010). Several states
were represented by more than one district on the list. While respondents to the survey
were geographically spread throughout the US (See figure 3), there were several
instances where multiple districts from the same state were represented. A total o f 17
states were represented in the study.

Data Collection
The online survey was developed for the study with a link available via
Surveymonkey.com. Though there may be bias to those with Internet access (Creswell,
2012), it is assumed that school librarians would have at least minimal access to
computers or a device (such as a smartphone or tablet) with internet access in their work
environment. The survey instrument allowed for both selected response and open-ended
response. Additionally, there were several questions seeking demographic data for the
participants such as school setting and years in the profession. Selected response items
were formatted to require participants to select responses on a scale. The open-ended
response format allowed participants to create responses that best describe their
individual experiences (Neuman, 2000).
The link to the survey was distributed to the library supervisors with a letter
requesting distribution to all school librarians in their district (See Appendix G). Surveys
were posted on Day One. A reminder post was sent one week later. Surveys were closed
after 17 days.

The unit o f analysis for the quantitative portion o f this study is the response o f
individual school librarians on each question addressing advocacy on the survey

64

instrument. Survey responses were entered into statistical software, Statistical Package
for the Social Sciences (SPSS), and descriptive analysis (mean, mode, and standard
deviation) was run on the data. The data were analyzed for frequency o f selection in
selected-response questions. Additionally, parametric correlational statistics were run on
those questions in which respondents self-rated themselves as successful in advocacy and
scored high in advocacy engagement. Demographic variables were correlated to
perceived success in advocacy activities using Multiple Regression correlation.
Respondent demographics were analyzed as predictors of advocacy, as well as success of
advocacy efforts.

Finally, open-response items were categorized descriptively and coded for intent.
This content analysis was conducted as a means to systematically identify and code
relationships within the text (Schutt, 2006). These open- response questions provide rich
information, especially on the topic o f advocacy as the field has little agreement on
predetermined answers and the researcher did not want to limit responses to a finite set
(Dillman et al., 2009; Schutt, 2006). Though response to open-response questions is
somewhat lower than selected-choice, Dillman et al. (2009) does suggest that participants
using an online survey are more likely to respond to this type of question. As this is the
mode o f delivery o f the survey in this study, the researcher chose to include these types
o f questions.

PHENOMENOLOGICAL QUALITATIVE DESIGN
Through the phenomenology tradition, the researcher attempted to understand the
essence o f the participant’s experiences with advocacy in the school setting.
Ontologically, there is no correct way to advocate for a school library program, or to

65

advocate for the school library profession, so each participant brought a unique
perception o f what it means to be a school library advocate. Additionally, as advocacy is
directed toward other stakeholders, it was useful to understand other stakeholder
perceptions o f school library advocacy. The use of personal interviews in qualitative
research establishes the participant voice (Hays & Singh, 2012)

Sample
This study analyzed engagement in advocacy activities and successful strategies
o f advocacy. Purposeful criterion sampling (Patton, 2002) was used to select participants
for the interviews in this study. Participants were identified for participation in the
interview process based on their responses to the survey questions as discussed below.
The researcher reviewed the responses of the 80 survey participants who agreed to
being interviewed and provided contact information. From this sample, a criterion-based
pool o f 28 participants was created based on their self-report that they engaged in a
higher threshold o f advocacy activity and they were successful in their advocacy efforts.
The researcher used the following criteria to identify these participants:
•

Practitioners aligned their belief with the AASL definition o f advocacy

•

Practitioners identified with 3 selected response advocacy activities

•

Practitioners rate their efforts on activities o f advocacy moderately or
highly successful

•

Practitioners self-identified activities of advocacy in which they engage

•

Practitioners rate their stakeholders as advocates for their program

The 28 possible participants were contacted via email using information provided on their
online survey to arrange for personal interviews, as well as to establish availability o f a

66

co-teacher and administrator. A co-teacher and school administrator were to be
interviewed after each participant to gain further understanding of the situational and
environmental experiences o f the participant. Eight confirmed trios immediately
responded and the researcher randomly selected six. Therefore, interviews were
conducted with 18 participants representing 6 sites. After identifying and establishing
initial contact with the participants, informed consent documents were emailed to all
participants and requests for interviews with the administrator and a co-teacher were
emailed. All information was emailed with directions on how to proceed with
participation in the study (See Appendices H, I, and J).
In an effort to maintain confidentiality but allow for a general description o f each
school site, the researcher has assigned each school librarian a pseudonym and each
school has been given a fictional name. Individual sites are described here to provide
demographic information based on participant responses. Minimal demographic
information is provided for the two stakeholder participants, as the school librarian was
the primary participant at each site.

Site #1 "Mako High School ” Rose has been the school librarian at Mako High School
for 12 years. She was previously an English teacher and taught at the middle and high
school level, as well as working as an adjunct professor teaching English. She has been a
school librarian at both the middle and high school level. She has a M aster’s degree in
Educational Media. Mako High School is a large suburban school in the southeast that
educates over 3,000 students. There are 2 full-time school librarians and two full-time
library clerks. In addition to the print collection, the school library has 45 computers and
3 computer labs are located off the library. A student cafe run with a grant co-authored
with the business department operates out o f the library. The school library has been the
recipient o f the state school library award. A 9th grade English teacher and the school
principal were each interviewed for this study.
Site #2 “Thresher Elementary ” Thresher Elementary school is a brand new school in the
mid-Atlantic region. Kelly, the school librarian, has been an elementary school librarian
for 5 years. She was a previous elementary and middle school classroom teacher, as well
as an administrator. She has a Master’s degree in Education in School Librarianship.
Kelly had the opportunity to work as the planning librarian prior to the opening o f the
school and has been influential in designing and developing the school library program.
The school refers to the library as the “Library Learning Commons” and has adopted the
learning commons model. The library is integral in much o f the curriculum and the
vision o f the school and in creating a “culture of learners.” Because o f this philosophy,
the library space is very flexible and interactive. Kelly and her assistant operate her
library on a fix/flex schedule; thoughtfully scaffolding her program to accommodate the
learning needs o f the students. The library includes resources to develop multiple

68

literacies and elements o f “makerspace” functions giving it a playschool feel. The
school principal and a 3rd grade teacher at his first teaching assignment participated in an
interview for the site.
Site #3 “Blue Elementary ” Blue Elementary is an urban elementary school located in the
south. Rose has been the school librarian at Blue Elementary for 7 years. Prior to this
placement she taught 12 years in a middle school and 7 years as a high school teacher.
Rose has a Master’s degree in Library Science, as well as her teaching certification. She
is the only librarian in her school and she does not have an assistant. Her PreK-5,h grade
library operates on a fixed, biweekly schedule where she sees Pre-K through 2nd grade
week one, then 3rd through 5th grade week two. The remainder of the time she
collaborates with teachers on units and projects to support the curriculum. Additionally,
Rose actively runs multiple reading incentive programs and promotions throughout the
year. The school principal and a fifth grade teacher also participated in interviews at the
site.
Site #4 "Great White High School ” Lori has been the school librarian at Great White
High School for 4 years. Great White is located in a large suburban district o f a midAtlantic state. Lori had no previous classroom experience. She worked as a library
assistant in the county for the 3 years prior to becoming a school librarian while
completing a Master’s degree in Library Information Science and attaining the education
credentials to be a school librarian. Lori is one of two school librarians staffed at the
school in addition to one library assistant. She has spent her time at the school
transforming the “struggling” library program she inherited. Her efforts focus on the
library space, as well as the program. Lori’s efforts with collection development, facility

69

updates and collaboration with teachers have been her top priority. An English teacher
and Assistant Principal participated in interviews as stakeholders to represent the school
community.
Site #5 "Bull Combined School ” Joy is the school librarian at a Combined PreK-8 school
in an urban district in the Northeast. The school is a dual language immersion school,
offering instruction to students in both English and Spanish. Joy has been the school
librarian at Bull for 7 years. A previous academic librarian, Joy had an MLS then added
the state school library endorsement after being hired provisionally in this position. Joy
works a four-day workweek in a shared library space that is scheduled for renovation this
school year. She currently has a flexible schedule, though her shared space requires her
to justify her schedule on a yearly basis. Joy and the library program are viewed as
innovators in technology use in the school, especially with the introduction o f the new
technology demands brought forth by the Common Core and the assessments that support
these standards. A bilingual fourth grade teacher and Teacher Leader participated in an
interview for the study.
Site#6 “Tiger Middle School” Linda is the school librarian at Tiger Middle School,
located in a large suburban city in the southeast. Linda returned to the school library
after taking some time off and earning a Master’s degree in Education with a school
library endorsement. She had previous classroom experience as a high school English
teacher. She has been a school librarian for 17 years, starting at the high school level,
then transitioning to the middle school when realizing that students were coming to high
school lacking the required inquiry skills. She has been at Tiger for 11 years and has one
full time assistant who is a retired school librarian certified in another state. Tiger Middle

70

School library has a large print collection, as well as a full computer lab. Linda, as well
as her co-teacher and administrator, consider her primary jo b to be a teacher and
primarily defines her program on this teaching role. She is known in her district as a
mentor on collaboration and has authored a book chapter on collaboration in library
literature. An English/Social Studies teacher and the school principal each were
interviewed at this site.

Data Collection
Semi-Structured Personal Interviews
A single, semi-structured interview with each school library participant was used
to gain further insight into the advocacy practice o f school librarians self-identifying as
engaging in high levels of advocacy. An interview protocol was developed and all
interviews followed a semi-structured format (See Appendix K). The interviews were
scheduled at the convenience of the school librarians and were conducted using video
teleconferencing technology (Skype, AdobeConnect). Interviews with school librarians
were approximately 1 hour in length and were recorded.
Researchers (Good, 1966; Patton, 2002) have established the benefits to recording
interview sessions. Recording helps to mitigate researcher bias (Good, 1966). Patton
(2002) also contends that it allows the researcher to better focus on the interview, to ask
better probing questions, and to be more visually responsive, instead o f devoting his
attention to note taking. Because o f the long-standing support in the education field for
interview recording, the researcher felt it was appropriate for use in this study as well.
Immediately following each interview, or as soon thereafter as possible, the
primary researcher completed a summary sheet for each participant to further record any

71

thoughts or impressions from the interview. Each interview was transcribed verbatim
from the recording. As further interviews occurred the researcher continued to document
thoughts and record memos. Since qualitative research is recursive and data collection
occurs simultaneously with data analysis (Hays & Singh, 2012, p 294) these memos
became additional sources o f data.
Following the interview with each school librarian, one additional interview was
scheduled with a teacher and an administrator from each participant’s school. These
semi-structured interviews were scheduled after the interview with the school librarian at
the convenience o f the interviewee. An interview protocol was developed from the
survey findings to guide these interviews (See appendix L, M). The interviews were
conducted via telephone or using video teleconferencing technology (Skype,
AdobeConnect) and were recorded. Stakeholder interviews lasted approximately 20-30
minutes. Immediately following each interview, the researcher completed a summary
sheet to further note any thoughts or impressions from the interview. Each interview was
then transcribed verbatim from the recording.
Data profiles of each school librarian participant, therefore, consisted o f the
completed online survey, memoing completed by the researcher, a transcript o f the
recorded interview, and accompanying transcripts o f a teaching colleague and
administrator from the school setting in which the school librarian works.
Topics discussed during the interviews were related to the research questions for
the study. School library participants discussed the following topics:
1. Advocacy for their school library program
2. Perceptions of success of advocacy efforts

72

3.

Beneficial advocacy strategies

Stakeholders (co-teachers and administrators) discussed the following topics:
1. Perception o f success o f their school librarian’s advocacy efforts
2. Beneficial advocacy strategies of their school librarian
3. Degree to which school library program is seen as essential to the school
community

Analysis/Coding
The primary researcher conducted, recorded, and transcribed each participant
interview. Each interview was transcribed verbatim within one week of occurrence. At
the onset o f data analysis, the researcher began by bracketing her assumptions and views
on advocacy. This was an important first step to mitigate researcher bias and allow the
voices o f the participants to guide the findings.
Horizontalization, as developed by Moustakas (1994) for phenomenological
research analysis methodology, was used as a means to accurately represent the
phenomenon for these participants to analyze the transcribed data. To begin the
horizontalization analysis, transcribed interviews were coded. This involved analyzing
the data for information from the participants for any experiences relating to the research
questions. Each expression relevant to advocacy was coded on the transcript, using
transcript lines as units o f analysis. The process o f horizontalization regarded each
expression equally, with no one code, experience, or expression having more or less
weight than any other.
Assigned expressions or codes were then analyzed for reduction or elimination.
Expressions that were overlapping, repetitive, and vague in describing the experiences

73

were eliminated or presented in more exact terms. Horizons that remained were those
possible to label and characterized as experiences o f advocacy. These were then grouped
into themes that emerged from the conversations.
An initial codebook was developed based on the horizontalization process. Codes
were identified from the written transcripts and were clustered to identify units that
describe the textures o f the advocacy experiences o f the participants. These textural
descriptions were supported through direct quotations from the participant transcripts and
were identified as thematic codes. The researcher also used memoing to document any
reflections as data were collected and analyzed. A partial-ordered Meta matrix was
constructed to display the data to visually represent the essence of the participant’s
experience as horizontalization was conducted and data were analyzed.
Textural descriptions were recorded and simultaneously reviewed until patterns
were established. Finally, a structural description o f the themes was presented to fully
represent the engagement o f advocacy experience for the group of participants as it
relates to their practice. Once themes were identified, a narrative was created to represent
the findings o f the study. This narrative provides a thick description (Geertz, 1973) o f
the meanings o f the experiences of the participants, including the group as a whole. To
fully capture the essence o f these experiences, the researcher included quotations from
the participants.

Strategies for Trustworthiness
To establish trustworthiness, several strategies were employed throughout the
study. Since the purpose o f phenomenological studies is to examine the lived
experiences o f the participants, it was imperative for the researcher to bracket her beliefs

74

throughout the stages o f data collection and analysis. The primary researcher for this
study is a practicing school librarian with a master’s degree in education and a teaching
endorsement in school library media. She is also an emerging teacher educator o f school
librarians working toward a doctoral degree in education. The researcher has co-taught
one master’s level course for a local university with a prominent leader in the field of
school librarianship. In this course, the topic o f advocacy and development o f an
advocacy agenda is taught according to NCATE established guidelines. She also serves
on two national level library advocacy committees, the duties of which are in part to
identify resources for school librarians. The researcher believes that a strong school
library program influences the success o f students and has adopted an advocacy
philosophy that closely aligns with beliefs and tenets of the American Association of
School Librarians. Each o f these beliefs could contribute to researcher bias, so measures
o f trustworthiness were established.
Confirmability and authenticity were established through a process o f member
checking. The semi-structured interview format allowed both the researcher and
participant to clarify statements during the interview. All participants were provided a
copy o f their transcript and were able to make clarifications and elaborations. This
ensured the participant voice was accurate and the lived experience o f the participants
was authentically represented in the study.
Participant voice was also present in the use o f thick description. The researcher
provided detailed description in data collection reports. This use of thick description
throughout the findings and in all reports o f the data established the criteria o f
transferability. Direct quotations were included in the findings whenever possible.

75

Additionally, a research team was used in the study. The research team was
comprised of one doctoral student and one educational researcher. Both team members
had experience and knowledge in conducting qualitative data analysis. Both had a
background in K-12 education.
Team members served as peer debriefers throughout the study. In this role, the
research team commented on the researcher interpretations o f the data to help mitigate
researcher bias (Lincoln & Guba, 1985). Team members participated in creation o f the
interview protocol. The research team also participated in data analysis.
Lincoln & Guba (1985) acknowledge a researcher can make assumptions or
judgments about data based on subjective criteria when coding data. To minimize this
risk and increase reliability and credibility o f data analysis, two coders participated in
consensus coding the data. Using 20% o f the dataset, the research team members
independently coded the data from the interview transcripts. These codes were then
compared with the codes o f the primary researcher to determine the inter-rater reliability.
Miles and Huberman’s (1994) formula for determining interrater reliability was used.
This formula states that reliability is determined by calculating the number o f agreements
o f raters divided by the total number of agreements plus disagreements. Miles and
Huberman’s established acceptable cutoff o f .70 was used for this study. The researcher
and research team found 90 % agreement in the coding of the data, making the analysis
reliable.

Summary
This chapter detailed the methodology used to conduct this study. A mixed
methods design was used which combined a quantitative survey analyzed using

76

descriptive and correlational statistics and a qualitative analysis conducted in the
phenomenology tradition. The following chapter will discuss the results o f this data
analysis and the findings o f the study.

77

CHAPTER FOUR
FINDINGS
This study attempted to identify practicing school librarians’ beliefs and practices
o f advocacy. Using AASL’s definition of advocacy (2007b) and HartzelTs (2003a)
tenets o f building influence for the school library to structure the discussion, the
researcher examined how closely aligned the participants’ espoused understandings o f
advocacy were with their activities in practice. This is based on Argyris and Schon’s
(1974) Theories in Practice model. Perceptions o f successful advocacy were also
examined. This chapter reviews the sources o f data and presents the results o f data
analysis, organized by research question. A summary of the findings concludes the
chapter.
This study was guided by the following research questions:
1. How do practicing K-12 school librarians define advocacy?
2. What advocacy activities do practicing K-12 school librarians report?
3. To what extent do practicing school librarians’ understandings o f advocacy align
with their advocacy activities?
4. To what extent are K-12 school librarians’ advocacy efforts perceived successful
by themselves and by their co-teachers and administrators
The researcher used quantitative statistical and content analysis o f the national
questionnaire, as well as qualitative interviews, to explore the research questions. The
survey contained questions in 8 categories: (1) demographic information o f respondents,
(2) advocacy knowledge and understanding, (3) activities o f advocacy and participation
in advocacy (4) advocacy resources, (5) perception o f advocacy training, (6) perception

78

of obstacles to advocacy, (7) perception of success of advocacy, (8) perception o f the
importance o f advocacy. All responses were analyzed and questions in the demographic
category, advocacy knowledge and understanding, activities of advocacy, and the
perception o f importance o f advocacy were explored in detail to address the first and
second research questions. From written survey responses and analysis o f the qualitative
interview data, the researcher analyzed the third research question. Finally, the fourth
research question was examined using quantitative data from survey questions in the
category addressing the perception o f success o f advocacy, as well as data gathered
through participant interviews. For the purposes o f this analysis, the researcher will use
the term respondent to identify those study participants who completed the survey and
the term participant for those with whom an interview was conducted.

Descriptive Analysis
A total o f 815 respondents replied to the distributed survey. Based on the
distribution numbers reported by the district library supervisors (N= 3374) this was a
completion rate of approximately 24%. Though this response rate is somewhat lower than
Dillman’s (2009) suggested minimum for surveys delivered online, statistical bias is
mitigated through adequate sample size and the demographics of the sample population
closely matching the demographics o f the US school librarian population. Upon closing
the survey, an export report was created and all survey responses were entered into SPSS.
Variable labels were modified from question number to a name reflective o f the question.
Additionally, the researcher identified those questions in which respondents could select
multiple responses. For these questions (question #12, #15, #16, and #18) the researcher

79

created separate value labels and divided the responses into separate, dichotomous
variables for analysis.
Frequency of selection was used to analyze the demographic composition o f the
respondents. Over half o f the respondents were employed as elementary school librarians
(50.43%, iV=411). Middle school and high school were almost equally represented.
19.8% were middle school librarians (N= 161), while 20.9 (N=170) were high school
librarians. 6.9% o f respondents worked in a combined grade/age school (N=56). 2.1% of
the respondents were not employed as school-level librarians (N=17). Based on optional
clarifying written responses, these represent the responses o f the district supervisors who
completed the survey or teachers assigned library duties in the school. The survey was
designed so that respondents who were not school librarians would exit the survey after
this identifying question, therefore their data were not used for analysis.
Most respondents had between 10-30 years o f experience in education (61.4%).
Respondents often had spent time in other educational settings prior to their placement in
the school library setting. 221 respondents had 6-10 years experience in the school
library and 254 respondents had 11 - 20 years library experience. O f the 783 respondents
who responded to the question, 93% (N=728) held a credential or certification as defined
by their state. Additionally, 82.8% (N=649) held a graduate degree as their highest
degree o f completion. Table 5 shows the demographic characteristic o f the sample.

To provide context to the respondent’s employment situation and investigate their
similarity to the national trend, the survey asked respondents if they had been involved in
a situation where school library positions or funding has been threatened, reduced or
eliminated. Over half the respondents, or 63% (N=489) stated they had been in such a

81

situation in the last three years. Additionally, 218 respondents provided written
comments describing a decrease in staffing o f district supervisors, certified school
librarians, school library assistants and library budgets used to support library programs.

School Librarian Understanding of Advocacy
The first research question explored practicing school librarian’s knowledge and
understanding o f school library advocacy, specifically as it is defined by AASL, the
national professional association. Question # 8 on the distributed survey asked
respondents to provide their personal definition of advocacy. This was followed by a
question requesting respondents align their definition with one of the three statements
provided in AASL’s Advocacy literature- the AASL definition of advocacy, public
relations, and marketing.
The researcher first analyzed the frequency of responses to Question #9,
respondent alignment of understanding with the AASL definitions (See Table 6).
Respondents most frequently (68.6%, N=459) aligned their understanding of advocacy
for their school library program to the AASL definition o f Advocacy “the on-going
process o f building partnerships so that others will act for and with you, turning passive
support into educated action for the library program” (AASL, 2007b). 27% of
respondents (N=l 81) aligned their understanding with the definition o f marketing, “ A
planned and sustained process to assess a customer’s need and then select materials and
services to meet those needs: know the customer’s needs, who they are? What do they
need? When and where can we best deliver it? What are you willing to pay?($)” (AASL,
2007b). Therefore, though AASL has an established definition of advocacy, 1/3 of
practicing school librarians do not immediately identify this definition.

Next, a content analysis was conducted on open-response definitions provided in
response to survey Question #8. While the greatest percentage of respondents aligned
their understanding with the AASL definition of advocacy, the content analysis of
respondent responses does not show an identical correlation o f understanding. The
researcher analyzed the responses o f those respondents who stated they aligned their
understanding with the AASL definition o f advocacy (N=415). A search o f the terms in
the AASL definition found that only 4 respondents used the term partnership and an
additional 7 respondents used the term relationship. Additionally, only 69 respondents
used the term support (by a group) or supporters.
Other terms respondents used more closely align with the public relations
definition, “One-way communication o f getting the message across: who we are, what we
do, when and where, and for whom” (AASL, 2007). 18 respondents used the term
communicate/communication. Promote/promotion was used by 90 respondents who
align their understanding with the AASL definition o f advocacy. Furthermore, 79
respondents who stated they align their understanding to align with the definition of
advocacy use the term needs commonly referenced when assessing and meeting a
customer’s needs through marketing. Additional terms aligned with this definition
include assist (N= 10) and support (of a program/group) (N - 22). Therefore, though

83

respondents stated they align their understanding with the AASL definition, when
crafting an open response the content o f their statements were more synonymous with
those definitions o f public relations and marketing (See table 7). Respondent’s definitions
o f advocacy were contradictory to the language used by AASL. This demonstrated a
misalignment in their understanding o f advocacy.

Activities of Advocacy
Next, to address the second research question, the researcher analyzed the
reported advocacy activities o f the participating school librarians. Using frequency o f
selection, respondent responses from Question #12 were analyzed to explore the
advocacy activities they report engaging in within the last three years (See Table 8).
Activities listed in Question #12 all aligned with the AASL definition o f advocacy, in
that they all represented an activity with the intent to build stakeholder relationships that
could lead to future support. O f the 594 respondents, 391 (65.82%) reported organizing a

84

meeting with their administration to discuss the library program. 294 (49.49%) read or
distributed literature on school library advocacy. 290, or nearly half o f the respondents,
(48.82%) reported elevating their advocacy efforts beyond school level to provide
comments to decision makers through phone calls, faxes, email, or letters. Additionally,
another 39.39% (N= 234) encouraged others to write or speak to decision makers about
library issues. Some worked to build relationships with local stakeholders by speaking at
a school board or PTA meeting (28.79%) or sponsoring an event for parents and/or
community members (22.39%) to gain support for the library. These findings
demonstrate that while respondents may have some awareness of the types o f activities
that constitute school library advocacy, they are not participating in them in great
numbers. Additionally, even those who are participating are failing to reach out to
multiple stakeholder groups within their immediate school community such as parent and
school board groups and community members. A positive advocacy activity enacted by
39.39% o f respondents (N=234) was the encouragement of others to write or speak to
decision makers about library issues. This act of advocacy not only builds relationships
among stakeholders but also encourages educated action o f others to speak out on behalf
o f school library programs, which is a primary goal o f advocacy.

Alignment of Advocacy Understanding with Practice
The theoretical lens for the research analysis aligning advocacy understanding and
advocacy practice is based on Argyris & Schon’s (1974) Theory in Practice. This guided
the third research question that explored the relationship between advocacy
understanding and practice. To address this research question, the researcher analyzed
data from the survey, as well as qualitative interviews conducted with practicing school
librarians at six independent sites.
First, a content analysis was conducted for survey Question #10. Respondents
were asked to describe the school library advocacy activities they associate with their
understanding o f advocacy based on the AASL statements o f advocacy, public relations
or marketing. Responses were first sorted based on respondents’ stated alignment o f their
understanding o f advocacy to one o f the three statements put forth by AASL. Each
response was then coded based on intent of the activity described and results were

86

categorized descriptively. The intent of each activity was analyzed for alignment with
one of the three statements- advocacy, marketing or public relations.
A content analysis of the responses o f the respondents aligning their
understanding with marketing most often supported activities that aligned with the
definition of marketing (75%, N= 161). Responses often referred to addressing the
resource needs o f patrons and teachers. A typical response demonstrating this type of
activity was, “I work to understand the curriculum and the students in my school. From
that I determine the needs for services, materials, and support that I can provide.”
(Anonymous survey respondent, 2014). Table 9 displays the extent to which respondent
responses correlate to their stated alignment.
This content analysis demonstrated a high correlation between those school
librarians who understood advocacy to align with the AASL definition o f marketing and
activities typically associated with marketing of a program. Respondents aligned their
understanding with the definition o f marketing and the advocacy activities they described
as supporting these efforts were largely consistent with this understanding. A small
number o f respondents aligned their understanding with marketing, but then described
activities o f advocacy (9.32%) or public relations (4.35%). Some respondents listed
activities that could not be categorized as aligning with any o f the three AASL
statements. These were categorized as Other (9.32%).

This correlation demonstrated

an alignment between the espoused understandings of advocacy and the theories in use of
the respondents.

Respondents who aligned their advocacy understanding with public relations
identified activities consistent with the definition o f public relations 73 % o f the time
(n=19). These responses frequently discussed types o f program promotion or the creation
or production o f promotional materials for the school library program such as
newsletters, brochures, and emails. Responses focused on promoting the library without
the intent o f creating an educated group of supporters, “I try to encourage teachers and
students to use the library service more.” (Anonymous survey respondent, 2014). Table
10 displays the extent to which respondent responses correlate to their stated alignment.
This content analysis demonstrated a high correlation between those school
librarians who understood advocacy to align with the AASL definition o f public relations
and activities typically associated with promoting a program. Respondents aligned their
understanding with the definition o f public relations and the advocacy activities they
described as supporting these efforts were largely consistent with this understanding. A
small number o f respondents aligned their understanding with public relations, but then
described activities of advocacy (15.79%). No respondents aligning their definition with
public relations described activities o f marketing. Some respondents listed activities that
could not be categorized as aligning with any o f the three AASL statements. These were

88

categorized as Other (15.38%).

This correlation further demonstrated an alignment

between the espoused understandings o f advocacy and the theories in use of the
respondents.

In analyzing this question, the majority of survey respondents aligned their
understanding o f school library advocacy to the AASL definition o f advocacy (N=415).
The content analysis found that most respondents also aligned their activities o f advocacy
with the stated AASL definition of advocacy. Analysis showed that 312 (75.18%) o f the
respondents who answered in this category mentioned forming a relationship with a least
one other stakeholder group as an activity o f advocacy (See table 11).
This content analysis demonstrated a high correlation between those school
librarians who aligned with the AASL definition o f advocacy and activities typically
associated with advocating for a program. Respondents identified activities that
referenced building partnerships and relationships with stakeholder groups as well as
activities to build support for the school library program. A small number o f

89

respondents aligned their understanding with advocacy, but then described activities o f
public relations (8.67%) or marketing (8.67). Some respondents listed activities that
could not be categorized as aligning with any o f the three AASL statements. These were
categorized as Other (7.47%).

This correlation further demonstrated an alignment

between the espoused understandings o f advocacy and the theories in use o f the
respondents.
It should be noted, however, that of those 312 responses in which respondent
understanding and activities aligned, 93 responses spoke specifically to teacher
collaboration and an additional 79 independently mentioned teacher or classroom
support. Therefore, while the responses suggest building partnerships among
stakeholders groups, these partnerships most frequently were fostered among teaching
peers. While the respondent theories-in-use aligned with their espoused theories, they
were limited in scope when enacted in practice.

Type of Advocacy Activity

Advocacy Activities in Context
Additionally, a qualitative analysis o f examined advocacy practices and the

90

engagement o f six practicing school librarians working in a variety of school settings and
levels was conducted. The school librarians participating in individual interviews were
selected based on criteria identifying them as having a mature understanding o f school
library advocacy. Each aligned their understanding o f advocacy with the AASL
definition and identified a minimum o f three advocacy activities in which they engage
and rate successful. Additionally, they were able to provide additional advocacy
activities in their practice. Finally, they identify their stakeholders as advocates for their
programs. Their survey responses identified them as espousing a deep understanding o f
advocacy, as well as a high level of engagement in advocacy activities.

In an effort to determine the alignment o f their espoused advocacy activities and
their advocacy in use, the researcher interviewed the participating school librarians at
each site about their advocacy activities. During the interviews they were asked about
their understandings o f advocacy and their advocacy practices. The experiences o f each
o f these and the characteristics of their individual settings influenced their individual
perception o f advocacy. The lived experiences o f the participants contributed to the
identification o f multiple textural themes, which exemplify how advocacy is viewed
uniquely at each site. However, common structural themes were identified from the data.
The findings o f how their understandings of advocacy aligned with their activities o f
advocacy in practice are reported addressing four themes from the data: Revitalize the
position o f the school librarian, Emphasize the teaching role of the school librarian,
Innovation o f the school librarian, Relevance of the school library program to today’s
learner.

91

Revitalize the Position o f the School Librarian
Participants at each site felt a need to change the perception o f the position o f the
school librarian among their stakeholders as one o f their primary objectives in advocacy.
This was easier for some than others. Kelly works in a new school designed around the
new vision o f a library learning commons. She was able to introduce “maker” elements
and a flexible, adaptable concept of the school library from the day the school opened to
both school and community stakeholders. While she admits she had an advantage
starting with a new community of educators, the school itself is comprised o f staff from
“different schools and different backgrounds and so there’s a lot of training and thinking
that needs to go into how they view the library learning commons and how they see that
as part o f the school culture.”
Sharon, conversely, works independently on a fixed schedule and maintains the
need to be ever engaged in actively supporting students and demonstrating how the
school library is an integral part of the school. To facilitate this perception she maintains
an active, teaching library schedule, “I have to do library work too, but you know, I ’m on
the computer, I’m doing inventory, but if I’m, you know, doing anything other than
teaching than it looks like I’m really not doing, you know, what I should be doing.”
Redefining the perception of the school library to stakeholders outside the school
building was also essential to the participants. The school librarians engaged in
activities that build partnerships with community members and decision makers in an
effort to demonstrate how the school library program and the position o f the school
librarian have evolved in recent years. In addition to activities that simply promote the

92

school library such as newsletters, the participants engaged stakeholder groups in the
activities o f the library. Rose, Kelly, Lori, and Joy all offer extended hours and flexible
access in their library with the intent o f bringing in not only students, but other
stakeholder groups as well.
Volunteering for leadership duties within the school and the district has also been
an effective advocacy strategy for several of the participants. Both Kelly and Linda state
that as the school librarian they have been assigned permanent seats on the school
improvement leadership team at their schools. Not only do they feel this demonstrated to
stakeholders within the school that the librarian is an important, central figure to the
school team, it provided yet another platform for getting the library message out to
multiple groups of stakeholders.
Leading professional development sessions within the county or at district or state
events was another way these librarians have demonstrated their leadership abilities. Lori
detailed how she recently volunteered to chair the advocacy committee for her districtwide librarian community. Linda shared her experiences leading professional
development on new technologies and teacher/librarian collaboration for not only school
librarians, but classroom teachers as well. By sharing knowledge with not only other
school librarians, but other educators, opportunities to influence the perception o f the
school library were available and positive relationships were created with other
stakeholders.
Additionally, these types o f professional development have led to administrator
support and the mentor role Linda has been invited to assume with other school librarians
in her district. She describes o f her administrator,

93

I have benefitted from a lot of very vocal support... She has gone into schools
where she felt that the [school librarian] needed to come and talk with me, to
kind o f learn some things about how to be, um, more involved in designing
lessons and that sort of thing. So I’ve had at least 4 people that she has sent
me to and said, ‘I’ll free you up to go spend the day,’ which is a real compliment.
Emphasize Teaching Role o f School Librarian
A second way each participant aligned her espoused understandings o f advocacy
with the activities in her practice was by emphasizing her role of teacher or instructional
partner. Empowering Learners: Guidelines for School Library Media Programs charged
school librarians with five roles (AASL, 2009, p. 16). The roles of teacher and
instructional partner explicitly support the academic goals o f students through curriculum
development, collaboration with other teachers, co-planning of lessons, and direct
instruction of students.
Participants in the study described building stakeholder support by becoming
indispensable partners in student learning. Joy routinely attended common planning
meetings with teachers in her school to ensure she was informed of new developments
with implementing the Common Core. Sharon described how her program supports the
classroom curriculum,
We do a lot o f team teaching. You know, when I start teaching, the teachers join
in with me. It’s based on something that they’ve already taught or they’re getting
ready to teach- or you know. So, it’s related. It w asn’t always like this.
Though all participants admitted that there would always be a teacher or a stakeholder
that could not be reached or who would be unwilling to work with the school librarian,
both Sharon and Lori felt word o f mouth was the best way to solicit collaboration with
other teachers.

94

Stakeholder support was facilitated by creating a perception o f expertise among
their teaching colleagues and outside stakeholders. One area that remained the domain of
participating school librarians was research. Most school librarian participants described
facilitating research instruction within their school community. However, Joy found that
the new rigors and complexity o f implementing the Common Core State Standards
provided an opportunity to demonstrate her teaching role in a way that assisted teaching
in an area in which she felt more capable than her teaching peers. She describes, “there’s
a big writing unit that requires research. And I think the teachers were kinda spinning
their wheels about that until I stepped in and I essentially took over that piece of that one
unit.” While she acknowledged that it is just one part of one unit, it was enough to
demonstrate a valuable teaching service she could provide to begin to change
perceptions.
Linda’s entire program centers on her teaching. Even her administrator
commented, “she probably teaches more than any school librarian I’ve ever worked
with.” Linda’s vision for her library program is to enhance student learning and the
curriculum.
Innovation o f School Librarian
The participants in the study each recognized the need to demonstrate something
unique or innovative in their program. Their understanding o f the need to build
stakeholder relationships and educated support was enacted by purposefully and
intentionally seeking opportunities to demonstrate unique and innovative experiences or
resources found in the school library program.

95

Joy explained that often the best way to create support of a program is by
identifying an element that is not being offered anywhere else. When stakeholders
perceive that something o f value can only be met through the school library program,
they are more likely to support the library. Joy was able to accomplish this as a leader in
technology integration in her school. While the teaching focus in her school was on
language, she forged ahead with technology and online resources. She explains,
“Technology just wasn’t a focus. This year with the Common Core and PARC te sts ,...
stakeholders have placed more o f an emphasis on it.” Through her efforts, she has
acquired a set o f IPads and Chrome books and made her program innovative through the
perception of her stakeholders.
Participants point out that often innovation comes in the form o f technology.
Kelly realized that the perception o f a school library as a physical space must change.
Acknowledging a virtual space in addition to her library learning commons, she noted the
future importance o f this into the future,
We have our website that I’ve created that is very interactive in nature and houses
many, many resources for our students and is constantly curated and changing. It
is a space that is curated and created by me but we’re giving more voice to our
students with that as well, even the elementary level. So, I think those are ways
we can start thinking about ourselves not only as a physical space, but as a virtual
space, so that we can make sure that we are giving every body access as often as
we possibly can.
She extended her ideas o f access to include social media and librarian “chat” features.
These virtual spaces further reshaped the perceptions of her already innovative space.
Relevance o f the School Library Program to Today’s Learner
A final theme that resonated throughout the participant interviews was the need
for authentic learning experiences relevant to today’s learners. Participants understood

96

that their greatest opportunity to change the perception of school libraries for all
stakeholder groups and to build an educated support group among those stakeholders was
to ensure that school library users engage in experiences that are relevant to today’s
learners.
Participants discussed advocacy activities that not only promote library programs,
but also included activities that show the relevance and authenticity o f the program to the
stakeholders they are attempting to reach. When Kelly invited parent and community
members in for informational sessions, she engaged stakeholders in hands-on discovery
learning activities that resemble the opportunities students participate in during the school
day. She explained the ideal behind engaging in experiences that involved multiple
literacies, similar to the experiences everyone encounters in real life. Kelly’s
administrator explained that these activities are designed to encourage 21st Century
learning skills such as problem solving and critical thinking.
Other participants built this into the content of their program and lessons. Linda
described building lessons that engage students in discovering real-world situations. By
building lessons that aligned with curriculum and also had relevance to today’s learner,
Linda’s students interacted with resources and deepened their content knowledge of
complex concepts. Describing a unit researching developing nations she stated, “7th
graders are just beginning to develop their social consciousness. It’s very
overwhelming.” Her approach allowed them to explore these difficult concepts through a
guided inquiry process. Finally, Sharon knew that to engage her urban population and
have her teachers perceive her program as support and not additive to their curriculum,
she needed to ensure that her students find her lessons relevant.

97

Perception of Advocacy Success
The final research question examined the participant’s perception o f advocacy
success. It also addressed the perceptions o f success of other stakeholders. To address
this question the researcher first examined participant responses to the survey. Next, a
multiple linear regression correlation was run to determine statistical significance
between the stated success o f the advocacy activities and the demographic variables
provided by the population. Finally, a qualitative analysis was conducted of the each o f
the interviews, to include the teacher and administrative stakeholder for each site, to
explore the perceived advocacy success o f the school librarian.
Question #13 on the survey asked respondents to rate their perceived success with
activities that align with the AASL definition of advocacy which involves building
partnerships in an effort to build an educated group o f supporters for the school library
who will in turn act as supporters themselves of the library program. Participants were
asked to rate their perceived success for each advocacy activity in which they participate
as either highly successful, moderately successful, not very successful, or to select they
have not participated in the activity. As there was no way to provide a measurement to
guide the respondent’s choices, analysis included only the responses o f respondents who
had participated in the identified activities and responses were grouped dichotomously as
either successful or not successful. This provided a basis for understanding which
activities the respondents engaged in as activities in their strategies-in-use and which of
those they perceived as successful in their practice (See table 12).

Overall, respondents who engaged in these activities perceived the greatest
amount o f success in speaking at a school board or PTA meeting (88.55%). Reaching out
to parent and community stakeholders was perceived to be effective by most stakeholders
who attempted to engage in this type o f advocacy. Organizing a meeting with
administration to discuss the library program was also effective. 86.11% o f respondents

99

who reported participating in this activity (n= 432) reported this to be successful. While
all o f the activities had a high perception o f success, those that were perceived to be
slightly less successful were attending a library legislative demonstration (68.63%),
establishing an advisory committee (66.97%), and encouraging others to write or speak
on behalf o f the library program (64.34%). Though compared to overall survey
responses, the number of respondents who participated in each of these activities was not
high, those who did participate in the activities perceived them to be successful.
Next, a multiple linear regression was run on each o f the advocacy activities to
explain a correlation between the activity and the respondent’s demographic
characteristics to predict a statistical likeliness of perceived success should they engage in
the activity. The results o f this regression analysis indicated statistical significance
between the activities and some o f the demographic characteristics o f the respondents.
This suggested there was a correlation between some demographic features and the
predicted perceived success o f advocacy activities. An analysis o f each factor follows.
Analysis o f the perceived success o f establishing an advocacy committee for a
school library did not have an overall statistical significance among respondents. There
was no statistically significant difference in the perceived success o f the activity of those
who established an advocacy committee for their school library (R2 = .011, F (7, 482) =
.738; p< .05). There were, however, three factors that predicted a statistically significant
difference in the variance in the perceived success o f the school librarians. Those factors
were the education level o f the school librarians (13=. 119,/? = .05), the holding o f state
credentials (13= .088, p= .05) and the librarian’s beliefs about the importance o f advocacy

100

to the future o f the profession (B= .126,/?=. 05). Each of these predictors impacted the
perceived success o f advocacy of a library committee.

Success in Context
Additionally, at each of the six sites, the school librarian, as well as an
administrator and teaching peer, provided their perception o f advocacy success. Findings
from these experiences were presented through two common themes. Participants
captured experiences in which advocacy success was evaluated through either informal or
formal output measures.
Informal Measures o f Perceived Success
The perception o f success most prevalently held by all stakeholders was that most
difficult to evaluate in a formalized manner. School librarians and interviewed
stakeholders perceived success through intangible measurements o f the experiences

110

students and teachers demonstrate from successful relationships with the school library
program. Teacher and administrator stakeholders equated this perception o f success to
how students and teachers react and interact with the library program. The co-teacher at
site #4 talked about “reading the excitement in her student’s eyes” when going to the
school library. The administrator at site #2 described how when she informally asks
students, “What is the best thing about our new school, what do you love about our new
school?- They’ll say something in connection to the library.” showing excitement and
enthusiasm for the programs and the opportunities it offers.
School librarians correlated success in advocacy to a new perception o f
importance for the school library. Joy explained one way she measures her success is
that the school library has become a frequent visit on orientation tours for the school.
This showcasing o f her space demonstrated an elevated status for her program by
building-level stakeholders. Kelly explained that she was invited to not only host a
district principal’s meeting in her school library space, she was then invited to lead the
meeting. This elevation in perception among stakeholders demonstrated success to these
school librarians in that the school library and the school librarian were influential in
building new relationships.
Study participants stated that the best measure of success for advocacy that has
created strong relationships and support for the library programs came in the form o f
anecdotal evidence. The co-teacher at site #2 explained the overall impression o f his
students about the school library learning commons and the excitement the school
librarian has managed to create for the space,
I was just thinking about, reflecting upon my students and their general demeanor
when it comes to the library and just... How excited they get to go, and um, how

Ill

they are when they are there. They are totally engaged and really into being in the
space and learning.
Additionally, the co-teacher for Site #5 struggled to come up with a definitive measure of
success, though he knew it existed in his school from the excitement that his school
librarian had renewed in the library program,
I know she has been successful because one o f her goals this year was a higher
percentage o f circulation and she surpassed that goal. I know that because she
sent an email saying thank you. So in that sense she has been successful in using
the library as a center for, I don’t know, loving literacy and reading. But I think
you can see it in the school when there’s just this love for reading and the kids are
walking down the hallway holding onto their books like it’s an accessory. So,
that to me shows some success in what she is trying to accomplish.
Formal Measures o f Perceived Success
Some participants relied on traditional library output measures to form their
perception o f success. The administrator o f Site #1 felt advocacy was part o f the school
librarian’s job description and could be evaluated by circulation numbers and scheduled
use of the school library. In order to gain the perspectives o f some o f her stakeholders,
the school librarian at this site did include a survey distributed to building-level
stakeholders, such a students and teachers, to obtain their perspective on the success o f
advocacy efforts throughout the year.
Kelly’s administrator intended to use formalized outputs, but evaluate them in a
more informative manner. Instead o f simply measuring the percentage o f time the library
learning commons was used and the amount o f collaborative lessons that were planned,
she and Kelly hoped to track the percentage o f time these interactions are initiated by
teachers other than the school librarian. It is intended that tracking these interactions will
provided a deeper understanding of the success of the school library program’s position

112
in in the school culture. This will occur with the informal measures they already feel
provide plentiful data on the success o f their school library program.
Other school systems have followed the new norm in education where
accountability is tracked using standards. Site # 6 has made efforts to formalize the
evaluative process. This site was located in a state currently updating the state evaluation
tool for school librarians, which will reflect advocacy as an evaluation area. Both the
school librarian and the school principal were aware that to address this new standard, a
formalized measure o f success would be necessary. This opened new dialogue between
the school principal and the school librarian on new initiatives to implement, as well as a
means to evaluate the success of these efforts. Their conversations have reflected a plan
for next school year that will identify under-served stakeholder groups and create
opportunities for programing and support for these groups.

Summary
This chapter reported both the quantitative and qualitative findings o f the study.
Each research question was analyzed and explored. Practitioner beliefs and
understandings were analyzed through descriptive quantitative analysis o f the survey
responses, as well as a content analysis of the respondent’s open response answers
showing that there is a lack o f consistency in how practitioners define advocacy and the
definition the school library field has established. School librarians identified advocacy
activities they had participated in. Highest percentages identified with activities engaging
stakeholders at the school or building level. The alignment o f advocacy understanding
with practice was explored with a content analysis, as well as through individual school
librarian interviews. These analyses demonstrated a majority of respondents identify a

113

variety o f activities they engage in within their practice that align with their
understanding o f advocacy. A multiple regression correlation exploring demographic
variables and perceived success o f selected advocacy activities showed a statistical
significance between the 7 analyzed demographic factors and reading and distributing
advocacy literature, attending a political event, providing comments to decision makers,
and encouraging others to contact decision makers. This analysis assists in suggesting
factors that influence perceptions o f success when engaging in advocacy activities.
Additionally, participant interviews at each of the sites with the school librarians, as well
as a teaching peer and an administrator led to findings suggesting that success in practice
is perceived through informal and formal output measures.
In the following chapter, these findings will be discussed as they relate to views in
school library literature. Implications for practice in strategic planning for advocacy will
be suggested based on these findings. Finally, recommendations o f future research will
be presented.

CHAPTER 5
DISCUSSION
This final chapter contains a summary of the dissertation and presents a
discussion o f the findings introduced in chapter four. It begins with an overview,
including the intent o f the study, the problem the study addresses, a summary of the
population, and the methodology. Each finding is discussed in relation to the four
research questions. The findings are positioned within the perspective o f the conceptual
and theoretical framework identified for the study. Limitations of the study are included.
The chapter concludes with final implications and suggestions for future research.

Overview of the study
This investigation is designed to explore how practicing school librarians define
advocacy, engage in advocacy in their practice, align their understandings o f advocacy
with their practice, and perceive their success in advocacy. The rationale for this
exploration is the noted lack of consistency in how school librarians interpret and engage
in advocacy. Multi-leveled definitions within the literature o f the national professional
organization, AASL, and inconsistent alignment o f definitions with other types o f
libraries add to inconsistency in the school library field.
The sample includes 815 practicing school librarians from 36 o f the 80 largest
school districts with identified district school library supervisors. Though the population
o f the study represents only school librarians from the 100 largest school districts in the
US (Keaton, 2012), the demographic characteristics of the sample closely resemble the
national demographics o f practicing school librarians as a whole as presented by the
National Center for Education Statistic’s Characteristics o f Public Elementary and

115

Secondary School Library Media Centers in the United States: Results from the 20112012 Schools and Staffing Survey (Bitterman, Gray, & Goldring, 2013). The NCES
report finds 56% o f school libraries to be elementary, 16% middle school, 20% high
school, and 8% to be combined schools. These numbers are comparable to the
respondent demographics o f the population sample (see Table 5, page 79).
Nationally, 67% o f public school libraries are reported as being staffed by a
certified or state credentialed school librarian and 52% of school librarians report having
a master’s degree. These numbers are slightly below the demographic composition o f the
sample in this study. The sample population of this study reported 93% hold a state
credential and 82% have a minimum of a master’s degree. These slightly higher than
national averages may be influenced by the school districts in the study having a school
library supervisor. One criteria o f selection for this study’s population is the existence of
a school library supervisor. Since the literature (AASL, 2012b; Bundy, 1970; Carter,
1971) suggests that one o f the duties of a library supervisor is to ensure that there is a
highly qualified school librarian in charge of the library program, a more qualified
sample would be expected in the schools in the sample.
This research is conducted using an explanatory sequential mixed methods
design. Quantitative measures are used to gain a broad sense of respondent
understandings and beliefs of advocacy and the activities they align with those beliefs.
This information is then explored more deeply through qualitative interviews. Analysis
is done using parametric statistical measures, content analysis and qualitative analysis
conducted in the phenomenology tradition providing a multifaceted examination of the
research questions.

116

Interpretations of the Findings
Hartzell (2003b) proposes that to effectively create educated support among
stakeholders, school librarians must build influence for the school library program and
the school librarian position. He describes three tenets necessary to build stakeholder
relationships to foster this type o f needed support. School librarians must focus their
advocacy efforts on changing the perception of the school library position and creating a
perception of indispensability for the school library program. These efforts are often
achieved when school librarians overcome their own ambivalence about seeking a more
prominent role in the school community. These tenets provide context for the discussion
o f the findings for this study.

Beliefs or Understandings of Advocacy
The initial research question in the study seeks to identify what current knowledge
practicing school librarians have o f advocacy. Definitions o f advocacy, marketing, and
public relations put forth by the national school library association, AASL, are used to
provide context for the discussion. These definitions were posted as part o f the
Advocacy Toolkit (AASL) for school librarians in 2007, created by the AASL Advocacy
Committee and expand the work o f the @ Your Library publication The Toolkit fo r
School Library Media Programs ( AASL, & ALA, 2003).
In this study, survey respondents are initially asked to provide open-response
definitions of advocacy. Most respondents are able to construct a definition. When
asked to align their understanding o f advocacy with one o f the three AASL definitions,
68.61% of respondents align their understanding with the AASL definition o f advocacy.

117

However, a content analysis of the school librarian definitions does not mirror alignment
o f understanding.
When building influence for the school library it is necessary to gain influence
within the school community. Participants did not demonstrate an understanding o f this
tenet or how it may be achieved through advocacy for their program through their
responses. They initially align their beliefs with the needs-based marketing model,
expressing this alignment by using terms commonly associated with this such as needs,
assist, and support (of a group/program). By using terms that align their understanding
with a marketing definition, school librarians in this study demonstrate the belief that
they must persuade stakeholders that they can meet and support their needs. Marketing is
one component o f advocacy, as it helps provide a foundation on which to build
relationships o f support. However, these activities might better be classified as simple
program promotion. School librarians in this study have difficulty distinguishing the
meaning o f advocacy as defined by AASL.

Practitioner Activities of Advocacy
The second research question examines the advocacy activities of the
respondents. Advocacy, from the school library perspective, is a step beyond program
promotion (Kerr, 2011; Levtiov, 2007) to the changing of perceptions of the school
library with the intent to educate a stakeholder base and build program supporters
(Schuckett, 2004). To explore this research question, activities congruent with the AASL
definition o f advocacy are identified and participants are asked to identify those in which
they participate.

118

Participation rates fall below 50% for all but one selected response activity on the
survey. The only activity with above 50% participation is “organized a meeting with
administrator to discuss the library program.” This finding suggests that while this
population of school librarians report they have been involved in situations o f defunding
and destaffing (62.77%) and while 68.61% align their understanding of advocacy with a
definition that would support the activities on the survey, participants are not regularly
engaging stakeholders other than their administrative staff. Furthermore, school
librarians are engaging in activities that reach out to parents and members o f the school
community at surprisingly low rates. Only 22.39% have sponsored an advocacy event
for parents or school community members, and 28.79% have spoken at a school board or
PTA meeting; 29.39% have conducted professional development for staff on school
library advocacy. Respondents are not regularly participating in or initiating activities
that foster stakeholder relationships and provide opportunities to build supporters for the
library program, even with members of their immediate school communities. They then
do not have an educated base of supporters when times of crisis arise.

Espoused Beliefs vs. Advocacy-in-Use
The complex Theories in Practice model (Argyris and Schon, 1974) suggesting
that school librarians espouse one set of beliefs and may implement a different, slightly
altered theory in practice has guided much o f the conversation and analysis o f this study.
This research attempts to examine how closely a practicing school librarian’s
understanding o f advocacy, and therefore espoused belief, aligns with the librarian’s
theory-in-use or practice o f advocacy. Though 68.61 % of participants align their
understanding o f advocacy with AASL’s definition, “the on-going process of building

119

partnerships so that others will act for and with you, turning passive support into
educated action for the library program” (AASL, 2007b), the only advocacy activity in
use by at least 50% o f respondents was organizing a meeting with an administrator. Each
o f the other activities designed to build stakeholder partnerships are used by a small
number o f the respondent population. This suggests that their theories-in-use do not align
with their espoused understanding o f advocacy.
Open response activities are examined intending to align respondent advocacy-inuse with espoused understanding o f advocacy. Approximately three-quarters of
respondents align their activities with their understanding regardless o f the statement they
most identify with advocacy (advocacy= 75%, marketing= 77%, PR= 73%). This
demonstrates congruence between their espoused theory and their theory-in-use when
given the opportunity to provide examples from practice.
However, their theories-in-use are not fully developed to include a thorough
understanding o f the definitions. The largest set o f respondents aligns their
understanding with the AASL definition o f advocacy. The analysis shows that while they
do align their espoused theory with a stated theory-in-use that also aligns with the AASL
definition o f advocacy, nearly one half does not identify any stakeholder partnerships
beyond that of the school librarian and classroom teacher. Each o f the reported
relationships occurs between teaching peers. This suggests that respondents are not
developing stakeholder relationships with a diverse group o f community members who
will become educated advocates willing to support the school library program.

120

Understanding in Context
School librarians identified from their survey responses as engaging in high levels
o f advocacy are interviewed. They identify activities they incorporate in their theoriesof-use that help build stakeholder relationships and gain educated support among those
they work with. These activities align with school library literature that supports the
tenets o f Hartzell’s (2003a) framework for building influence. Schools are constantly
evolving and the school library must meet changing needs by offering an updated
program. School librarians have the opportunity to capitalize on the new perspective of
their position when they strategically engage in advocacy in a way that builds influence
for their position and support among their stakeholders.
The participant’s stories describe how these opportunities and advocacy efforts
are instrumental in revitalizing the role of the school library program and changing
perceptions of the school library for stakeholders. Facilitating new perceptions that
include redesigning both the physical and virtual space of the school library has been
influential in gaining stakeholder support. Additionally, school librarians working as
leaders within both school library communities and the education community at large
gain influence for the school library position.
The increased focus on the role of the school librarian as teacher provides a
positive perception o f the school library program when teaching is not seen as additive to
the classroom curriculum and does not focus on “library skills”. Changing the
perception o f instruction in the school library to information literacy in support o f
achieving curricular standards creates a perception o f indispensability for the school
library program and the expertise of the school librarian. For these six sites, no longer is

121
the school library a quiet place o f skills taught in isolation, it is now a collaborative
learning hub.
Through an examination of the innovative practices o f the participants, advocacy
practices are witnessed that build influence for the school library programs and the
position o f the school librarian by changing the perception o f what the school library
program is and how indispensible the skills o f the school librarian can become. As
Empowering Learners: Guidelines fo r School Library Media Programs (AASL, 2009)
states, today’s users have diverse needs and school libraries have a responsibility to
maintain a flexible, fluid program ready to meet them. Kelly who manages the library
learning commons has built a culture o f learners in her school who require the support of
the AASL Standards fo r 21st Century Learners (AASL, 2007a), incorporating them as part
o f her school’s vision and introducing the concept o f the learning commons to
community stakeholders.
Introducing 21st century skills, participants hope to engage stakeholders through
authentic practices in the school library and deconstruct artificial policies so they can
mirror what may be faced in “real-life”. The school librarians use their knowledge and
resources to plan lessons students find more engaging. Sharon, the solo urban librarian,
finds these lessons help build rapport; not only with her students, but also with her
teaching colleagues since student enthusiasm leads to co-planned projects in the future.
Partnerships that are created with community members are designed purposefully to
show students an immediate relationship between their lives and learning. Stakeholders
outside the school are able to identify the value the learning opportunities provide to the

122

students. This creates an educated group o f stakeholders more willing to support and
advocate for the school library program as a valuable resource for student learning.

Interpretation of Perceived Success of Advocacy
For the purposes o f this study, success is not defined in a quantifiable measure,
but rather left to each respondent and participant to situate along their own unique
continuum of understanding. Respondents rate their advocacy activities on a scale and
also have the opportunity to provide context for their response. Several respondents
provide written responses to clarify their selections. Success for these respondents is
described as added administrative support, increased teacher collaboration, increased
parent use, and addition o f staff for the library program.
Respondents are asked to rate those activities they have personally engaged in.
Though the respondents are asked in Question #12 to identify the advocacy activities in
which they participate and are presented with an identical list in Question #13 to rate
perceived success with one option being- I have not participated in this advocacy effort,
the number o f responses does not match and responses are higher when rating success.
Therefore, some respondents rated the success o f more activities than they initially chose
as activities in their practice. It may be assumed that some participants responded not
from personal experience, but from perception o f practice.
Those who do rate the activities show a greater perception o f success for those
activities that involve stakeholders directly involved with the school. This may be due to
the fact that these stakeholders have a visible presence in the school and the effects o f
advocacy may be something that is immediately seen or demonstrated to the school
librarian. While the effects of contacting a decision maker or attending a political event

123

may be as effective, the effects of the advocacy effort may not have an immediate, direct
impact on the school librarian’s building level program. Therefore, the school librarian
may not perceive the activity to be as successful. Johns (2007) reminds us that it is
essential that school librarians see advocacy as an issue greater than school level.
Analysis o f perceived success of the select response advocacy activities shows
each activity has some positive correlations with the identifying demographic
characteristics. Though correlation does not imply causation, these findings suggest that
school librarians with specific demographic characteristics are more inclined to perceive
the activities successful. These predictors should be cultivated to ensure that school
librarians feel empowered to build relationships with their stakeholder groups and gain
educated supporters o f their program.
The grade level o f the school in which the librarian works statistically assists in
identifying predictors o f success for the activities o f providing comments to various
decision maker groups through calls or email, encouraging others to provide comments,
sponsoring a parent or community event, reading or distributing advocacy literature, and
speaking to a school board or PTA group. Elementary librarians in the study reported
lower perceived levels o f success with activities such as speaking with school board and
PTA groups and sponsoring advocacy events. It may be that school librarians in
elementary schools, who typically see higher levels o f parent presence in the schools,
may correlate parent presence at events as a measure of successful advocacy. However,
the message o f their advocacy campaign is most important. School librarians at the
elementary level must focus their strategies on extending their advocacy efforts beyond
program promotion (Hand, 2008; Slusser, 2011). They should seek opportunities to

124

express the instructional role of the school librarian and the support o f the school library
program in student learning as recommended by Kerr (2011).
Likewise, high school teachers who work in large schools that support larger
staffs perceive the opportunity to distribute literature or solicit support o f several
members o f the staff as less successful. As Schuckett (2004) suggests, school librarians
have a unique connection to each member o f a school faculty and, by extension, an
opportunity to influence them. If the activities of gaining staff support such as
distributing advocacy literature and encouraging others to contact decision makers to
support the library have been perceived successful by some, other school librarians can
direct their energy in this area as they look for possible strategies.
The study population had only a small percentage (7%) of respondents that did
not hold a certification or credential as defined by their state. However, education level
and the holding o f a state credential is a predicting factor in the perception o f success o f
nearly all o f the advocacy activities. It is likely that school librarians who are well
educated in their field and who hold valid credentials for their job would be more likely
to have more developed advocacy plans. School librarians who hold an advanced degree
in their field and/or hold a state credential may have a more mature or developed
understanding o f advocacy or may have been exposed to more resources. Because o f
this, these professionals may feel more confident in their advocacy message. This may
also be a contributing reason the number o f years the respondent has been employed in
the school library is a predictor of perception of success in many o f the activities of
advocacy. It is a predicting factor in the librarian providing comments to decision
makers through email or phone calls, as well as encouraging others to contact decision

125

makers about school library advocacy issues. The number o f years a librarian has been in
the field is also a predicting factor in the perception of success of school librarians
volunteering or serving on committees o f professional organizations, attending library
legislative days and speaking at a school board or PTA event. This finding suggests the
importance of the reaching out to those new to the profession to ensure they have
opportunities to be involved at early stages in their career.
Finally, the belief in the importance o f advocacy to the future o f the profession is
a predicting factor to the perception o f success for all activities but sponsoring a parent or
community event about library advocacy. This may contribute to a shared belief among
all respondents that advocacy is a necessity for the future o f the profession and what
continues to drive all activities o f advocacy, whether they are met with success or not.
As one respondent stated, “If they don’t know what we do, they don’t know to ask for
support.” (Anonymous survey respondent, 2014)

Success in Context
The participants interviewed at the six sites are able to articulate multiple
activities that build relationships with a variety o f stakeholder groups in their
communities in such a way that the perception o f the school library is redefined. They
are quick to point out the multiple informal measures they use to evaluate the success of
their advocacy efforts. By defining success through these measures, the school librarians
and the interviewed stakeholders demonstrate that the perception o f the school library has
shifted in their settings. Use o f student and stakeholder perception, though intangible and
not measureable, demonstrates to these participants a rejuvenated excitement in the
program offered at their schools. Both Joy and Kelly have gained influence for their

126

position and program by the demonstrated support witnessed through the showcasing of
their space due to this shift in perception. Hartzell (2003a) suggests school librarians
must become leaders. Linda’s administrative support and assignment to mentor others
who may need guidance demonstrates success through non-quantifiable means. Their
programs are supported in their school community. It feels like success to them.
Participants also use formal measures to measure their success. High circulation
numbers, as well as the constant use o f each o f the participant’s physical space leads the
participants to conclude that stakeholders perceive the school library to be an essential,
indispensible program. The recognized award that Rose’s program received led to
concrete funding and consistent staffing she perceives as a measurement o f her success.
Each o f the school librarians shies away from equating successful advocacy with
student achievement. They speak about student learning in terms o f supporting the
teachers. Most o f the co- participants, whether supporting informal or formal output
measures allude to students performance in classes or on standardized tests in direct
correlation to experiences in the school library. Only Rose feels compelled to explicitly
address student achievement in direct relation to advocacy.
I really think that I need to say something about student achievement
because if you do advocate for your library and you can point to the
number o f students who come into your library and that you’re somehow
effecting enough students to make a difference in test scores, and that is
really hard to measure, but if you feel like your, um, students are gaining
some kind of knowledge or skills because o f the program and you put outIt’s like a big circle. Because if your principal supports you with the staff
and the money to make your library nice so kids want to come in, and if
you run a program where kids want to come in and check out books and
use your resources. The student achievement will go up. So, I think that
you have to look not only at the concrete things, like the money for the new
stuff and the staffing, but also you have to look at if what you’re doing to
promote your library and if your program is helping students achieve more.

127

Limitations
Limitations are identified for both the quantitative and qualitative measures
employed in this study. The sites used for the qualitative portion o f the research are
selected to represent a random sample. The participants at each site location are co­
teachers and administrators selected by the school librarian participants themselves with
no selection criteria provided. Most school librarians choose a co-teacher with whom
they have successfully collaborated. Future research may interview a wider variety o f
stakeholders at the site to explore a greater perception of experiences with advocacy in
practice.
One limitation o f the quantitative study is found in the analysis o f the survey
responses o f respondents identifying perceived success of activities o f advocacy. While
the respondents have the opportunity to rate success as either highly successful or
moderately successful, there is no opportunity to operationalize their measures on the
survey and responses rely solely on the respondents’ individual, internal continuum o f
perceived success. Additionally, though respondents are asked to rate the level of
success for their personal advocacy activities, the number o f respondents rating their
level o f success is greater than the number o f respondents originally reporting
engagement in the activity. It is possible some participants rate perceived levels of
success o f each o f the activities in general, not their own success. Future research may
consider alternate means o f collecting this data to ensure internal validity.
A final limitation is the influence o f district library supervisors on the population
sample. While distribution of the survey through school email distribution lists o f libraiy
district supervisors helps obtain a large sample that has no outside affiliations beyond

128

their employment as school librarians, it also introduces a limitation to the study. First,
school library supervisors are the initial point of contact for the study. Therefore their
decision to participate is the determining factor for inclusion in the study. Additionally, a
district library supervisor acts as an advocate for school library programs at a district
level. As Carter (1971) reminds us, their position implies some level o f district support
for school libraries. School librarians in the study population may feel falsely secure in
their position due to this district influence. Finally, as defined by the AASL position
statement on appropriate staffing for school libraries (AASL, 2006c) one o f the functions
o f a library supervisor’s job is to ensure the quality o f school library programs, including
hiring qualified school librarians. The school library programs should be stronger, and
therefore more visible and perceived as valuable to the school communities in which they
are situated. Since this sample is comprised of all school librarians working under a
district level library supervisor, the population may be more supported at the district level
and reflect higher credentials. Additionally, the population may have more opportunities
for professional development, which could include advocacy.

Implications and Recommendations for Further Research
This study has been primarily exploratory in nature. The intent is to examine the
beliefs and understanding currently held by practitioners in the field so that strategies and
models o f advocacy can be built on an educated foundation. While the findings identify
practitioner’s understanding o f advocacy in relation to the current intent o f the school
library’s professional organization, additional research should explore the organization’s
continued message and plan of advocacy, as well as strategies it hopes to build to carry
out such a plan. The primary implication for school library research and the school

129

library literature is that this study contributes to the gap in existing school library research
examining advocacy. As there is limited empirical research examining school library
advocacy, this study will strengthen the field’s knowledge on practitioner beliefs.
The findings o f this study only addressed advocacy as it aligns with the definition
set forth by AASL. That definition was formally adopted in 2007, though it was
introduced with the 1998 Information Power program standards (Haycock and Cavill,
1999). There is an implication that the professional association will revisit these
definitions to ensure there is a single clear message o f what the field intends advocacy to
be, and so that all school librarians have an unambiguous expectation o f what their
charge is in engaging in advocacy for their programs. This is particularly timely as the
library field, under the new 2015 strategic plan (ALA, 2008), has elevated advocacy as an
association goal.
An additional implication o f the study is that the strategies shared by the school
librarians and their administrative and co-teaching stakeholders represent success stories
o f advocacy the school library field is eager to hear. The advocacy initiatives
implemented to build stakeholder support and foster relationships are done in such a way
that the perception o f the school library and the position o f the school librarian were
altered within each o f the six school communities. The school librarians in the study
revitalized the role o f the school library in their school through innovative practices and
emphasizing the teaching role of the school librarian. Additionally, they made the school
library program relevant to today’s learner. Hamilton (2011) discusses the nature o f a
participatory culture in school libraries, where the school community comes together to
learn, and share and create information. This philosophy can be found in these six sites;

130

students are eagerly seeking out the school library and stakeholders view the library as an
essential component to their school community. By exploring the dynamics o f the
individual library programs, other school librarians can generalize the strategies used to
gain stakeholder support and alter the perception o f the library in their unique setting.
These stories provide a vision of the impact o f advocacy on the profession. Future
research should include the development o f resources for dissemination and
implementation o f strategies of success and explore ways school librarians can
implement them into their practice.
A final implication o f this study is to help guide course work and training in
advocacy within school librarian education programs. The findings from this study can be
used in planning curriculum and coursework in advocacy to better train pre-service
school librarians on how to advocate for a school library program. Findings suggest such
courses would benefit from information regarding identification of program stakeholders,
location o f advocacy resources, and effective strategies that can be used to build
influence for the school library program once candidates have been hired. Additionally,
findings suggest that credentialed school librarians are a predictor in the perceived
success o f advocacy. Additional research should examine the extent to which advocacy
is included in pre-service education coursework to ensure that school librarians are
adequately trained and feel empowered to advocate at early stages in their school library
career.

Conclusion
With a national decline in staffing and funding for school libraries there is an
immediate need for school librarians to know how to build relationships o f support

131

among their stakeholders. The first step in this process is educating each stakeholder
group o f the value that school libraries add to the school culture. This can be achieved by
changing the perception o f the role the school library plays in the academic support and
enhancement o f students. School librarians who are able to identify and engage in
activities and strategies that align with the purpose o f advocacy to foster stakeholder
relationships and gain their support build a perception of influence for the profession.
Unfortunately, school librarians do not yet have a clear understanding and
definition o f advocacy. Practicing school librarians are not participating in advocacy in
a way that engages multiple stakeholder groups in the school community. When
participating in advocacy in their programs, school librarians either fall short o f advocacy
and simply promote their library programs, or they engage only with stakeholder groups
within their school building, neglecting to draw on the support of other groups in their
school community.
Practicing school librarians struggle to align their espoused advocacy practice
with their theory-in-use. Advocacy remains a priority of the school library field, but few
practitioners regularly engage in a systematic plan to advocate for their program. Those
who do advocate often focus on stakeholder relationships within their school building.
To be most effective, a larger message must be spread. Those who have a developed
understanding o f advocacy must use their influence to build relationships with multiple
stakeholder groups both inside and outside the school community. By demonstrating a
strong advocacy theory-in-practice they can become leaders and mentors and help build
influence for the school library program.

132

This study found that there is still work to be done to define the message of
advocacy for the school library profession. School librarians struggle to identify our
national organization’s definition o f the term. Even those who can identify it have
difficulty understanding the complex task that is being assigned to them. School
librarians need clearer guidelines on the activities and strategies they can enact that will
align with the goals o f advocacy as put forth by AASL, the national professional
organization.
School librarians need to engage in activities that build educated supporters. One
respondent notes, “ Advocacy is having a good program that people want to use and
supports students.” but Slusser (2011) warns, it is not enough to simply do a good job or
have a good program. Building upon the strong programs they create, school librarians
must take opportunities to demonstrate their efforts to not only administration and the
teachers they work with, but to their larger school community and outside decision
makers. An ongoing, systemic effort should be in place to achieve this.
With a clearer understanding of activities that constitute advocacy to draw from,
school librarians will have a better sense o f what activities they can implement in their
own practice to be successful advocates. Those beliefs that school librarians espouse will
be in closer alignment with those in which they engage. This will ensure they are
reaching multiple stakeholder groups to provide a perception of an essential library
program, led by an influential school librarian. Additionally, using the model o f those
school librarians who do perceive success in their practice, targeted advocacy plans can
be constructed to assist school librarians to become stronger advocates.

133

When examining the success of advocacy, it is important to consider not only
traditional formal measures, but also the perceived informal measures associated with
successful advocacy. Stakeholder perceptions of the impact school libraries make on the
educational landscape can be influential in building continued support. Collecting
anecdotal and supplemental evidence to demonstrate the perceptions o f indispensability
can be powerful indicators o f success.
The primary intent o f this study is to identify the current beliefs and
understandings o f advocacy and the activities that are perceived to be successful. Future
research should focus on identifying a model o f advocacy that can be implemented based
on these findings to give practicing school librarians a single, clear course for advocacy
engagement.

Dear Library Supervisor/ Coordinator:
My name is Elizabeth Bums and I am a doctoral candidate at Old Dominion University in the
Curriculum and Instruction program. I am completing my dissertation analyzing School
Librarians’ advocacy practice. My study examines how school librarians define advocacy and the
types of advocacy activities reported in their practice. The findings will explore effective
advocacy practice for school librarians.
I would like to distribute a survey to a national sample of school librarians working in public
schools. Unfortunately, there is not a national email database maintained of all school
librarians. One way I have of reaching a large number of school librarians is through a school
library supervisor or coordinator. My hope is that you will distribute the link and a short
introduction to my survey to each of the school librarians in your district. I would ask simply that
you send forward an email and a follow-up reminder upon my email prompt to you within a 14day period. Librarians will be informed that participation is voluntary and this study is in
no way associated with their employment in the district. You will not have to craft any
documents- simply forward my emails through your distribution list. I have conducted this
as a pilot with a school district similar to yours and received a completion rate of 52%. A
Distribute initial email and
Your response to this email

stating willingness to

If you are willing to forward these two emails, would you please reply to this email
acknowledging willingness to participate, as well as the total number of librarians in your
database so that I can record how many will receive the surv ey for record of sample size.
I am conducting this survey under the supervision of Dr. Gail Dickinson at Old Dominion
University'. This study has been approved by the university ’s Human Subject Review7Board (IRB
approval letter attached). Please feel free to contact me if you should have any additional
questions about the study. Thank you so much for your time. I look forward to hearing from
you.

Dear School Librarian:
Thank you for your time in completing my survey on School Library
Advocacy. I am beginning to analyze the results from that survey. Your
responses indicate that you have had some success in the advocacy
activities and practices you engage in within your school setting. You also
indicated a willingness to participate in an individual interview.
I would like to schedule interviews with a small sample of school librarians
in the upcoming weeks. I hope to include you in this group. My schedule is
extremely flexible- I hope this will allow us to find a mutually convenient
time. These interviews will be conducted online. I can be available from
7:00 AM-9:00 PM EST. I would like to begin the week of XXX
I also would like to schedule a shorter interview with a co-teacher and an
administrator from your school. This will give me a valuable perspective of
how the library program and efforts to advocate for it are perceived by
stakeholders in your community.
If you could please respond with the following information it will allow me to
create an interview schedule:
1. Name and email address of administrator I may contact to invite to
participate in study.
2. Name and email address of co-teacher I may contact to invite to
participate in study.
3. Preferred day/time that may work well for you for an interview. Please
plan for one hour.
I look forward to hearing from you!

Hello XXXMy name is Elizabeth Bums and I am a doctoral student researching
school library advocacy. I have gathered some initial data from your
school librarian on her understandings and activities of advocacy in your
school setting. I am also interested in exploring the perceptions of
advocacy by stakeholders in the school community. She has given me
your name as a co teacher who may provide an educator’s perspective on
the school library in your school. The interview will last approx. 30 minutes
and will be conducted via video teleconference software.
My schedule is flexible and I can accommodate most days and times.
Would there be a time this week that might work for us to meet? Kindly
respond with a day and time that is convenient, so I can add you to my
calendar.
I look forward to hearing from you soon!
