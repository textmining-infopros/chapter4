ABSTRACT
Information, culture, and memory centers increasingly anchor urban
redevelopment projects in historically marginalized communities challenged with
contemporary social and economic disparities. This dissertation situated libraries,
archives, and museums within a socio-cultural context and examined the role of
cultural heritage institutions in gentrification. Librarians, archivists, curators, and
community advocates in Detroit, Michigan shared their viewpoints and
experiences of gentrification in a legacy city. Using a modified Delphi process,
the e-Delphi panel explored the need for assessing policy, service delivery, and
programming in a city of color at-risk to gentrification-induced displacement.
This mixed research study used a concurrent triangulation design. A panel
of experts (round one: n = 32; round two: n = 31; round three: n = 30) was
selected to participate in a three-round e-Delphi survey conducted from May
2017 to August 2017. The e-Delphi panel was composed of information, culture,
and community workers who: (a) practiced at an anchor institution; (b) in a
neighborhood undergoing gentrification; or (c) with community members seeking
to stay put in transitioning neighborhoods. Qualitative and quantitative data were
analyzed using inductive analysis and descriptive statistics. A nonparametric
statistical test, Kendall’s Coefficient of Concordance (W), measured the extent of
agreement among the e-Delphi panelists’ rankings of the five most important

v

issues and ten most important recommendations regarding the role of cultural
heritage institutions in gentrification and displacement.
Thirty panel members (93%) of the round one survey indicated that it was
important for cultural heritage institutions to assess if revitalization partnerships
contributed to gentrification-induced displacement. The panel generated twentyfive propositions in round two which were ranked by the panel in the third and
final round of the survey. Kendall’s W for the rank ordering of issues (W = .008;
X2 = 15.815; df = 6; p= .015) and recommendations (W = .050; X2 =24.467; df =
17; p = .085) indicated a very weak level of agreement. The implication of this
finding suggested a need for further exploration. This study adds to the global
investigation on the role of cultural heritage institutions in gentrification and
displacement and contributes to an emerging body of knowledge in cultural
heritage informatics in the U.S.

CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION
Libraries, archives, and museums are keystone institutions of an
information society (Machlup, 1962; Masuda, 1981, 1983), functioning as cross
walks to information and communications technology (ICT), knowledge
production, and collective memory. Surveys conducted by sector associations as
well as government and non- governmental organizations provide a composite
appraisal of cultural heritage institutions. Visitations to U.S. memory sites and art
museums were on the decline at the beginning of the twenty-first century
(American Academy of Arts and Sciences, 2016; United States Department of
Commerce et al., 2012), but by 2012, seventy-two percent of U.S. museums
reported increased attendance (American Alliance of Museums, 2013). The
Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) reported similar upticks in
program attendance at public libraries within the same period; notwithstanding an
eight percent decrease in 2013 in physical visitations, a measure which did not
incorporate online or mobile usage (Institute of Museum and Library Services,
2016).
While these statistics validate library, archive, and museum (LAM)
attendance, they partially support the socio-cultural significance of information,
heritage, and memory centers in communities. Pew Research Center surveys
found that over seventy percent of public library members think libraries served
their educational needs (Rainie, 2016). Sixty-five percent believed their
1

community would be impacted by library closures; with low-income members
and people of color responding more frequently that a library closure would
greatly impact their community and family (Horrigan, 2015).
The cultural heritage sector has been transitioning since the middle of the
twentieth century. Information and heritage scholars cognizant of “trends and
patterns of inequality” (United Nations, 2005, p. 43) in the U.S. parsed the
significance of LAMs by locating the cultural, economic, and political impact of
cultural heritage institutions within the architecture of historically disenfranchised
communities (Fenton, 2014; Jimerson, 2009; Josey, 1999; Robinson & Allen,
1943; Vega, 1993; Williams, 1945; Zinn, 1977). These scholars shifted the focus
from statistical inference to the social function of LAMs and the socio-cultural
issues related to access, inclusion, and equality of autonomy (Sen, 1979) for
members of marginalized and racialized communities (Brimhall-Vargas, 2015;
Robert, 2014).
Information and heritage centers are dynamic environments in which
administrators negotiate fiscal and resource objectives at the same time that
thought leaders navigate the competing narratives and contested memories of
constituencies. While the sector invests in capital management and works toward
advancing technical capacity, it must continue to address the disparities in social
and economic inclusion that mark the cultural landscape. The UNESCO Global
Report on Culture and Sustainable Urban Development identified LAMs as
significant components of “cultural infrastructure” (Hendili, 2015, p. 3) in urban
communities. The United Nations also linked attrition of urban community values

2

to “uncontrolled development” (UNESCO, 2011, p. 50). British sociologist Ruth
Glass named this type of development, gentrification, defining it as the
displacement of impoverished and working-class residents from a community
through the “effects… of deliberate or incidental developments” (Glass, 1964, p.
xvii).
1.1 Statement of the Problem
Gentrification is a vector of urbanization that transfigures neighborhoods
and produces community erasure for innumerable low-income residents and
communities of color in the U.S. (Glass, 1964; Waldheim, 2004). Since the
1940s, urban centers across the country have been impacted by federal, state,
and local legislation and policy resulting in racialized disinvestment and
displacement (Darden, Hill, Thomas, & Thomas, 1987; Rothstein, 2017; Sugrue,
2014; Tracy, 2014). Prescient urban and cultural studies scholars have voiced
disquiet regarding gentrification-inducted displacement (GID) in poor or lowincome communities, as well as in communities of color (Bedoya, 2014; Fullilove,
2001; McFarlane, 2009; Powell & Spencer, 2002). The propinquity of
contemporary urban place-making initiatives has also been recognized as a
mechanism for the displacement of historically marginalized populations
(Bedoya, 2013; McFarlane, 2006; Wilson, 2015).
Cultural policy and urban planning scholars have identified LAMs and
historical and archeological societies, as stakeholder organizations anchoring
culture-led urban revitalization efforts worldwide (Binns, 2005; Markusen &
Gadwa, 2010; Mathews, 2014). Blumer and Schuldt (2014) explicitly interrogated

3

the role of public libraries embedded in revitalization in Switzerland; while
Townsend (2015) similarly called into question the capacity of cultural heritage
institutions to advance gentrification and displacement in Bogotá, Colombia. With
a few exceptions (Skipper, 2010; Sze, 2010), there is a paucity of research by
LAM scholars investigating the sector’s involvement with urban development
projects and the impact of these initiatives in racialized and marginalized
communities in the U.S. As librarians, archivists, and curators respond to the
expectations of low-income members and communities of color, they will
continue to address issues of inclusion and relevance if LAM stakeholders
overlook connections between cultural heritage institutions, gentrification, and
GID.
1.2 Rationale and Purpose of the Study
The aim of this study was to explore the information worlds (Jaeger &
Burnett, 2010) of culture and community workers within the context of a
gentrification-impacted community at risk for displacement. Using a mixed
research approach (Johnson & Onwuegbuzie, 2004), the objective of this study
was to use the Delphi process (Delbecq, Van de Ven, & Gustafson, 1975/1986;
Ziglio, 1996), incorporating qualitative (QUAL) and quantitative (QUAN) data
collection, to circle the reality (Dervin, 1983) of librarians, archivists, curators, and
community advocates in Detroit, Michigan. This strategy was used to better
understand the function of cultural heritage institutions in gentrification. The
rationale for selecting a mixed approach was based on the assumption that a
nuanced analysis of trends augmented with the perspective of practitioners

4

working in gentrification-impacted settings would enhance the accuracy of
research results (Creswell, 2013, 2014; Johnson, Onwuegbuzie, Turner, 2007).
The process of gentrification has, and continues to be, well documented
(Glass, 1964; Heriza, Garrison, Rasmussen, & Tuss, 1980; Reece, 2004; Sutton,
2014; Williams, 2014; Zuk, et al., 2015); therefore a comprehensive review of the
phenomenon was not undertaken for this mixed method empirical study.
Gentrification served as the undercurrent for this project because LAMs are
increasingly embedded in contemporary urban renewal1 schemes (Evans, 2001;
Hamnett & Schoval, 2003; Jackson, Hodgson, & Beavers, 2011; Miles, 2005).
1.3 Need for the Study
Urban culture-led revitalization studies have come primarily from Europe
and Canada (Blumer & Schuldt, 2014; DCMS, 2004; Mathews, 2014; Mauger &
Underwood, 2004; Skot-Hansen, Rasmussen, & Jochumsen, 2013). Cultural
heritage, as phenomena, is inestimable. To operationalize it researchers apply
economic indicators utilizing six factors of valorization: aesthetic, spiritual or
religious, social, historic, symbolic, and authentic (Iorgulescu, Alexandru, Cretan,
Kagitci & Iacob, 2011). Binns (2005) contextualized culture as an economic
strategy; either a tool for production (i.e., creative industry), or consumption (i.e.,
creative place-making). Culture-led revitalization research is growing in the U.S.
where it is termed ‘cultural development’ or ‘urban revitalization’. A national

1

James Baldwin identified urban renewal as “negro removal” in a 1963 interview
with social psychologist and civil rights activist, Dr. Kenneth B. Clark. See WGBH
(1963) to access full interview.
5

survey of cultural development strategies (Grodach & Loukaitou-Sideris, 2007)
identified the use of three approaches in the U.S.: entrepreneurial, creative class,
and progressive; corresponding with Binns’ (2005) European cultural renewal
models of consumption, production, and participation, respectively.
In a public exchange on the merit of cultural-led revitalization in the U.K.,
British cultural policy scholar David O’Brien opined, “Who benefits?” (Pomery &
O’Brien, 2013, p. 19), raising concern with the approach to a museum director at
a prominent facility. Reports commissioned by the Urban Libraries Council
(Manjarrez, Cigna, & Bajaj, 2007) and IMLS (Walker, Lundgren, Manjarrez, &
Fuller, 2015) emphasized the importance of focusing on the “human dimension of
economic development” (Manjarrez, Cigna, & Bajaj, 2007, p. i) when assessing
place-based strategies. Yet neither report addressed gentrification or
displacement. The process of gentrification has been extensively researched by
urban studies, sociology, and cultural policy scholars (Glass, 1964;
Maeckelbergh, 2012; Slater, 2006; Smith, 1979; Zuk, et al., 2015; Zukin, 1987)
but there is a dearth of literature on gentrification and LAMs in library,
information, archive, and museum studies. Blumer and Schuldt (2014) situated
public libraries in Switzerland within the contested terrain and deliberated the
function of libraries in gentrification and the responsibility of librarians to “socially
vulnerable groups” (p. 19) impacted by segregation or displacement.
Exacerbated social or economic conditions endanger the cultural heritage
of low socio-economic status and racialized communities (UNESCO, 1972).
Detroit, Michigan provides a salient example of the impact of racialized

6

disinvestment and its effect on cultural infrastructure. One consequence has
been an erosion of public goods through diminished funding of public services.
LAM funding has stagnated or decreased nationwide (American Alliance of
Museums, 2013; American Library Association 2012; Chung & Wilkening, 2008).
But in disinvested communities of Detroit, cuts in funding not only jeopardizes
cultural infrastructure, they endanger the cultural heritage of community
members.
Over the years, information and heritage professionals in Detroit have
wrestled with finding ways to work around the contraction of public goods. LAMs
endured an unprecedented challenge in 2013 when a state appointed emergency
financial manager filed municipal bankruptcy. Through the oversight of the
emergency financial manager, the city's museum collection was audited for
appraisal as collateral for debt repayment. A structural readjustment plan, called
the ‘Grand Bargain’ (U.S. Bankruptcy Court Eastern District of Michigan, 2014),
was settled between the museum, private foundations, and the State of
Michigan. Detroit Institute of Arts (DIA) assets were transferred to a non-profit
entity to leverage the city’s debt obligations. While the grand bargain appears to
have shored Detroit’s gentrifying cultural corridor, recovery outside of Detroit’s
historic Cultural Center district is slow to non-existent.
The DIA grand bargain exemplifies an international trend utilizing austerity
measures to curb public sector debt. Cultural policy analysts and urban studies
scholars examined the social and economic impact of gentrification and have
acknowledged the dilemma of GID (Galster, Cutsinger, Booza, 2006; Gunay,

7

2008; UNESCO, 2003b). In response to changes in socio-economic global
conditions associated with gentrification, heritage- or culture-led revitalization
was recommended as a strategy to “ensure the sustainability and continuity”
(Gunay, 2008, p. 1) of cultural infrastructure and heritage in urban communities.
Recent collaboration between LAMs and community service organizations in the
U.S. were identified by IMLS to assess the application of a similar approach,
termed “comprehensive community revitalization” (Walker, Lundgren, Manjarrez,
& Fuller, 2015, p. 1).
IMLS reviewed the practices of fifty libraries and museums in 2015 and
made recommendations for revitalization strategies providing “wrap-around
services” (p. 41) in under-served communities. The report recognized the need
for a “broadening public purpose” (Walker, Lundgren, Manjarrez, & Fuller, 2015,
p. 5) for LAMs, referencing an executive administrator who emphasized that
libraries would have to “act more emphatically as a community-based institution”
(p. 5) to reify the approach. The Parkman Branch, Technology Literacy & Career
(TLC) Center at the Detroit Public Library was featured in the IMLS sponsored
assessment. TLC is a collaborative effort between the Parkman Branch library,
the Knight Foundation, and Focus: HOPE, a community-based organization
implementing anti-racist, housing and food security, job training, and community
arts projects in Detroit. TLC provides an example of a library in the process of
examining and broadening its mission to render community-based experiences of
cultural, economic, social, and technological relevance.

8

Veinot & Williams (2011) contend that research focused on “the
community as the central unit of analysis” (p. 847) renders greater scope to
information studies and informatics scholarship. Not enough is known about the
role of LAM practitioners in relationship to community advocates in
neighborhoods at risk to GID or their attitudes concerning the emerging
relationship between LAMs and urban revitalization. Investigation of this nexus
provided an opportunity to illuminate ambiguities as well as gaps in LAM
literature regarding issues related to ‘race’2, class, and GID. Discourse on
economic inequity within the domain is often sanitized, while 'race’ is undertheorized, referenced abstractly or as a demographic indicator. Markusen (2014)
reviewed cultural policy and creative cities research agendas in the U.S. and
highlighted gentrification as an area for further research. Noting an absence in
perspective of racialized, immigrant, and working-class communities, Markusen
challenged researchers to quicken efforts to investigate ‘race’ and class in
relation to creative place-making.
Sociology and urban studies scholars offer a wealth of literature
discussing the process of gentrification and its impact on racialized, immigrant,
and low socio-economic status (SES) communities (Betancur, Galster, Schrupp,
Holmes-Douglas, & Mogk, 2002; Boyd, 2008; DeVerteuil, 2012; Glass, 1964;
Wallace, 1988). LAMs are increasingly identified and referenced as ‘anchor’ or
‘flagship’ sites utilized in urban place-making projects (Evans, 2001; Hamnett &

2

‘Race’ is used in accordance with the critical race theory convention indicating
the term as a socially constructed categorization.
9

Schoval, 2003; Jackson, Hodgson, & Beavers, 2011; Miles, 2005). Evidence
indicates that the cultural heritage sector is moving toward revitalization
strategies to keep pace with economic trends and technological advancements.
Blumer and Schuldt’s (2014) recommendation for an interrogation of the role of
libraries in gentrification and Markusen’s (2014) call for stakeholders and
researchers to focus attention on populations displaced by gentrification
substantiate this.
It is imperative that information and heritage professionals engage with
community members to unpack the meaning and potential of culture-led and
comprehensive community revitalization strategies. The reality of funding and
budgetary constraints and accompanying need for investment is unerring.
Consideration must also be given to whether such enterprises represent retooled urban development schemes in racialized and marginalized communities.
Urban revitalization initiatives are typically slated for areas or neighborhoods
impacted by urban renewal, highway construction, and redlining policies and
projects begun in the 1930s (Jackson, 1980; Karas, 2015, Rothstein, 2017).
There is a need for critical evaluation of public-private development projects by
the cultural heritage sector, with attention to whether these strategies foster
further exclusion or marginalization as a consequence of gentrification.
1.4 Research Questions and Conceptual Framework
The research questions for this study were informed by the integration of
two lines of inquiry from academic and popular literature (Blumer & Schuldt,
2014; Kinniburgh, 2017). The underlying supposition that: (a) culture heritage

10

institutions are one of many structural supports driving gentrification (Kinniburgh,
2017); (b) in what capacity “should [LAMs] engage in projects for urban
revitalization… [w]hat, if this revitalization leads to gentrification, social
segregation and displacement?” (Blumer & Schuldt, 2014, p. 19). Situating LAMs
in the context of transformative space in a disinvested community nurtured the
formation of three research questions:
RQ1: How might cultural heritage institutions play a role in gentrification?
RQ2: How might information, culture, and heritage practitioners shape
policy, service delivery, or praxis in communities at risk for gentrificationinduced displacement?
RQ3: What services do cultural heritage institutions provide to
communities resisting displacement?
A mixed research model was designed using a modified Delphi method
(Custer, Scarcella, & Stewart, 1999; Fletcher & Marchildon, 2014; McKenna,
1994), grounded by a theoretical framing in information behavior and social
psychology. Jaeger & Burnett’s (2010) concept of information worlds integrated
with Jones’ (1997) dynamic structural model of racism shaped and informed the
research process. The notion of information value (Jaeger & Burnett, 2010)
guided the examination of the information worlds of the cultural heritage and
community practitioners within a socio-cultural context. The dynamic structural
model of racism provided a mnemonic device for reflexive multi-level analysis.
The Delphi technique was selected for this study because it employs both
participative and recursive methods. The dialogic and participatory nature of the

11

Delphi method offered not only a recursive process for participants to explicate,
reflect, and explore issues (Campbell, 2011) but contributed QUAL and QUAN
data for a comprehensive analysis. Bharat (2004) recommended participatory
library and information science (L/IS) research as a means to examine the role of
libraries in supporting social equity in marginalized communities. Participative
methods integrate “tacit knowledge and experience” (Bell et al., 2004, p. 9) to
winnow “context-bound… ‘local theory’” (p. 3). This modified Delphi study
extended Bharat’s (2004) proposition across domains to explore the role of
cultural heritage institutions in a community undergoing intense gentrification.
The Delphi process also facilitates issue identification and prioritization
(Okoli & Pawlowski, 2004) when data is unavailable or “needed to contribute to
the examination of a… problem” (Linstone & Turoff, 1975/2000, p. 4). The
paucity of information on LAMs, gentrification, and displacement in the U.S.
suggests a need for study, one way to address this gap is to study the
information available from the viewpoints of those with knowledge and
experience of the topic. Over the course of this study, Delphi panelists examined
issues related to cultural infrastructure and disinvestment; investigated the role of
librarians, archivists, curators, and community advocates in cultural revitalization;
and suggested strategies to bridge the information worlds of community
members.
The Delphi technique was introduced to civilian society by the Research
and Development Corporation (RAND) in 1958 (Rand, 1998). The method
originated in 1951 as a classified scenarios procedure conducted by the U.S. Air

12

Force to elicit munitions estimates from a panel of military industry experts
(Dalkey & Helmer, 1962; Gordon & Helmer, 1964; Helmer & Rescher, 1958). As
the method developed, it was used to “forecast knowledge” (Culhs, 2005, p. 96)
on “potential political issues and… resolution” (Gordon, 1994, p. 1) related to the
impact of warfare technology (Rand 2016a); and adapted for civilian use in longrange planning (Gordon & Helmer, 1964; Helmer, 1967). The Delphi process has
evolved into an interdisciplinary application “to aid understanding” (Delbecq, Van
de Ven, & Gustafson, 1975/1986, p. 85) and “decision making under uncertainty”
(Rand, 2016b).
Delphi exercises are structured to elicit a dialogic group communication
process using iterative rounds of survey to facilitate a systematic review of
information to generate ideas on emerging trends or problems (Turoff & Hiltz,
1996). Delphi surveys have been conducted to identify issues, investigate trends,
evaluate policy, and assess programming in the business, education, and health
care domains (Bender, Stract, Ebright, & von Haunalter 1969; Cyphert & Gant,
1969; Helmer, 1966; Ludlow, 1970). Borko (1970) conducted the first Delphi
survey in the L/IS domain, identifying and prioritizing a research agenda related
to L/IS pedagogy, policy development, and administration.
The Delphi technique has been used incrementally since its introduction
into the L/IS domain. Ju & Jin (2013) analyzed the use of the Delphi method in
L/IS empirical studies and found eighty-seven publications succeeding the Borko
report between 1971 and 2011. To obtain a snapshot of current usage of the
method in L/IS research, the Ju & Jin (2013) document review protocol was
13

replicated in the Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts database
and yielded an additional forty-four publications between 2012 and 2016.
1.5 Significance of the Study
Considering the position of LAMs in culture-led or comprehensive
community revitalization efforts and growing recognition of the need for an
expansion of mission and service (Horrigan, 2015), this mixed method study
holds threefold significance. For information and heritage scholars interested in
examining the role of cultural heritage institutions in gentrification, it explores the
social impact of GID from the viewpoint of culture workers in a transitioning
community. The study also unpacks the discrepancy between institutions
anchoring development in communities at risk to GID and organizational
missions aimed at inclusion and community engagement. Lastly, the research
contributes to an emerging body of literature on LAMs in gentrification-impacted
communities in the U.S.
The physical and cultural infrastructure of many urban areas in the U.S.
has been impacted by a six-decade disinvestment project, which endangers the
cultural heritage of urban communities. This study examined the role of cultural
heritage institutions in contemporary urban revitalization and explored the
attitudes and concerns of information, heritage, and memory center practitioners,
and community advocates working in a community undergoing gentrification.
1.6 Definition of Terms
To “follow the community thread from sociology to information behavior”
(Veinot & Williams, 2011, p. 847), the accompanying terms serve to establish a

14

foundation for the exploration of the role of LAMs in marginalized and racialized
communities undergoing gentrification:
Anchor institution: Non-profit or public enterprises “rooted in local
communities by mission, invested capital, or relationships to [community
members]; [these] place-based entities control vast economic, human,
intellectual, and institutional resources” (Dubb, McKinley, & Howard, 2013, p. v).
Civilization: A “culture which has endured, expanded, innovated and…
elevated to new moral sensibilities” (Mazrui, 1996, p. 210).
Collective memory: “The way… a society or social group recall,
commemorate and represent their own history” (Harrison, 2010, p. 309).
Community: A “set of identities… framed… by… physical, political, social,
psychological, historical, linguistic, economic, cultural, and spiritual spaces”
(Smith, 2012, pp. 128-129).
Cultural heritage: The evidentiary by-product of human activity, denoting
the identity of a group (Doerr, 2009; Nora, 2011).
Cultural heritage institution: An entity which oversees the organization,
storage, preservation, and accession of information and knowledge products;
memorializing artifacts; and tangible and intangible culture.
Culture: “[A]n historically transmitted pattern of meanings embodied in
symbols [via] a system of inherited conceptions expressed in symbolic forms by
means of which [people] communicate, perpetuate, and develop their knowledge
about and attitudes toward life” (Geertz, 1973, p. 89).

15

Decoloniality: Extrication from the linkages between rationality and
modernity associated with structures of political domination and social
discrimination instituted through Eurocentered colonialism (Quijano, 2007).
Everyday life: Daily situations representing “social meaning,
expectations, and practices that reflect and maintain power differentials between
and among people that have been racially defined” (Jones, 1997, p. 380).
Gentrification: A formulaic process of commercial redevelopment and
community relocation typified by disinvestment, rebranding, and infrastructure
upgrade (Tracy, 2014). Once completed, “the original working class occupiers
are displaced and the whole social character of the [community] is changed”
(Glass, 1964, pp. xviii-xix).
Gentrification consciousness: “An unspoken and yet central feature of
how institutions relate to neighborhoods and participate (or not) in raging
gentrification and development debates” (Sze, 2010, p. 525).
Heritage: UNESCO designated four types of heritage: natural sites,
tangible material, intangible cultural product, and digital material (UNESCO,
1972, 2003a).
Indigenous people: An “ethnic group who occupied a geographical area
prior to the arrival and subsequent occupation of migrant settlers. The term may
be used in some circumstances to include a group who may not have been part
of the ‘original’ occupation of an area but who were part of an early historical
period of occupation prior to the most recent colonization” (Harrison, 2010, p.
310).

16

Institutions: “Historical accretions that bear the imprint of past conflicts
between ideologies and paradigms” (Silver, 1995, p. 71).
Intersectionality: An integrative, critical framework of analysis rooted in
Black feminist discourse grounded on the premise that: (a) discrimination is
operationalized through interlocking systems of oppression2; (b) multidimensional analysis is required to interpret experiences of marginalization3; (c)
‘race’, ethnicity, nationality, class, gender, heteronormativity, able-bodiness, and
age “operate [as reciprocal entities that] shape complex social inequalities”1
(1Collins, 2015, p. 2; 2Combahee River Collective, 1983; 3Crenshaw, 1989).
Marginalization: A “form of oppression [in which people are] expelled
from useful participation in social life and… subjected to severe material
deprivation and even extermination” (Young, 2011, p. 53).
Museumification: “The transformation of a place into heritage, involving
the fixing of values and appearance through an active intervention of
conservation and management” (Harrison, 2010, p. 311).
Official heritage: The “state-sponsored or controlled process of heritage
management” (Harrison, 2010, p. 311).
Placekeeping: Preservation of culture and collective memory in addition
to the buildings of a place. The concept is promoted by Allied Media Projects
executive director, Jenny Lee and Cultural Affairs Manager for the City of
Oakland, Roberto Bedoya (Bedoya, 2014).
Trandisciplinarity: A mode of knowledge production and applied
research that addresses societal issues and challenges disciplinary silos.

17

Transdisciplinary librarianship proposes that disciplinary research and hyperspecialization limit inquiry and knowledge organization (Martin, 2017).
Unofficial heritage: “Objects, places, or practices which are not
considered to be part of the state’s official heritage, but which nonetheless are
used by parts of society in their creation of a sense of identity [and] community”
(Harrison, 2010, p. 313).
Urbicide: “Deliberate and widespread destruction of the built environment
(p. xii)… and material substrate upon which urban ways of life and identity take
root. Such destruction negates plural communities and constitutes homogenous,
exclusionary political programs” (Coward, 2009, pp. 38-39).
1.7 Methodological Assumptions
The methodological paradigm for this investigation assumed that
integration of QUAL and QUAN methods of data collection, analysis, and
interpretation would support a comprehensive understanding of the research
questions of the study (Creswell, 2014; Johnson, Onwuegbuzie, Turner, 2007;
Mertens, 2012).
The ontological grounding of this study was based on the following
theoretical assumptions:3
1. ‘Race’ is central to analysis because racialization is inherent to Western
culture and episteme;

3

Adaptation of the five tenets of critical race theory. See Bell (1980) and Delgado
& Stefancic (2012) for a summary of the principles.
18

2. dominant social groups only tolerate social justice or equity when it is
beneficial to them;
3. ‘race’ is compounded by ethnicity, class, gender-identity,
heteronormativity, able-bodiness, and other hierarchies of social ranking;
4. ‘race’ is a social construct, as such, it can be deconstructed through
critical interrogation and redemptive expression;
5. counter-narration is a means by which historically silenced and excluded
groups reclaim their voice on a path to autonomy.
This study is presented in five chapters. The first chapter provided an
introduction to the study, discussing the statement of the problem, rationale
and purpose of the study, need for the study, research questions and
conceptual framework, significance of the study, definition of terms and
methodological assumptions.
Chapter 2 provides a review of the literature and discussion of the history
and function of LAMs in the racialization project in the U.S. Chapter 3 details
the research methodology of this study. Chapter 4 describes the analysis of
the sample data. Chapter 5 discusses the summary of the findings, limitations
of the study, and presents recommendations for the future direction in the
body of knowledge.

CHAPTER 2: LITERATURE REVIEW
The introductory chapter of this thesis positioned LAMs as social
institutions located in a contested community and discussed the need for an
examination of the function of cultural heritage institutions in the context of
gentrification and displacement in the U.S. The overarching concept for this
empirical study was supported by interdisciplinary sources identified through a
multi-stage document review process. Four online discovery platforms were used
to conduct a systematic review of the literature: (a) EBSCOhost; (b) ProQuest;
(c) HathiTrust digital repository; (d) WorldCat.
2.1 Document Review Protocol
Using domain specific databases of the EBSCOhost interface: (a) Library,
Information Science & Technology Abstracts (LISTA); (b) Library Literature &
Information Science (LLIS); (c) Public Library Core Collection: Nonfiction
(PLCCN), the search term ‘gentrification’, with a 1986-2016 date publication
limiter yielded seventy-one results. Seventy of the items were reviews of
gentrification-themed books and one an op-ed from an educational policy journal.
Using ProQuest platform databases: (a) Dissertation & Theses (PQDT); (b)
Library & Information Science Abstracts (LISA), the keyword ‘gentrification’, with
a 1994-2016 publication date filter yielded seven scholarly journals in LISA.
Using the keyword ‘gentrification’ with the subject terms ‘cultural heritage’ AND

20

‘institutions’, with a 2000-2016 publication date filter yielded forty dissertations in
PQDT.
To extend the scope of the search query, social science databases were
included. EBSCOhost: (a) Academic Search Complete; (b) Psychology and
Behavioral Science Collection; (c) Social Sciences Full Text. ProQuest: (a)
Applied Social Sciences Index & Abstracts (ASSIA); (b) Education Resource
Information Center (ERIC); (c) Social Services Abstracts; (d) Sociological
Abstracts. Using the subject term ‘gentrification’ filtered with a 2000-2016 date
range, yielded a cumulative 1115 hits (708 EBSCOhost results, 407 ProQuest
results). To cull the results, the subject filters ‘neighborhood/neighborhood
change’, ‘urban development’, ‘urban planning’, ‘urban renewal’ were selected,
yielding 242 scholarly articles and documents.
2.2 Transdisciplinary Literature Review
The body of literature resulting from multiple search queries transcended
disciplinary boundaries and demonstrated the continuance of critical discourse
regarding the socio-cultural role of LAMs in racialized and marginalized
communities (Böök, 2004; Du Bois, 1902; Foss, 1908; Jones, 1962; Logan,
2012; Nafziger & Nigari, 2010; Schuman, 1969/1989). Given the capacity of
LAMs to contribute to spatial culture and impart identity to constituents and future
generations of constituency (Ebewo & Sirayi, 2008), the literature reviewed for
this study consolidated conceptual elements from critical heritage studies, social
psychology, and information behavior (see table 2.1).

This study was informed by Dunbar’s (2008) assertion that critical race
information theory (CRIT) can be used as a transdisciplinary approach to
interrogate the effects and uses of information by cultural heritage practitioners in
racialized and historically marginalized communities. The study explored
interconnections between the “operative mythologies” (Schuman, 1976.p. 256)
and “inherently political” (Jaeger & Sarin, 2016, p. 17) nature of librarianship; the
“archontic power” (Jimerson, 2009, p. 18) of archivists; and the curator’s capacity
to delegitimize “heritage as false consciousness (Harrison, 2013, p. 101). To
navigate this theoretic terrain a description of the Dynamic Structural Model of

22

Racism (Jones, 1997) is presented; followed by an overview of the socio-cultural
history of LAMs in racialized communities in the U.S. Lastly, core concepts of
information behavior theory are reviewed.
2.3 Dynamic Structural Model of Racism
Jones’ (1997) dynamic structural model of racism (DSMR) was utilized as
a mnemonic device to facilitate comprehension of the process of racialization
(see Figure 2.1). Jones (1997) described ‘race’ as a categorization “loom[ing] in
our psyches” (p. 339) that has “nestled into our everyday life” (p. 345). Jones
added that 'race' “persists as a label that is applied to human groups, with clear
psychological implication… defined by social convention [and] role definitions”
(pp. 347-348).
DSMR situates the operationalization of 'race' as a cultural phenomenon
and structure; mapping cognitive, social, and institutional trappings accordingly.
As a representational device, DSMR provides a lens for a system view of
racialization and racism, scaling between micro-, meso-, and macro-levels of
analysis. Within DSMR, culture corresponds to the personality of society, shaping
human experience, behavior, and informing worldview. Table 2.2 provides a
legend of key DSMR conceptual elements.
2.4 Social-Cultural History of LAMs in Racialized Communities in the U.S.
The institutional legacy of LAMs in racialized communities of the U.S. is
fraught with contradiction (Battles, 2009; Du Mont, 1986; Gardner, 2004;
Gleason, 1945; Peterson, 1996; Robert, 2014). Librarians, archivists, and
curators engaged within these communities recognize it takes more than

Prejudice

Antipathy based upon a faulty and inflexible generalization felt
or expressed and directed toward a group as a whole, or
toward an individual because they are a member of that group1

Racialism

A belief, a cognitive structure that organizes perceptions of the
world around racial categories and the perceptions, ideas, and
values associated with these catagories2

Racialization

Racism

Processes by which racialistic beliefs are transformed into
active economic, political, and social instruments of
categorization and judgment2 hierarchically ordering social
relations and practices into a racial regime3
A process of creating advantaged and disadvantaged groups
through the coordinated actions of individual-, institutional- and
cultural-level biases2

targeted programming to be inclusive. Respectful recognition of cultural
difference and the ability to apply an awareness of the scope of lived-experience
to pedagogy and practice are required (Kumasi & Franklin Hill, 2011; Overall,
2009). To achieve nuanced discourse on the role of LAMs serving communities
undergoing gentrification it would be instructive for information and heritage
practitioners to evaluate institutional practice with a mindset offering hospitality to
the stranger (Derrida, 2000).
Jimerson (2009) insisted that archivists, librarians, and museum curators
be mindful of the intersection between memory, history, social power, and justice
as it relates to written records and cultural materials. He suggested “welcoming
the stranger into the archives” (Jimerson, 2009, pp. 298-301), a concept

25

developed by French Algerian deconstructionist philosopher, Jacques Derrida
and South African archivist Verne Harris (2002). By showing “hospitality to the
stranger [archivists]… balance the support given to the status quo by giving
equal voice to those groups that have too often been…silenced” (Jimerson,
2009, p. 243). To be welcoming of historically marginalized and disenfranchised
community members in information, heritage, and memory centers requires, at
minimum, an understanding of the socio-cultural history of LAMs in historically
marginalized and racialized communities. This relationship is complex and
reflects a polity and convention that has been at times uncomplimentary of
cultural heritage institutional civic missions.
Cultural values are maintained or reformed through statute, policy, and
social norms. Cultural heritage institutions figure prominently in the socialization
process, augmenting social mores, shaping identity, and fomenting literacies.
Harris (1973) noted that public institutions which emerged in the mid-nineteenth
century, socialized second-wave European immigrants from the late nineteenth
to mid-twentieth centuries. First-wave European American institutional
gatekeepers proposed assimilation projects to facilitate American enculturation
(Boxer, 2009; Brown & Bean, 2006; Gumport & Smith, 2008; Layson & Greene,
2015). Collin & Apple (2009) examined the evolution of American literacy in
relation to ‘race’ and U.S. material systems processing and identified three
ideological influences which shaped U.S. public education: Taylor’s scientific
management theory, at the turn of the nineteenth century; Fordism, and the
Americanization project, after the First World War (WW I); and neoliberalism in

26

the information society. The authors noted that “the literacy characteristics of the
industrial-era public schools were a view of knowledge… situated in clear
hierarchies that privilege[d] the ‘official knowledge’ of dominant groups” (Collin &
Apple, 2009, p. 89).
Promoters of the American public library movement recognized the
importance of libraries for socialization (Adams, 1884; Greenough, 1874; Hovde,
1997). Melvil Dewey (1904) argued that schools and libraries were essential tools
for public education. Public libraries were instrumental to the enculturation of
working-class, ethnic groups arriving from eastern and southern Europe (Harris,
1973; Rubin, 2016; Shera, 1952) from the late 1800s to 1930s; as well as
offering citizenship, literacy, and amanuensis services. At the same time, federal
and state legislation prohibited Chinese immigrants from entering the country,
while Chinese migrant workers were restricted from leaving the country (Gumport
& Smith, 2008). Honma (2005) juxtaposed the egalitarian rhetoric of American
public library founders with the ontological role libraries played in the construction
of White identity for eastern and southern European immigrants. Identifying
assimilationist library policies between 1882-1916 as racialization projects, which
served to “perpetuate a corollary system of racial exclusion and oppression
toward those who could not… assimilate into the white racial citizenry promoted
within the library system” (Honma, 2005, p. 7).
Communities of color were effectively excluded from the benefits of the
stated mission of public libraries and schools. Indigenous and enslaved
communities were “politically and legally subordinated [and relocated]”

27

(Lomawaima, 1999, p. 19) in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. These
same communities experienced enforced acculturation as well as the
criminalization of literacy in the nineteenth century (Gates, 1886; Lomawaima,
1999; Monaghan, 1998). Library services for African, Asian, Mexican, and
Indigenous communities in the U.S. during the period of the public library
movement were minimal to non-existent (Burke, 2007; Meriam, 1928; Yust,
1913). Services that were available languished under the aegis of an American
system of apartheid practiced well into the third quarter of the twentieth century.
LAMs mirrored and still reverberate from the segregationist, Jim Crow practices
initiated in 1896 (Du Bois, 1902; Hopkinson, 2011; Lomawaima, 1999; Trujillo &
Cuesta, 1989). Collin & Apple (2009) asserted that “neoliberal politicians… have
endeavored since the late 1970’s to dismantle the [Keynesian] welfare state and
its modes of literacy sponsorship” (Collin & Apple, 2009, p. 89). Such efforts have
contributed to further marginalization in the forms of increased
underemployment, unemployment, incarceration, and “disarticulation of public
school systems from the informational economy” (p. 89).
Art unions, symphonies, theaters, zoological parks, and museums4 of the
mid-nineteenth and early twentieth centuries represented a formalized system of
prestige and power (Tythacott, 2011), which civic leaders believed essential to
the cultural governance of citizens (Bennett, 1995). Wealthy patrons financed the
building of nineteenth century cultural institutions, showcasing collections of

significance to the social elite (Horowitz, 1976; Levine, 2002; Sidford, 2011).
Among these collections were displays of the remains of Indigenous and formerly
enslaved African peoples, as well as ethnological expositions featuring ‘human
zoos’. Between 1896 and 1906 the Cincinnati Zoo, American Museum of Natural
History, St. Louis World's Fair, and Bronx Zoo each housed humans on
zoological display (Lebovics, 2014; Parezo & Fowler, 2007; Zwick, 1996).
Library missions broadened at glacial speed in racialized communities of
the twentieth century. Early proponents of public library service for African
Americans included sociologist W. E. B. Du Bois (Du Bois, 1902; Jones, 1962)
and social-activist discontent, Earnestine Rose. Du Bois contested the use of
public appropriations for the construction of a segregated Carnegie library and
opined the “illegality of using public money collected from all for the exclusive
benefit of a part of the population” (Du Bois, 1902, p. 809). He declared that the
distribution of “public utilities [should be] in accordance with the amount of taxes
paid by [African Americans]” (p. 809). Rose also questioned segregationist
policies in libraries (Rose, 1921a). Assembling a round table discussion at the
forty-third annual meeting of the American Library Association (ALA); seven
attendees “voted unanimously to establish” the Work with Negroes Round Table
as “a permanent round table dealing with [broadened public purpose] for
libraries” in segregated communities (Rose, 1921b, p. 201).
U.S. cultural heritage institutions wore a crown of American ingenuity at
the end of the Second World War (WW II) as cultural patronage morphed into
philanthropy. Wealthy patrons/matrons, foundation and corporate donors, and

29

middle-class subscribers donated to LAM fund-raising drives (McCarthy, 1984).
LAM missions also broadened in response to growing dissension within the rank
and file membership of professional associations. Mid-century modern cultural
heritage institutions began implementing community-based service objectives
reminiscent of settlement house movement programs of the late nineteenth
century (Bruce, 2008). Eight-five years after the inception of ALA, the association
amended its statement of principle and policy to include “the use of a library
should not be denied or abridged because of... race, religion, national origins, or
political views" (ALA, 1961, p. 233).
Prior to 1961 the ALA had been slow to respond to racial segregation
within chapters or experienced by conference attendees (Fenton, 2014;
Peterson, 1996; Preer, 2004; Van Jackson, 1936a, 1936b). A series of editorials
written by Eric Moon, ALA president, 1977-1978, addressed the “silent subject”
(Lipscomb, 2004, p. 299) of racial segregation in librarianship and discriminatory
provision of services. Moon, in an alliance with E. J. Josey, Annette Hoage
Phinazee, and other African American librarians, focused attention on the issue
of ‘race’ and American libraries at the 1961 ALA annual conference (Kister,
2002).
As the demand for social and economic equity reached critical mass in the
late twentieth century, LAM administrators responded by advancing policy
moving the sector away from century old paternalistic overtures of governance.
In 2002, the American Association of Museums (AAM) sponsored the Museums
and Community Initiative dialogs, a series of public forums examining

30

perceptions of museums as inhospitable or patronizing spaces. Authoritarian
posturing practices were identified, reviewed, and discussed (Hazan, 2007).
Communities whose ways of knowing had been historically or institutionally
devalued where also acknowledged and discussed as a means for administrators
to re-vision the scope and potential effectiveness of engagement initiatives.
Shifts in institutional authority and focus reiterate the importance of
communities contesting their exclusion and misrepresentation in cultural heritage
centers. Attempts to move away from the role of overseer or gatekeeper to
collaborator signal an effort on the part of practitioners to leverage buy-in from
racialized and marginalized community members to preserve and sustain the
cultural infrastructure of transfigured communities. LAMs are barometers of the
socio-cultural milieu of their service communities. Weathering the vicissitudes of
social, environmental, technological, and economic change has prompted many
sector leaders to re-evaluate and develop strategic initiatives geared toward
inclusion, engagement, and collaboration.
2.5 The Community Thread from Sociology to Information Behavior
The need for an analysis of the role of cultural heritage institutions
contribution to or circumvention of marginalization in gentrification-impacted
communities is apparent when considering how LAMs manage and distribute
cultural artifacts and knowledge bases. Pawley (2006) argued that L/IS pedagogy
and scholarship “transmit an inheritance that perpetuates white privilege and
presents barriers to racial diversification” (Pawley, 2006, p. 153); exhorting
practitioners to make libraries “places where whiteness is no longer central and

31

people of color are no longer marginalized” (p. 153). Honma (2005) called upon
librarians of color to “recognize the power relationships involved in dominant…
strategic institutional maneuvering which [do] little to challenge structural racism”
(Honma, 2005, p. 13) and “elide critical discourse on… racial inequality” (p. 15).
He advised transformative praxis as a “long term approach to tackling structural
racism in LIS” (p. 22).
Veinot & Williams (2011) proposed research in “community-level
information studies” (p. 860) as a means to gain insight on “how to achieve
greater inclusion” (p. 854) of marginalized communities as well as examine “the
place of libraries in community economic development” (p. 854). As a principle
supposition of L/IS theory, information behavior (IB), in the context of “the
community as the central unit of analysis” (p. 847), lends itself to “everyday life
information behavior” (p. 847) and “information flow” (p. 854) at the meso-level of
the DSMR model.
Burnett, Besant, & Chatman (2001) define IB as a condition or choice to
act (or not) on information. Wilson (1999) developed a matryoshkan typology of
nested information processing activities: information seeking, searching, and use,
which focalizes IB into a series of applications to instigate, discover, retrieve,
use, and communicate information. Shenton & Hay-Gibson (2012) proposed that
IB meta-models circuit a network of relative methodologies in L/IS research. A
range of conceptual approaches situate IB within structuralized (computing or
human) networks or user-centered cognitive processes (Dervin & Nilan, 1986).
These information processing frameworks involve the adoption and application of

32

information. To support a transdisciplinary vantage point, the conceptual
underpinnings most conducive for this project were sense-making (Dervin, 1983),
normative behavior (Chatman, 2000), and information worlds (Jaeger & Burnett,
2010).
2.6 Sense-Making
Sense making theories evolved concomitantly in the fields of
organizational psychology, L/IS, and human-computer interaction. These
divergent streams contributed analyses related to the cognitive behaviors
exhibited by people attempting to interact and interpret (make sense of) their
experiences (Dervin, 1977; Klein, Moon, & Hoffman, 2006; Russell, Stefik, Pirolli,
& Card, 1993; Snowden, 2005; Weick, 1988). Weick (1988) and Snowden (2005)
placed emphasis on collective behaviors involved in the process of meaning
making. Russell, Stefik, Pirolli, & Card (1993) and Klein, Moon, & Hoffman (2006)
focused on external data interpretation at systems and individual levels. Dervin
(1977) highlighted the situational contexts associated with individual meaning
making. Solomon (2002) noted that Dervin focused “on situations, information
gaps, and the actions that people take to bridge [information] gaps” (Solomon,
2002, p. 235).
Sense-making, as envisaged by Dervin in 1972 (Spurgin, 2006),
underwent iterative processes involving theory building; development of a
representational device or central metaphor (Cheuk & Dervin, 1999); as well as
techniques supporting data collection and analysis. Sense-making methodology
(SMM) developed into a theory of methodology (Dervin, 1999), connecting

33

substantive theory with metatheory. Defined thusly: substantive theory –
propositional statements explaining phenomena resulting from observation;
metatheory - abstractions relating to phenomena and the manner in which to
observe it (Dervin, 2005). SMM is anchored by the following theoretic premises
(Dervin, 1983):


The nature of reality is that of perpetual change, therefore discontinuity is
generalizable;



information is a consequence of human observation rather than a static
entity external to humans (Buckland, 1991); i.e., information is subjective
rather than objective;



IB is an ongoing series of sense-making and sense-unmaking actions in
response to reality;



sense-making (and unmaking) is situational and responsive to conditions
across time and space;



recursive observation of discontinuity (circling reality) is required for
reliability.
Dervin interpreted IB as a communicative method of human information

processing in a social context, moving along a space-time continuum.
Foundational concepts of space-time, horizon, gap, bridge, movement,
constancy, change (Dervin, 1999), and power (Dervin, 2005) are framed within
the central metaphor and operationalized through the perspective of an actor
moving across space-time. Each moment of space-time holds the potential for
bridging discontinuity, moving toward sense-making or sense-unmaking. A

34

researcher utilizing SMM circles the reality of an actor’s gap-bridging steps to tap
their verbing (Dervin, 1983, 1999) in an attempt to understand and interpret the
actor’s IB.
SMM interviews are structured with a participatory and dialogic intent (Ma,
2012) to contextualize the experiences of a respondent’s world (situations,
events, moments); to achieve this, a protocol of “fundamental mandates” (Ma,
2012, p. 14) guide data collection and analysis. The positionality of the
researcher is constrained to minimize intrusion into respondent experiences.
Reflexive responses are foregrounded, directing attention to the verbs used by
respondents in describing gateways or barriers to an information world.
Recursive techniques facilitate interrogation of discontinuity and gap-bridging
measures (information need) of respondents. Dervin (1983) described this as
circling reality. By circling reality, the researcher utilizes a recursive method to
engage a situation for deeper examination of a respondent’s information world.
2.7 Normative Behavior
Normative behavior is one of three related theories within Elfreda
Chatman’s small world constellation. A small world is defined by the “social and
cultural space [in which people share] the everyday reality of [their] lives”
(Pendleton & Chatman, 1998, p. 733). Normative behaviors are the actions,
attitudes, and ethics governing the conduct of members of a physical or virtual
small world (Chatman, 2000). The conceptual elements of the small world
(information poverty, life in the round, and normative behavior) explain every-day
IB through a social, cultural, and affective lens. Normative behavior theory

35

contextualizes IB in relation to the effect of social conditions, interactions, and
discourse on information processing (Fidel, Pejtersen, Cleal, & Bruce, 2004).
Chatman proposed the following concepts and propositions for the normative
behavior framework.
Core Concepts (Pendleton & Chatman, 1998; Chatman, 2000):


Social norms – codes of behavior gauging appropriate action within a
system of shared meaning. Social norms hold a small world together
through social control.



Social types - distinctions made between members based on categories of
predictive behavior.



Worldview - the collective body of beliefs determining position and status
in the small world and assessing relevance to larger social world events.



Information behavior – a state in which one may or may not act on
information.

Propositions of normative behavior (Chatman, 2000, pp. 13-14):


Social norms are standards to which members of a social world comply to
exhibit desirable expressions of public behavior.



Members chose compliance because it allows for ways in which to affirm
what is normative for a specific context at a specific time.



Worldview is shaped by the normative values that influence how members
think about the ways of the world. It is a collective, taken-for-granted
attitude that sensitizes members to be responsive to certain events and to
ignore others.

36



Everyday reality contains a belief that members of a social world retain
attention or interest sufficient enough to influence behavior. The process
of placing persons in ideal categories of lesser or greater quality can be
thought of as social typification.



Information behavior is a construct through which to approach everyday
reality and its effect on actions to gain or avoid the possession of
information. The choice of an appropriate course of action is driven by
members’ beliefs concerning what is necessary to support a normative
way of life.
Throughout her theory building process Chatman consistently called upon

researchers and practitioners to take notice of how social factors impact the
course of information flow. Her application of social theories and ethnographic
methods placed her at the forefront of L/IS research in marginalized
communities. Normative behavior theory focuses on the social performance of IB
(Chatman, 1999), providing a useful approach to examine the social context of IB
in mediated or contested community.
2.8 Information Worlds
The central supposition of the theory of information worlds postulates that
IB is equally influenced by the norms, values, and communication exchanges of
extant social groups and larger social structures. Jaeger & Burnett (2010) define
information as an aggregate of “facts, knowledge, feeling, opinions, symbols, and
context conveyed through [physical or virtual] communication” (Jaeger & Burnett,
2010, p. 14). The information worlds framework is intended to explore the social

37

role of information in context to its impact on technical, political, and economic
life. The theory of information worlds extends Chatman’s concept of the small
world in normative behavior theory and combines it with the concepts of the
public sphere and lifeworld elements from Jürgen Habermas’ theory of
communicative action.
Most of the core concepts of the theory of normative behavior remain
intact in the theory of information worlds (IW). The definition of a small world has
been honed in IW to represent “the social environment in which an
interconnected group of individuals live [or] work, bonded… by common
interests, expectations and behaviors” (Jaeger & Burnett, 2010, p. 21). The idea
of social norms, social types, and information behavior stand as presented.
Worldview is replaced in IW by the concept of information value, i.e., “the
different kinds of value that different worlds attach to information” (Jaeger &
Burnett, 2010, p. 35). A fifth element is introduced termed boundaries, which are
the interstices “between and among worlds [in which] communication and
information exchange” (Jaeger & Burnett, 2010, p. 32).
Chatman’s theory of normative behavior affords a micro-level perspective
of the social context of IB. Consolidation of the public sphere and lifeworld
elements of Habermas’ theory of communicative action, in the IW conceptual
scheme, scale to incorporate a macro-level perspective. Habermas’ concept of
the public sphere is introduced as the domain of collective public influence
serving as a cornerstone to “the exchange of information necessary for a healthy
democracy” (Jaeger & Burnett, 2010, p. 25). Lifeworld is the “information

38

[systems] and social environment that weaves together diverse information
resources, voices, and perspectives of [society and the] communication and
information options and outlets available culture-wide” (Jaeger & Burnett, 2010,
pp. 26-27). IW provides a multi-level perspective of the conceptual, social,
technological, and political context of IB (Jaeger & Burnett, 2010).
Burnett & Jaeger (2011) point out that IW “argues for the examination of
information behavior in terms of the immediate social groups of everyday life, the
mediating social institutions of phenomena such as the public sphere and the
context of an entire society" (Burnett & Jaeger, 2011, p. 169). LAMs serve as the
keystone of knowledge and collective memory in the public sphere, providing
three levels of information access - physical, intellectual, and social (Burnett &
Jaeger, 2011). IW emphasizes “the multiple interactions between information,
[IB], and the many social contexts within which it exists – from the micro (small
worlds), to the meso (intermediate) to the macro (lifeworld)” (Jaeger & Burnett,
2010, p. 144). The multi-focal approach of IW complements the multi-layered
analysis of DSMR as well as the technique of circling reality in sense-making.
Combined, these elements acted as a fulcrum in this mixed method Delphi study
and aided the exploration of the function of LAMs and role of cultural heritage
practitioners in the context of a gentrification-impacted community. This study fit
the stated intent of IW to “bring together [L/IS] and elements of… other areas of
research essential to understanding information as a social and societal issue”
(Jaeger & Burnett, 2010, p. 144).

This chapter reviewed the relevant literature and theoretical underpinnings
of this mixed empirical study. The next chapter provides a detailed discussion of
the research methodology of the project. A description of the research scheme,
use of the Delphi process as a research strategy, and the sampling selection of
participants will be addressed.

CHAPTER 3: METHODOLOGY
The purpose of this research project was to develop an understanding of
LAM practitioner and community advocate viewpoints on the anchoring strategies
of cultural heritage institutions in a gentrifying community. Using a modified
Delphi process, this mixed method, non-experimental study explored the
perspectives and experiences of cultural heritage practitioners and community
advocates from metropolitan Detroit. Librarians, archivists, curators, and
community advocates working in gentrifying or gentrified neighborhoods, at
anchor institutions, or with residents in communities at risk to GID were selected
to participate as experts on a Delphi panel.
As described previously (Rationale and Purpose of the Study, p. 4), the
Delphi method was selected to circle the reality of LAM practitioners. Exploration
of the role of LAMS in gentrification and displacement was addressed through
the following research questions: (RQ1) How might cultural heritage institutions
play a role in gentrification? (RQ2) How might information, culture, and heritage
practitioners shape policy, service delivery, or praxis in communities at risk for
gentrification-induced displacement? (RQ3) What services do cultural heritage
institutions provide to communities resisting displacement?
Chapter three describes the research design and strategy implemented to
administer this modified Delphi study and outlines the following:

Collins, 2011); description of the sampling technique, sample frame and selection
criteria; outline of modified Delphi workflow; summary of data collection and
analyses procedures.
3.1 Research Strategy
The research approach implemented for this study was a concurrent
triangulation design (Creswell & Plano Clark 2011). As Figure 3.1 illustrates, the
design scheme involved a single empirical study, placing equal emphasis on the
simultaneous collection of QUAL and QUAN data. Data were analyzed
separately then integrated for interpretation.

3.2 Attributes of the Delphi Process
Ziglio (1996) characterized the Delphi process as a three-phased,
concentric method of sense-making (Table 3.1) involving explorative, evaluative,
and operative spheres of discovery (Day & Bobeva, 2005; Linstone & Turoff,
1975/2000; Ziglio, 1996). In the exploratory phase, QUAL data are collected via
document review, pilot testing, and selection sampling. During the evaluative
phase, QUAL and QUAN data are generated through open-ended inquiry, rating,
and rank ordering. The operative phase, referred to as “utilization” (Day &
Bobeva, 2005, p. 107), incorporates “short or long term… development and
dissemination of… the Delphi exercise” (p. 108).

3.3 Strengths of the Delphi Process
Rowe and Wright (1999) identified four elements of the “classical Delphi
procedure” (p. 354) which collectively constitute a Delphi rubric: iteration,
anonymity, controlled feedback, and statistical group response. In a comparison
of group communication problem-solving processes, Dalkey (1969) described the
criteria for anonymity and controlled feedback as strengths of the Delphi

43

technique, noting that the method elicited better accuracy in responses than inperson discussion groups. Dalkey claimed that anonymity countered halo effect,
i.e., loquacious individuals or people in positions of authority influencing or
dominating personal communication in face-to-face settings.
The applicability of the method has also been identified as an asset in
scenarios where initial problem solving is required and there are constraints due
to time, finances, or geographical dispersion (JPICH, 2016; Somerville, 2007). A
major strength of the Delphi technique has been its use as an heuristic device
(Fischer, 1978; Sackman, 1974; Weaver, 1972). Skulmoski, Hartman & Krahn
(2007) reported that the Delphi technique was particularly useful for conceptual
development of emergent graduate research topics.
3.4 Limitations of the Delphi Process
Criticism of the Delphi technique has fallen largely into three categories:
ambiguity in selection criteria (Fischer, 1978; Hsu & Sandford, 2007; Sackman,
1974); limitation of statistical analysis (Ju & Jin, 2013; Schmidt, 1997; Weaver,
1972); and low response or high attrition rates (Fink, 1991; Hsu & Sandford,
2007; Somerville, 2007). In a RAND report assessing the applicability and
reliability of the Delphi technique as a long-range forecasting tool, Gordon &
Helmer (1964) observed that selection and retention of participants was an
inherent weakness of the method.
Sackman (1974) contended that anonymity and iteration were compound
threats to validity, arguing that anonymity reinforced a lack of accountability by
protecting respondents with a cloak of invisibility; and iteration fostered

44

respondent and researcher biases. Ju & Jin (2013) indicated that the Delphi
method is susceptible to critique when studies lack standard statistical analyses.
Researchers have suggested nonparametric statistical analysis as a means to
circumvent this limitation (Ju & Jin, 2013; Schmidt, 1997).
At the onset of a Delphi survey, panel members are asked to participate
through the full course of the process. Delphi exercises typically require a
minimum of forty-five days to complete (Delbecq, Van de Ven, & Gustafson,
1975/1986). Such lengthy time commitments have the potential to result in low
response rates (Hsu & Sandford, 2007), response fatigue (Fink, 1991) or low
completion rates, and high attrition rates or drop out (Somerville, 2007).
3.5 Methodological and Interpretive Rigor
To offset limitations and strengthen the applicability of the Delphi
technique, Linstone’s (1975/2002) checklist of pitfalls aided conceptualization of
the plan and design of the Delphi process for this study. Pre-testing of the first
Delphi questionnaire established the “construct validity” (Okoli & Pawlowski,
2004, p. 19) of the design and content of the survey instrument (Creswell &
Plano Clark 2011; Okoli & Pawlowski, 2004; Ziglio, 1996). Richness of QUAN
data were provided through the “multiple iterations” (Okoli & Pawlowski, 2004, p.
20) of the Delphi process.
Triangulation, member checking, peer debriefing, and a “coding
consistency check” (Thomas, 2006, p. 244) were implemented to authenticate
Guba’s (1981) criteria for trustworthiness of the QUAL data (Creswell, 2014;
Shenton, 2004). To ensure the reliability of this study – replication of the

45

procedures, not the sample or findings (Williams & Morrow 2009) - descriptions
of the sampling, data collection and data analysis procedures follow.
3.6 Sampling Technique and Selection Criteria
According to American Community Survey (ACS) 5-year combined
occupational estimates; there were approximately 355 LAM practitioners in
Detroit for the period 2006-2010 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2011). Table 3.2 shows a
breakout of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s most current
estimates of LAM practitioners in Information, Educational Services, and Arts,
Entertainment and Recreation occupations in Detroit (U.S. Census Bureau,
2011).

Current occupational data retrieved from the U.S. Bureau of Labor (2017)
show an estimated 4380 LAM practitioners in the Detroit-Warren-Dearborn
metropolitan statistical area (Table 3.3). Nonprobability, purposive sampling was
used to establish diversity in respondent viewpoints related to the research
questions rather than to achieve representativeness of the metropolitan Detroit
LAM workforce (Butterworth & Bishop, 1995; Teddlie & Yu, 2007).

A purposive sampling frame was created using a Knowledge Resource
Nomination Worksheet (KRNW), a selection procedure introduced by Okoli &
Pawlowski (2004). A KRNW (Appendix F) was created through document review
to identify categories of experts and to use the information to generate a list of
prospective participants. Two purposive sampling techniques were used for the
Delphi survey. Snowballing, to identify and gain access to participants meeting
the selection criteria; and maximum variance, to increase the heterogeneity of
the perspectives represented by the sample (Onwuegbuzie & Collins, 2007).
Okoli & Pawlowski (2004) noted that the Delphi survey is a group
communication process, and, as such, the sample does not rely on
representativeness or statistical power as criteria for selection. The explicit
criterion for Delphi sample selection is expertise, demonstrated by knowledge or
experience of the topic under investigation (Ziglio, 1996). Additional criteria for
selection included: (a) willingness to explore the target issue and identify aspects
related to the issues; (b) written communication and computer skills; (c) sufficient

47

time to participate in the study (Delbecq, Van de Ven, & Gustafson, 1975/1986;
Ziglio, 1996).
3.7 Sampling Frame and Selection Protocol
Consensus varies in the literature regarding the appropriate sample size
for a Delphi survey. Clayton (1997) suggested five to ten participants for an
heterogeneous sample, while Okoli & Pawlowski (2004) regard ten to eighteen
as a “practical” (p. 18) sample size. Rowe & Wright (2001) recommended a
sample size of five to twenty respondents, noting that groups over a certain size
limit the gains in the reliability of Delphi studies. To facilitate purposive, snowball
and massive variance sampling, Okoli & Pawlowski’s (2004) selection protocol
(Figure 3.2) was replicated and a database was created of the prospective
individuals and organizations identified through the process.
3.8 Ethical Considerations and Data Security
The research protocol and expedited review applications for the pilot study
and modified Delphi survey were submitted to the University of South Carolina
Institutional Review Board (IRB) Office of Research Compliance on November
26, 2016. The IRB granted approval for exemption from the Human Research
Subject Regulations for the pilot study and modified Delphi survey on December
20, 2016 (Appendix A).
Because the Delphi technique is an iterative group problem-solving
process, the study was quasi-anonymous (McKenna, 1994). Participant’s
individual responses were not known to other panel members but known to the
researcher (Keeney, Hasson, & McKenna, 2006).

Survey responses were kept strictly confidential to maintain the privacy of Delphi
panel members. Panelists were not asked for any personally identifiable
information in the online questionnaires.
Survey data was collected and stored on a secured web server with
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption. Data collected from the survey were
stored in a secured location on a password protected computer. Research
records will be destroyed three years after the termination of the study as
stipulated by the University of South Carolina Office of Research Compliance.
3.9 Modified Delphi Workflow
A modified Delphi technique was used to better understand the function of
cultural heritage institutions in gentrification. The QUAN data (demographic
information, ratings, and rankings) and QUAL data (responses to open-ended
questions) collected provided a nuanced analysis of trends augmented by the
perspective of practitioners working in gentrification-impacted settings (Creswell,
2013). Figure 3.3 outlines the implementation of the Delphi process. The
workflow was modeled upon the Schmidt (1997) protocol for ranking-type Delphi,
shown in Figure 3.4.
The Delphi process was initiated with a pilot survey to test navigation,
readability, and refine any inherent ambiguity prior to the launching of the first
Delphi round. Modifications made during pre-testing enhanced distillation in
subsequent Delphi rounds to foster group comprehension (Ziglio, 1996).

The first round of a classical Delphi utilizes open-ended questions to aid
topic formulation. This step was modified in the study and a semi-structured
questionnaire was created. Relevant topics or questions were incorporated into
the instrument from information gleaned through document review to seed the
survey (Hsu & Sandford, 2007). The second and third rounds of the survey were
developed through an iterative process in which successive questionnaires were
developed based on the results of the preceding survey.
3.10 Instruments and Time Frame
The Delphi process moved from a pencil and paper application to the
online environment with the advent of ICTs. The first electronic surveys or eDelphi (MacEachren et al, 2005) were conducted in 1971 using “teletype or
teletype-compatible computer terminal[s]” (Turoff, 1972, p. 159). The Tailored
Design survey method was used to create a mixed-mode survey implementation
for this study (Dillman, Smyth, & Christian, 2014). Paper and online
questionnaires were designed with similar question and visual formats and
wording for each Delphi survey instrument (Appendix L).
This e-Delphi project was administered using a variety of online platforms
and software programs. Survey instruments were created, distributed, and stored
using the Qualtrics online survey-hosting platform. Qualtrics was also used to
monitor the progress of survey returns, deliver e-mail reminders, and manage
data collection.
Giftbit digital gift cards were offered as a gesture of appreciation to all
participants after the completion of each Delphi round. Giftbit code data were

54

embedded in the Survey Flow element of the Qualtrics interface to trigger an email with a giftlink for each respondent after survey completion. The MAXQDA
computer- assisted qualitative data analysis software (CAQDAS) program was
used to perform inductive analysis of QUAL data. The Microsoft Excel 2010
spreadsheet application was used to organize, store, and clean raw QUAN data,
and the Data Analysis Toolpak add-in program was used for statistical analysis of
QUAN data.
Data collection for this modified e-Delphi mixed research project took
place from September 2016 to August 2017 and incorporated the following
methods: development of KRNW-based sampling frame, comprised of 139
potential contacts; creation of a semi-structured questionnaire; pilot survey; and
three iterative rounds of survey (Figure 3.5). The first and second rounds
collected QUAN and QUAL data concurrently, the third round collected QUAN
data. Each Delphi round required a minimum of four weeks to complete;
panelists had two weeks to complete and return a questionnaire and the
researcher required two weeks to interpret and formulate subsequent survey
instruments.
3.11 e-Delphi Pilot Study
After receiving IRB approval, a semi-structured questionnaire was created
and a pilot survey was conducted March 2017 - April 2017. The pilot study was
administered to test the validity of the survey instrument (Okoli & Pawlowski,
2004); ensure that the survey addressed the research questions (Skulmoski,
Hartman & Krahn, 2007); and to test the navigation and readability of the

55

56
Figure 3.5. Modified e-Delphi Study Time Frame

e-Delphi instrument on the Qualtrics platform. The pilot survey was not
distributed to individuals solicited for the e-Delphi study.
Twenty-four prospective participants were contacted via e-mail and asked
to pre-test the Delphi survey. The e-mail correspondence included two
attachments, a letter of introduction (Appendix B) and background information
about the pilot study (Appendix D). The information letter explained the purpose
of the pilot study, contained a confidentiality disclosure statement, and a
confirmation statement that panel participation was voluntary.
The pilot sample was limited to cultural heritage administrators, educators,
and practitioners from outside the state of Michigan (Table 3.4). Fifteen
individuals (63% response rate) agreed to participate in the pilot survey and nine
individuals did not respond to the e-mail request. Participants were selected from
various regions of the country, seven from southern, three from eastern, three
from midwestern, and two from western areas of the country.

Eleven participants (73% completion rate) returned completed surveys. Changes
were made to the instrument based on feedback received from the pilot group.
The modifications made to the questionnaire validated the content of the survey
(Okoli & Pawlowski, 2004) and contributed to the instrument produced for the
modified e-Delphi study.
3.12 Delphi Panel Solicitation and Recruitment
According to the ACS 5-year combined ‘race’ estimates for the city of
Detroit, 80% of Detroit residents were African American; 13% European
American; 7 % Latinx or Hispanic American; 1% Asian American; and 0.3%
Indigenous or Native American for the period 2011-2015 (U.S. Census Bureau,
2016). As mentioned previously, the U.S. Bureau of Labor (2017) occupational
statistics estimate 4380 LAM practitioners in the Detroit-Warren-Dearborn
metropolitan area; while the current ACS 5-year combined estimates reported
355 LAM practitioners in Detroit for the period 2006-2010 (U.S. Census Bureau,
2011). Approximately 190 (54%) were European American women, 84 (24%)
were African American women, and 80 (23%) were European American men
(U.S. Census Bureau, 2011). The ACS 5-year estimates indicated no African
American men or Latinx LAM practitioners. Estimates were not displayed for
Asian American, Indigenous, or multi-racial LAM practitioners because sample
cases were too small (U.S. Census Bureau, 2011). Middle Eastern and North
African practitioners were also not represented in the ACS 5-year estimate.
To achieve heterogeneity in the composition of the Delphi survey panel,
prospective participants needed to be solicited and recruited from the data gaps

58

indicated in the aforementioned estimates. Using a sample frame of 139 potential
contacts, snowball and massive variance purposive sampling techniques were
used to contact individuals and organizations identified during the KRNW
process. The niche targeted for the survey was over sampled to counter an
estimated 30%-50% drop-out between survey rounds (M. Phoenix, personal
communication, April 21, 2017). Panel selection was limited to cultural heritage
practitioners and community advocates in metropolitan Detroit based on their
knowledge or experience of the following criteria:


Practice at an anchor institution, in a neighborhood undergoing
gentrification, or with a community seeking to stay put or resist
displacement.



Conduct research, publish, lecture, or present on community archiving,
community development, public history, or other place-based activities.



Interest in the role of LAMs in gentrification.
Eighty-nine prospective participants were contacted via e-mail and invited

to take part in the survey. The invitation included three attachments, a letter of
introduction (Appendix C), information about the Delphi process (Appendix E),
and curriculum vitae. The letter of introduction explained the purpose of the study
and asked prospective participants to refer qualified colleagues. The information
letter contained background information about gentrification, synopsis of the
Delphi process, proposed a timeline for the study, offered options for a preferred
survey mode (paper or online questionnaire), and included confidentiality
disclosure and voluntary participation statements. The curriculum vitae was
included to provide background information about the researcher. Prospective
participants were asked to respond to the e-mail if they were interested in taking

59

part in the study. Forty-one individuals (46% response rate) indicated an interest
in participating in the study.
3.13 e-Delphi Round One
The first round of the Delphi study was launched on May 6, 2017. Round
one survey instructions (Appendix G) were distributed using the Qualtrics
platform to forty Delphi panel participants. Panel members were provided with a
link to the survey and asked to complete the survey within two weeks. At the
beginning of the second week, a reminder e-mail (Appendix J) was sent to panel
members who had not completed the survey. A second e-mail reminder or
voicemail message was sent to panelists who had not completed the survey the
day before the closing date of the Round one survey. The morning of the
deadline, a final reminder (Appendix K) was sent to panelists who had not
completed a survey.
The Round one survey (Appendix M) was composed of twenty-three
questions grouped into four areas:
1. Occupation and Organization Information
2. Definition and Impact of Gentrification
3. Cultural Heritage Institutions and Gentrification
4. Demographic Information
The purpose of the Round one survey was to discover issues related to
the research questions. The following open-ended questions from the Cultural
Heritage Institutions and Gentrification portion of the survey were asked to elicit

60

responses from the panelist to generate data for compiling a list of factors for the
second survey (Schmidt, 1997):


List as many factors as you can think of (at least six) that are major issues
(challenges, conflicts, barriers) to cultural heritage institutions serving as
anchors for revitalization projects.



List as many factors as you can think of (at least six) that bridge the
information worlds of residents and support placekeeping in
neighborhoods at risk for gentrification-induced displacement.
Thirty-two panelists (80% completion rate) responded and returned the

Round one survey by May 20, 2017. The survey was closed and individual
responses to the open-ended survey questions were transcribed and returned to
each respective respondent for verification. A total of 290 responses were elicited
by the panel and categorized into 135 Issue Statements and 100
Recommendation Statements. MAXQDA CAQDAS was used to identify common
themes, code the data, and compile a consolidated list of forty-nine propositional
statements. Microsoft Excel 2010 was used to create both a spreadsheet for
organizing Round one raw QUAN data and a QUAL data matrix.
3.14 e-Delphi Round Two
The second round of the Delphi study was launched on June, 11, 2017.
An e-mail summarizing the findings from Round one, instructions for Round two,
and a link to a survey (Appendix H) were distributed using the Qualtrics platform
to thirty-two Delphi panel participants. At the beginning of the second week, a
reminder e-mail (Appendix J) was sent to panel members who had not completed
the survey. A second e-mail reminder was sent to panelists who had not
completed the survey the day before the closing date of the Round two survey.

61

One panelist responded asking for an extension on the return date. An extension
was granted to the panel member to ensure that a maximum number of
participants completed the survey.
The Round two survey was composed of two sections. The first section
contained twenty-three Issue Statements and twenty-six Recommendations.
Panelists were asked to indicate their agreement or disagreement with each
statement by completing a seven-point Likert-type scale. The scale measured
intervals ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree. The second section of
the survey included the following open-ended questions:


Please describe how you could support community-led service
planning/delivery in the next 12 months.



Please describe how your organization [could] strengthen community-led
service protocols in the next 3 years.

The purpose of the Round two survey was to gather data indicating the level of
the groups’ agreement on the factors elicited in Round one and to develop an
understanding of how the factors related to the research questions.
Thirty-one panelists (96% completion rate) responded and returned the
Round two survey by June 26, 2017. The survey was closed and data were
compiled using Microsoft Excel 2010 to input raw Round two QUAN data into a
spreadsheet. Data Analysis Toolpak was used to calculate the percentages of
agreement on the Round two survey items to interpret a level of consensus (Du
Plessis & Human, 2007). For this round of survey, consensus was defined as
having been achieved if 80% or more of the panelists agreed or strongly agreed
with a statement (Avery et al., 2005; Du Plessis & Human, 2007). Schimdt (1997)

62

noted that in this phase of the study, issues of importance are determined as a
result of the listing of consolidated factors being bound statistically. By
establishing consensus, the criteria were set for selecting items for inclusion on
the Round three survey (Powell, 2003).
3.15 e-Delphi Round Three
The third and final round of the Delphi study was launched on July 17,
2017. An e-mail summarizing the findings from Round two, instructions for Round
three, and a link to a survey (Appendix I) was distributed using the Qualtrics
platform to thirty-one Delphi panel participants. At the beginning of the second
week, a reminder e-mail (Appendix J) was sent to panel members who had not
completed the survey. Monitoring of the progress of survey returns indicated that
a number of panel members had yet to start the survey two days prior to the
closing date. A second e-mail reminder was sent as well as voicemail messages
left with panelists who had neither opened the e-mail link to the survey nor
completed the survey. The researcher, aware that there were city wide
commemorations marking the 50th anniversary of the 1967 Detroit Rebellion,
extended the deadline to ensure maximum panel participation.
The Round three survey (Appendix N) consisted of twenty-five statements
that the panelists had rated with 80% or more agreement in Round two. The
panelists were asked to select five of the seven issues elicited by the group and
rank from the most important issue to least important issue. Panelists were also
asked to select ten of the eighteen recommendations elicited by the group and

63

rank from the most important recommendation to the least important
recommendation.
The purpose of the Round three survey was to produce a rank-order
listing of the factors elicited by the panel and to compare rankings between LAM
practitioners and community advocates. The list prioritized the issues and
recommendations identified by the e-Delphi panel. The ranking also provided a
means for understanding the issues and recommendations most critical to the eDelphi panel (Okoli & Pawlowski, 2004).
Thirty panelists (96% completion rate) responded and returned the Round
three survey by August 17, 2017. At this point the e-Delphi survey was
concluded. Panelists received an e-mail thanking them for their participation in
the study and were informed that a summary of findings would be provided, to
those interested, at the completion of the research project. Microsoft Excel 2010
was used to input Round three raw QUAN data into the QUAN database. Data
Analysis Toolpak was used to perform data analysis on the responses collected
from each survey round.
Summary
This three-round modified Delphi mixed research project explored issues
related to LAMs, gentrification, and displacement with cultural heritage
practitioners and community advocates in Detroit, Michigan. The Delphi panel
was composed of administrators, advocates, educators, front-line staff, and
interdisciplinary scholars from metropolitan Detroit. Thirty-two panelists
responded and returned questionnaires in the first survey round (n = 40, 80%

64

completion rate); thirty-one panelists responded and returned questionnaires in
the second survey round (n = 32, 97% completion rate); and thirty panelists
responded and returned questionnaires in the third survey round (n = 31, 97%
completion rate).
A pilot study was conducted to validate the survey instrument designed for
use in Round one of the modified Delphi study. Each subsequent Delphi survey
instrument was informed by data gathered in the preceding Delphi survey round.
Data was collected and analyzed during each e-Delphi round of the study. QUAL
and QUAN data were collected during the first and second rounds of the e-Delphi
study and QUAN data during the third e-Delphi round. The QUAL and QUAN
data gathered during the “elicitation sessions” (Ju & Jin, 2013, p. 1) were
interpreted and evaluated using the MAXQDA CAQDAS program and the
Microsoft Excel Data Analysis Toolpak add-in program, respectively.
The round one survey instrument consisted of a semi-structured
questionnaire composed of twenty-three questions, two of which were openended questions. Responses from the survey were analyzed using MAXQDA
CAQDAS to identify themes in the narrative data. The themes were then
categorized, consolidated, and used to develop the survey instruments for
Rounds two and three. Microsoft Excel 2010 was used to input Round one raw
QUAN data into a spreadsheet and organize both the QUAL and QUAN data
sets.
The round two survey instrument contained forty-nine statements using a
seven-point Likert-type scale (1 = strongly agree to 7 = strongly disagree) and

65

two open-ended questions. Responses were analyzed using the Data Analysis
Toolpak to calculate percentages of agreement to determine a level of
consensus for the e-Delphi panel. In this phase of the study, issues of
importance were established and criteria set for the items selected for inclusion
in the Round three survey. Microsoft Excel 2010 was used to input both QUAL
and QUAN data into respective data sets.
The round three survey was composed of twenty-five statements which
the panel rank-ordered from most to least importance. At the close of the third
and final survey the questionnaires were exported from the Qualtrics platform to
create a codebook (Appendix O). Microsoft Excel 2010 was used to clean the
raw QUAN data set and to facilitate transformation of data for both the QUAN
and QUAL data sets (Sue & Ritter, 2012).
MAXQDA CAQDAS and the Data Analysis Toolpak were used to analyze
patterns and pattern frequency distributions in the narrative data. The QUAL data
set was analyzed using inductive analysis. The QUAN data set was analyzed by
using frequency distributions to tabulate descriptive statistics and nonparametric
statistical methods to calculate Kendall’s Coefficient Concordance W for the
ranked data elicited in the third Delphi round. The next chapter presents the
results of both the QUAL and QUAN analysis of the survey study.

CHAPTER 4: RESULTS AND FINDINGS
Cultural heritage organizations are recognized as anchor institutions in
urban development revitalization schemes (Mathews, 2014; Rubin & Rose, 2015;
Skipper, 2010). Observant scholars have initiated interrogation of the nexus
between revitalization, gentrification, and LAMs (Blumer & Schuldt, 2014; Sze,
2010; Townsend, 2015).The objective of this mixed research project was to
contribute to this body of knowledge by providing information from the viewpoint
and perspective of LAM practitioner and community advocate stakeholders in a
community experiencing GID.
This chapter presents data collected from May 6, 2017 – August 17, 2017
during a three-round modified e-Delphi survey conducted with librarians,
archivists, curators, educators, and community advocates in Detroit, Michigan.
The modified mixed Delphi design was appropriate for this exploratory study
because it allowed the researcher to garner both QUAN and QUAL data,
providing rich information to develop understanding of an emergent topic.
Descriptions of the Delphi panel and a summary of the collection and analysis of
data follow.
4.1 e-Delphi Panel Demographics
An heterogeneous panel was generated for this survey using purposive
sampling; participants represented front-line staff, technologists, administrators,

67

educators, organizers, academicians, and advocates. The following description
of the compilation of demographic information (Table 4.1) was collected from the

4.2 e-Delphi Panel Recruitment and Retention
Prospective participants were identified using a sampling frame of 139
individuals. Eighty-nine potential respondents were selected for inclusion based
on criteria that established the individual as a stakeholder with expertise
demonstrated by: (a) practical work, teaching, or research experience; (b) topical
publications or media-based presentations. Forty-one individuals (46% response
rate) accepted the invitation to participate on the e-Delphi panel. One individual
withdrew before the launch of the first round due to a change in employment.
Seven additional responses were received after Round one commenced; these
individuals were not included on the e-Delphi panel.
Kebea (2016) observed that attrition across Delphi rounds should be
expected and suggested Sumsion’s recommendation of 70% retention as

72

acceptable for a Delphi survey (as cited in Kebea, 2016). The three-round
modified e-Delphi survey commenced with forty participants and concluded with
thirty panel members (75% retention rate) returning the third questionnaire. Table
4.6 represents the completion rates between e-Delphi rounds. Thirty-two panel
members (80% completion rate) answered the first questionnaire; thirty-one
panel members (97% completion rate) responded to the second questionnaire;
and thirty panel members (97% completion rate) returned the third and final
questionnaire.

4.3 e-Delphi Round One Data Collection and Analysis
Data from the first round of the survey were collected from May 6, 2017
through May 20, 2017, using a semi-structured questionnaire created with the
Qualtrics online survey platform (Appendix M). The primary objective for this
round was to discover issues related to the research questions. RQ1: How might
cultural heritage institutions play a role in gentrification? RQ2: How might
information, culture, and heritage practitioners shape policy, service delivery, or
praxis in communities at risk for gentrification-induced displacement? RQ3: What

73

services do cultural heritage institutions provide to communities resisting
displacement?
Using closed-ended questions, panelist (n = 32) performed the following
tasks: selected from a list of descriptors to define gentrification; identified if
gentrification impacted their organization’s service area; chose the extent to
which they believed culture-led revitalization contributed to GID; and specified if
there is a need for the cultural heritage domain to assess if revitalization
partnerships contribute to GID. Two open-ended questions were used to identify
factors related to LAMs anchoring revitalization efforts in Detroit. Responses to
the open-ended questions and comments from the “please specify” text box
options were collected and analyzed to consolidate a list of factors for
subsequent surveys.
The QUAN data set was organized based on an instrument code book
generated from the QUAN survey data (Appendix O, pp. 204-230). Numerical
values of the closed-ended survey responses were input into a database using
the Microsoft Excel 2010 spreadsheet application. Descriptive statistics were
computed using the Microsoft Excel Data Analysis Toolpak add-in program to
calculate frequency distributions. The QUAL data matrix was arranged according
to a narrative typology generated from the open-ended and free-text responses
elicited by the panel. MAXQDA 12.3.2 Analytics Pro CAQDAS program was used
to identify, sort, and categorize emergent themes into a coding scheme
(Appendix P). Narrative data was input into the matrix using the Microsoft Excel
2010 spreadsheet application.

74

A narrative typology was generated using general inductive analysis
(Thomas, 2006). The inductive coding process began with 290 statements
collected from the open-ended and free text responses of the survey. Panelists’
individual responses were read and closely examined to identify repeating
themes. Nineteen emergent themes were identified and assigned a descriptive
code. Sources for code names were based on literature review or originated from
panelist responses. Table 4.7 represents the nineteen primary code
designations, identified as Level One codes, and the number of times a theme
was coded.

A coding consistency check was then executed (Hahn, 2008). An
independent coder was given 100 Level One coded raw text statements and
asked to assign emergent codes to sections of text (Appendix Q). Miles,
Huberman, & Saldaña (2014) recommend 85% to 90% intercoder agreement.
The coding consistency check yielded 75% intercoder agreement.
The emergent codes were consolidated through recursive abstraction into
the narrative categories shown in Figure 4.1. The narrative categories
(Information Value, Access, Education or Skill, Power Networks, Community
Benefit Building, Resources + Funding) are based on the most frequently coded
themes (Appendix P, p. 233), or themes in which the coding frequently
overlapped or clustered (Appendix Q). Four thematic codes were merged.
‘Power’ and ‘relationships/networks’ were combined into the Power Networks
category and ‘resources’ and ‘funding’ were linked together as the Resources +
Funding category. The Power Networks category contains clustered
codes as subcategories (socio-economic status, trust, critical race analysis,
organizational culture, cultural competence, media-based organizing, exclusion,
diversity, indifference, disrespect, appropriation).
To situate the narrative typology in context with the themes voiced by the
e-Delphi panel members, a description is provided for the main categories:
Information Value: As previously discussed (Information Worlds, p. 38),
information value is the fourth element of the IW framework and represents
shared or conflicting perspectives held by the panelists regarding the importance

of information (Jaeger & Burnett, 2010). Panel member 22-M2 suggested that
cultural heritage organizations improve marketing/social networking efforts to
bridge the IW of residents in neighborhoods at-risk to GID; noting that the use of
ICTs “keep certain communities or residents in communication, but don't
necessarily support placekeeping” (Panelist 22-M2).
Access: Jaeger & Burnett (2010) characterize access as the physical,
intellectual, and social means by which people are able to reach, understand,
and make use of information. One panel member’s (26-M3) envisioning of
access for residents in a neighborhood at-risk to GID included “culturally
relevant/responsive historical museums supporting community centers, small
businesses, and public recreational spaces with community programming [and]
galleries supporting local artists and collectives” (Panelist 26-M3).
Education or Skills: Libraries and archives have been associated with
imparting or acquiring knowledge since antiquity (Rubin, 2016; Shera, 1976;
Zulu, 1993/2012). Panel member 24-AD4 conveyed how “literacy and poverty
rates continue to make capital only accessible to the educated and privileged”,
making the use of “the land bank [and] instruments like mortgages almost
impossible to access for the majority of residents.” Panelist 24-AD4 suggested
LAMs make “zines and publications that use visual language and universal
design principles” available, to address literacy and economic disparity issues in
Detroit (Panelist 24-AD4).
Power Networks: Jones, Dovido, & Vietze (2014) describe power
dynamics as the relationship between access to social power, diversity status,

78

privilege, and the ability to control, acquire, and maintain assets. Panel member
12-L2 asserted that “white-owned and operated heritage institutions can never be
used to dismantle [a] cultural/power nexus” formed by “European colonization”
(Panelist 12-L2).
Community Benefit Building: de la Peña McCook (2000) proposed that
librarians are community builders and identified community building as a
community-driven praxis reinforcing the values as well as social and human
capital of neighborhood residents and organizations. Panelist 43-M4 felt LAM
practitioners faced a challenge in addressing the issue of LAMs and gentrification
because of the need for “convincing stakeholders/leadership that this is missionbased work” (Panelist 43-M4).
Resources + Funding: The necessity for a supply of support, information,
or capital was recurrently expressed by many of the panelists. Panel member 45AR4 encapsulated this narrative, indicating that their organization had “started to
apply triage” in an effort to serve communities at-risk to GID. Stating, “we
continue to measure where best to put our energies. We have a renewed
emphasis on K-12 education and on the most vulnerable cultural artifacts that are
directly affected by costs going up, old building stock, neighborhoods in transition
(or neighborhoods being ignored)” (Panelist 45-AR4).
The following details are provided for two subcategories (appropriation,
disrespect) which were in vivo codes (Charmaz, 2012) originating from the eDelphi panel:

79

Appropriation: When the cultural forms of a social, political, or
economically oppressed group are used or mimicked by an oppressor group it is
termed cultural misappropriation (OMICS 2017). Panel member 4-AD1’s use of
the term introduced the theme as an in vivo code. The panel member described
the representation of neighborhoods at-risk to GID by cultural heritage institutions
in Detroit as a “white washing of [the] historical context of resistance and
appropriation of the language and goals of communities of resistance” (Panelist
4-AD1).
Disrespect: The authority for creating this category resided with panelist 2AR1 (Constas, 1992). It indicates a lack of regard or treatment that is
contemptuous, rude, or without respect. Panel member 4-AD1 described a
countermeasure that their organization furnished as a service to offset incivility:
“we provide water at no-cost to those whose water is being shut off; we know that
this is one practice the city is using to force people from their homes” (Panelist 4AD1).
4.4 e-Delphi Round One Findings
Definition of gentrification. Findings in chapter four frequency tables
represent frequency distributions from largest to smallest percentages. Panelists
selected from a list of eight descriptors to define gentrification. Table 4.8 shows
that the majority of panel members determined that gentrification involved the
relocation of racialized, poor, and homeless residents. Twenty-nine (91%)
selected racialized relocation and twenty-six (81%) chose relocation of poor
households and the homeless as primary factors of gentrification.

Eight panel members (25%) provided additional comments regarding
gentrification in Detroit. These panelists expressed contrasting viewpoints across
domains. Some thought gentrification had less to do with ‘race’ and more to do
with SES. While others considered ‘race’ the engine of gentrification. Panel
member 18-L4 commented that “the ‘gentrifying force’ coming into the city
included as many African Americans and Hispanic people as Caucasians. So in
our particular case… it has… more to do with SES” (Panelist 18-L4). Panel
member 24-AD4 noted that, “gentrification is often racialized in the U.S.,
however, it happens in other countries and places where racialized relocation is
not a central feature; the displacement/gentrification issue in Detroit is very
uneven” (Panelist 24-AD4).
Conversely, panelists’ 22-M2, 60-AD11, and 47-AD8 identified ‘race’ as a
prime factor of gentrification. These panel members used terms like
“disenfranchisement”, “genocide”, and described the gentrification process as
“the dismantling of Black political and economic structures”, respectively.

Service provision in gentrifying communities at risk to GID. Table 4.9
shows that seventy-eight percent (n = 25) of the panel members reported that
their organization’s service community was gentrifying.

Due to an error the researcher made in the design of the instrument, the setting
for the branching logic conditions disrupted the survey flow to respondents that
selected “no” or “I don’t know” as a response to Q8: Does gentrification impact
the community served by your organization? As a result, the survey advanced to
Q12 and questionnaire items regarding modifications in practice or service to
communities at risk for GID were not displayed to all panelists. QUAN data for
Q10, Q10B, and Q10C were therefore excluded from analysis.
Findings from inductive analysis however traced the praxis of panelists
working in gentrifying neighborhoods. Panel member 2-AR1 engaged community
benefit building and cultural competence by offering sliding scale fees for cultural
tours to community-based groups and lower income families. Panelist 2-AR1
stated, “I’ve led tours and delivered presentations to both the corporate
community and grassroots organizers to address the issue of inequality based on
gentrification.” Overall (2009) identified cultural competence as an ability rather
than behavior, developed over time, exhibiting knowledge, understanding, and

82

respectful interaction with diverse communities Cultural competence is achieved
by fully integrating work and service so that both the lives of those being served
and those engaged in service are enhanced. Panel member 2-AR1
demonstrated an understanding of the diverse backgrounds and socio-economic
realities of community members in the area and integrated this knowledge into
their programming and service.
The relationship between praxis and power was suggested by panel
member 12-L2 who stated that they had modified their pedagogic methods by
“deriving culturally responsive research questions and teaching practices to
educate MLIS students and scholarly communities about the intersections of
race, power, and culture in urban library communities.” Panelist 12-L2’s comment
underscored the importance of assessing the role of LAMs in GID.
Panelists were asked the extent to which they thought culture-led
revitalization contributed to GID. To discern the pattern in the scope of
responses, Table 4.10 displays the findings in order of magnitude. Seven panel
members (22%) thought culture-led revitalization contributed to GID to a
moderate extent. When asked how important it was for cultural heritage
institutions to assess if revitalization partnerships contributed to GID, sixteen
(50%) specified that it was extremely important for LAMs to assess if
revitalization partnerships contributed to displacement (Table 4.11).
A majority of the panel members supported the notion of cultural heritage
institutions approaching the question of LAMS and gentrification (Table 4.12).

Twenty-eight (88%) indicated that LAMs should engage with community
members regarding the issue. Panelists also indicated a need for LAMs to
support policy implementation and program development in communities at risk
for GID (Table 4.13). Thirty (94%) chose public forum presentations and twentysix (81%) selected adopting anchoring missions as strategies for implementation.
Six panel members (19%) shared additional ideas regarding praxis. Panel
member 54-AR5 suggested that “historical/memory keeping institutions locate

84

and share historical resources that depict related past stories or resources
relevant to today's at-risk communities” (Panelist 54-AR5).

Panelist 47-AD8, recommended practitioners “help young people understand
the[ir] ‘cultural legacy’ and connect it to the skills they need … so they will not
see participation in gentrification… as their only way forward” (Panel member 47AD8). Finally, panel member 4-AD1 commented that LAM practitioners have

85

access to power that “we cannot have” and urged that they “work with young
people who are trying to find their place in this city to see [the] policy and
structural issues behind their individual experiences with gentrification and school
closure[s]” (Panelist 4-AD1).
The feedback elicited in the first round of the modified e-Delphi survey
generated 290 statements related to LAMs and gentrification in Detroit.
Comments were transcribed and returned to respective respondents for
verification. Duplicate comments were removed and terminology consolidated to
produce a list of forty-nine propositions, which were used in the second survey
round to be discussed in the next section.
4.5 e-Delphi Round Two Data Collection and Analysis
Data from the second round of the survey were collected from June 11,
2017 through June 26, 2017, using 7-point Likert-type scale item questions
created with the Qualtrics online survey platform. The aim of this survey round
was to establish a level of consensus on the propositions elicited by the panel
and to develop an understanding of how the elicitations related to the research
questions.
Panelists (n = 31) were asked to rate forty-nine statements compiled from
the preceding survey, which were grouped into twenty-three issue statements
and twenty-six recommendation statements (Appendix O, pp. 220-227). Using
the following seven point scale, panelists indicated their level of agreement or
disagreement with a statement: 1 = strongly agree, 2 = agree, 3 = somewhat
agree, 4 = neither agree nor disagree, 5 = somewhat disagree, 6 = disagree, and

86

7 = strongly disagree. Two open-ended questions were asked in the section
following the Likert-type scale items to provide panelists an opportunity to
comment further if desired.
Descriptive statistics were computed using the Microsoft Excel Data
Analysis Toolpak add-in program. A percentage level of agreement (80% or
higher) was determined by calculating the frequency distribution of the responses
to questionnaire items. At least 80% of the panel had to rate an item as ‘agree’ or
‘strongly agree’ to constitute agreement in this round.
4.6 e-Delphi Round Two Findings
Twenty five items reflected consensus between the e-Delphi panel
members. Table 4.14 presents consensus statements with frequency
distributions which 80% or more of the e-Delphi panel rated in agreement with.
Seven issue statements and eighteen recommendations were culled from fortynine propositions. By establishing consensus, the criterion was set for selecting
items for inclusion on the third survey discussed in the following section.
4.7 e-Delphi Round Three Data Collection and Analysis
Data from the third round of the survey were collected from July 17, 2017
through August 17, 2017, using a ranking survey created with the Qualtrics
online survey platform (Appendix N). As previously discussed, (e-Delphi Round
three, p. 63) the survey was scheduled to remain open until July 31, 2017. Due to
city wide commemorations marking the 50th anniversary of the 1967 Detroit
Rebellion, the survey deadline was extended to ensure maximum panel
participation.

The Round three survey instrument contained twenty-five items (seven
issue statements and eighteen recommendations). Panel members were asked
to select five issues from a list of seven statements and rank order by
importance. One equaled the most important and five the least important.

90

Panelist then selected ten recommendations from a list of eighteen statements
and rank ordered by importance, one equaled the most important and ten the
least important. The Microsoft Excel 2010 Data Analysis Toolpak add-in program
was not effective for computing the nonparametric statistical test of the rankordered data (Moore, 2010). As a result, rankings values (Appendix O, pp. 228230) were recorded with the Data Analysis Toolpak and the nonparametric test
computed using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS).
A nonparametric statistical test was used to analyze the round three
sample data for three reasons:


The study used a small, non-probability sample;



recorded values represented ordinal, ranked data;



the research project was an empirical study; therefore statistical
significance would not be inferred.

Kendall’s Coefficient of Concordance (W) was selected as the
nonparametric statistical test to measure the extent of agreement among eDelphi panel members with respect to their ranking of issues and
recommendations. Kendall’s W (herein denoted as W), is a measurement of
association used to determine the degree of group consensus for ranked data
(Linebach, Tesch, & Kovacsiss, 2014; Siegel & Castellan, 1988). The results for
computing W using this statistical approach, yield values that range from zero,
representing the absence of agreement (no consensus); to one, representing
complete agreement (consensus). Schmidt (1997) developed a guideline for
interpreting W when administering ranking-type Delphi surveys to determine the

91

need for further study: W ≥ 0.7 indicates strong agreement; W = 0.5 indicates
moderate agreement; W ≤ 0.1 indicates very weak agreement and suggests the
need for an additional round of survey (Okoli & Pawlowski, 2004).
4.8 e-Delphi Round Three Findings
Rankings were recorded and mean ranks calculated for each item, data
recorded for items that were not ranked by a panel member received a recorded
value of zero. The results provided used all the data (zeros included) and ties in
the ranking were replaced with a mean rank formula (W. Sims, personal
communication, October 24, 2017). Table 4.15 represents a comparison between
LAM practitioner and community advocate issue rankings with percentage
mention, mean rank, variance rank (D2), Kendall’s W, and chi-square value (X2).

Group consensus overall on the issues and recommendations generated
by the e-Delphi panel (not shown) indicated a very weak level of agreement, W =
0.1. Comparison between LAM practitioners and community advocates also
indicated a very weak level of agreement, with slightly higher W values for
community advocates. W = 0.073 for LAM practitioner issue rankings and for
community advocates, the rounded value for W = 0.2 (Table 4.15). W = 0.1 for
community advocate recommendation rankings and for LAM practitioners, the
rounded value for W = 0.1 (Table 4.16).The very weak levels of group consensus
on the relative rankings suggest a fourth round of survey would have been
appropriate for this study. Finally, Table 4.17 and Table 4.18 show rankings
ordered by the percentage of mentions categorized by narrative theme (Ju &
Pawlowski, 2011).

Summary
A concurrent, triangulation mixed-methods research design was utilized to
examine the role of cultural heritage institutions in gentrification and
displacement in Detroit, Michigan. A modified-Delphi technique was used to
collect QUAL and QUAN data from three rounds of survey conducted over a
three month period. The study began May 6, 2017 with 40 participants and
concluded August 17, 2017 with 30 participants (75% retention rate).
QUAL and QUAN data were triangulated to report the findings of the eDelphi study. The QUAN findings for all three rounds of sample data were
reported as descriptive statistics and frequency distributions. The QUAL findings
were reported as descriptive e-Delphi member quotes or narrative categories.
The narrative typology created from the Round one and Round two sample data
was produced through inductive analysis. The Round three nonparametric
statistical analysis of the sample data was reported as Kendall’s W values to
report group consensus on rankings.
The key findings from this mixed e-Delphi study revealed that the majority
of the e-Delphi panel indicated racialized relocation (91%) and relocation of poor
households and the homeless (81%) as primary factors of gentrification (Table
4.8). Fifty percent of the e-Delphi panel specified that it was extremely important
for LAMs to assess if revitalization partnerships contributed to displacement
(Table 4.11). A majority of the e-Delphi panel indicated that it was important for
LAMs to assess if revitalization partnerships contributed to GID rather than to
remain neutral (Table 4.12). Kendall’s W values indicated a very weak level of

101

agreement among the e-Delphi rankings, suggesting further study would be
necessary if the objective were to achieve group consensus.
The next and final chapter will include the limitations of the study, how the
findings relate to the research questions and literature, and recommendations for
further research.

102

CHAPTER 5: SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The objective of this research was to explore the role of cultural heritage
institutions anchoring gentrification from the vantage point of information, culture,
and community workers in Detroit, Michigan; and to prioritize factors identified by
the group as issues and recommendations for policy and praxis. A review of the
literature pointed to several gaps in knowledge on LAMs and gentrification,
prompting the use of a transdisciplinary document review protocol. Much of the
research on LAMs and gentrification originated from outside the U.S., two case
studies specifically situated libraries and museums within gentrification in
Switzerland and Bogotá, Columbia, respectively (Blumer & Schuldt, 2014;
Townsend, 2015).
There were no previous Delphi studies discovered that assessed cultureled revitalization decision-making or LAM praxis in communities undergoing
gentrification. Studies closely related to the thesis centered on the socio-cultural
context of Whiteness and museum praxis in racialized and historically
marginalized communities (Gautreau, 2015); public archeology, public history,
and cultural resource management at ethnic specific institutions located in
gentrified communities (Skipper, 2010, Sze, 2010); and a survey of DIA exhibition
and interpretive labeling strategies targeted to creating greater inclusion of
Detroit’s predominantly African American community (Beehn, 2015).

103

These studies as well as the 2015 IMLS report on comprehensive community
revitalization served as signposts supporting the researcher’s use of a mixed
research approach. Through the use of the modified Delphi process, a threeround survey instrument was developed to collect data, which addressed the
research problem.
Using a mixed e-Delphi survey, LAM practitioners and community
advocates were asked to identify: (a) challenges, barriers, or conflicts related to
cultural heritage institutions anchoring revitalization projects; (b) elements that
bridge the information worlds of residents at-risk to GID; (c) factors supporting
placekeeping in transitioning neighborhoods. This chapter presents a summary
of the QUAN and QUAL findings relative to the research questions and discusses
the implications of the research; limitations of the study; and recommendations
for future direction in the body of knowledge.
5.1 Summary of Findings
At the close of the first survey round, the sample participants (n = 32) were
comprised of librarians (28%, n = 9), archivists (25%, n = 8), curators (16%, n =
5), and community advocates (31%, n = 10). Thirty e-Delphi panel members
completed all three rounds of survey (94% completion rate), identifying factors
and describing experiences related to cultural-led revitalization, gentrification,
and displacement in Detroit. Panelists rated their level of agreement with fortynine proposition statements (23 issues and 26 recommendations) consolidated
from 290 responses elicited from survey one. The e-Delphi panel then prioritized

104

twenty five items where there was 80% or more agreement among the
participants on survey two. Each panel member selected five of seven issues
and ten of eighteen recommendations in survey three and rank-ordered them
from most important to least important. Consensus was not achieved by the third
and final round of this study, there was a very weak level of agreement in the
ranking of issues (W = .008; X2 = 15.815; df = 6; p= .015) and recommendations
(W = .050; X2 =24.467; df = 17; p = .085).
QUAL sample data produced from the open-ended survey questions were
organized into six narratives: (1) Information Value, (2) Access, (3) Education or
Skill, (4) Power Networks, (5) Community Benefit Building, (6) Resources +
Funding. The narratives of the e-Delphi panel provided descriptive data adding
depth to the QUAN values relating to the research questions. While there was a
very weak level of group consensus, the synthesis of the QUAL and QUAN data
provided a rich source of useful information on the extent to which practitioners
and advocates in Detroit consider the role of LAMs in gentrification and
displacement an issue for the cultural heritage domain.
5.2 Research Question One QUAN Findings
The first research question asked: How might cultural heritage institutions
play a role in gentrification? Findings from survey one showed that 78% of the
panelists work in communities undergoing gentrification. The recorded data
indicated a range of opinions regarding the magnitude to which panelists thought
redevelopment contributed to displacing residents in organization service areas.

105

A third of the panelists (34%, n = 11) specified that culture-led revitalization
contributed to GID to a fairly great, great, or very great extent. Another third
(34%, n = 11) of the panel members indicated that culture-led revitalization
contributed to GID to a very small, small, or to no extent. Twenty-two percent (n =
7) suggested a moderate extent; and nine percent (n = 3) chose not to respond.
A majority of the e-Delphi panel (84%, n = 27) reported that it was very or
extremely important to assess if revitalization partnerships contributed to GID. In
contrast, one panel member indicated that cultural heritage institutions should
remain neutral. Three panelists (9%) reported that it was moderately important to
assess partnerships, and one panel member chose not to respond.
5.3 Research Question One QUAL Findings
Access and Power. A panelist recounting the experience of a family
member of a displacee (Hartman, Keating & LeGates, 1982) from a gentrified,
formerly African American community described the positionality of LAMs in
gentrification and displacement. The panelist commented and inquired:
A friend of mine [shared] her shock in seeing her grandfather's name on a
plaque in San Francisco, long after her family was priced out of being able
to live there. What does it mean for your contributions to be ‘remembered’
when you cannot afford to be a part of that city/community any longer?
This is a key question for cultural heritage institutions. [I]n many cases,
gentrification includes the changing of names of institutions and places.

106

Do cultural heritage institutions just ‘remember’ what the names used to
be, while still giving validity to the… colonizing? (Panel member 47-AD8).
5.4 Research Question Two QUAN Findings
The second research question asked: How might information, culture, and
heritage practitioners shape policy, service delivery, or praxis in communities at
risk for gentrification-induced displacement? This question was explored by
focusing on frequency count data collected from LAM policy implementation and
program development strategy selections and panel generated
recommendations, which received 80% or more agreement by the e-Delphi
panel. Thirty (94%) chose public forum presentations; twenty-six (81%) indicated
revising mission statements, twenty- three (72%) selected evidence-based
research work groups; and twenty-three (72%) reported developing cultural
competency best practices and guidelines as strategic actions.
5.5 Research Question Two QUAL Findings
Community Benefit Building. A participant discussing strategies for
engagement with limited funding indicated the significance of LAM practitioners
as community builders, stating:
[B]roaden the definition of… community engagement... It doesn’t have to
be always a formal thing that costs a lot of money… there’s little
changes… that really honor your relationship with the community... until
you can find the money. And in that case, if the money is found, the

107

people you’re always calling on, why can’t they be the ones to get those
jobs? [T]here needs to be intentional relationship building… This city is full
of block clubs and residents who do the back breaking labor that literally
holds the city together. [P]eople talk about ‘oh it’s great; it’s nice that the
residents are doing this’ but then it also becomes the residents [who] will
sustain all these projects. [T]here’s not an acknowledgement that the
residents have… histories. (Participant 68-AD12).
5.6 Research Question Three QUAL Findings
The third research question asked: What services do cultural heritage
institutions provide in communities resisting displacement? This question was
explored by focusing on the descriptive sample data collected from the survey.
Community Benefit Building. The e-Delphi panel ranked collaboration as
both an issue and recommendation for information, culture, and heritage policy,
programming, and service delivery in communities at risk to GID. A community
advocate described the significance of LAMs to community benefit building in
Detroit, observing:
When we do engagement work for our capacity building workshops, it’s
been hard because there’s not that [space] we can hang around during
parent pick up, because there’s no local [public] school. I could talk to
parents at a charter school at parent night but they may not live in the
neighborhood. It’s important to preserve a place, a community space to
talk to your neighbors. (Participant 68-AD12).

108

Education or Skill. The descriptive sample data collected from LAM panel
members suggested individual practices were being implemented but no
organizational strategies were currently in place. Panel member 22-M2 proposed
that cultural heritage institutions could strengthen community-led service
protocols in the next 3 years by collaborating with the Detroit Independent
Freedom Schools movement (DIFS). LAMs could host a series of community
stakeholder discussions addressing the “issues of access, race, sexism, and
desires/needs for education and skilled recreation” and sponsor the creation of a
“community curriculum” by providing “in-kind service/resources [to] hold weekend
classes delivered by [DIFS] teachers.” (Panel member 22-M2).
5.7 Interpretation of Findings
A transdisciplinary approach was utilized as the conceptual scaffold for
this study, to situate cultural heritage institutions as one of many structural
supports driving gentrification (Kinniburgh, 2017). Documents guiding the
exploration of the socio-cultural context of LAMs, gentrification, and displacement
in a racialized community were discussed in chapter two and provide the
framework for evaluating the results of this study.
The disparity in the representation of people of color in Detroit’s LAM
workforce did not go unnoticed by the researcher. Detroit is a city of color. Over
87% of Detroit residents are estimated to be people of color (U.S. Census, 2016).
Yet, of the 355 reported LAM practitioners in Detroit for the period 2006-2010,
approximately 54% were European American women and 23% were European

109

American men. An estimated 24% were African American women and no African
American men were indicated. There were also no Latinx or Mexican American,
Arab American, Asian American, Indigenous, or multi-racial LAM practitioners
indicated in the ACS 5-year estimate (U.S. Census, 2011).
Underrepresentation of people of color on LAM staffs and in leadership is
a noted and continuing issue for the cultural heritage domain (Drake, 2017; Neely
& Peterson, 2007; Schonfeld, Westermann, & Sweeney, 2015). The connections
between gentrification, displacement, and the historic as well as contemporary
racial segregation of Detroit are well documented (Darden, Hill, Thomas, &
Thomas, 1987 Sugrue, 2014; Thomas, 2013). The continuing struggles for equity
and equality of autonomy by the residents of Detroit made it imperative for the
researcher to have a sample inclusive of the experiences and viewpoints of
practitioners of color for this study.
Dunbar (2008) posited that the “interdependency between… social and
systematic processes” in LAM settings were “under-acknowledged and underaddressed issues within Information Studies” (Dunbar, 2008, p. 14). He proposed
intersectionality as a means of micro- and macro-level inquiry to navigate
understanding of the information worlds of racialized and historically marginalized
communities. Panel member 12-L2 articulated this notion when asserting that
“white-owned and operated heritage institutions can never be used to dismantle
[a] cultural/power nexus” formed by “European colonization” (Panel member 12L2). The propositions generated by the e-Delphi panel address this point in
question, specifically, recommendations six and twelve:

110



R6: Library, archive, and museum studies programs must educate
undergraduate and graduate students, as well as scholarly communities,
about the intersections of race, power, and culture in information and
heritage institutions;



R12: Administrators must critically assess if their organization advances
the imperialistic interests of dominant cultural groups at the expense of
further marginalizing displaced and excluded cultural groups.
Pawley (2006) examined the avoidance and understudy of ‘race’ in L/IS

and also proposed transdisciplinary research as one of five measures to
transform L/IS pedagogy and scholarship. The e-Delphi panel deliberated the
interconnectivity of ‘race’, class, and power in the context of LAMs, gentrification,
and displacement, opening the space for proscribing the institutional legacy of
racial, political, and economic contest in the metropolitan Detroit area. Panel
member 51-M6 summarized this, stating:
[T]he exclusion of longtime residents and small businesses from the
decision making process for the ‘new’ Detroit must be recognized. It
makes it critical for me to put the history of the residents at the forefront of
any conversation about the ‘state of the city’. Silence is not the way
forward. (Panel member 51-M6)
The range of the recorded values for the question regarding the extent to
which culture-led revitalization contributed to GID was surprisingly varied. Sze
(2010) identified this type of multivalence as a “class-driven [component of]
ethnic identification” (Sze, 2010, p. 525) associated with gentrification

111

consciousness. Sze further suggested that gentrification consciousness is an
“institutional awareness of gentrification and one’s own role in it [that]…
reorder[s] the relationship between… cultural groups and their neighborhoods
to…respond to the material realities of gentrification” (Sze, 2010, p. 517).
Gentrification occurs in different phases (Holm, 2013) and its
manifestation registered differently for the e-Delphi panel. This was suggested by
the variety of selections for the stage of gentrification that panel members
indicated who worked within the same zip code. Although gentrification is
different in the eye of the beholder and locale in which it takes root, there are
characteristics which remain constant globally.
Blumer & Schuldt (2014) contented that Swiss libraries played a role in
urban redevelopment and that libraries, worldwide, are components of
gentrification. Townsend (2015) described cultural institutions in Bogotá (and
internationally) as catalysts of gentrification and extended the thesis, declaring
displacement a mechanism of exclusion and urbicide. Ninety-one percent (n =
29) of the e-Delphi panel recognized gentrification as a form of racialized
relocation as well a process of removal for poor and homeless residents of
Detroit. Skipper (2010) identified this as “race and class-based city planning” and
successful implemented a public archaeology and public history collaborative
project that assisted an African American institution stay in place in a gentrified
community in Dallas, Texas.

112

5.8 Implication of Findings
Practical. The interpretation of the findings of this study in relationship to
the literature indicates that cultural heritage institutions in the U.S. do play a role
in gentrification and displacement. It is possible that the paucity of research in
this area could be the result of a lag in the diffusion of this emergent line of
inquiry. The gap in the body of knowledge suggests to this researcher that sociocultural research investigating the function of cultural heritage institutions in
racialized and historically marginalized communities is under-acknowledged and
under-addressed by LAM scholars.
The findings of this study highlight both continued discrepancies in LAM
praxis as well as offer priorities, which could serve in the development of guiding
documents. Three overarching narratives stood out in the recorded data,
suggesting the following: (1) an interest in community benefit building
collaborations between practitioners, educators, and advocates in Detroit; (2) a
need for paper-based and media-based collections and resources addressing
successful mitigation of GID; (3) the need for diversity, anti-racist, and cultural
competency training within LAMs. These narratives were supported in the
discussions in the literature emphasizing social justice service learning in LAM
education and practice (Bharat, 2004; Jimerson 2008) and CRIT and critical race
analysis in library, museum, and preservation studies (Dunbar, 2008, Gautreau,
2015, Pawley, 2006; Skipper, 2010).

113

Policy. The e-Delphi panel recommendations highlighted the need for
short-term operational planning and strategic planning actions that implement
disparities policy; build-in collaborative research to develop community vision
statements and/or curriculum; evidence-based research to align anchoring
strategies to community-led service protocols; and adjustment of position
descriptions to remove ‘organizational fit’ biases.
5.9 Limitations of Study
Although the survey data provides useful information that few researchers
have addressed there were limitations to the study. The error in the selection of
branching logic settings in the survey design resulted in the elimination of data
for three questions from the round one survey. Also, the use of self-administered
surveys may have influenced responses if panel members misinterpreted
questions.
The use of purposive sampling could have potentially introduced
researcher bias, leading to findings that corroborated the researcher’s position.
To reduce the level of bias the researcher used the KRNW selection protocol as
previously described (Chapter 3, p. 49). The KRNW protocol allowed the
researcher to perform a comprehensive search to organize a sample frame
categorized by discipline or skill, literature review, and organization charts or
online staff directories before contacting prospective participants.
The researcher recognized that as an African American woman,
researcher bias could potentially influence the interpretation of the QUAL data.

114

To reduce the level of researcher bias, member checking, peer debriefing, and
code consistency strategies were employed. Lastly, due to the relatively small
sample sized used for this study, the results are not (and were never intended to
be) generalizable.
5.10 Recommendations for Future Direction in the Body of Knowledge
The purpose of this study was to explore issues related to LAMs,
gentrification, and displacement with information, heritage, and memory center
practitioners along with community advocates working in a community
undergoing gentrification. If the objective of this Delphi process had been to
achieve group consensus, additional rounds of survey would have been
necessary until a statistical measure of consensus was reached. Being that this
was an exploratory study, the statistical result suggested a need for further
examination of the divergent perspectives of the LAM practitioners and
community advocates to better understand the similarities and differences
between the groups.
A rich set of data now exists as an evidence base for future research on
LAMs, gentrification, and displacement in the U.S. The issues and
recommendations identified by the Delphi panel contributed two important
streams of information. The first supports the assertion linking cultural heritage
institutions that anchor redevelopment, to gentrification and displacement
(Blumer & Schuldt, 2014; Townsend, 2015). The second evidences the impact of

115

LAMs in a historically marginalized community and signals how LAMs figure in
the process of racialization (Dunbar 2008; Pawley, 2006).
Future research related to the first knowledge base could include a
community-based impact survey of the social and economic effect of cultural
heritage anchor institutions in communities at risk to GID, to determine wraparound services identified by community members. Additional studies could also
replicate this Delphi survey to investigate the extent to which LAM stakeholders
address anchoring projects, gentrification, and displacement in other U.S. cities.
LAM curricula can also be developed to examine how the communitarian charge
of the domain and institutional mission square with GID and the social
responsibility of LAMs in communities at risk to displacement.
Critical analysis of ‘race’ in LAM scholarship is required to address the
issues related to the second knowledge base. Du Bois (1898) defined social
problems as “the failure of an organized social group to realize… ideals through
the inability to adapt a… line of action” (Du Bois, 1898, p. 2). Adding that, “a
social problem is… a relation between conditions and action… [that] has had a
long historical development” (p. 3). The intricate connection between the polity
and convention of intentional and structural racism in the U.S. and LAMs in
racialized communities was previously discussed in chapter two (pp. 23-31).
Further research is needed, as suggested by the narratives of the e-Delphi panel
members, to interrogate the complexity of the socio-cultural relationship between
LAMs and spatial and strategic racism (Hammer, 2016, Jeffries, 2016).

116

A discursive turn is needed to develop LAM curricula, policy, and praxis
addressing the issues in the Power Network recommendations identified by the
e-Delphi panel. To achieve this, LAM scholars must move from the undertheorization of ‘race’ toward a critical analysis of ‘race’, racism, and discrimination
within the sector (Alabi, 2015; Dunbar, 2008, Honma, 2005). Pawley (2006)
examined the avoidance and understudy of ‘race’ in L/IS, asserting the following:
Without a clear and intellectually rigorous understanding of race as
perhaps the major component of multiculturalism, we will fail in our
teaching and research…and continue to trivialize a feature of American
society that is deeply destructive. To achieve clarity, LIS educators need
to recognize the roots of our racialized thinking and the ways in which
these are still discernible in the LIS curriculum. (p. 153)
LAM research and literature examining issues related to agency, authority,
decoloniality, and underrepresentation are essential to an interrogation of the
Power Networks narrative presented by the e-Delphi panel. The level of
ownership assumed by White practitioners who embrace notions of “welcoming
the stranger” or “place making” can be problematic in communities of color that
view practitioners as “the stranger” entering their community, displacing them
from their communities, and renaming creativities and places long in existence.
LAM practitioners perform activities under the purview of institutions that
oversee, valorize, and control access to information, knowledge, culture
production, and ultimately identity and legacy. Implementation of engagement

117

strategies in historically marginalized communities can be challenging because
the entities with contested history are oftentimes unacknowledged. Reflection or
re-imagining of institutional culture is required in taking steps toward building or
repairing institutional trust. To engage with racialized communities it is important
to be mindful that racialization is a byproduct of European colonization and
Americanization projects. Forethought must be given to the ways in which all
people negotiate their identities to navigate ‘race’ power dynamics on a daily
basis in the U.S.
CRIT curricula incorporating cultural and information literacy and
participatory action service learning and research can both document the
historically silenced and “underrepresented forms of knowledge and practice”
(Swanson et al, 2015, p. 13) needed to support a social justice framework in LAM
studies (Bharat, 2004; Dunbar, 2008; Skipper, 2010). CRIT is an important
methodology “to liberate the production of knowledge, reflection, and
communication” (Quijano, 2007, p. 177) in communities impacted by racialization
and cultural subjugation. Critical race analysis in information, museum, and
archival science as well as informatics and telematics can contribute toward
identifying structural and strategic racism in policymaking and practice within
these disciplines.
The objective of this Delphi survey was to present the perspectives,
experiences, and narratives of the e-Delphi panel members at the foreground of
this study on cultural heritage institutions, gentrification, and displacement in
Detroit. A final wish of the researcher would be the implementation of the
118

“utilization phase” of the Delphi process as either a network gathering at the
Allied Media Conference convened annually in Detroit or a collaborative project
in the form of a working group in Detroit.
Summary
This chapter provided a summary and discussion of the results from a
mixed methods three-round modified Delphi study on the role of cultural heritage
institutions and gentrification in Detroit, Michigan. A summary of the QUAN and
QUAL findings relative to the research questions and discussion of the
implications of the research; limitations of the study, and recommendations for
future direction in the body of knowledge were presented. The results of the
study contributed to an emerging body of knowledge in cultural heritage
informatics, gentrification, and displacement.

APPENDIX B – LETTER OF INTRODUCTION TO PERSPECTIVE
PILOT STUDY PARTICIPANTS
Dear [Reader]:
My name is Celeste Welch. I am a cultural heritage informatics doctoral
candidate in the College of Information and Communications at the University of
South Carolina. I am pilot testing a survey questionnaire as part of a research
project I’ve designed to fulfill requirements for my degree in Library and
Information Science. I’m contacting you because of my interest in your work.
Your participation would help to test the readability of the questionnaire and
contribute to the development of this instrument as a tool for data collection. The
questionnaire consists of 23 questions and takes approximately 15 minutes to
complete.
The purpose of my study is to circle the reality of librarians, archivists, curators,
and community advocates working in gentrification-impacted communities, to tap
their perceptions and experience of culture-led revitalization. I appreciate your
time and ask that you review the attached PDF file for background information
about this study.
If you are interested in participating, you will be asked to do three things:
1. Review all statements on the questionnaire.
2. Respond or make comments supporting or opposing any
statements you wish - feel free to suggest issues or ask questions.
3. Return your survey before April 15, 2017.
I will be happy to answer any questions you have about the pilot study and can
be contacted at welch4@email.sc.edu. If you would like to participate, please
respond to this email indicating your interest and you will receive an email
invitation linking you to the survey. If you prefer a paper version of the survey I
can email, fax, or mail one to you.
I sincerely appreciate your time and attention.
Regards,
Celeste Welch

SURVEY PARTICIPANTS
Dear [Reader]:
My name is Celeste Welch. I am a cultural heritage informatics doctoral
candidate in the College of Information and Communications at the University of
South Carolina. I am contacting you because of my interest in your work. I’m
conducting a research study as part of the requirements of my degree in Library
and Information Science and would like to invite you to participate in an e-Delphi
study. I think your experience and expertise would contribute valuable
information and insight on issues relating to the gentrification process in Detroit
and its impact on the residents and cultural infrastructure of the city.
The purpose of this survey is to circle the reality of librarians, archivists, and
curators, along with community advocates, to tap their perceptions and
experience of culture-led urban development and gentrification. Your
participation will help to bridge a gap in understanding the institutional trust of
communities experiencing revitalization efforts advanced by cultural heritage
organizations. I appreciate your time and ask that you review the attached PDF
files for background information about me and the study.
After reviewing the attached files, please respond to this e-mail indicating your
interest. I'm currently in the pilot phase of the study, once completed, e-mail
invitations will be sent linking to surveys or paper questionnaires mailed with
return postage envelopes.
Would you be willing to pass along the attached information to colleagues
interested in learning about this research study? If so, I would appreciate you
sharing the attached files with potential participants so that they may contact me.

APPENDIX D – BACKGROUND INFORMATION TO PERSPECTIVE
PILOT STUDY PARTICIPANTS

The objective of this research project is to identify practices and/or issues
related to service-oriented programming in communities impacted by
gentrification. If you decide to participate in this pilot study, you will be asked to
share your opinions regarding the anchoring of cultural heritage institutions to
urban development projects. I specifically need your help pinpointing unclear
wording, ambiguous questions, problems navigating the web version of the
questionnaire, or unclear instructions in the paper version of the questionnaire.
Below are points for consideration.
Background
Gentrification is a formulaic process of social and physical restructuring
achieved through disinvestment, displacement, re-branding, and infrastructure
upgrade which has transfigured communities for over sixty-five years (Glass,
1964; Tracy, 2014). Uncontrolled commercial development impacts community
values, fragments cultural infrastructure, and endangers the cultural heritage of
poor, working class, immigrant, and racialized communities (UNESCO 1972,
2003, 2011). Since heritage-led revitalization (Gunay, 2008) was introduced as
a strategy to sustain cultural continuity in gentrification-impacted communities;
libraries, archives, and museums have increasingly embedded as stakeholder
institutions in contemporary urban development (Binn 2005, Markusen &
Gadwa, 2010, Mathews, 2014).
Information and heritage scholars are beginning to focus attention on the role of
cultural heritage institutions in urban revitalization. Sze (2010) introduced the
concept of gentrification consciousness to identify the competing discourses
and politics of gentrification within the cultural heritage sector. Describing an
165

ideology of racialization and gender identity issues related to the structures,
policy decisions, and histories of museums. Blumer & Schudlt (2014)
deliberated the responsibility of libraries to community members impacted by
the segregation and displacement inherent to the gentrification process.
This pilot survey seeks to explore your perspectives on this issue. The results
will be used to refine a questionnaire for use in research interrogating the
extent to which cultural heritage practitioners and educators contribute to the
transformative capacity of information and heritage organizations serving
communities impacted by gentrification.

APPENDIX E – BACKGROUND INFORMATION TO PERSPECTIVE
SURVEY PARTICIPANTS

The objective of this research is to explore institutional trust in communities
experiencing culture-led revitalization and to identify practices and/or issues
related to service-oriented programming in communities impacted by
gentrification. If you decide to participate, you will become an anonymous
member on a Delphi panel composed of librarians, archivists, curators, and
community advocates. Panelist will be asked to complete three questionnaires,
sharing opinions regarding the anchoring of cultural heritage institutions to
revitalization projects and the provision of wrap-around services to gentrificationimpacted communities. Below are points for consideration.
Background
Gentrification is a formulaic process of social and physical restructuring achieved
through disinvestment, displacement, re-branding, and infrastructure upgrade
which has transfigured communities for over sixty-five years (Glass, 1964; Tracy,
2014). Uncontrolled commercial development impacts community values,
fragments cultural infrastructure, and endangers the cultural heritage of poor,
working-class, immigrant, and racialized communities (UNESCO 1972, 2003,
2011). Since heritage-led revitalization (Gunay, 2008) was introduced as a
strategy to sustain cultural continuity in gentrification-impacted communities;
libraries, archives, and museums have increasingly embedded as stakeholder
institutions in contemporary urban development projects (Binn 2005, Markusen &
Gadwa, 2010, Mathews, 2014). Information and heritage scholars are beginning
to focus attention on the role of cultural heritage institutions in urban
revitalization. Sze (2010) introduced the concept of gentrification consciousness
to identify the competing discourses and politics of gentrification within the
cultural heritage sector. Describing an ideology of racialization and gender
identity issues related to the structures, policy decisions, and histories of
museums. Blumer & Schudlt (2014) deliberated the responsibility of libraries in

167

communities impacted by the segregation and displacement inherent to
gentrification.
The Delphi Process
Delphi panelists will be asked to share their insights on institutional trust and
answer questions regarding their observations and experience with policies
and/or services provided in communities impacted by gentrification. The Delphi
process will comprise three rounds of surveys delivered through the Qualtrics
online platform. If you do not have regular access to an internet service provider
or an e-mail account, surveys can be mailed to you. It will take approximately
fifteen minutes to complete one online questionnaire. Two weeks will be allotted
for you to complete and return a questionnaire. You may receive an e-mail
reminder (online questionnaire) or phone call (paper questionnaire) a few days
prior to the survey completion date.
The first questionnaire will collect demographic information and ask for your
feedback on culture-led revitalization and gentrification. A summary of your
responses will be returned for you to verify the accuracy of my transcription.
Panelist feedback and suggestions will then be incorporated into a second
survey. The second questionnaire will ask for your comments on panel statement
items. A summary of panelist statements will be returned for you to order. Group
feedback will again be incorporated to create the third and final survey. The third
questionnaire will be sent for you to indicate which statements are most
important to you and to add any final comments or suggestions. It will take four
weeks to process each questionnaire; two weeks for respondents to complete a
questionnaire and two weeks for me to summarize panelist responses. The study
will take twelve weeks for me to transcribe and summarize the data collected
from the three rounds of survey.
Disclosures:
1. CONFIDENTIALITY. Your responses and comments will be kept strictly
confidential. You will not be asked your name or any personally
identifiable information on any of the online questionnaires. You will
receive an e-mail invitation with a link redirecting you to the survey.
Survey data will be collected and stored on secured web servers with
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption. Upon final analysis, data will be
deleted from the secured web servers. If you complete paper
questionnaires, please do not write your name or other personally
identifiable information on any of the materials. Study information will be
stored in a secured location on a password protected computer. Because

168

the study is intended as a group problem-solving process, anonymous
summary of responses will be shared between participants to facilitate the
exchange of ideas. To that end, I ask you and all Delphi respondents to
respect the privacy of the panel members participating in this study. The
results of the study may be published or presented at professional
meetings but responses will not be associated with individuals or the
institutions they are affiliated with.
2. VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION. Your participation in this study is entirely
voluntary. You do not have to answer any questions that you are not
comfortable in responding to or do not wish to answer. You may also
terminate your participation at any time.
I will be happy to answer any questions or comments you have about the study.
You may contact me at welch4@email.sc.edu or my faculty advisor, Paul
Solomon at paulsolomon@sc.edu. If you have questions about your rights as a
research participant, you may contact the Office of Research Compliance at the
University of South Carolina at 803-777-7095.
If you would like to participate, contact me at the e-mail address or phone
number below to indicate that you agree to participate. The survey is currently
being tested, after completion of the pilot phase you will receive an e-mail
invitation from the following address: noreply@qemailserver.com. To avoid the
e-mail being marked as spam, please add the e-mail address to your address
book. If you do not have internet access or an e-mail account, questionnaires will
be mailed to you with return postage envelopes.
Finally, I have an additional request. I am seeking cultural heritage practitioners,
educators, and community advocates in metro Detroit who might be interested in
participating in this study. You are under no obligation to assist me in this effort
nor does it mean that those who share a potential interest will participant in the
study. If you know potential participants, please suggest they contact me or
forward the attached materials for their consideration.
Kindest regards,
Celeste Welch

Directly link residents wanting to stay in their
neighborhood with existing orgs working to resist
displacement and provide resources to this
community at no cost. [LAMs] have access to
halls of power that we cannot have. We need
them to connect us to what we're missing. This
would likely mean risking their grants or access
[to power] but that's a risk they need to be willing
to take (social)
