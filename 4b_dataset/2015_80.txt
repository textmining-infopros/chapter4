ABSTRACT
Pickett, Janie A., The principal and the K-12 school library: A delphi study. Doctor o f
Education (Educational Leadership), August, 2015, Sam Houston State University,
Huntsville, Texas.
Purpose
The purpose of this study was to describe the knowledge, skills, and dispositions
used by the effective K-12 principal to facilitate a strong library program. Specifically,
experts in the field of K-12 administration, K-12 librarianship, and higher education
preparation of K-12 librarians developed consensus regarding what the effective principal
knows, does, and values in order to position the library for maximal support of student
learning.
Additionally, K-12 principal oversight of the school library was examined within
the conceptual framework of the national Interstate School Leaders Licensure
Consortium (ISLLC) Standards. The review o f literature focused on three perspectives
on the issue: research at the nexus of libraries and pre-service preparation of
administrators, literature pointing to principal preparation as bearing the weight of
educational reform, and the school library as key to equitable access to quality education.
Method
Information regarding the knowledge, skills, and dispositions needed by K-12
administrators to direct strong school library programs involved three Delphi expert
profile groups: distinguished K-12 administrators, nationally-recognized librarians, and
professors from distinguished graduate librarian preparation programs, all recognized by
the American Association of School Librarians. Across those three profile groups, 23
panelists participated in three rounds of a Delphi online questionnaire.

Findings
A high degree of consensus across the expert groups led to 44 statements of reallife application for administrators and those who prepare them. Implications for
administrators included supervision, hiring, and assessment within the practice of
supervising the strong school library. Findings relevant for principal preparation and
professional development comprised discrete details of knowledge and skills that can be
taught and studied, as well as values that can inform practice. The essential place of the
strong library among the K-12 educational leaders’ resources was confirmed.

CHAPTER I
Introduction
The current environment for education is one of accountability (Ravitch, 2010;
Wagner, 2014). For K-12 public schools and administrators, the use of standardized
testing is the current means of evaluating effectiveness (Christensen, Horn, & Johnson,
2011). With that focus on test scores have come significantly higher expectations for
school leaders (Council of Chief State School Officers [CCSSO], 2014) who are
mandated by state and federal law to produce quantitative data indicating to what extent
students have made yearly progress.
Implementation of a one-dimensional concept of yearly progress, however, brings
troubling issues. The laws that mandate the testing, the design of the tests that are given,
and the consequences to schools and administrators for not meeting required progress
have become increasingly problematic (Ravitch, 2010). Public education is “getting what
we measure, but we’re measuring the wrong things” (Neal, A., [personal communication]
cited in Wagner, 2014, p. 17).
Increasingly, education reform conversations are pointing to deeper skills and
higher levels of thinking needed by students than those measured by standardized tests.
In The Global Achievement Gap, Wagner (2014) highlighted competencies he believed to
be crucial for the 21st century. However, the structure of today’s schooling often does
not provide for teaching or encouraging these skills, and Wagner (2014) commented that
teachers often lack preparation or encouragement to do so. Hess and Kelly (2007) argued
that “school improvement rests to an unprecedented degree on the quality of school
leadership” (p. 245), but as instructional leaders, K-12 administrators often lack

2
preparation to lead their faculty in implementing new forms of instruction (DarlingHammond, LaPointe, Meyerson, & Orr, 2007; Hess & Kelly, 2007). One resource that
assists with developing forms of instruction and technology may be overlooked by
administrators, yet it exists specifically to foster Wagner’s (2014) crucial competencies:
the school library program (Kuon, Flores, & Pickett, 2014; Mancall, Aaron, & Walker,
1986; Moreillon, Luhtala, & Russo, 2011; New York City Department of Education, City
Universities of New York, & Gale Cengage Learning, 2014 ).
If asked to name the school program that best advances critical thinking across the
content areas, not all school leaders would think of the library. Its role is often
misunderstood and its resources misapplied (Lau, 2002; Shannon, 2012). The phrase
benign neglect has been used in research (Kaplan, 2006) to describe the disuse by
principals of the library’s potential. But properly envisioned, the school library is
research-supported and data-driven to produce not only critical thinkers and competent
citizens but higher test scores and narrower achievement gaps (Barack, 2014; Francis,
Lance, & Lietzau, 2010; Kachel, 2012).
The phenomenon of district and campus administrators unaware of the potential
of the library has been attributed to several causes (Hartzell, 2002, 2012b; Kaplan, 2010;
Lau, 2002). One explanation lies in the lack of training to prepare administrators to
understand, manage, and implement a strong library program (Hartzell, 2002; Kaplan,
2006, Wilson & Blake, 1993). As Hartzell (2002) explained, “administrative training
usually does nothing to make administrators aware of how the library and librarian might
help them. As a result, few principals recognize themselves as important players in
maximizing the librarian's potential to contribute to school quality” (p. 2).

3
National standards for pre-service principal preparation and for in-service
education administrators exist to guide principals in ensuring that “all students graduating
from high school are prepared to enter college or the modem workforce” (CCSSO, 2014,
p. 6). Three iterations of national preparation standards have been published, beginning
with the first in 1996 and the most recent, the 2014 revision draft currently out for public
comment. Yet despite indicators for the knowledge, skills, and dispositions of model
administrators found in the standards, many principals and district administrators report
that their understanding of strong library programs are dependent on personal experience
(Pickett, 2013; Shannon, 2012).
K-12 principals have been described as “the linchpin of a school community”
(Klaris, 2013, para. 8), and the demands on their time and focus often seem
overwhelming (Grant, 2007; Knuth, 2004). In a world where “the rules of the game have
been changed and keep changing,” (Grant, 2007, p. 24), the difficulty for administrator
pre-service preparation programs to adequately prepare school administrator candidates
for all eventualities would be expected. In fact, preparation program inadequacies have
been reported in multiple studies (e.g., Bustamante & Combs, 2011; Darling-Hammond
et al., 2007; Levine, 2005; Veltze, 1992), and principals themselves report not being
adequately prepared for the realities of today’s school setting (Hess & Kelly, 2007).
Today’s K-12 schools need administrators who understand teaching and learning
in a way that will result in citizens able to think critically and creatively (Christensen et
al., 2011; Wagner, 2014). Principals and administrators need all resources available to
help create those citizens. The focus of this study will be to contribute to the knowledge
base needed by administrators who seek to take advantage of resources available to meet

4
the demands for accountability and expectations for student learning.
Statement of the Problem
The current trend of accountability through high-stakes testing drives public
school administrative decisions about programs, facilities, and resources (Christensen et
al., 2011; Ravitch, 2010). In best practice, those decisions are research-driven. Through
the search for informed practice and research, educational leaders can fill gaps left by
their educational leadership preparation. Indeed, superintendents interviewed in one
study shared that administrator research skills to find, interpret, and use data were of
“high importance” for school improvement (Lease, 2002, p. 40).
One example of a campus resource that is thoroughly research-based and tied to
increased student learning is the strong school library (e.g., Haycock, 2011; Kachel,
2013; Todd, 2007). As the “biggest classroom in the building” (Kuon et al., 2014, p. 65),
the library can be positioned to serve as the “silver bullet for boosting literacy and
academic achievement” (Kachel, 2012, p. 33). In fact, the potential of the library to
support student learning is such that “any school or district that decides not to invest in
school library programs must account for that decision in terms of the public charge of
equitable access to a quality education” (Achterman, 2008, p. 194).
Contrary to research findings, however, the current trend among K-12
administrators and boards of education is to cut, reduce, or entirely remove the library
from the campus educational plan (Ballard, 2012; Hartzell, 2012b; Lance, 2010;
Roberson, Schweinle, & Applin, 2003). In sharp contrast, though, because of the
library’s compelling potential to increase student learning, K-12 administrators must
ensure they are aware of the research base for the library and in particular, aware of those

identified attributes that correlate to achievement and a decrease in the achievement gap
(Francis et al., 2010).
Somehow, the research base for school libraries eludes many K-12 administrators,
despite its decades of rigorous quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods research
studies. Consistent results from studies conducted across dozens of U.S. states, Canadian
provinces (c.f. Kachel, 2013) and global communities (Oberg, Hay, Henri, & Sturt, 2000)
have pointed to the impact that an effective school library program produces on empirical
measures of student achievement (c.f. Lynch & Weeks, 1988). Yet K-12 administrators
remain largely unaware of these findings or fail to respond to them (Kaplan, 2010; Lau,
2002). Often students lose access to the rich potential of a library because of that
unawareness. Based on conclusions gleaned from the literature, researchers have been
called to examine avenues to address the administrator knowledge gap about the potential
of the school library program to raise student achievement (Achterman, 2008; Hartzell,
2012b).
Conceptual Framework
In the United States, there exists today a nationally recognized set of educational
leadership standards. The purpose of these standards is to “outline what educational
leaders should know and be able to do” (CCSSO, 2014, p. 6) to ensure students graduate
ready for college and today’s career demands. Developed by stakeholders in national
educational leadership organizations, these national standards were first titled The
Interstate School Leaders Licensure Consortium (ISLLC) Standards (referred to in this
study as the Standards) to indicate the trans-national origination of and intent for those
Standards. The Standards serve to “provide a common vision for effective educational

6
leadership” (CCSSO, 2014, p. 23). A modified version of the Standards was adopted by
the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education and the Council for
Accreditation of Educator Preparation to guide leadership preparation program reviews
(CCSSO, 2014).
In this study, it was assumed that those Standards are widely accepted expressions
of educator knowledge, skills, and dispositions. Through them I examined the
understandings that enable principals to facilitate strong library programs. It appears,
however, that the Standards themselves fail to address the content necessary to prepare
leaders to position the library for student learning.
Purpose of the Study
The attributes that distinguish strong school library programs have been
consistently identified by research (e.g., Kachel, 2013; Lance, Rodney, & Schwarz,
2010), and these attributes consistently correlate with increased student achievement.
Yet rather than awareness of that research or training from an administrator preparation
program, it is personal experience that most often constitutes the primary information
source for principals when making crucial library decisions (Hartzell, 2002; McGhee &
Jansen, 2010; Shannon, 2009). Such subjective experiences can be problematic.
In light of that reality, the purpose of this Delphi study was to describe the
knowledge, skills, and dispositions needed by K-12 administrators to direct effective
school library programs embedded within the larger goal of school improvement. Such
an understanding of principals’ competencies can in turn carry implications for higher
education preparation programs for both administrators and librarians, as well as guide
the in-service professional development of school leaders.

7
Significance of the Study
A wealth of research defines the strong school library: from specific dimensions
of library resources (cf. Kachel, 2013, for a compilation of studies, as well as Todd,
2004); to the dispositions and preparation of the effective librarian (Bush & Jones, 2010;
Church, Dickinson, Everhart, & Howard, 2012; Kimmel, Dickinson, & Doll, 2012). Also
well documented is the crucial need for principals and district administrators to support a
strong library program (e.g., Loertscher, 2000; Pickett, 2013; Shannon, 2012). Ironically,
evidence also reports administrators generally make decisions that ignore school library
research (e.g., Hartzell, 2012b; Kaplan, 2006, 2010; Lau, 2002). Numerous studies have
addressed issues concerning the quality of pre-service preparation of K-12 administrators
(e.g., Darling-Hammond et al., 2007; Hess & Kelly, 2007; Levine, 2005), which is at
times inadequate for administrator responsibilities including supervision of the school
library program (e.g., Roberson et al., 2003; Veltze, 1992).
Lacking in the research, however, is insight into the administrator herself and the
knowledge and dispositions that guide her approach to the school library. Information
regarding specific administrative skills that help position the library effectively is also
lacking. In addition, there is a lack of material within the principal’s sphere (Hartzell,
2012a; Shannon, 2012) that can readily inform principals and allow them to learn to
make research-based decisions in light of their libraries’ potential.
The significance of this study was to fill that gap in the understanding of
administrators who effectively guide implementation of the school library. Access to
reliable data regarding those administrative knowledge, skills, and dispositions may
inform and shape individual administrators seeking to develop professionally. Empirical

8
evidence about the administrator faced with directing the school library program can
guide in optimal use of campus resources for school improvement.
Equity for the quality of student learning is a crucial goal. As Achterman (2008)
asserted, schools that consciously decide against strong library programs are accountable
to their stakeholders for those issues of equity and quality education for all students. An
additional significance of this study will be to provide curricular content for pre-service
programs and in-service learning regarding the use of a school resource readily at hand:
one that has been documented to promote equity, to narrow the achievement gap, and to
extend student achievement (Francis & Lance, 2011).
Research Questions
To develop the description of administrator knowledge, skills, and dispositions,
the design of this study was focused by three research questions. Answers to these
questions were sought through collaborative investigation with experts knowledgeable in
the field.
1. What do experts consider to be essential knowledge needed by K-12
administrators to facilitate an effective library program?
2. What do experts consider to be the essential skills needed by K-12
administrators to facilitate an effective library program?
3. What do experts consider to be the essential dispositions needed by K-12
administrators to facilitate an effective library program?
Definition of Terms
Two conceptual perspectives on K-12 education were involved in this study:
aspects of administrator practice and school library program profiles. For this study, I

drew key terms for administrator practice from iterations of national standards (ISLLC,
1996; CCSSO, 2008; National Policy Board for Educational Administration, 2011) that
attempt to outline best practice for effective school leaders. These standards have, over
the years, used varying combinations of terms such as administrator knowledge, skills,
performance, dispositions, and most recently, functions. Key terms for librarianship are
drawn from best practices in school libraries, in this study designated as the effective
library or library program, and are described in that portion of Chapter II. Specifically,
terms referring to those perspectives are understood in the following way.
Knowledge. To situate this term in the field of educational leadership, I sought a
nuanced understanding of the term knowledge from the Encyclopedia o f Educational
Leadership and Administration (English, 2006). The broad term connotes “congeries of
information” (English, 2006, p. 201) that can be divided into specific types, such as
declarative (general and shared information), procedural (how something happens), and
causal (why something happens). Implications for administrators include recognition that
constructing knowledge requires a complex cognitive process but that intentional efforts
to form new and deeper mental schemas can be accomplished. Administrators can and
do learn.
Skills. Beginning with the early Guidelines fo r the Preparation o f School
Administrators (American Association of School Administrators, 1979), the term skills
has been used to signify visible indicators or descriptors of administrator competencies.
In a dissertation titled School Leadership Skill Development, Weigel (2012) argued that
use of the term skills indicated “a focus on performance or results” (p. 100) and examined
the concept of skill sets that should describe the effective administrator. Gregory (2004)

10
provided additional support for the concept of effectiveness and considered the individual
demonstrating a skill a “performer” (p. 843). Hence, skills are equated to some degree
with performance, and the term can be defined as “expertise developed in the course of
training and experience” (Gregory, 2004, p. 843) and displayed in the performance of
one’s work, demonstrating efficient strategies for that work (Gregory, 2004). The latest
iteration of administrator standards, Educational Leadership Program Recognition
Standards: Building Level (National Policy Board for Educational Administration, 2011)
measures administrator performance in terms of descriptor skills.
Dispositions. The term dispositions as used in this study refers specifically to the
invisible and un-assessable (CCSSO, 2008) personal motivation to action. Perkins
(1995) provided grounding for the CCSSO definition with his statement that
“dispositions are the proclivities that lead us in one direction rather than another within
the freedom of action that we have” (p. 275). In his use of the term dispositions, Perkins
(1995) tended to conflate the term with “beliefs, concepts, values, attitudes” (p. 308). In
this study I considered these terms related in meaning and often operationalized the
concept with the terms values.
Effective school library program. For this study, the term library program
represents all “concepts of practice” (Todd, 2004, p. 9) and resources within a library
(including personnel) that allow students to “engage in diverse information sources in
order to develop new understandings and knowledge, to learn” (Todd, 2004, p. 9). Thus,
the term effective is ineluctably tied to student growth and achievement. Since the early
1990s, research examining the correlation of student achievement and school libraries has
consistently identified functions of library practice that “impact student achievement”

11
(Kachel, 2013, p. 4). Thus, references in this study to an effective library assume those
characteristics of library functions that have been empirically demonstrated to influence
student learning (e.g., sufficient and appropriate staffing, extended hours of access,
funding for enriched collection, technology infrastructure). In Chapter II, a review of
these functions is presented.
Delimitations
This study is bounded by key factors pertinent to the research questions: K-12
administrators as they engage in facilitating school library programs. In particular, the
pre-service preparation for school administrators is explored, with particular focus on the
role, if any, of the library program in that preparation. The research is confined to the
experience of administrators and schools within the United States.
Another delimitation to this study is the concept of the school library.
Specifically this work conflates the roles of librarian, library staff, and the library
program, denominating the combined concepts as the library or the library program.
Discussions during data collection and analysis touched on each of these aspects, but the
research did not explore those aspects individually.
The study is also bounded by its method: a Delphi process. The Delphi technique,
developed by the RAND organization during the 1950s, uses a structured communication
process (Linstone & Turoff, 2002) stretching over repeated and narrowing rounds of
questions to seek opinion and judgments from a panel of experts (Helmer, 1967). Data
generated by this study consist of nonparametric and qualitative information from which
conclusions and inferences are drawn.

12
Additionally, the time period for this Delphi study constrained data and findings.
The study was conducted over several months during the end of 2014 and into 2015.
Responses by the participants were expected to be influenced by current educational
issues and trends, such as the revision of K-12 administrator standards, the
implementation of the Common Core or other state standards, and shifts in funding for
public schools.
Limitations
The limitations of this study arose in large part from the nature of the Delphi
method itself. Belonging to neither the quantitative nor qualitative research paradigm,
the Delphi technique can be susceptible to errors in design, data collection and analysis,
and interpretation of the evidence (Goldschmidt, 1975; Sackman, 1974). Although “little
guidance exists in ... how to manage that data generated” (Keeney, Hasson, & McKenna,
2001, p. 198), the Delphi method has been supported by over half a century of close
scrutiny, statistical examination, and general validation (cf. Brooks, 1979; Dalkey, 1969;
Goldschmidt, 1975; Linstone & Turoff, 2002). Increasingly, researchers have found the
Delphi process to be an appropriate (Helmer, 1967), flexible (Hsu & Sandford, 2007),
and widely applicable (Keeney, Hasson, & McKenna, 2011) method for seeking and
synthesizing knowledge on issues “where published information is inadequate or non­
existent” (Jones & Hunter, 1995, p. 376).
The limitations resulting from use of a Delphi study specifically involve the use
of a consensus methodology that depends on opinions and perspectives of individuals
identified as experts in the relevant field. Care must be exercised to validate the
participants as expert (Murry & Hammons, 1995) and to confirm clear understanding of

13
the responses of those experts. Keeney et al. (2011) clarified that the data collected by a
Delphi “elicit valid opinion” from individuals who demonstrate expertise in the area, with
the clarification that “an opinion is a belief that may or may not be backed up with
evidence . . . . The Delphi technique does not produce any right or wrong answers or any
definitive answers; instead, it produces valid expert opinion” (Keeney et al., 2011, p. 9).
Keeping those experts involved through the study is a further concern (Delbecq,
Van de Ven, & Gustafson, 1975; Dillman, 2007; Murry & Hammons, 1995). Keeney et
al. (2011) asserted that Delphi studies carry a higher potential for participants failing to
complete the process because of the iterative nature of the questions. Because of
predictably poor participation rates, studies by Green, Jones, Hughes, and Williams
(1999) and Brooks (1979) reported the common practice of beginning a Delphi by
initially inviting the entire population of eligible members to participate in order to
ensure an adequate sample size.
Beyond the methodology of this study, further limitations included the uncertainty
of locating contact information for individuals in the sampling pool of panel experts.
Currently the professional names and affiliations are publicly available through the
awarding organization, but contact information is not provided specifically. In addition,
the functionality of the web-based communications may influence respondent
participation. The use of technology for experts to participate in and provide data
through online platforms assumes a comfort and competency that could possibly
influence results.

14
Assumptions
Skulmoski, Hartman, and Krahn (2007) asserted that the Delphi method is well
suited for research “when there is incomplete knowledge about a problem” (p. 1) or when
the goal of the study is to improve understanding of particular problems or possible
solutions. Assuming that the Delphi is thus well suited for the questions of this study,
several additional underlying assumptions are present. These assumptions have to do
with the participation of the expert panelists, the design of the panelist group behavior,
and the design and use of the instrumentation.
Shelton (2010) reflected that Delphi studies assume panelists can in fact be
justifiably identified as experts. Panelists’ participation is assumed to include their
thoughtful and complete responses to the questions asked, in part because their
involvement with the field of study makes them stakeholders in the inferences to be
gained from the study. These assumptions for the panelist behavior are foundational to
the study.
Additionally, the design of the Delphi panel behavior is built on assumptions
regarding the group design: specifically, that group opinions are usually more valid than
that of any single individual, and that group effectiveness can be enhanced by avoiding
face-to-face interactions. The Delphi design specifically provides for anonymous and
independent responses that avoid group pressure and interaction influence (Linstone &
Turoff, 2002). Responses are thus assumed to be more forthcoming and honest.
Dillman (2007) concluded that the design and delivery of the questionnaires also
carry assumptions relevant to this study. Responding to a self-administered questionnaire
“involves not only cognition, but also motivation” (p. 13) and because of the iterative

15
nature of the Delphi, motivation to persist will be an important element to a successful
study. Dillman (2007) also admonished researchers to recognize the assumption that
multiple contacts with the participants “are essential to achieving satisfactory response
rates” (p. 13).
Organization of the Study
In this introductory chapter, the context for education in “a country obsessed by
‘test score accountability’” (Wagner, 2014, p. 230) is posited. This context provides a
foundation for discussing the need of K-12 administrators to oversee and manage their
educational resources in the most effective way possible, ideally in line with researchand evidence-based practices. The literature on U.S. administrator preparation programs,
however, presents an inconsistent picture of the quality of such programs at the same
time that accountability for student scores and financial exigencies intensify the
challenge. This introductory chapter presents the conclusion that administrator
management of school resources, of which the school library program presents an
example, can be sharpened, informed, and strategically implemented to provide improved
outcomes for student learning.
In Chapter II of this study, the Review of the Literature, I begin with the core
concept of formal administrator preparation to facilitate an effective school library
program. From that core, I turn to consider the literature on K-12 administrator
preparation, including the history of national standards for preparation programs. In
addition, I move from the core concept to consider an overview of U.S. implementation
of the school library. Specifically, I focus on the potential of the effective library, the
conditions under which the library supports student learning, and best practices for

16
implementing that library program. The resulting synthesis of these areas of literature
justifies and undergirds the research in this study.
In the third chapter of this dissertation, Method, I laid out the study design for my
research based on a Delphi process. The strategy for my research is discussed, as well as
the information I sought through the Delphi and my intentions for the analysis and
interpretation of data collected. Chapter IV presents the data collected and the results of
the research. In Chapter V, I discuss interpretation of those data and conclude with
recommendations for future research.

17
CHAPTER II
Review of the Literature
The authors of the most recent educational leadership standards shared that
schools are “increasingly accountable for raising student achievement among students
from all population subgroups” (CCSSO, 2008, p. 3). It would be inexplicable for school
administrators to ignore campus resources that have empirically demonstrated a
compelling relationship to increasing that very achievement. Yet misuse of the school
library program is just that: benign neglect at best (Kaplan, 2006), programmatic inequity
at worst (Achterman, 2008). In this chapter, I review the literature relevant to this study’s
examination of the K-12 principal and the school library: (a) studies found at the research
crossroads of principal preparation and libraries; (b) literature examining principal
preparation and national standards thereof; and (c) the empirical studies examining
libraries and their correlation to student achievement.
At the Nexus: Libraries and Pre-Service Preparation of Administrators
The literature of principal preparation programs first crosses the literature of
effective school libraries after the 1980s. Both disciplines were experiencing the early
tremors that would later become the turmoil of school reform and high-stakes
accountability. During that decade, the first national standards for higher education
preparation programs were being shaped (McCarthy, 1999). In that decade as well, the
national standards for school libraries and librarians were shifting to highlight the
collaborative instructional and curricular role for media centers (libraries) and their media
specialists (Midland, 2008). The convergent story lines for the two disciplines are
recounted in five scholarly articles that underscore two foundational principles: The

18
nature and purpose of the school library program was becoming increasingly correlated to
student achievement; and new and experienced school administrators were largely
unaware of the new potential of libraries, unable to value them, and unable to fully serve
as instructional leaders without that knowledge. Ironically, the literature also supported
principals as having “tremendous influence” (Roberson et al., 2003, p. 99) to position
their library programs to influence student learning.
In 1991, Linda Veltze published her dissertation from the University of Southern
Mississippi focusing on the status of the inclusion of information regarding school
libraries in the curricula of principal preparation programs. Her literature review reported
no previous literature existed that considered the nexus of the two fields. The research
work for her study consisted of a quantitative, linear regression study of a randomly
selected national sample of professors in higher education school administrator programs.
Of those professors, 47% reported not including information about libraries in what they
taught; yet 84% agreed their students should be encouraged to learn about the library
program. Participants indicated general agreement with the fairly new national standards
for school librarians, but data collected by Veltze indicated that participating professors
held no clear understanding of the implications of those standards. Conclusions from
Veltze’s (1991) study conveyed two crucial implications for administrator preparation
programs: the critical need to include in the curricula information about the new
conception of libraries, and the need of the faculty themselves to understand that
conception, particularly as expressed in the updated national library standards.
At roughly the same time that Veltze was completing her study, Wilson and Blake
(1993) were also studying the nexus of principal preparation and school libraries. Both

19
were faculty members at the University of Houston-Clear Lake, Wilson teaching Library
Science and Blake teaching in the department of Educational Leadership. Together they
examined the experience and perceptions of a randomly selected national sample of 423
school principals and 572 library media specialists. They reported that participating
school administrators were generally unknowledgeable about the library’s role in
teaching and learning. Most of the principals (69%) reported they were inadequately
prepared regarding the management and function of the school library. Additionally, a
majority (78%) agreed that information about facilitating library programs should be
included in principal preparation programs. Comments from both principal and librarian
participants were used to describe specific topics about libraries that they believed should
be included in preparation programs. Taken as a whole, this content was identified by
Wilson and Blake (1993) as the missing component in higher education preparation
curricula, and the authors concluded that “until education leadership programs at
universities across the nation highlight information concerning school library media
programs in their course work, the potential of the school library ... in the educational
process will not be reached' (p. 68; emphasis added).
A few years later, another study from the University of Houston-Clear Lake was
published (1999) by library professor Wilson and educational leadership professor
MacNeil. In this study, the researchers explored the question of what principals actually
learn in their preparation programs. Specifically, Wilson and MacNeil (1999) sought to
determine if the preparation programs were providing principals with information about
the expanded role of libraries in K-12 schools. From a randomly selected national
sample of faculty from educational leadership programs certified by the National Council

20
for the Accreditation of Teacher Education a total of 250 professors responded to the
survey instrument. Of those 250 faculty, only 19% indicated they did include
information about school libraries in their courses. But follow-up telephone interviews
clarified that a more accurate response was probably less than 15%: A number of the
original positive responses had counted instruction about research methods as
constituting information about school libraries. This phenomenon again supported that
new principals were generally exiting leadership programs unprepared for the potential of
libraries and unable to fully serve as their instructional leaders: “Very few principalpreparation programs across the nation are preparing school principals for the leadership
role related to the school library media center” (Wilson & MacNeil, 1999, p. 23). The
authors concluded with the imperative to provide library information in K-12
administrator preparation, suggesting that accreditation, such as that of the National
Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education, include descriptors specific to school
library supervision that would encourage institutions to do so.
A 2003 study by Alexander, Smith, and Carey revealed that pre-service training
that includes information about libraries is a predictor for principals to value the library
significantly more highly (p < .05) than principals who received no such training. In
1990, the state of Kentucky initiated a broad-sweep reform of its public schools through
the Kentucky Education Reform Act (KERA). An additional $1 billion funding for
education promoted the option of libraries, and in 2000, KERA was amended to require a
library in each public school. But in 2003, Alexander et al. found that a randomly
selected sample of Kentucky state principals regarded libraries as only of moderate
importance. And in general, those principals held only an amorphous understanding of

21
the expanded role of librarians to impact student learning. The authors attributed this
lack of knowledge in part to the principal’s inadequate preparation, with less than 10% of
respondents reporting that they had received any preparation for implementing a library
program. Yet those who had been so trained were strikingly more aware of the valuable
potential of the library to support student learning. This study by Alexander et al. (2003)
supported the big idea that principal preparation had not kept pace with the changes in the
field of school librarianship and the re-conceptualization of the role of libraries and
librarians. The authors theorized that principals unprepared to manage that changed
reality were not aware of, and ill-equipped to take advantage of, the potential of the
school library for student achievement.
A 2003 study by faculty from the University of Southern Mississippi (USM)
provided a discussion of what strategic pre-service principal curricula might resemble.
Almost 10 years after Veltze (1991) took her doctorate from USM, Roberson, Schweinle,
and Applin (2003) published their study regarding their institution’s work to design and
implement curricular changes to the education administration program in order to
adequately prepare principal candidates to manage and effect strong libraries on their
campuses. The first of their two-part study examined the current state of school libraries
in Mississippi, and their findings were in line with the national body of empirical work
supporting strong libraries as correlates to improved student achievement and narrower
achievement gaps. The second part of their study described the curricular changes USM
was implementing in principal preparation courses. Grouping their preparation courses in
three blocks or stages, the faculty was embedding library information strategically in
each block as relevant to the theme for those stages. In addition to the model for program

22
curricula, Roberson et al. (2003) provided two compelling findings: “Students in
[Mississippi] schools with better funded, better equipped, and better staffed libraries tend
to perform better on standardized tests” (p. I l l ), and that, despite the body of research
that supports similar conclusions for other states, there is a “void [about this research] in
the knowledge possessed by pre-service principals” (p. 111). The authors concluded that
“the need for [library] training in educational administration programs is imperative” in
order for administrators (and future principal preparation professors) to understand the
“vital and essential element” that the library presents for student learning (Roberson et
al., 2003, p. 111).
Taken together, these five studies support the foundational concepts of the
dynamic role of the school library program and the void in the knowledge of new
principals to understand the potential of the library to support student achievement. My
study seeks to describe the knowledge, skills, and dispositions needed by K-12
administrators to direct effective school library programs. Research at the conceptual
nexus of pre-service preparation programs and strong school libraries supports the critical
need for such a description.
Principal Preparation: Bearing the Weight of Educational Reform
It is difficult to overstate the crucial role of the principal for effective education
(Briggs, Cheney, Davis, & Moll, 2013; Hess & Kelly, 2007). Because principals are
responsible for so many functions in the school culture, they drive improvement of
student learning (Branch, Hanushek, & Rivkin, 2013; Leithwood, Louis, Anderson, &
Wahlstrom, 2004). But it is the government representatives of each of the 50 states and
the District of Columbia that position principal candidates for success by the authority

23
they hold over the preparation and licensure of principals. Briggs et al. (2013) claimed
that:
States have tremendous authority when it comes to principal preparation.
They are responsible for overseeing and authorizing preparation programs
that prospective school leaders must complete to become principals. States
define the approval process and specify the elements and programmatic
components that need to be included for principal preparation programs to
earn state approval. They are also responsible for collecting and
monitoring programs to determine program renewal on a periodic basis.
(p. 17)
Data on the states’ oversight of principal preparation programs and principal practice,
however, do not present an encouraging picture.
The structure and content of principal preparation. A recent survey of the 50
U.S. states and the District of Columbia was conducted to examine “the current state of
affairs in state principal preparation” (Briggs et al., 2013). With 100% survey response
rate from the 51 states (counting the District of Columbia as a state), Briggs et al. (2013)
reported 978 principal preparation programs in operation across the states, with 19 states
reserving preparation programs for institutions of higher learning only. Despite
consistent research findings that tie key principal competencies to effective education
(Briggs et al., 2013; Hess & Kelly, 2007; Leithwood, et al., 2004; Wallace Foundation,
2013), only 5 states require their preparation programs to include teaching related to these
key competencies. Of the 51 states, 41 require a master’s degree and teaching experience
for principal licensure-both qualifications providing only input measures, whereas “in

24
most other professional fields, licensing systems are designed to require some kind of
proof of competence” (Briggs et al., 2013, p. 27). Key findings in the Briggs et al. (2013)
report indicated that most states were “operating in the dark” (p. 10) due to a lack of
policy, lack of data, and lack of action to influence principal preparation programs and
principal practice. The conclusion confirmed Levine’s (2005) frequently-cited study
critical of U.S. educational leadership training: “As a field...educational administration is
weak in its standards, curriculum, staffing, the caliber of its student body, and
scholarship. Its degrees are low in quality and inappropriate to the needs of school
leaders” (Levine, 2005, p. 61).
Levine’s study primarily focused on the structure of educational leadership
programs. As a consideration of the content of those programs, Hess and Kelly (2007)
examined course syllabi from a variety of university educational leadership programs.
Using course weeks on the syllabi as representative of the amount of attention given to a
topic, the authors concluded that there was warrant to question whether today’s school
leadership training programs “may leave aspiring principals prepared for the traditional
world of educational leadership but not for the challenges they will face in the 21st
century” (Hess & Kelly, 2007, p. 268). The authors synthesized crucial areas of content,
as represented in educational administration literature, into seven broad topic areas as
follows:
1. Managing for results: including topics such as school-level program
implementation, evaluation, and organizational change;
2. Managing personnel: topics such as recruitment, selection, assessment, conflict
management, and termination;

25
3. Technical knowledge: programmatic and managerial issues such as school law,
finance, technology, facilities, data and research;
4. External leadership: topics dealing with relationships with stakeholders beyond
the walls of the school building;
5. Norms and values: including ethics and philosophical perspectives on education,
equity and social pedagogy, diversity and constructivism ;
6. Leadership and school culture: titles including frames of leadership, school
culture and climate; and
7. Managing classroom instruction: topics such as curriculum and collaboration,
pedagogy and class management, and other titles that dealt with the principal’s
influence on what occurs in the classroom.
The findings of Hess and Kelly’s (2007) study indicated that “programs devoted more
than a quarter of their time to technical knowledge [programmatic and managerial
issues], about 15 percent to managing for results and managing personnel, and less to
other areas” (p. 255). These findings provided a sharp contrast between what principal
candidates are being taught and what the majority of superintendents consider the most
important element of a principal’s evaluation: raising student achievement.
Standards that guide training for effective principals. Of three core elements
identified in the research as determining principal effectiveness (training, conditions, and
standards), standards is the most important (CCSSO, 2008). In examining principal
effectiveness standards, Briggs et al. (2013) reported that 47 states (92%) use some form
of standards to define what successful principals do to impact student outcomes. The
ISLLC standards were the most commonly used (32 states reported using them or some

26
modified form thereof), whereas 18 states reported using their own state-developed
standards (Briggs et al., 2013).
The 1999 study by McCarthy on the history of educational leadership preparation
programs explored the development of national educational leadership standards. Her
work helped readers understand how programs and practice have evolved and how they
have been shaped by external forces beyond the control of preparation programs. In
particular, the influence and collaborative work of government and professional
associations are explained as working in combination to produce some articulation of “a
common core of knowledge, dispositions, and performances t hat ... link leadership more
forcefully to productive schools and enhanced educational outcomes” (ISLLC, 1996, p.
iii). McCarthy’s (1999) study also highlighted a phenomenon that has been a frequent
criticism of educational leadership programs: that “educational leadership units
[programs] are reluctant to engage in substantial programmatic transformations” (p. 124).
This resistance to change has presented a stark contrast to the rapid and exponential
growth of the needs and demands for effective K-12 education.
The ISLLC standards for principal preparation programs. The first nationally
recognized and widely implemented standards for educational leadership appeared in the
1996 Interstate School Leaders Licensure Consortium Standards fo r School Leaders
published under the auspices of the CCSSO but developed in wide collaboration with
stakeholder organizations for education and its administration (McCarthy, 1999). This
document set forth six standards, each with a number of explanatory descriptors in the
areas of knowledge, dispositions, and performances related to each broad standard.
Using the language and concepts current at the time, each standard began with the

27
wording “A school administrator is an educational leader who promotes the success of all
students by” and continued on to target six areas of responsibility. Those areas became
more informally (and succinctly) referred to as Instruction, Vision, Management, Ethics,
Community, and Larger Context (Ramaswami, 2013).
Times changed; technological capabilities continued to grow; and the focus on
school reform and national content standards shifted dramatically. The understanding of
what effective school leadership required shifted as well: Rather than a program
administrator, effective principals were increasingly understood as instructional leaders
(ISLLC, 2008) who were “expected to demonstrate bottom-line results and use data to
drive decisions” (Hess & Kelly, 2007, p. 244). But many educational leadership prep
programs continued to resist change. In their 2007 examination of the content taught in
principal preparation programs across the United States, Hess and Kelly (2007) reported
surprising consistency in content across the nation. The authors shared that only 2% of
preparation courses addressed principal accountability as related to school improvement.
Overall data indicated that educational leadership programs had failed to keep pace with
the dramatic changes in education (Hess & Kelly, 2007). In response to those changes,
the CCSSO and collaborative partners introduced a revision of the 1996 ISLLC
standards. Titled Educational Leadership Policy Standards: ISLLC 2008, the six
footprints or standards provided “important but modest” (CCSSO, 2014, p. 6) changes to
reflect the primacy of instructional leadership responsibilities for principals and the
importance of every child learning. Each standard began with the wording “An education
leader promotes the success of every student by” and continued on to target roughly the
same six goals: Vision, Instruction, Management, Community, Ethics, and Context.

28
Standard 4 also changed wording to emphasize the inclusion of faculty collaboration as
part of the successful school community. Instead of the 1996 descriptors called
knowledge, skills, and dispositions, the 2008 standards were operationalized by functions,
defined as “the action or actions for which a person or thing is responsible” (CCSSO,
2008, p. 20). The textual setting for the 2008 Standards specified the different kinds of
standards: policy, practice, and program, and the authors clarified that the 2008 ISLLC
Standards were policy standards and could possibly be strengthened by practice and
program standards documents. At the time of this writing, the CCSSO and collaborators
have presented a third iteration of the ISLLC standards, in the form of a draft presented to
the public for comments: “Public comment draft - 2014 ISLLC standards refresh”
(CCSSO, 2014). From the six footprints or standards statements of 1996 and 2008, the
2014 version moved to 11 statements. Table 1 illustrates the way in which the conceptual
kernels of 1996 and 2008 have been parsed into the 11 standards statements of 2014.

Adapted from CCSSO, 2014, Appendix C, p. 26
The 2014 iteration of the Standards continues to articulate “what education
leaders know and should be able to do” (CCSSO, 2014, p. 6) and expresses the priority of
“leadership for learning” (CCSSO, 2014, p. 6). The fresh nuances included in the parsing
and the functions allow the Standards to be used for any level of educational leadership
(teacher leader, building leader, or district leader) and at all career stages.
The combined perspective of the status of principal preparation programs and the
national Standards for those programs illustrate two underlying premises for this study:
The quality of principal preparation is generally lacking relevance and rigor in most areas
of content and structure, and although standards continue to be developed and sharpened,
there seems to be no corresponding pace of improvement in the programs that prepare K12 administrators. The fact that information on the power of strong school libraries is
lacking in educational leadership curricula represents only one area of many that
principal preparation fails to provide.
The School Library: Key to Equitable Access to Quality Education
The ineluctable concept of school libraries as a necessary part of a strong school
is not new to the library field. Writing about school libraries in the early 1960s, Rutgers
University professor Mary Gaver referenced the then-recent CCSSO policy decision that
stated “the school library is intrinsic to the purposes of the school and is, therefore, a

30
basic service for which the board of education is responsible” (cited in Gaver, 1962, p.
13, emphasis added). The decades since Gaver’s work have seen the development of a
compelling body of empirical research that justifies the CCSSO’s position. The effective
school library has been demonstrated to correlate to improved student achievement (e.g.,
Kachel, 2013), and those “empirically-based studies are particularly convincing because
of their use of correlation and factor analytic methods to isolate specific characteristics of
[libraries] that contribute to academic achievement while controlling for other influences”
(Roberson et al., 2003, p. 98).
As with other instructional programs, however, the library must be positioned
strategically to function as that effective correlate for achievement. School
administrators, often working in a political and financially-constrained environment,
must decide how best to position their instructional resources for greatest impact
(Hartzell, 2007). Principals unaware of the library’s potential will be limited in their
ability to provide equitable and effective resources to meet high-stakes accountability
(Achterman, 2008; Van Hamersveld, 2007).
The questions for this study seek the knowledge, skills, and dispositions needed
by principals to allow them to position the library for greatest impact on learning. This
portion of the review of literature (a) examines the body of research demonstrating the
effective school library’s correlation to student learning and the lessening of the
achievement gap and (b) presents the literature articulating the features and functions of
the effective library program.
The Library Impact studies. It was the U.S. private sector rather than
educational research that first reported on the statistical correlation of libraries to student

31
achievement. In 1988, National Public Radio’s “Morning Edition” host Bob Edwards
interviewed Will Bainbridge, president of an education research and database service
company that assisted in corporate relocations. According to the interview, Bainbridge’s
SchoolMatch® business had worked with high-level business executives to assist with
upcoming moves, providing data on the best local schools in relocation areas. The
company had created a database with information on over 30,000 public and private
schools and districts in the United States. When Edwards asked which school variable
related most significantly to student achievement, Bainbridge replied “library and media
services expenditures” (Lynch & Weeks, 1988, p. 459).
Unfortunately, state- and institution-specific data from SchoolMatch® were
proprietary and available only by purchase. Even then, the data released weren’t always
disaggregated as consumers wanted. The September 1988 issue of American Libraries
reviewed the situation and shared a letter from one unhappy reader, Keith Curry Lance.
Miffed at having paid $79 for a SchoolMatch® report that did not disclose discrete data
for his state of Colorado, Dr. Lance wrote that “we have applied for a Library Research
and Demonstration grant to conduct our own analysis and to develop a methodology and
database which other states can replicate” (Lynch & Weeks, 1988, p. 460). Dr. Lance did
in fact receive that research grant, and the database and methodology were created and
shared.
The corpus of empirical studies correlating school libraries to student
achievement continues to grow, and many studies still rely, at least in part, on Lance’s
methodology. Today those studies are referred to as a whole by the name school library
impact studies or simply impact studies. Access to and information about those studies

32
are provided at http://www.lrs.org, the online home of Lance’s Library Research Service
working in association with the Colorado State Library and the Colorado Department of
Education. In addition, Pennsylvania’s Mansfield University (i.e., http://slit.mansfield.edu/current-students/school-library-impact-studies-project.cfm; cited in this
study as Kachel, 2013) provides a summative document describing the studies and
providing links where available to the original studies. As of early 2015, more than 26
states and provinces have produced more than 38 impact studies specific to their students.
Table 2 illustrates studies identified as of April 2015. For purposes of this literature
review, I discuss the first and the latest of those impact studies and the ways in which
they represent both the status of library impact research and the evolution of the strategies
for those studies.

An examination of the first impact study conducted by Lance, Welbom, and
Hamilton-Pennell (1990) sets forth the methodology developed that would be repeated
over the following decades. Four data sets were used: student standardized test scores
(the most common in Colorado at the time were the norm-referenced Iowa Test of Basic
Skills and the Tests of Achievement and Proficiency); the most recent census data for the

34
sample; school statistics for the building level; and data on the building’s school library.
The school, library, and test data for the 1990 study were drawn from the 1988-1989
school year. Because only 17% of Colorado’s public schools presented all the needed
data, Lance et al. (1990) used that sample but also verified the representativeness of the
limited sample: Though limited in extent, the sample size was almost identical to the
whole of Colorado public schools, as well as to the U.S. national school profile. The
authors used three statistical techniques on those data: correlation analysis to eliminate
redundant variables and to combine related ones; factor analysis to compare grouped
variables; and multiple regression to test the model of academic achievement. The path
analysis for the regression technique placed community variables first, school variables
second, and library variables followed third. These variables were examined in relation
to academic achievement, with relationships reported as path coefficients. Some of the
study’s findings were reported in the executive summary as follows:
•

Where the school libraries were better funded, academic achievement was higher,
while controlling for poverty and the education of community adults;

•

Size of the library staff and collection was a predictor of academic achievement,
second only to absence of at-risk conditions;

•

Students whose librarians participated in the instructional process of the school
were higher academic achievers. (Lance et al., 1990, p. iii)
As other states and Ontario sought to verify their local school library impact,

researchers drew on Lance et al.’s (1990) method design. In a number of cases, state
boards of education hired Lance and his research organization to conduct studies for
them. Those geographically diverse studies consistently returned similar findings.

35
An examination of the latest impact study as of July 2014 demonstrates the
evolution of this body of research. Lance and Schwarz (2012) designed the second
Pennsylvania state study in a way that confirmed what was already known: the consistent
finding that “quality school library programs impact student achievement” (Kachel, 2013,
p. 4). However, their study design also reflected current pressures on schools and
libraries: high stakes testing, national standards, and financial constraints.
The 2012 study by Lance and Schwarz consisted of three distinct topics or phases.
The first phase, similar to earlier impact studies, examined the relationship between
school libraries and state student test scores. In this case, however, Lance and Schwarz
(2012) no longer needed to confirm that a correlation existed between libraries and
student achievement. Instead, the researchers narrowed their data collection to consider
libraries as yes or no units of analysis: Schools from which the data were drawn either
did or did not report specific measures of strong libraries. Against this binary
perspective, the range of student scores was considered, and again Lance and Schwarz
(2012) refined the Pennsylvania data collection. For the first time in the impact studies,
achievement data were reported for student writing in addition to measures of student
reading. Also for the first time, data were collected and analyzed for specific sub-groups
such as economically disadvantaged, underrepresented demographic groups, and students
with individualized education programs (IEPs). With an examination of test scores for
these students specifically, the researchers sought to determine the relationship of
effective libraries specifically to narrowing the achievement gap. Phase I of the study
found that “consistently, for all ... library measures, students with access to these
resources—a better-staffed, funded, equipped, and stocked, and more accessible school

36
library—are more likely to score Advanced and less likely to score Below Basic” (Lance
& Schwarz, 2012, iii). Surprisingly, the impact of the school library was found to be
“more pronounced proportionally” for writing than for reading scores (Lance & Schwarz,
2012, iii). Strong library impact was noted across all of the sample groups. However, for
the economically disadvantaged, the Black and Hispanic groups, and students with IEPs,
test scores “associated with stronger library programs are better for these than for
students generally” (Lance & Schwarz, 2012, iii). In other words, those students needing
the most help got the most from strong libraries.
In Phase 2 of the study, Lance and Schwarz (2012) examined the perceptions of
principals, teachers, and librarians to determine what, if any, influence librarians
appeared to bring to the implementation of national standards, both for curricular and for
library practices. The Pennsylvania educators identified specific library outputs (services
and support) of strong libraries that they believed were key to implementing those
standards. Findings offered “substantial evidence of the unique contributions of library
programs and librarians to what and how well Pennsylvania students learn. What students
learn is how to learn more effectively, both now and in the future” (Lance & Schwarz,
2012, p. vii).
Phase 3 of the 2012 study introduced a new perspective on library impact: the
financial costs to implement the functions of effective libraries. From the survey of
perceptions of principals, teachers, and librarians, an overwhelming majority identified
three library infrastructure components as being valued strongly for having a positive
impact on student learning: certificated, full-time staff, professional development for
collaborative work between teachers and librarians, and state-wide e-resources for

37
equitable educational enrichment. Table 3 illustrates those components with the
estimated Pennsylvania state cost based on data from 2010-2011.

Data provided by Lance and Schwarz presented a compelling case for school
libraries: The power of the library’s impact on learning, at the cost of “about a nickel out
of every $10 spent on public education” (Lance & Schwarz, 2012, p. 165), along with the
equity of quality education to be provided by state-wide e-resources, made not funding
libraries to be a clear penny-wise, pound-foolish decision.
The gamut of evidence presented by the school library impact studies has
provided decades of research support for libraries in general and for specific states and
Ontario. The consistency of findings along with the strategic exploration of current
issues in education have made it clear that administrators who choose to not implement a
strong library program have much to account for (Achterman, 2008; Gaver, 1962).
Attributes of the effective library. The consistency of library research findings
and the strategic design of those studies have resulted in clearly recognized attributes that
determine the effectiveness of a school’s library program. Drawn from the corpus of

38
impact studies, the following qualities have been demonstrated to impact student
achievement. While multiple studies support most assertions, further explanation and
state-specific quantitative data are found in Kachel (2013), a single meta-study synthesis
of the impact studies and findings cited in the following discussion.
Certified and support staffing. In repeated state studies, the presence of full-time
certified librarians has been linked to higher reading scores (e.g., Lance & Schwarz,
2012). In addition, students in schools where the library is staffed with both certified
librarians and support staff were more than twice as likely to score Advanced on the state
writing test as students without that library staffing (Lance & Schwarz, 2012). In the
2008 California impact study, Achterman (2008) reported that the combination of
certified librarians in combination with paraprofessionals was significantly related to the
extent of services provided, and “the strength of the relationship between library services
and test scores increased with grade level” (Kachel, 2013, p. 11). The most effective
combination of staffing appears to be certified librarians who lead in program
management and instruction, allowing support staff to attend to clerical issues such as
book processing and maintenance of the physical spaces (i.e., shelving books).
Interestingly, support staff who maintained a library without supervision by a certified
librarian were found to have no impact on Colorado students’ reading scores (Lance &
Hofschire, 2012).
Collaboration and instruction. It was that same support staff that figured as an
essential feature for schools whose certified librarian was involved in collaborating with
classroom teachers and teaching students both directly. In such situations, student test
scores were markedly higher than those for students whose librarian was required to

39
maintain the day-to-day clerical operations of the library (Farmer, 2006). The Wisconsin
study (Smith, 2006) revealed that school librarians helped students “acquire unique skills
not taught in the classroom and information and technology skills essential for students in
the 21st century” (Kachel, 2013, p. 12).
Scheduling and access. Flexible (as opposed to fixed) scheduling consists of
students and classes receiving support from the library at point-of-need rather than fixed,
pre-determined times. The National School Library Program of the Year award,
administered by the American Association of School Libraries, regards operating on a
flexible schedule as an essential descriptor for an effective library.
In her study of California library impact on student achievement, Farmer (2006)
found that flexible scheduling and program planning proved to be the most important
variable in predicting student reading scores. When libraries are locked into fixed
schedules, particularly as a “special” in rotation with art, computer, music, and other non­
core subjects, the key variables of librarian collaboration and instruction are reduced or
precluded all together to the detriment of student learning (Moreillon, 2014). The
second California study (Achterman, 2008) reported that extended access to library
resources, as measured by the number of hours when students are able to be in the library,
directly correlated to higher test scores for all three levels of schooling: elementary,
middle, and secondary. The difference between 80 hours of library access per week and
60 hours correlated to a 20% increase in Florida student test scores (Baumbach, 2003).
Funding and library collections. The currency and extent of the holdings in a
library (referred to as the collection) correlated directly to the writing and reading
achievement of the school’s students (e.g., Lance, Rodney, & Hamilton-Pennell, 2005).

40
Lance and Schwarz (2012) discovered that students whose library provided better
resources were up to five times more likely to score Advanced on state writing
assessments. The circulation of those resources (the number of times those resources are
checked out by library patrons) was 45% greater for Florida students that scored in the
top third of the state’s achievement tests. However, the quality of the collection is
dependent on the funding and budget available to shape that collection. Many schools in
lower socioeconomic communities have less funding for the library collection and thus
purchase significantly fewer books (Todd, Gordon, & Lu, 2010). This reality has
resulted in the poorest students and communities having the fewest books in their school
library collection. This consistent finding of correlation between funding and student
achievement (Kachel, 2013) supports the 1988 statement by Bainbridge and
SchoolMatch® (Lynch & Weeks, 1988) that the level of expenditures for the library was
the greatest single correlate to quality of education.
Technology infrastructure. The availability of technology and instruction in its
use were reported in multiple state studies (Kachel, 2013) as being highly valued by
school library patrons. “Due to the ubiquitous access to information and the wide variety
of formats available, information literacy—the ability to find, analyze, comprehend, use,
produce, and share information—is ... essential learning” (Moreillon et al., 2011) for
21st century education. Indeed, the Delaware impact study (Todd & Heinstrom, 2006)
revealed that computers and their support in the library were the resource that students
most frequently found helpful in their learning and research. The second California study
(Achterman, 2008) reported that, for middle and high school students, both English

41
language and social studies state test scores rose as access to computers and digital
resources in the library increased.
In-service and professional development. School administrators reported that
librarians “offer physical and virtual portals for faculty in terms of thinking and planning
for the future, integrating critical thinking, teaching ethics, research, and literacy”
(Moreillon et al., 2011). Certified librarians are often experienced teachers who have
been trained to teach teachers (Kuon et al., 2014), and a 2007 study by Lance, Rodney,
and Russell reported that principals who placed a higher value on librarians providing inservice opportunities to classroom teachers tended to oversee better-performing schools.
Effective libraries, then, can be determined by the extent to which the program and the
staffing reflect these functions that impact student achievement and the narrowing of the
achievement gap (Kachel, 2013). The school principal and the district administration
could expect student learning to increase in the same measure to which those
administrators strengthened these strategic library program attributes.
Summary
My purpose with this review of literature has been to situate my study within the
literature for three perspectives: a) at the nexus of libraries and pre-service principal
preparation programs; b) the practice of and standards for principal preparation as it bears
the weight of educational reform; and c) the verification of school libraries as they serve
to increase student achievement and to provide equitable opportunities for deeper
learning. Findings included the repeated call for data-driven libraries to form part of a
more effective and relevant curriculum for tomorrow’s principals (and professors) as they
deal with increasing constraints and expectations. Within that context, the search for

42
expert opinion on the content of strategic library information for principal preparation
and practice aligns well with the needs of today’s K-12 administrators.

43
CHAPTER III
Method
The purpose of this Delphi study was to describe the knowledge, skills, and
dispositions needed by K-12 administrators to direct effective school library programs.
Using a Delphi method design, individuals acknowledged as experts in the area of school
administration and library programs were invited to develop that information through a
collaborative and dynamic process. Accordingly, the discussion in this chapter sets forth
the design of the study, the selection of participants, the instruments used, and the data
collection and analysis experienced. A general overview of the Delphi research design is
included, and the legitimation of the study is also discussed.
Research Design
The understanding sought through this study did not exist in prior literature—a
concise articulation of the knowledge, skills, and dispositions needed by K-12
administrators to direct effective school library programs. Nor did the information
sought lend itself to merely quantitative descriptors, being in essence a description of
human behavior. When a problem “does not lend itself to precise analytical techniques
but can benefit from subjective judgments on a collective basis” (Linstone & Turoff,
2002, p. 4), researchers may initiate a Delphi study to make “the best you can of a less
than perfect fund of information” (Dalkey, 1968, p. 8).
A Delphi study gathers and analyzes data from the judgments of experts based on
their knowledge or experience. Practitioners experienced in the related fields of endeavor
might provide valuable insight and expertise, thus constituting that less than perfect
information source (Dalkey, 1968). Based on the assumption that a group opinion or

44
consensus would be more valid than any single person’s opinion (Keeney et al., 2011, p.
3), the Delphi method is an increasingly recognized and appropriate research method for
bringing consensus (Chou, 2002; Keeney et al., 2011; Shelton, 2010) or developing
criteria (Murry & Hammons, 1995) from experts in the field.
Working under the aegis of the RAND Corporation in the 1950s, researchers
Dalkey and Helmer (Murry & Hammons, 1995) developed an investigative method of
gathering opinions from groups of experts in a way that supported the validity and
reliability of those data. Now called the Delphi method or technique, the research design
involves a carefully selected group of experts replying to a researcher’s series of
questionnaires. The method is structured to avoid group influence on individual
responses by having each panelist remain anonymous to other participants (Delbecq et
al., 1975). After each series or round of questions in a Delphi study, the panel of experts
receives feedback from the researcher expressing the group response and “the range of
opinions” (Ludwig, 1994, p. 55) for the previous round of questions or questionnaire.
Each iteration of questions builds upon the previous round with the goal being “to reduce
the range of responses and arrive at something closer to expert consensus” (RAND, 2014,
para. 1).
Dalkey (1968) described the three key elements of an effective Delphi study to be
anonymity, iteration with controlled feedback, and statistical group response. Keeney et
al. (2011) described the iterative process as beginning with an open-ended question or
statement posed by the researcher to the panel of experts. The panelists respond and
provide their best understanding in response (Keeney et al., 2011). The researcher then
compiles and analyzes the responses and shares back the analyzed and anonymous data

45
with the experts. The second round consists of the panelists’ responding to the compiled
data, often ranking statements drawn from the group responses or modifying their initial
response (Keeney et al., 2001). Rounds proceed until one or more of the following occur:
•

Consensus is reached (Dalkey, 1968);

•

The panel and researcher believe that sufficient information has been gathered
(Delbecq et al., 1975);

•

Stability of responses is demonstrated (Murry & Hammons, 1995).
Over the decades since its conception, the Delphi design has been productively

used by a variety of research disciplines including education (Keeney et al., 2011). As of
March 2014, more than 2,600 graduate education students had utilized the Delphi method
in their research, as identified in a search of the database ProQuest Dissertations and
Theses. Table 4 reflects the chronology and the number of Delphi studies conducted
from 1970 through 2013. These data document the increasing use of the Delphi research
design for the type of educational research questions posed by this study.

In the original classic Delphi study, the process involved paper questionnaires and
written responses (Linstone & Turoff, 2002). Because these questionnaires were
generally sent by postal mail, the process could incur significant time lapses. Participant
engagement and response rate were often victims of those delays, and disappointing
participation levels could be characteristic of the final rounds of questions (Keeney et al.,
2011). With the advent of new technologies in education, including collaborative online
platforms and rapid communication modes, the eDelphi or online Delphi design has
provided an easier and a more effective form for the classic Delphi method (Chou, 2002).
Keeney et al. (2011) clarified that eDelphi study designs follow the classic guidelines for
Delphi research but make use of online and electronic tools for improved administration.
The technology helps to diminish earlier issues with slowness and consequent
disengagement of participants. Accordingly, this study was conducted using electronic
communication such as email and web-based analytical survey technology such as
SurveyMonkey.
Selection of Expert Panel Members
Green et al. (1999) called the selection of experts the linchpin of the Delphi
method and stated that “the expert status of the respondents is often presented as the
guarantee of the validity of the results” (p. 200). Rather than using a random sample that
attempts to be representative of the target population, Keeney et al. (2011) advised
inviting participants selected according to criteria that target the expertise needed to
answer the research questions.
The challenge for a Delphi study is to justify the selection of respondents as
experts (Goldschmidt, 1975; Murry & Hammons, 1995). For the purpose of this study,

47
three criteria guided the selection of panelists. First, the collective participants
represented a combination of knowledge and experience in three educational areas: K-12
administration, K-12 librarianship, and higher education preparation of K-12 educators.
Second, potential participants for this Delphi investigation were recognized as experts by
national acknowledgement of superior performance in their area of practice. Third, the
expert panelists were knowledgeable not only in their field but also across disciplines as
follows: (a) effective K-12 administrators who have demonstrated effectiveness in
managing school libraries; (b) school librarians who have excelled not only in leading a
library program but also in collaborating with campus administrators; and (c) experienced
higher education professors who serve in recognized K-12 preparation programs
providing instruction in leadership through school libraries.
A single national organization was identified as recognizing individuals meeting
the three criteria: the American Library Association (ALA). Based in the United States
but acting globally, the ALA is both the world’s oldest and largest library association
(ALA, 2014a, para. 1). Its mission is “to provide leadership for the development,
promotion, and improvement of library and information services and the profession of
librarianship in order to enhance learning and ensure access to information for all” (ALA,
2014b, para. 1). In particular, one of ALA’s many divisions, the American Association
of School Librarians (AASL), focuses on, serves, and recognizes individuals who
demonstrate excellence within each of the three areas examined in this study:
•

exemplary school administrators supportive of and effective in administering
school library programs recognized through AASL’s annual Distinguished School
Administrator Award;

48
•

exemplary school librarians and school library programs through AASL’s
National School Library Program of the Year Award;

•

higher education professors who excel in programs preparing school library
leaders, as recognized through the Council for the Accreditation of Educator
Preparation in collaboration with AASL.

A pool of potential candidates for the Delphi study was drawn from the list of awarded
professionals as publicized on the ALA web sites for the various recognition programs.
The number of participants recommended for a Delphi study varies. Ziglio
(1996) stated that the “criterion for deciding on a sample size is not and cannot be a
statistical one” (p. 14), and Hsu and Sandford (2007) reported that the appropriate
number of subjects for a Delphi study “never reaches a consensus in the literature” (p. 3).
Regarding the maximal number, Brooks (1979) and Delbecq et al. (1975) argued that
panels consisting of more than 25 to 30 participants did not yield more accurate data. As
seen in Table 5, the number of available participants to be drawn from the ALA lists well
exceeds that maximal number.
The make-up of this study’s panel drew from the numbers of individuals
recognized according to the three criteria stated:
•

The list of Distinguished School Administrator award winners, from its inception
in 1985 until 2014, includes 28 individuals. For issues of currency, administrators
recognized between the years 2000 to 2014 (n =14) for whom contact info could
be determined were invited to participate.

•

The National School Library Program award began in 1963 and during the next
50 years (through 2013), 88 schools or school districts have been recognized. In

49
order to operationalize these programs for individual experts, librarians from
those recognized schools or districts from the years 2000 to 2014 (n = 37) for
whom contact info can be determined were invited to participate.
•

Although many U.S. higher education institutions prepare library leaders for the
K-12 setting, the Council for Accreditation of Educator Preparation collaboration
with AASL currently recognizes 37 such programs. Each of these recognized
institutions were contacted to assist in inviting an appropriate faculty member to
participate in this study.

Instrumentation
Delphi studies are designed to elicit data in the form of responses to carefully
designed questions (Linstone & Turoff, 2002). Those questions are often embedded in
questionnaires distributed to each respondent. Self-administered questionnaires have
become increasingly appropriate and feasible (Dillman, 2007) given the cultural and

50
technological contexts that characterize 21st century research. In this study, data were
gathered through the use of self-administered questionnaires over a series of three rounds.
Design of instrument. The first round of questions in a Delphi typically seeks to
generate a broad range of ideas by posing open-ended questions (Keeney et al., 2011).
Those responses are used to shape the following rounds’ questions (Linstone & Turoff,
2002) in an ever-narrowing distillation of the panel’s opinions. The researcher studies
the responses to the broad questions of the first round, analyzes the data for themes and
constructs, and then provides the compiled responses to the panelists for the following
round (Keeney et al., 2011). During the second round, each panelist is often asked to
consider the compiled responses and rate or prioritize them according to his or her
experienced perspective (Murry & Hammons, 1995).
The instrument used for the first round in this study began the Delphi process by
posing four open-ended questions to the panelists (Appendix A). Those questions
targeted the information sought by this study’s research questions concerning the
knowledge, skills, and dispositions of a K-12 administrator managing a library program.
Additionally, the questions were supported by the review of literature related to K-12
administrators, school librarians, and higher education library leadership preparation
programs. The instrument for the first round was developed according to informed
practice (Dillman, 2007) and aligned with research supporting the design of self­
administered questionnaires (Johnson & Christensen, 2012). Over years of practice and
research, Dillman (2007) came to realize that questionnaires such as those involved in a
Delphi study constitute a social exchange. As such, the most accurate and extensive data
will be collected when the researcher understands the respondents’ need for trust, reward,

51
and reduced cost: “How can we increase rewards for responding? How can perceived
costs be reduced? How can trust be established so that the ultimate rewards will outweigh
the costs of responding?” (Dillman, 2007, p. 14). Conclusions to these questions involve
representing the task as appropriately important, invoking mutual relationships and
interests in the experts’ field, and articulating that costs and rewards may also accrue for
not responding to a survey. The contents of this study’s initiating questionnaire and those
in subsequent rounds will be designed with these characteristics in mind.
Pilot study. Experienced methodologists (e.g., Goldschmidt, 1975; Johnson &
Christensen, 2012) have advised that a pretest or pilot for a questionnaire strengthens and
helps validate the instrument to be used in the formal study. Accordingly, a pilot study
was conducted with the instrument for this Delphi study prior to the actual process. A
targeted population of 15 experts yielded a successful five individuals (in a desired range
from five to 10 participants according to Johnson and Christensen, 2012) who were asked
to read, respond to, and comment on the design of the first-round questions. The
individuals targeted had experience and expertise similar or superior to participants for
the formal study, with each pilot respondent having 5 or more years of experience in his
or her field (i.e., K-12 administrator working with an effective library program or a
school librarian with a strong program and working with a supportive administration) or a
higher education faculty position in K-12 preparation with a demonstrated research
background in school library leadership. Changes to the formal first-round questionnaire
were made from the feedback of experiences and insight gained from the pilot study.

52
Data Collection and Analysis
Once approval for this study was granted by the Sam Houston State University
Institutional Review Board, data generation and collection began with the organization of
the Delphi process: engaging experts, determining willingness and consent of experts to
participate, and initiating the first round of questioning (e.g., Brooks, 1979; Helmer,
1967; Linstone & Turoff, 2002).
An online survey platform (i.e., SurveyMonkey) was used to gather responses for
both the pilot and the formal study. This web-based technology offers tiers of services,
ranging from basic, no-cost survey tools (with limited questions and responses allowed)
to three increasingly-priced subscription levels. Utilized in my study was the second level
(unlimited questions and responses) of service, where subscribers are offered the ability
to customize a survey’s design options (e.g., color, background, layout of introductory
text and actual questions) as well as to build a variety of question types and formats.
In addition, SurveyMonkey provides enhanced security through Secure Sockets
Layer (SSL) technology. The SSL establishes a secure, encrypted link between the
SurveyMonkey server and the participants responding to the questions on the site’s
webpage. The survey-owner subscriber must use a secure log-in protocol to access data
collected from the questionnaires.
For the three rounds of questions in this Delphi study, a link to the appropriate
online survey platform was created and provided to each participant. Knowledge of the
specifics of each panelist’s responses was available only to the participant and the
researcher, utilizing what Keeney et al. (2011) referred to as “quasi-anonymity” (p. 9).
The Delphi methodology seeks to avoid group interaction that might interfere with full

53
and honest panel responses, and quasi-anonymity retains fidelity to the Delphi design
while offering electronic convenience for the process.
In a Delphi study, data are gathered from the responses of the panel of experts in
iterative rounds, and analysis of those data is conducted between the rounds to identify
the opinions and judgments of the experts on the panel (Greatorex & Dexter, 2000). The
text of those responses for this study were analyzed semantically as qualitative data
(Keeney et al., 2011), but Dalkey (1969), originator of the method, asserted that Delphi
procedures also “create a well-defined process that can be described quantitatively” (p.
vi). When quantitative data are represented on scales of interval measurement,
descriptive statistics can be calculated. Predominantly, percentages of frequency of
responses were utilized to determine group opinion of the panel and to measure for
consensus.
Data gathered from this Delphi study were analyzed both qualitatively and
quantitatively. From data gathered in Round 1, when open-response judgments and ideageneration are the focus (e.g., Keeney et al., 2001, 2011), I examined the responses for
semantic themes and quantitative frequencies that guided the development of the Round 2
instrument. To begin Round 2, panelists were presented with summary information from
the Round 1 data in the form of statements provided anonymously by the panelists. This
summation served to share “the range of options” (Ludwig, 1994, p. 55) provided in
Round 1 and to present categories derived from those themes. Respondents considered
and rated those proposed categories for importance in answering the study’s research
questions (e.g., Hsu & Sandford, 2007; Keeney et al., 2011). In Round 3, the panelists
received the frequency data for each Round 2 statement and were then asked to confirm,

54
change, or reject the panel’s collective opinion (e.g., Dalkey & Helmer, 1963; Greatorex
& Dexter, 2000). After both qualitative and quantitative analysis of the final round was
conducted, the data collection portion of this study concluded.
Legitimation
Research must be defensible. Establishing methodological rigor for a Delphi
study, however, is complicated by the design’s arguable placement within either the
quantitative or qualitative paradigm (Keeney et al., 2011). To reflect both perspectives in
a mixed study, Tashakkori and Teddlie (2009) recommended the use of nomenclature
appropriate for a combination of methodologies, and accordingly, Onwuegbuzie and
Johnson’s (2006) term legitimation seems most appropriate for the discussion of this
study’s rigor and credibility.
Within a decade or so after the RAND Corporation developed the Delphi
technique for research, the scientific community was taking note of the approach to group
opinion and was employing it in increasingly disparate ways (Brooks, 1979; Linstone &
Turoff, 2002). This versatility of application led to publication of a critical examination
of the Delphi (Sackman, 1974), which in turn provoked a storm of articles in response
(e.g., Goldschmidt, 1975; Hill & Fowles, 1975; Jillson, 1975). To those responding
articles, today’s Delphi methodologists owe the ability to identify key design points that
can influence the legitimacy of such a study.
Those design points were articulated by Jillson (1975), and those five descriptors
guide the legitimation of this study: (a) standards for determining the applicability of the
technique to the problem identified; (b) criteria for selecting respondents; (c) suggested
questionnaire approach to be utilized, including number of rounds for each type of

55
question, response scales; (d) types of analyses most appropriate; and (e) interpretation of
results. Table 6 reflects the consideration of these key points for this study.

Summary
In this chapter, I discussed the Delphi method in general and specifically how this
study carefully implemented informed practices with the Delphi process. Specifics
included the identification of a pool of potential panelists to serve as experts for this
study, as well as the criteria for selecting that pool and the justification of its
identification as experts. An explanation of the instrumentation, its design, and a
proposed pilot study to test that instrument was provided. The before-hand perspective of
the collection of data and the expected analysis of those data after collection led to the
discussion of considerations for reliability and legitimation of this research. Results from
the implementation of these plans follow in Chapter IV.

CHAPTER IV
Data Analysis and Results
Introduction
The purpose of this study was to describe the knowledge, skills, and dispositions
needed by K-12 administrators to direct effective school library programs. The method
for gathering data for this description involved iterations of survey questions in a design
called the Delphi method (Chou, 2002; Dalkey & Helmer, 1963; Keeney et al., 2011;
Shelton, 2010). Respondents participating in those iterations were selected for their
expertise in relevant fields
Demographics of Expert Panel
Turoff (2006) suggested that a key consideration for selecting experts is not how
many experts, but how many varieties of experts should be included in the panel. For this
study’s purpose, three participant profiles were utilized: experienced individuals skilled
in K-12 school leadership and administration, experienced individuals skilled in K-12
library practice, and individuals experienced in higher education preparation of school
library leaders. As described in Chapter III, AASL serves as a national clearing house for
exemplary individuals in each of these areas through three annual awards: Distinguished
School Administrator Award winners selected for their support of school libraries;
National School Library Program of the Year librarians recognized for their best practices
and program design; and instructors of institutions of higher education accredited by the
Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation in collaboration with AASL to
prepare tomorrow’s effective librarians. This elite recognition by AASL was judged
sufficient justification for these individuals to constitute experts for this study. For issues

58
of currency, experts recognized only since 2000 were considered as potential participants
for this study. Table 7 shows the identification of participating experts by the total
number of candidates available, the number contacted for this study, and the resulting
count of study panelists who agreed to participate.

Literature on the Delphi method suggests initially inviting the participation of all
eligible population members (Brooks, 1979; Green et al., 1999). Accordingly, contact
with all potential experts for whom contact information could be determined was made
by email. This initial contact provided an explanation of the study and invited each
individual to participate. The count of individuals from each expert profile group who
agreed to participate is indicated in the final column of Table 4. Turoff (2006) indicated
that a count of three participants per expert profile group would constitute a sufficient
panel size for effective results. Across all expert profile groups, a total of 23 panelists
participated. All 23 experts completed all rounds of the Delphi study, providing 100%
participation throughout the study.

59
In the final round of this study’s Delphi process, demographic data were collected
on each of the 23 participants. These data are reflected in Table 8.

The three administrative experts included two current public school district
superintendents and a retired school principal. Included among the seven librarian
participants were (a) the library director in one of the largest U.S. cities’ public school
system, (b) three additional district-level directors, and (c) three campus-level librarians.
The position titles reported for the 13 higher education instructors included professor,
assistant and associate professor, visiting instructor, and school library program director.
Years of K-12 experience across the 23 experts averaged 25 years, and those years were
divided equally between the elementary campus level and the secondary campus level
(middle and high school). One participant reported working only at a district-level
position in his K-12 experience. The geographic location of the panelists was widely
dispersed across 14 states. Ethnicity reported by these participants was largely
White/Not of Hispanic origin (n = 22), with one individual self-identifying as Native
American.

60
Pilot Study
Literature on the adaptable Delphi method does not specify the number of
iterative, narrowing rounds of questionnaires to be used in every study. Instead, the
purpose of a Delphi study is to “combine expert opinion into a group consensus” (Keeney
et al., 2011, p. 4) using as many rounds as may be needed to reach a clear convergence of
expert opinion. The first round, regardless of number of subsequent rounds, is pivotal as
it is used to brainstorm possible responses to the study question, and a pilot study is
recommended (Johnson & Christensen, 2012) for shaping the first round. For this
present study, such a pilot study was implemented.
Johnson and Christensen (2012) recommended including five to 10 people to
provide feedback for a pilot study. For this study’s pilot, six of the leading U.S. scholar
practitioners in the field of school libraries and K-12 educational administration agreed to
provide feedback on the design of a first round for the Delphi. Individuals participating
in the pilot study included two professors and researchers in the field of Educational
Leadership who are directly involved in integrating knowledge of school libraries into the
curriculum of principal preparation; two professors of school librarianship (previous
school librarians) who conduct research in the field of school libraries; an academic
(higher education) librarian who has collaborated with educational administration
programs to integrate school library practice in the university’s educational
administration curriculum; and a former campus librarian and past New York city school
library director, now serving as a professor of practice in a major northeastern university.
The initial four questions posed to these six individuals were open-ended and
sought to elicit responses to the three research questions of this study: (a) In a school with

61
an effective library program, what is the role of the principal regarding the library? (b) In
a school with an effective library program, what are the principal’s understandings
regarding the library? (c) In a school with an effective library program, what actions does
the principal take regarding the library? and (d) In a school with an effective library
program, what does the principal value about that program?
Responses from the pilot participants were generous and helpful. In addition to
conceptual content, responses guided the wording of demographic and profile
identification questions. Personal email communications also provided extended
feedback for increasing clarity and strategic wording of the individual questions.
Summary of Procedures
The formal Delphi that followed the pilot study required three rounds to gather
basic concepts, reach consensus on the importance of those concepts, and to confirm the
expert group’s opinions. In early December 2014, approval from Sam Houston State
University’s Institutional Review Board (IRB) was granted for this study (see Appendix
B). Contact with the pool of potential participants began in the following days. Personal
email invitations were sent to all potential administrator participants for whom contact
information could be located. Although the AASL webpage for the Distinguished School
Administrator Award provides the names of recognized individual administrators, it
provides only those administrators’ school district at the time of the award. The email
invitations included the topic of the study, a brief description of the Delphi method, and a
link to the online questionnaire for the first round. Of those administrators contacted,
three responded and agreed to participate. All three administrators participated in all
three rounds of the Delphi.

62
The AASL webpage provides the names of the universities recognized by the
Council for Accreditation of Educator Preparation, and similar personal email invitations
were sent to likely contact persons at each institution. Often, I received a cordial
response from the institution indicating that a particular instructor would be asked to
respond to the questionnaire. From other institutions I received no response. Of the 37
higher education institutions contacted, four either no longer offered a librarian program
or had no knowledgeable faculty member in place that could respond to the survey. In
total, 13 instructors eventually participated, and all CAEP participants completed all three
rounds of questions.
The AASL webpage provides the names of only the school or district of
recognized library programs for the National School Library Program of the Year award
winners. Names and contact information for individuals working in those programs are
not released to the public. However, AASL graciously offered to contact all identified
individuals at the latest known address on my behalf. Wording similar to that sent to the
administrative and higher education candidates was provided to and sent by AASL to the
37 awarded program individuals eligible for this study. Contact was made on two
occasions: an initial email invitation, and a follow-up email prompting their
participation. Of the 37 contacts made, seven librarians (or district library directors)
agreed to participate. All seven of those individuals completed all three of the Delphi
rounds.
Delphi Round 1
Participants who accepted and followed the survey instructions found an initial
online page providing the IRB-approved informed consent notice. Each participant

63
expressed consent to participate by continuing to the second page of the questionnaire.
There panelists were asked two preliminary questions: which profile of expertise they
brought to the survey (whether administrative, library program, or higher education) and
the level (elementary or secondary) at which they had gained most of their K-12
experience. On the following online page, panelists read a brief statement of the purpose
of the study and a clarification of the terms knowledge, skills, and dispositions. Those
terms were operationalized as seen in Table 9.

The online questionnaire articulated that the terms library program and librarian
were used interchangeably in the survey. This conflation of concepts did not present
problems during the data collection: Participants worked comfortably with the blended
concept and, as appropriate, could and did make that distinction in their open responses.
The first round of the Delphi began with these instructions to the participants:
“Consider what you know about principals working with libraries based on your area of
expertise. Then please respond to the following four questions with as many SHORT
PHRASES as occur to you.” Four questions were presented, three of which were keyed

64
to one of the three major terms guiding this study, with the fourth being a broad overview
of the principal’s role: (a) In a school with an effective library program, what is the role
of the principal regarding the library? (b) In a school with an effective library program,
what are the principal’s understandings regarding the library? (c) In a school with an
effective library program, what actions does the principal take regarding the library? and
(d) In a school with an effective library program, what does the principal value about that
program? The open period for the first round began December 18 (immediately upon
receipt of the invitations by the participants) and continued through January 13.
Although 10 days had been proposed for the first round, additional time was provided to
engage all interested experts.
Round 1 data results. The open-ended questions provided experts with an
opportunity to brainstorm and generate ideas and themes relevant to principals and the
school library. The instructions were worded in a way that sought to elicit “a high
quantity of ideas” (Delbecq et al., 1975, p. 34) and to identify all perspectives and
concepts that could be conceived by this group of experts regarding the study topic. Most
expert responses included the word support both as a noun and as a verb, indicating that
panelists saw the principal as an essential support for the work of the library.
To probe deeper, however, I examined the ways in which the experts envisioned
the principal providing that support. Content analysis of the response texts from Round 1
yielded a number of common themes, for which I followed Keeney et al.’s (2011)
suggestion for collapsing those themes into major categories. Ten such categories were
identified and are presented in Table 10.

65
At this stage in the data analysis, the themes were considered holistically without
reference to the study’s conceptual framework domains: knowledge, skills, and
dispositions. Such a correlation of the categories to those domains appears in the
following chapter of this study. The 10 categories and their frequency are reported in
Table 10. Frequency indicates the number of times a panelist spoke to that particular
category as being important to the principal’s knowledge, skills, or dispositions for
facilitating a strong library program.

Interestingly, the top five themes, half of all themes identified, accounted for more than
76% of category responses developed in Round 1 of the Delphi. The most frequently
mentioned category, and interpreted as the most important because of that frequency, was
principal’s leadership (21.1% of all responses). The four themes following in importance
were best practices and library standards (utilizing the research- and evidence-based
attributes of the library for maximal effectiveness) appearing in 17.8% of responses; the
librarian’s complex role (the array of potential helps available from a 21st-century
librarian as opposed to earlier, traditional roles) with 14.8%; provision by the principal to
equip and allocate for effective library practice with 12.1%; and the instructional services
of the librarian, understood as the distinctive role of the certificated librarian to teach
rather than merely support instruction, appearing in 10.6% of total responses.
Delphi Round 2
As each participant completed the Round 1 questionnaire, I responded to each
with an individualized email thanking them for their time. I included in that email the
responses and comments they had given for Round 1, and I invited them to change, edit,
or elaborate on those responses. Participant responses to those emails were encouraging
and indicated significant interest in the study. On January 4, 2015, individual emails

67
were again sent, initiating and giving the link to the online Round 2 survey and inviting
them to participate once again. Responses began to arrive that same day and continued
over the next 2 weeks.
The iterations of surveys in this Delphi study sought to distill and narrow the
experts’ opinions to those resembling a consensus that would answer the research
questions. Thus, questions forming the second round of the Delphi were developed from
the identified common themes and categories expressed in Round 1. Round 2 presented
experts with statements relating to the knowledge, skills, and dispositions or values of a
principal of a strong library program. To articulate the statements, I drew from specific
participant comments, repeating wording and phrasing as directly as possible. I also
drew from combinations of responses that spoke to similar concepts. The resulting
statements were presented to the experts in Round 2, and panelists were asked to respond
with a valuation of importance for each statement: How important do you consider this
statement to be? Hsu and Sandford (2007) described this rating system as appropriate for
a Delphi study’s second round.
Keeney et al. (2011) judged the use of a scale for collecting data to be
appropriate, as “within a Delphi questionnaire ... the technique is more concerned with
agreement” (p. 77). To determine the experts’ rating of importance for statements in
Round 2 ,1 used a 4-item fully-anchored rating scale (Johnson & Christensen, 2012) with
possible responses being 4 = very important, 3 = somewhat important, 2 = not very
important, and 1 = not important at all. Additionally, an optional, open-response question
was added for each of the three domains of statements (knowledge, skills, dispositions) to
allow respondents to elaborate, emphasize, or share some new idea: What, if any,

68
additional information about the knowledge of a strong principal would you like to add?
These open-ended opportunities to respond came at the end of each area or domain of
statements.
In the domain of a principal’s knowledge, I culled and presented 24 statements
based on the experts’ responses in Round 1, along with an additional open-response
question. In the domain of principal’s skills, 23 statements were provided for rating of
importance, as well as a concluding open-response question. The third and final domain,
regarding the dispositions and values of a principal concerning the library, was
represented by 25 statements to be rated for importance, with a concluding open-ended
response question. In all, 77 statements (n = 74) and optional questions (n = 3) across
three domains were posed to the panel for Round 2.
Round 2 data results. To determine agreement among experts for the Delphi
technique, some statistical measure of tendency is sought. Keeney et al. (2011) judged
that the frequency of important responses (very important or somewhat important) for a
statement to some degree “mirrors the determination of quantitative criteria for
determining results” (p. 45). The quantitative level to declare consensus has varied
according to the topic of a particular study. Keeney et al. (2011) reported on Delphi
studies for which the determined consensus level varied from 51%, 75%, 80%, 95%, and
up to 100%.
Round 2 demonstrated a high degree of consistency among most responses to the
statements. Of a total of 74 statements to be rated, nearly all were considered important
by the panel of experts. A consensus rate of 100% importance (very important or
somewhat important) was received by 69 statements out of the 74. The remaining five

69
statements, all in the domain of the knowledge of a principal, received ratings of
important by 96% of the experts (three statements), 91% (one statement), and 78% (one
statement).
The research questions for this study sought characteristics that are essential to
the principal who seeks to facilitate a strong library program. With the data produced
through this study, two criteria that would aim for essential determined consensus: A
statement had to receive an overall rating of importance (very important or somewhat
important) by all respondents, and at least 75% of those respondents had to rate the
statement as very important. Two areas of comment from participants supported this cut­
off point. First, several panelists commented that they had difficulties deciding which
statements could be marked as less than very important. One participant commented that
“I wanted to put VERY important for all of them. Hard to distinguish the different
values.” Another expert discussed the importance of a particular concept emphatically in
Round 1 yet responded to a Round 2 statement about that concept with only a somewhat
important rating. These representative examples of expert thinking indicated that experts
could consider a statement as comparatively important and yet not necessarily rate it as 4,
very important. All 74 rated statements and the percentage of importance rating received
by each are provided in Appendix C by domain.
Knowledge domain. The experts were presented with 24 statements regarding a
principal’s knowledge to facilitate a strong library. Of those statements, nine exhibited
consensus as specified: all respondents indicating the statement was important (very or
somewhat), as well as receiving ratings of very important by at least 75% of respondents.
Table 11 illustrates those statements and the level of agreement received by each at both

70
the very important and somewhat important levels. All statements and ratings in the

Delphi Round 3
One of the distinctive characteristics of a Delphi study is the feedback to be
provided to the panelists after each round. Despite the high degree of agreement found in
Round 2, some responses were unexpected after the open discussions submitted in Round
1. Accordingly, in Round 3, participants were provided feedback on the group’s ratings
of the importance of Round 2 statements. Additionally, I requested clarification of and
exploration into some items from the prior round, seeking to confirm expressed opinions
and to tease out the reasoning behind the online questionnaire responses.
In the domain of a principal’s knowledge, two earlier statements were re­
presented for clarification and a new statement culled from the open responses in Round
2 was presented for rating. In addition, an inference was suggested based on a
combination of two knowledge statements, in order to explore the thinking of the experts
from Round 2. Experts were asked to rate their agreement with the inference as being 1Strongly disagree, 2-Disagree, 3-Agree, or 4-Strongly agree.
Similar clarifications and inferences were offered in the domains of a principal’s
skills and dispositions. New statements resulting from Round 2’s open-response
opportunities were shared for rating as well, as they appeared cogent to the topic.
Round 3 data results. In contrast to the 77 questions and statements of Round 2,
Round 3 data collection was short and quickly completed by respondents. The
clarifications of previous ratings, ratings of newly presented statements, and the

75
responding to inferences from Round 2 statements appeared in the three domains of
exploration.
Knowledge domain. Two Round 2 statements (#7 and #13) regarding the
principal’s knowledge of national library standards and familiarity with library goals and
values were rated as important by all experts in Round 2 but with only 43% of experts
responding with very important. When asked to confirm their rating, experts responded
with even lower ratings (only 28% responded with very important). An inference was
drawn and presented to experts: “The principal doesn't have to know specifics of
librarianship to facilitate an effective library program.” Panelists indicated their
agreement: 78% agreed or strongly agreed with the statement, and two higher education
instructors strongly disagreed, pointing out that the principal’s evaluation of the library
program depended on the principal’s knowledge of such standards and goals. The new
statement presented for importance rating, “6. The value the school librarian can bring to
the students' learning is essential knowledge for the principal,” received 100% ratings of
importance: 87% very important, and 13% somewhat important. This statement was
added to the Round 2 list of knowledge statements reaching consensus. Regarding the
new statement, one administrator commented that “the onus is both on the librarian and
the principal to work together, so that the principal knows what an academic multiplier
library services can be.”
Skill domain. Based on relatively low importance rating in Round 2 and several
compelling open responses, an inference was presented in Round 3. The original
statement (#42) dealt with the principal’s skill of working with the librarian to create
library goals and objectives (only 54% rated the statement very important in Round 2),

76
and the inference offered in Round 3 stated “Library goals and objectives are important
but may more appropriately be the responsibility of the strong librarian.” Agreement and
disagreement with the inference were widespread, and several participants objected to the
absence of collaboration in the wording of the inference. That inference statement was
not considered further.
Additionally, two new statements were presented in Round 3 based on open
responses from Round 2, and although both statements garnered 100% importance rating,
neither statement met this study’s level of consensus for at least 75% of respondents
rating very important. Those statements and their ratings were: (a) The strong principal
is himself/herself a collaborative leader, welcoming and acting on information given by
the strong librarian (65% very important; 35% somewhat important); and (b) The strong
principal works to synchronize all of the various campus resources, which include the
library program, in order to maximize student achievement (74% very important', 26%
somewhat important).
Dispositions domain. One statement was offered for clarification after being rated
as the least important of the dispositions statements in Round 2 (all experts considered it
important, but only 56% of experts rated it as very important): “The principal values the
librarian serving as point person on legal and ethical use of information, Internet, and
technologies.” When offered reasons for the lower importance from which to select,
panelists indicated varying opinions:
•

All panelists (100%) recognized the librarian’s expertise in this area;

•

39% of the panelists indicated they still strongly believed the original statement to
be very important.

77
•

35% indicated they thought the principal would have different (district) resources
for such questions.

Several experts speaking from the librarian’s perspective commented on the two aspects
of ethics and legalities: Although the librarian should take the lead in teaching these
digital literacies, this panel of experts did not judge it appropriate for the librarian to act
as the enforcer for school or district policies.
New data collected in Round 3 indicated continuing group consensus on the
importance of statements produced in Round 1. However, only one item of new data
from Round 3 reached the rigorous consensus level that would signify an essential
descriptor: “The value the school librarian can bring to the students' learning is essential
knowledge for the principal.” This statement was added to the knowledge domain of
consensus statements.
Summary of Research Findings by Question
Three research questions were posed for this study:
1. What do experts consider to be essential knowledge needed by K-12
administrators to facilitate an effective library program?
2. What do experts consider to be the essential skills needed by K-12
administrators to facilitate an effective library program?
3. What do experts consider to be the essential dispositions needed by K-12
administrators to facilitate an effective library program?
To answer these questions, I utilized a Delphi study that consisted of three rounds. The
expert panel consisted of 23 experts working collaboratively to distill essential
characteristics of the K-12 principal who facilitates a strong school library. The data

78
collection process ranged over 3 months: December 2014 through February 2015. The
nature of the data collected included free, open-response text gathered through personal
emails and an online survey tool, as well as the rating response data of those experts for
statements drawn from the panel’s collective work on open-ended questions that began
the Delphi study.
Through the weeks of collaborative brainstorming and consideration, experts
developed the 44 descriptive statements. The statements are organized by research
question domain (knowledge, skills, and dispositions). The involvement of the panelists
was extensive and thoughtful. Participation rates throughout the three rounds remained
high at 100%. At each stage of the process, panelists were invited to correspond directly
with me, and personal communications helped develop concepts, as well as to shape and
sharpen subsequent rounds of the Delphi process. Of the 44 statements developed,
experts rated five as being of highest importance (i.e., a unanimous rating by all
respondents) to the description of a principal. The remaining 39 statements were
considered very important by at least 75% of those respondents.
Research Question 1 targeted the essential knowledge or understanding of the
principal. In response, 10 consensus statements were identified in the domain of
knowledge of a principal facilitating a strong library program. These statements, shown
with the original survey question number and in order of greatest consensus, were as
follows:
•

6. The principal understands that credentialed librarians are certified teachers who
integrate with the curriculum to support instruction.

79
•

3. The principal understands the changing role of libraries during a time of
widespread educational change.

•

15. The principal envisions the library as the hub of the school, setting a
welcoming and accepting environment.

•

18. The principal understands the importance of continuous and adequate funding
to maintain an effective collection of print and digital resources.

•

20. The principal understands the need to schedule time for the librarian to
collaborate, plan, and teach.

•

Round 3 addition: 6. The value the school librarian can bring to the students'
learning is essential knowledge for the principal.

•

8. The principal knows what a good librarian does.

•

23. The principal understands the importance of equitable and open access to
library resources.

•

4. The principal holds an accurate understanding of the librarian’s complex role.

•

11. The principal understands what constitutes 21st century skills and how the
librarian mediates that learning.
To answer Research Question 2 regarding the essential skills of a principal, 13

consensus statements were identified in that domain. These statements, shown with the
original survey question number and with greatest consensus shown first, were as
follows:
•

33. The principal hires and retains the best certified librarian available.

•

30. The principal clearly communicates to teachers the value of the library
program to student learning

80
•

34. The principal includes the librarian in the campus' professional development
activities, in order to keep the librarian informed and current.

•

40. The principal trusts in the knowledge, skill, and professionalism of an
effective librarian.

•

44. The principal ensures proper technology infrastructure for the library.

•

45. The principal holds the librarian accountable for a strong, integrated program.

• 48. The principal supports reading across the curriculum.
• 50. The principal recognizes that "adequate" is not enough and expects

and

supports a strong library program that increases student learning and engagement.
•

31. The principal seeks out the definition of a strong school library program,
learns about it, expects it on her/his campus, and asks for change or celebrates its
strength.

•

43. The principal leads in establishing a culture centered on reading and the
pursuit of knowledge.

•

28. The principal allocates appropriate funds for the library from the building
budget.

• 35. The principal initiates and expects teacher-librarian collaboration.
• 39. The principal schedules grade-level or content-area collaborative time that
includes the librarian.
The third and final research question for this study concerned the dispositions
essential to a principal. That domain of dispositions or values regarding the strong
library program presented the area of greatest consensus for this study’s experts.
Twenty-one consensus statements were identified in the domain of skills for a principal

81
facilitating a strong library program, and these statements, with greatest consensus
presented first, were as follows:
•

60. The principal values the strong library's impact on student achievement.

•

57. The principal values the librarian's expertise as a teacher.

•

76. The principal values the library being an integral part of instruction.

•

56. The principal values the library providing equitable and open access to its
resources.

•

58. The principal values the librarian's expertise as a collaborator.

•

59. The principal values the librarian's expertise as a leader.

•

63. The principal values instruction for digital and information literacies.

instruction.
•

71. The principal values the library as the hub for media resources and
technology.

• 73. The principal values the library's high-quality collection of resources.
• 75. The principal values affective support for students (beyond quantitative
measures and statistics).
In this chapter, I have reported on the design of the Delphi study and how the data
collected were categorized to yield information answering the study’s research questions.
In the following chapter, I will present overarching findings, as well as conclusions
supported by the data, in ways that place those conclusions within the conceptual
framework of the study. In addition, I recommend areas of further research as well as
implications for professional preparation, professional development, and practice.

83
CHAPTER V
Discussion, Implications, and Recommendations
The data analysis from this research culminated in 44 essential statements
descriptive of a principal’s knowledge, skills, and dispositions to facilitate a strong school
library program. As the Delphi method seeks to create valid opinion (Keeney et al.,
2011), so these 44 statements suggest an updated perspective on K-12 administration,
school librarianship, and postsecondary preparation programs for both groups. Themes
embedded in the panelists’ work confirm positions reported in the literature of principal
preparation and librarianship, and such findings may initiate new considerations for
improving the effectiveness of and understanding between administration and librarians.
Discussion
This research was posited in a conceptual framework of the national standards for
principals and K-12 administrators (CCSSO, 2008, 2014). Both the purposes and
intentions of the Standards are illustrated by the content and the themes identified by the
expert panel in this study. Learners and leaders in K-12 schools represent the priorities of
the Standards. The discussion will be organized by the learner, the leader, and the
librarian within the context of the conceptual framework and previous literature.
The learner: Increasing achievement. In its permutations since 1996, the ISLLC
Standards have steadily shifted to prioritize leadership that deals with a school’s
instruction. In its latest draft, this focus is worded as “leadership for learning” (CCSSO,
2014, p. 6). In the draft 2014 versions, each individual standard begins with the phrasing
“An educational leader promotes the success and well-being of every student by”

84
(CCSSO, 2014, p. 16). The clear intent and focus of the Standards is to influence
leadership to “improve student achievement and engagement” (CCSSO, 2014, p. 6).
The work of experts in my study echoed that priority. That the strong library
impacts student achievement was the essential, overarching statement determined by this
study’s expert panelists: The principal values the strong library's impact on student
achievement. Of the diverse participants in this Delphi research (i.e., administrators,
librarians, and higher education professors), all experts unanimously agreed on this
valuing of the school library.
The literature reviewed for this study, as well as the experts from this study,
pointed to student learning as the chief goal for the school library. Gaver’s (1962) early
apologetic for school libraries echoed Bainbridge’s SchoolMatch® correlation between
well-funded libraries and student achievement (Lynch & Weeks, 1988). The library
impact studies (e.g., Kachel, 2013) consistently supported student growth. Sample
statements from this study reflecting the primacy of student achievement are as follows:
•

The principal values the strong library's impact on student achievement.

•

The principal clearly communicates to teachers the value of the library
program to student learning.

•

The principal recognizes that "adequate" is not enough and expects and
supports a strong library program that increases student learning and
engagement.

The concepts of student achievement and engagement resulted as essential knowledge for
the K-12 principal, in the view of this panel of experts.

85
The leader: Preparing for effectiveness. The 2014 draft of the revised Standards
articulated the increasing pressure for and emphasis on high levels of achievement for K12 learners, and effective leaders are crucial to this achievement. As reported in Chapter
II of this study, principals drive improvement of student learning (Branch et al., 2013;
Leithwood et al., 2004). Thus, the Standards and the literature of the field speak with
increasing urgency to the quality of administrator preparation programs and to the state
organizations that guide, prescribe, and evaluate those programs.
The exigency of adequate principal preparation appeared frequently in the
statements produced by this study’s experts. Yet studies have reported that principal
preparation content (e.g., Wilson & Blake, 1993) and program evaluation (e.g., Wilson &
MacNeil, 1999) fall short of providing and ensuring the knowledge about libraries that is
needed by in-service principals. In answer to the first research question in this study
regarding the essential knowledge needed by K-12 administrators to facilitate an effective
library program, Delphi panelists produced 10 statements in the domain of the knowledge
needed by a principal. Of those 10 statements, nine indicated essential knowledge that
should inform the curricula for principal preparation programs. For example, the
statement that “the principal understands the changing role of libraries during a time of
widespread educational change” would constitute essential learning needed by a pre­
service administrator.
Research Question 2 asked about essential skills for a principal to facilitate a
strong library program. Only a small percentage of principal preparation content
addresses skills a principal needs for school improvement (Hess & Kelly, 2007), yet this
expert panel produced 13 statements in the domain of skills, seven of which indicated

86
equipping that should result from a principal preparation program. As an example, one
skill statement found essential by experts in this study was “the principal hires and retains
the best certified librarian available.” If not trained to understand the qualities that
constitute best, the principal new to the job would have no basis to distinguish good from
best library candidates.
The third research question for this study dealt with the dispositions or values
essential for the principal that facilitates a strong program: 21 such statements were
derived through the Delphi process, and 13 of those indicated preparation for real-life
practice that should come from a quality educational leadership program. The problem
for this study, ineffective use of the school library, was represented by one statement that
illustrated content lacking from most principal preparation teaching: “The principal
values the library being an integral part of instruction.”
Multiple studies (e.g., Farmer, 2006; Smith, 2006) have empirically supported the
benefits to student learning in schools where the credentialed librarian is positioned to
collaborate with teachers and to be integrated in the instructional activity of the school.
School leaders who have not developed an appreciation for this potential support from
the library would be unable to value and thus facilitate the library to provide this service.
One participant shared that “in my experience the principal has very little understanding
[regarding librarian’s instructional role] unless they were a school librarian in the past or
if they have had experience working with a strong librarian.” As expressed by another
participant, the principal should understand that the potential for a library program lies far
beyond collecting and reading books.

87
The concept of a K-12 leader equipped to effect increased student achievement
appears front and center in the Standards. The collaborative opinion of this study’s
experts echoes the primacy of that goal, and those experts’ opinion statements hold
implications for principal preparation and in-service development.
The library: A strategic solution. The Standards in all iterations deal with
abstracts of leadership as justified by research and best practice. For specifics, the
Standards state that the knowledge, skills, and dispositions of the effective leader are “to
be further articulated in order to ensure the Standards are meaningful and useful”
(CCSSO, 2014, p. 7). This study serves that purpose as it articulates findings that target
student learning through effective leadership of the school library program.
Equity. The library presents a well-grounded and strategic means through which
an equipped and knowledgeable principal may leverage her resources to increase student
learning. Perhaps most important in today’s cultural focus on diversity, the library
inherently offers equity and openness for the principal’s community of learners. Two
essential expert statements reflect on that equity: (a) The principal understands the
importance of equitable and open access to library resources; and (b) The principal values
the library providing equitable and open access to its resources. Experts in this Delphi
study recognized the research finding (Lance & Schwarz, 2012) that the most vulnerable
students are often those lacking the educational and social capital needed for learning,
and the library, facilitated knowledgeably, can offset that inequity and work to bridge the
achievement gap.
Technology. In addition to poverty and social inequity, technology represents an
overwhelming force for change that confronts educators. The school library serves to

88
leverage and instruct in the changes in technologies, Internet participatory platforms, and
personal devices and apps (Dickinson, 2013). Experts in the Delphi study pointed to this
attribute of a strong library program with the following four statements:
•

The principal values the library as the hub for media resources and
technology.

•

The principal values [library] instruction for digital and information literacies.

•

The principal values the library's integration of technology to strategically
support the curriculum (not just gadgets).

•

The principal ensures proper technology infrastructure for the library.

The principal who overlooks the potential technology leadership and support offered
through her school library neglects a well-substantiated resource.
Staffing. Research questions for this study were purposefully delimited to
consider the school library program as a whole rather than specifics about individuals
working within the program. Yet the study’s experts included in their work variables of
appropriate staffing when they considered the attributes of the library that a school
principal should know, work with, and value.
Out of all statements created through this study, five were found to be of highest
importance by unanimous opinion of the expert panel. One statement bridged the chief
need of the learner and the principal: The principal values the strong library's impact on
student achievement. Each of the remaining four statements involved or spoke directly to
the role of the credentialed librarian:
•

The principal values the strong library's impact on student achievement:
Throughout the corpus of library impact studies, the presence of a full-time,

89
credentialed librarian correlated directly to increased student test scores and,
when examined, to the narrowing of the achievement gap. Researchers (e.g.
Lance & Schwartz, 2012) have remarked on the lack of library impact when the
program is missing a full-time credentialed librarian.
•

The principal values the librarian's expertise as a teacher. In all but four U.S.
states and the District of Columbia, an individual is required to have teacher
certification (or to have demonstrated 2 years of successful teaching experience in
an accredited school) in order to be credentialed as a school librarian. This
experience is foundational to the meta teaching skills (Groom, 2008) and
collaboration that principals of strong library programs should expect and
schedule. A corollary statement resulting from this study expressed that the
principal should provide “support for library staffing (adequate number of
qualified librarians to serve the population, [including] adequate clerical staffing
to allow the librarian to spend time in instruction).”

• The principal values the library being an integral part o f instruction. Although
the traditional image of the school librarian is that of a keeper of books,
expectations for the primacy of instruction have been articulated since U.S. school
libraries began to appear in the mid-20th century (Gaver, 1962). The current
environment of increased accountability and national standards has rendered this
role of the librarian essential for impact on student achievement (c.f. Kachel,
2013). One administrator in this study’s panel shared about a time when, as
superintendent of a school district, he observed a lack of vibrant instruction and
services by his librarians. He commented that he was so “disappointed in their

90
quality that I eliminated them through future budgets [in order] to start over.” In
this case, credentials did not ensure an effective library staff.
•

The principal hires and retains the best certified librarian available. This
statement appeared mundane and quotidian, yet it garnered unanimous support as
being of highest importance for a principal’s competency to facilitate a strong
library. If the principal is unaware of the attributes of a strong librarian or fails to
position a strong certified librarian in the library, that program’s potential is in
jeopardy (c.f. Kachel, 2013). The nuances of best were articulated in openresponse discussions and included most active professionally and the really smart,
curriculum-centered, pro-active librarian, not the lady-that-reads-books. One
expert participant shared that a previous Colorado district held a description of the
school librarian that lacked only the phrase “walks on water,” as the expectations
for what the librarian could and would perform were so rigorous.

Implications and Recommendations for Practice
The standards prioritize “centrality of student learning” (CCSSO, 2008, p. 8) for
school leaders. A strong library program can help today’s K-12 school administrator who
works with that priority in mind by offering these supports: research-based improvement
for student learning and test scores (e.g., Kachel, 2013; Roberson et al., 2003); equity to
narrow the achievement gap (e.g., Francis et al., 2010; Lance & Schwarz, 2012); and
proficient leadership in the library staff for the technological and digital brave new world
(e.g., Todd & Heinstrom, 2006). Sometimes principals get lucky and find a strong library
program in place on their campus. Realistically, however, only solid pre-service
preparation or strategic professional development will equip a principal to position the

91
school library for greatest effectiveness. Based on the findings of this research, I suggest
three pathways to leverage administrator learning for facilitating the library: pre-service
preparation, in-service professional development, and leveraging the librarian.
Pre-service preparation. The ISLLC leadership standards point the way to
ensuring that all K-12 students graduate college and career ready. The research
grounding those Standards allows for implementation of the data demonstrating the
library’s impact on student achievement (Roberson et al., 2003). Higher education
programs are called to strategically integrate the content of the library impact studies in
preparation curricula in order to prepare each principal candidate for the reality of
facilitating a strong library program. As stated by Roberson et al. (2003), “though
educational administration preparation programs may differ, the information needed by
pre-service principals concerning school libraries is essentially the same and can be
applied in the course work where appropriate” (p. 112).
Essential descriptor statements produced in this study suggest specific content for
principal preparation. A learning activity as simple as information literacy workshops
could be crafted out of content already in the preparation syllabus. These workshops
would work to equip principal candidates for their own research needs, and at the same
time, demonstrate inquiry-process needs for the K-12 students they will serve.
Additional readings of strategically-selected passages from library impact research could
easily enrich preparation content. These readings would provide both methodological
training for principal candidates as well as content information about how libraries build
student achievement.

92
Engaging guest speakers could be included in course activities. Topics could
include cogent issues such as the qualities of a strong library program and how to
interview potential librarians. Discussions could center on ways to evaluate the campus
library program and the library staff. Future leaders need information about the realities
of appropriate library budgeting to meet state and national standards.
Implications appear as well for state organizations that assess principal
preparation programs. Discussion and research have called for performance-based
assessment for administrators (Briggs et al., 2013), so including facilitation of a strong
library would be a strong measure to ensure principals are prepared for 21st century
learning. Flowing from state assessment, accrediting agencies could include specifics of
information and digital literacy functions to their evaluation metrics.
In-service professional development. A wide body of reading and training exists
to assist the principal who is aware there is more to learn about libraries. Both open web
(e.g., Google) searches for “teacher librarian” and paid database searches for “strong
library program” will return many results, from academic journals, professional writings,
and current news stories, which will begin a thread of learning about what makes a strong
library for the principal who seeks one. Universities such as Mansfield University of
Pennsylvania and Rutgers’ School of Communication and Information, as well as
individuals such as Gary Hartzell, Keith Curry Lance, and Ross J. Todd offer extensive
reading, learning, and training opportunities for principals who want to learn more. State
education agencies often have librarian consultants who respond to requests for personal
conversations and directed reading. One participant in this study shared that he had
asked school library vendors such as Follett to speak to him and his district about

93
effective librarianship and sound collection development. In light of the extensive
information and research available on the potential of the school library for increasing
student achievement, ignorance about libraries by school administrators is a choice that
may affect student achievement and equity.
Leveraging the librarian. Repeatedly, researchers have shared experiences
through which a strong librarian educates and builds school administrators to be savvy
about effective library services (e.g., Kaplan, 2006). This study’s experts alluded to that
phenomenon when they rated as important the statement that “the principal trusts in the
knowledge, skill, and professionalism of an effective librarian.” One participant shared
from her own research the necessity of the principal and the librarian matching in their
vision for the strong library. That shared vision empowers both the principal and the
library program. One study cited a librarian valuing an effective relationship with the
principal: “When you find someone who understands the library, you follow them. You
stick with them whenever you can” (Gregg, 2007, p. 85). One participant in my study
encouraged principals and librarians who enjoyed such an effective relationship to
“nurture that opportunity to make the most of it for the students, teachers, the leadership,
and for yourself.” With the right librarian, the principal leverages all the best practices
and standards that she may not know herself.
Statements produced by the participants in this study lead to recommendations for
principals regarding both the hiring and the supporting of a strong librarian. Interview
questions should ask for the candidate’s (a) views of the place of the library in
instruction, (b) professional activities and service in which the candidate is currently
involved, and (c) opinions on engaging teachers for collaboration and engaging students

94
in literacy activities. Recommendations for librarians point to the areas highlighted in
this study’s statements, specific areas in which the librarian and the principal can
mutually explore, develop, and dream for future student achievement. The statements
also provide a potential matrix for evaluating the library program and building it for
increased effectiveness. Librarians should consider how the statements inform their work
in the library: How can the program be strengthened and improved? In either position,
principal or librarian, an effective working relationship should be valued for the potential
to improve instruction and learning. Such synergy should be nurtured.
Limitations of This Study
As clarified in Chapter I of this study, the Delphi method yields expert opinion
rather than correct answers or quantitative proof of a hypothesis. The 44 statements
produced through this collaborative work represent what recognized experts in the field
of K-12 administration and library practice believed to be the essential knowledge, skills,
and dispositions of the principal of a strong library program. It is possible that other
Delphi studies, using justified experts answering the same questions, could produce
similar answers but in differing degrees of importance.
The study participants in the pilot of this Delphi were warranted experts in this
field of study and practice. Their personal experiences in practice and in research
enriched the conduct of this study. For example, one participant recognized that
educational research that disregards the grade span of students, such as elementary or
secondary, can be misleading when generalized across levels inappropriately. I followed
his recommendation for this study and found that grade span experience was equally
balanced across the panelists. Thus, although not relevant for these panelists, grade span

95
considerations are recommended for future studies regarding use of the school library.
Such studies might reveal aspects hidden in less-nuanced data.
Both fields of professional practice represented in this study, administration and
librarianship, are deeply entrenched in their relevant research, responsibilities, and
priorities. Although this study attempts to find overarching goals and to arrive at
mutually beneficial paths to those goals, the division between the fields will remain. Yet,
as one administrator expert commented, “library values and beliefs should be the same as
the principal’s, definitely not something separate. The principal is ultimately responsible
for student achievement in her/his building. The beliefs of the leader should flow into
and throughout the library.” Future research that more closely conjoins the mutual
aspirations and activities of principals and librarians would continue to build common
understandings.
Recommendations for Future Research
The effective use of the school library is a complex issue with numerous
variables. This study sought to examine the issue from the perspective of the equipping
of the principal within the framework of the national school leader Standards. Issues of
credentialing of educators, issues of generalizability of findings across grade spans, and
issues of student perceptions of service for achievement all offer ideas for future study
into the use of school libraries.
It is a truism that credentials of a professional educator do not ensure an effective
practitioner, and a more in-depth study of a principal who effectively positions the school
library to raise student achievement or of a librarian administering a strong program
could inform both understanding and practice. Many administrators develop an

96
appreciation for and work with research-based library services across schools of differing
achievement and demographics. What variables impede or improve their success?
Equally, a more nuanced examination of individual librarians, those who administer an
effective program as described by research, could yield insight into the motivations,
perception of rewards, and means of perseverance in a role that is often isolated and
frustrating. Both depth of data and generalizable findings are needed for cogency.
Research that compares differences in library impact across grade spans could
yield strategic findings in how principals can best position their library for student
learning. In my own experience, the practice of librarianship has varied greatly between
the elementary and the secondary grade spans, and I suspect the effects of what the
programs provided varied as well. Data that compare and contrast administrator use of
library services and the impacts thereof could provide unexpected information to guide
both preparation programs and school practice.
The learner is the heart of both school leadership and school librarianship. One
very helpful line of investigation would be the personal perceptions of a variety of
student profiles (e.g., low-achieving, typical, and high-achieving and across socio­
economic and social capital lines). What aspects of the library program does a particular
student value or avoid? Do the academic and demographic profiles of a student have
consistent implications for the types and levels of library helps? Ultimately, what can the
principal facilitate and the librarian provide that will more consistently secure student
learning? Surely the eye of the beholder, or in this case, the nuanced concept of a
student, would yield pertinent and important implications for the use of the school
library.

97
Conclusion
The findings of this study reflect the importance of effective leadership to student
improvement, thus aligning with the goals of the ISLLC Standards. The opinions of the
expert panelists also reflected the essential role the library program can play in raising
student achievement. The path to appropriately embedding the best of both professions
in the work of the other is perhaps further illuminated by this study.
Rather than opposing realities, however, the informed principal and the equipped
librarian are highlighted in these findings as coming together for the mutual aim of
students learning—and learning to learn. How can more be accomplished? Just as the
principal's potential to improve the achievement of all her students is increased by the
support of a strong library program, so the potential of that library can only be made
possible by the informed and equipped administrator.
These concepts have each been previously reported through the research base for
both administrator preparation and librarianship. What may be new from this study is
two-fold: (a) specific details of the knowledge, skills, and dispositions that describe the
strong principal of an effective school library program, and (b) the compelling agreement
across the professions about the importance of those details. The essential statements
produced by this study might serve as practical targets for the developing principal, and
they might guide her integration of the library into the culture of her school. Librarians,
and those who prepare tomorrow’s librarians, may use the descriptive statements from
this study to shape how they prepare to support student learning. Ultimately the winner
in any synthesis of leadership and libraries may be the students, encouraged and

98
supported in their growth to independence as ethical thinkers and responsible citizens.
That vision presents one to which all educators can commit.
