EXPLORING RACIAL DIVERSITY IN
CALDECOTT MEDAL-WINNING AND HONOR BOOKS
by
Angela Moffett
The Caldecott Medal, awarded annually by the American Library Association to
the illustrator of the “most distinguished American picture book,” is the oldest and most
prestigious award for children’s picture books in the United States. While the award
winners have occasionally depicted racially diverse characters, it was not known to what
extent the chosen winning titles have kept pace with changing racial demographics in the
country. Diversity in children’s literature, and the lack thereof, has become a critical
issue for our time. The social implications of failing to provide an exemplary collection
of picture books and other literature representative of all of the United States’ citizens can
be seen in our continuous struggle to reduce the impacts of racism. Research into how
the Caldecott Medal awards have or have not kept pace with the racial composition of our
country will help guide an informed discussion going forward and provide critical data to
drive our conversations.

Introduction
In 1937, Frederic G. Melcher suggested establishing the Randolph Caldecott
Medal, named for an influential nineteenth century illustrator, for best illustrated
children’s book annually (American Library Association, n.d.). He had previously
launched the American Library Association’s annual Newbery award for “most
distinguished American children’s books,” and felt that an award honoring the best
illustration was timely as illustrators’ contributions to children’s literature were just as
critical as those contributions encompassed by the Newbery award. Accordingly, the
Caldecott Medal was begun in 1938 and has been awarded annually since then. A
winning medal (gold) is awarded each year to one illustrator and honor (silver) books are
named as well, though there is no minimum or maximum number of honorees.
Recipients of the prestigious award are all but guaranteed immortality in children’s book
publishing as they are very likely to remain in print in perpetuity (Smith, 2013).
Presently, there are 332 books—79 medal winners and 253 honor titles—encompassing
the entirety of the collection which are set forth in Appendix A.
The process of granting the award has been fine-tuned over the years to become
what it is today. A revolving 15-person committee is selected annually and is composed
of members of the sponsoring association (Association for Library Service to Children, a
branch of the American Library Association), who work diligently throughout the year to
identify the best illustrated children’s books of the year. Their year-long work culminates
in a days-long meeting at the American Library Association’s annual midwinter meeting
where they gather to hash out the details and make their final selections (Killeen, 2012).

1

Selection criteria require that the work “be awarded to the artist of the most distinguished
American Picture Book for Children published in the United States during the preceding
year,” and that the award go to the artist, who must be a U.S. resident or citizen
(American Library Association, n.d.). Controversy often follows the award
announcement as not everyone agrees with the year’s choices for a variety of reasons.
Yet even those who are not satisfied with the year’s selections recognize there are strict
selection guidelines in place and a professional committee overseeing the process to
ensure the best outcome.
Significantly, additional awards specifically for racially diverse children’s
literature have been created over the years to ensure acknowledgement of exceptional
work by diverse authors and illustrators. The Coretta Scott King Award for African
American illustrator and author was first awarded in 1970 by the American Library
Association (American Library Association, Coretta Scott King, 2016). The Pura Belpré
Award for Latino/Latina writer and illustrator was first awarded in 1996 by the
Association of Library Service to Children and REFORMA, the National Association to
Promote Library and Information Services to Latinos and the Spanish-Speaking
(American Library Association, Pura Belpré, n.d.). The Asian Pacific American Library
Association and the American Indian Library Association, both affiliates of the American
Library Association, issued their first awards in 2003 and 2006, respectively (Asian
Pacific American Librarians Association Literature Awards, n.d.; American Indian
Library Association, n.d.). These awards were most likely developed in response to lack
of diversity in mainstream “white” literature. The Coretta Scott King Award in particular

2

was established to “encourage and acknowledge African American authors and
illustrators, in the same way the Newbery Award had been created nearly fifty years
earlier, to help create a body of distinguished children’s literature” (Horning, 2010, p.
13).
Due to the secrecy with which award committees conduct their decision-making
and the fact that members pledge to never discuss their committee’s process, we will
never know whether the development of these diverse awards proactively enabled
Caldecott committee members to maintain the status quo honoring primarily “white”
literature and trust these awards to be the catchall for diverse literature. Further, due to
the fact that these awards are specifically for authors and illustrators of the same racial
identity about whom the literature is written, these “diversity” awards may exclude some
exemplary literature about these populations, when written or illustrated by cultural
outsiders. A potential obstacle for placement of these books themselves is that librarians
may exclude winners in certain categories if they don’t feel the population of their
community would be interested in books that do not reflect their own demographics.
“The implication that only blacks can write well about blacks sets up the implication that
only they can read well about them, too” (Aronson, 2001, p. 273). Although librarians
frequently rely on the evaluations and reviews of books from trusted sources, Aronson
finds it concerning that books in some award categories may be chosen just because the
librarian perceives it meets the demographic of their community rather than taking the
time to become familiar with their content. He also posits that by requiring an author or
illustrator to be the same race as the character about whom the book is written, these

3

award committees are setting up the expectation that a good book can’t be written by
someone about a person of another race. Author/illustrator Virginia Hamilton and
children’s literature educator Rudine Sims Bishop, both African American women who
took exception to Aronson’s position on criteria for winning awards for diverse literature,
responded to Aronson’s article via letters to the editor of Horn Book Magazine. Bishop
argued that with regard to the awards specifically for diverse literature, it “makes sense
that those best able to illuminate those experiences would be those who have been closest
to it.” At the time of this discussion, only the Coretta Scott King and Pura Belpré awards
had been established and she stated that both awards were “about recognizing that
cultural distinctiveness and celebrating literary and artistic excellence created by people
who have ‘talked the talk and walked the walk’” (Bishop, 2001). Hamilton likewise
opined in opposition to his declarations and offered instead that there “is a difference in
the way a member of Parallel Culture community writes about the community through
her own experience from the way one outside of that community might write about it.”
Indeed, according to Hamilton, “Race and culture and social consciousness give Parallel
Culture artists and writers unique insights” (Hamilton, 2001).
Problem Statement
In 2015, the Caldecott medal was awarded to Dan Santat, an Asian American
author and illustrator, and three of the six honor books were by authors from
underrepresented backgrounds (Barthelmess, 2015). While 2015’s Caldecott winners
were the most diverse yet, the announcement arrived on the heels of some insensitive and
racist incidents in the children’s literature community. In April 2014, as preparation for

4

the inaugural BookCon was underway, Publisher’s Weekly announced that “Blockbuster
Reads: Meet the Kids’ Authors That Dazzle” would assemble Jeff Kinney, James
Patterson, Rick Riordan, and Lemony Snicket on the same stage for the first time (Kirch,
2014). At this May 31 event, the authors would discuss the inspiration behind their
novels and characters, shed light on their creative processes, and offer a peek at what fans
could expect next. The event was described as an “unprecedented, power-packed panel”
of the “world’s biggest children’s authors.” However, a “number of industry observers
expressed their displeasure on Twitter about the lack of diversity” on this panel and, in
quick response, the non-profit We Need Diverse Books was established almost overnight
(“We need diverse books,” n.d.).
Not long after, in November 2014, African American female Jacqueline Woodson
received the National Book Award for Young People’s Literature for her book Brown
Girl Dreaming. The man presenting the award—white author Daniel Handler (a.k.a.
Lemony Snicket and one of the members of the aforementioned BookCon panel)—
announced as he presented the award to Ms. Woodson, “Jackie’s allergic to watermelon.
Just let that sink in your mind.” The backlash was so quick and immense that Handler
apologized via Twitter within 36 hours, made a $10,000 donation to We Need Diverse
Books and matched another $100,000 in donations. Gracious in the aftermath,
Woodson’s response in the New York Times explained her mission “to write stories that
have been historically absent in this country’s body of literature, to create mirrors for the
people who so rarely see themselves inside contemporary fiction, and windows for those
who think we are no more than the stereotypes they’re so afraid of” (Woodson, 2014).

5

The Cooperative Children’s Book Center of the University of WisconsinMadison’s School of Education (CCBC) has provided annual statistics on the diversity of
published children’s books since 1994 and statistics for African American representation
since 1985. Their statistics for year 2014 (the most recent year for which there are
population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau), indicate that of an estimated 5,000
children’s books printed, the CCBC received 3,400 for review. Of those 3,400 reviewed,
292 (or 9%) were written by people of color and 396 (or 12%) were about people of color
(Cooperative Children’s Book Center, 2016, March 25). The U.S. Census Bureau’s
estimate in 2014 was that 37.9% of the United States population identified their race as
something other than “non-Hispanic White” (United States Census Bureau, 2016, March
22). It is quickly apparent that even with a large margin in the statistics to account for
nonfiction books about subjects other than people or fiction books whose protagonists are
animals, racially diverse populations are nowhere near equally represented as characters
in children’s literature, let alone as authors. Further, these statistics do not account for
the fact that 23.1% of the population is under 18 (United States Census Bureau, 2016),
and in the case of these primary consumers of children’s literature, racial diversity is
greater than the national average and growing rapidly (Klein, 2015).
It is commonly held that literature shapes thought, and thought shapes society. As
Quinn claims, “studies of cultural artifacts provide information about what a culture
holds as valued as well as insight into how the participants of a culture make meaning”
(Quinn, 2006). What do our artifacts reveal about us? With such significance, it is no

6

wonder that social scientists will occasionally pursue an understanding of how children’s
literature is mirroring society, or how society is mirroring children’s literature.
Although the dialog continues among children’s literature professionals, and it is
frequently acknowledged that there is a lack of adequate multicultural literature, the
selections of the award committees have made no consistent progress to address it. As
the literature reviewed below will demonstrate, given the unprecedented diversity of the
2015 Caldecott recipients and the momentum of the #WeNeedDiverseBooks campaign,
an examination of racial diversity as depicted in Caldecott Medal and honor books,
compared to changing racial demographics in the United States, is an area overdue for
scrutiny.
Literature Review
As the oldest and longest-running award for children’s picture books in the United
States, the Caldecott canon is frequently utilized for research examining the culture of
children’s picture books, including within the broader context of concurrent social issues.
Detailed studies have included examinations of the depiction of fatherhood, civil rights,
gender, and environmental conservation (Crisp & Hiller, 2011; Sasser, 2014; SillsBriegel & Camp, 2001; Williams, Podeschi, Palmer, Schwadel, & Meyler, 2012). Still
others have used the Caldecott collection as just a small piece in a much larger puzzle of
examining racism in the United States (Pescosolido, Grauerholz & Milkie, 1997;
Williams, & Deyoe, 2014). Most researchers of the topics above have indicated that they
selected Caldecott books because they were a controllable, easily identified subset that
were not only likely to be in print but which, due to the predictability of their continuous

7

publication, would be books to which generations of children would be exposed as
libraries continued to reintroduce them (Crisp & Hiller, 2011, 198; Quinn, 2006, 74;
Williams et al., 2012).
Researchers felt examination of picture books, a media with which children
regularly interact, would be meaningful because of its “widespread availability in the
United States, its use as an instructional tool, and its enduring ‘shelf-life’” (Quinn, 2006,
74). Selection of Caldecott winners as the examined body of literature was often cited as
a particularly useful choice because of the stipulation that they be illustrated by a U.S.
citizen and published by an American publisher (Crisp & Hiller, 2011; Quinn, 2006;
Williams et al., 2012). Conversely, it was also acknowledged that these criteria did not
necessarily hold that the books were popular with children, but in order to create a
predictable subset for exploration, each reviewing team had to make a decision and
choose a body of work (Quinn, 2006). Other researchers used the collection, along with
yet other subsets of children’s literature, to look at how the culture of children’s books
reflected social conflicts for African Americans in particular (Pescosolido et al., 1997).
As part of the process of reviewing how fatherhood was portrayed over the years,
for instance, researchers scrutinized Caldecott winners and honorees covering the years
1938–2002. They gathered data on how both mothers and fathers were depicted for
purposes of comparing the different roles and to see how the changing face of the nation
was represented in picture books. Due to their selection as Caldecott titles, the books
were fairly easy to access for scrutiny. Each team had to create a list of codes to note
search criteria as it appeared in the pictures and/or text, requiring several reads. The

8

researchers of each social issue used different controls with some having a single
reviewer, others comprising the team of authors, and still others composed of larger
review groups (Quinn, 2006).
As a vehicle for exploring how Civil Rights-Era African Americans felt about the
representation of Blacks in picture books, M. Tyler Sasser looked at the response to the
publication of Ezra Jack Keats’ 1963 Caldecott-winning The Snowy Day among Black
thought leaders of the time. As Keats was a white male, these leaders were divided in
their response to his success. The old guard within the Civil Rights movement, including
people such as Langston Hughes, Charlemae Hill Rollins, and others, were delighted to
have African American children appearing in mainstream (i.e., “white”) picture books.
Yet the new face of the Black Power Movement, including Malcolm X and others, did
not want a white man legitimizing the experience of African American youth by telling
the stories that rightfully belonged to them. Significantly, this appears to be the
beginning of a discussion that continues today: who is entitled to give a voice to African
American or other people of color (Sasser, 2014)? At that time, “librarians, authors,
illustrators and scholars of African American children’s literature split . . . into two
camps: those who define the genre solely by authorship (i.e., only African Americans can
write African American literature), and those who define the genre by the content of the
book” (Sasser, 2014, 372).
In the case of the team researching depictions of fatherhood, of particular interest
was “the intersection of cultural and possible symbolic phenomena with historical events
and patterns” (Quinn, 2006). They were following in the footsteps of others who had

9

researched the culture of fatherhood vis-à-vis comics, magazine articles, and television
commercials which they felt were possible sources of role identity and would thus
influence picture book illustration. Interestingly, it was believed that “the children’s
book field…developed alongside, if not together with, the organized Left” and “helped to
make children’s literature a key outlet for leftists in the mid-twentieth century” (Sasser,
2014, 362).
The team who studied gender in Caldecott winning books (1938–2011) collected
data on how gender is represented in each of the books as well as the gender of the author
and illustrator. To keep their research consistent with similar researchers, they only
looked at the medal winners, of which there were 74. The research team actively
negotiated their coding determinations throughout the process so the coding of gender
was dynamic to the end (Crisp & Hiller, 2011).
The researchers investigating how African Americans were portrayed in picture
books during times of significant black-white societal conflict discovered that when
dominant norms were being challenged, “Blacks virtually disappear from U.S. picture
books.” This team took on the monumental task of examining Caldecott winners, Little
Golden Books, a sampling of books from the Children’s Catalog, the Horn Book
advertising and editorial content, and event summaries listed in the New York Times
Index for the decades spanning the 1930s through the 1990s (Pescosolido et al., 1997).
The researcher examining leadership in children’s literature focused on all medal
winners and “selected” honorees. Because they used a specific leadership model (i.e.,
Kouzes and Posner), its usefulness was somewhat limited to those whose interests

10

extended to their management techniques. However, it is interesting to note that their
findings revealed that many leadership concepts are accessible in children’s literature and
could serve as models in lesson planning for children’s learning environments (Boulais,
2002).
There was also much “chicken or egg” contemplation among researchers as to
whether society was mirrored in picture books or if picture books set the pace for society
(Quinn, 2006). However, researchers of gender depiction noticed marked spikes in
female winners during the 1960s “famous for the Civil Rights and women’s liberation
movements” and a tapering off through the seventies, only to conclude the most recent
decade with the highest male to female ratio yet and Quinn and others found that
fatherhood depictions fluctuated concurrent with other media (Crisp & Hiller, 2011;
Quinn, 2006).
Also of additional concern to researchers was the role picture books might play in
the nation’s changing response to environmental concerns. They noted at the outset that
two contributing factors might be playing a role in Americans’ waning concern for the
environment amidst increasing environmental problems (Williams et al., 2012).
Specifically, they wanted to examine if the diminishing concern could be due to a lack of
natural environments in picture books or if it could be due to increased isolation from
nature as more youth live in urbanized areas and turn to electronic resources as their
primary interaction. Their findings support the isolation theory (Williams et al., 2012).
In addition to the research regarding the Caldecott medal’s place in our social
milieu, several articles examined the winners’ experiences following receipt of the

11

prestigious award (Glass, 2013; Smith, 2013; Verbeten, 2013). Former Caldecott
selection committee members shared some aspect of their experience, their research, or
their perception of the winners’ experiences post-award. All of these articles originated
in Children and Libraries, the publication of the Association for Library Services to
Children, the Caldecott-awarding body, in the Spring 2013 issue. There is definitely
opportunity for further research in this regard as most of these are pieces celebrating the
authors and much could be done to explore their writing experience.
Finally, of potential general interest with regard to the Caldecott Medal is the
research surrounding the significance of the selected literature. According to Pauline
Davey Zeece in And the Winner Is: Children’s Literature Awards and Accolades, “There
are currently over several hundred awards recognized in the field of children’s literature
in the United States,” and they come with a myriad of different requirements (Zeece,
1999, 233-234). That a number of researchers chose to focus on Caldecott winners is no
surprise given the finite nature of the Caldecott and the varying criteria for most of the
other awards. As a potential research project, one could choose to examine best sellers or
other award winners for greater depth, variety or focus, depending on the nature of one’s
research. The research of Ujiie and Krashen revealed that “very few award winners”
were on the fiction bestseller list but that that did not keep librarians from stocking both
the award winners and the bestsellers (Ujiie & Krashen, 2006). However, the award
winners will stay in a library’s collection long after popularity of contemporary
bestsellers fades.

12

Interestingly, the American Library Association has added special awards for
diverse audiences over the years, including the Pura Belpré Award, established in 1996,
and awarded “annually to a Latino/Latina writer and illustrator whose work best portrays,
affirms, and celebrates the Latino cultural experience in an outstanding work of literature
for children and youth.” Additionally, the Coretta Scott King Book Awards are given
annually to outstanding African American authors and illustrators of books for children
and young adults which demonstrate an appreciation of African American culture and
universal human values (American Library Association, Welcome to the Pura Belpré,
n.d.; American Library Association, About the Coretta Scott King, 2016.). While these
awards do not yet have the same level of popular exposure and market impact as a
Caldecott Medal, they are prestigious in their own right.
It is widely believed that a culture’s values will be held in its artifacts, of which
picture books are a part (Quinn, 2006) and that “picture books often play an important
role in socialization” (Williams et al., 2012). In fact, a “primary means of transmitting
cultural values from one generation to the next is through the telling of stories and, in the
United States, this commonly comes in the form of picture books” and that children’s
picture books “legitimize and validate experiences, providing spaces that allow readers to
locate images of themselves and the people they love” (Crisp & Hiller, 2011, 197, 210).
Conspicuously absent from this body of literature is a focused examination of the
appearance of racial diversity within the text and illustrations of the Caldecott genre as
well as the diversity of authors and illustrators themselves. Closing this gap in
knowledge with a close examination of racial diversity within the Caldecott collection is

13

critical to more fully understanding these culturally and socially significant materials and
to help guide the conversation about diverse inclusion moving forward.
Analysis of the content of diversity in children’s books has been undertaken by
many researchers in the past. Recently and significantly, Melanie D. Koss, an associate
professor in the Department of Literacy and Elementary Education at Northern Illinois
University, undertook analysis of a collection of picture books from 2012. She and her
team examined a subset of 455 books published that year applying an analytical lens
which examined each book’s content for ethnicity, gender and disability. Author and
illustrator gender and ethnicity were likewise recorded. Their study concluded that
children “who interact with current picturebooks predominantly see White faces and
receive the message that [therefore] according to scholars of CRT, to be White is to be
better” (Koss, 2015, 37). Applying a similar lens to examination of the Caldecott
collection, along with an examination of our changing racial demographics, will reveal at
what pace our changing population has been paralleled in the winners of this significant
award.
Methods
Objectives for this research included analysis of (a) how racial diversity has been
depicted in Caldecott winning and honor books, both in the text and illustrations; (b) the
racial diversity of the books’ illustrators and authors themselves; and (c) comparison of
both to the changing racial diversity in the United States. A preliminary review revealed
that these factors have not kept pace with each other. A lack of diverse representation in
picture books upholds a fear of the “other” that is perpetuated in our racist society.

14

Bringing a greater focus on the disparity between publication choices and award selection
will hopefully highlight the importance of continued efforts to ensure that books
representative of our diversity are selected for publication and awards. Along with those
efforts should come increased awareness that the books our youth need are books that
honor the diversity in their lives.
The method of analysis for this study centered on a detailed quantitative review of
each of the 332 winning and honor books from 1938–2016 as primary sources. The
complete list of all Caldecott award winning (medal and honor) books, is available on the
American Library Association’s website and incorporated herein as Appendix A. Access
to these books was fairly unimpeded, with the majority of the items collected in the Arne
Nixon Center for the Study of Children’s Literature at the Henry Madden Library,
California State University, Fresno, and the remainder in public library rare book
collections in the San Francisco Bay Area where the researcher lives.
As was the case with other research focusing on Caldecott books as described in
the literature review essay above, an initial read of each book was necessary to establish
final variables for coding. Research started with examination and recording of the
following data:


Title



Year of award



Gold or silver award recipient



Genre



If books are about inanimate, animal or human characters

15



If human characters, record appearances of people for race, gender,
and role (primary, secondary, or background)



Any languages represented other than English



Location



Culture depicted



Author race and gender



Illustrator race and gender; and



Citation.

Roles of characters were calculated as follows:


Primary character was specified when the images depicted are of the
character the book is about or from whose voice the story is told;



Secondary character was used when the image is a character
interacting with a primary character or if the story was not about them
but they were significant enough to be called out in the text;



Background character was used when the image is of a character
represented on the page not interacting with the primary character.

This data was gathered during an initial review. Some anomalies were accepted
in such instances where a place (e.g., Harlem) or thing (e.g., In the Small, Small Pond)
serves as the primary character.
A second, detailed review of the Caldecott books featuring people from diverse
cultures examined the quality of how people were depicted. This portion was conducted
either in concert with an additional person and/or with someone spot-checking accuracy

16

in assessment. To settle potential interpretive conflicts, yet another researcher reviewed
“indistinct” representations, such as where racial identity was designated as
“Indeterminate.”
Review of illustrator and author biographies of Caldecott winners and honorees
helped to reveal their ethnicities. This was accomplished through internet research,
publisher descriptions and, for contemporary titles, reviews of the book jacket
biographies and author or publisher websites.
Readily available on the internet, United States census data served as the data
with which to compare book diversity to racial demographics. Similar to the previous
studies of Caldecott winners and honorees examined in the literature, the comparisons
were broken down with the reporting of decennial census data (i.e., 1938-39; 1940-49;
1950-59; and so forth). Demonstrable arcs in changes in diversity are evident in visual
graphics extrapolated from the comparison to the two data sets.
Collection and synthesis of the aforementioned data allows research into how our
diverse and changing racial demographic have been reflected in these award-winning
children’s picture books. While data was collected about the role(s) played by white
characters in the winning and honor Caldecott titles, they were not scrutinized further for
purposes of this study inasmuch as there is no lack of white representation and the
purpose of this research was to focus on representation of diverse populations.
In addition to the quantitative analysis, the researcher undertook qualitative
analysis of all books which featured a person who fell into one of the predetermined
categories of Africans/African-Americans, American Indians/First Nations, Asian

17

Pacific/Asian Pacific Americans or Latinos. This closer examination of the quality of
representation took note of how these races or cultures have been represented.
The predetermined categories are based on the categories in use by the CCBC,
which receives most of the books published annually for youth in the United States for
collection and examination. In 1985, the CCBC started recording which of the books
they received were written and/or illustrated by or were about African Americans. Then
in 1994, the CCBC also started tracking the same data with respect to Asian
Pacific/Asian Pacific Americans, First Nation/American Indians and Latinos. Finally,
beginning in 2002, the CCBC began sharing the data they collected each year (CCBC,
2015). Because the CCBC has been a pioneer in the collection of data regarding diversity
in children’s literature and because their research continues to shape much of the
conversation regarding said diversity, this was the criteria and language used in this study
as well.
Results
An initial review of the Caldecott canon revealed that diversity as represented in
the United States’ children’s literature has not kept pace with the diversity of the United
States’ children and, in particular, the award-winning literature that is destined to stay in
the hands of future generations of children. Knowing the data behind this important
foundation for our youth may help demonstrate the necessity for more diversity in
children’s literature as the disparity in representation is revealed. It is possible that the
fact that we, as a society, are not providing enough windows and mirrors to our youth is
one of the reasons that racism continues to be so prevalent and why the “other” continues

18

to be stigmatized in American culture. Through the medium of picture books, we have
the opportunity to increase awareness of other cultures and identities and, with this
awareness, acceptance and familiarity with differences. Stories of the everyday such as
More More More Said the Baby and All the World depict people of multiple races
interacting and living out their lives in ways likely to be familiar to most children,
offering mirrors with either their own or a different colored face. These are opportunities
to see what they have in common with other people. Last Stop on Market Street gives the
reader an opportunity to see themselves if they live in a similar urban environment but
also a chance to see through a window into another’s life and how those surroundings and
experiences may differ from the reader’s.
Another interesting discovery among the data is that although a number of books
included multiple races, there were fewer books that told a story solely about or from the
perspective of one race only. It was discovered out of the 332 books, 7% featured only
Africans/African Americans (22), 3% featured only American Indians (10), 4% featured
only Asians/Asian Americans (13), 2% included only Latinos (6), 1% featured only
indeterminate characters (4), 14% included only inanimate or animal characters (47) and
52% included only white characters (173).
African and African American Representation
Black people have been visually represented in the winning and honor Caldecott
titles a total of 19%, or in 62 of the 332 books. They have been featured exclusively in
these 62 books 22 times, or in 7% of the total Caldecott titles. These representations
include African American, African, Caribbean and Jamaican people. As primary

19

characters, they have appeared in 29, two of which were medal winners (see Figures 1
and 2). Among the Caldecott books featuring Africans or African Americans, 22 have
been illustrated by African American artists and 15 have been written by African
American authors. Additionally, several books have been illustrated or written by an
African American that did not feature Black people. Some of those titles are included
under “Indeterminate,” and the others are Freight Train and Truck, both illustrated and
written by Donald Crew; The Story of Jumping Mouse illustrated and written by John
Steptoe; and The Ugly Duckling, Noah’s Ark and The Lion & the Mouse, all by Jerry
Pinkney.
The first appearance of an African American primary character in a winning title
was The Snowy Day in 1963. This was followed by The Smoky Night in 1995. The first
appearance of an African American author and illustrator came the same year, in 1972,
when Tom and Muriel Feelings won an honor award with Moja Means One: A Swahili
Counting Book. The first African American illustrator of a medal winner was Leo Dillon
in 1976 with Why Mosquitoes Buzz in People’s Ears and the first African American to
author a winning title was Jerry Pinkney whose The Lion and the Mouse, a wordless
book, won in 2010.

Figure 2. Representations of African American, African, Caribbean and Jamaican people
in Caldecott winning and honor books, 1992–2016. Data compiled from author’s
research.

Andy and the Lion was a 1939 honor book written and illustrated by James
Daugherty. This story about an imaginary friendship between a young white boy and a
lion includes a single image of an African American man who is shown running through
a crowd at the circus. The man has dark skin and exaggerated features common to the
stereotypical images of African Americans at the time (Daugherty, 1938).
Abraham Lincoln, the 1940 medal winner written and illustrated by Ingri and
Edgar Parin d’Aulaire, was the second Caldecott title featuring African Americans. In
this biography, the first time we encounter images of African Americans is a two-page

22

spread about a slave market. On the left page, interspersed among the text are three small
illustrations: one of an African American with a load of fruit on his head larger than
himself accompanied by the text “running about with loads on their heads;” one of a
crying mammy figure surrounded by young Black children with the text “Negro mothers
were weeping for they never knew if they would see their little black babies again when
they were sold;” and the third of a small African American woman in a white dress with a
white scarf on her head shaking hands with Abe Lincoln. On the right page, is a black
and white illustration of a raised platform with a white auctioneer, a barefoot African
American woman and four African American children. All of the enslaved people are
shown with nondescript features, very black skin and bulging white eyes. The text on the
platform reads “Slaves, Horses and Other Cattle Sold.” White men in the foreground are
shown raising their hands while more African Americans stand behind the platform with
the cattle (see Figure 3). The next image of African Americans is a street scene with
Abraham Lincoln, who is holding the hand of a white boy, as dozens of African
Americans follow, gather and bow around him (see Figure 3, left-hand image).
In December of 2015, a new edition of this book was released with several
revisions to the text and illustrations. Most notably with regard to African American
content, the scene of the auction block has been revised to lighten the Black peoples’
skin, give them recognizable features and realistic eyes; most are wearing scarves or hats
in lieu of the knotted hair in the original illustration (see Figure 3, right-hand image.)
Again, in the revised street scene illustration, the African Americans’ skin is lighter and
their faces more discernible (see Figure 4). As a result of the changes, the faces of some

23

of the enslaved people are distorted and unusual in the updated images, which is not
necessarily an improvement, so any effort to create a benefit may be moot. Be that as it
may, the original version is still readily available in local libraries. Text from the original
version when Lincoln responds to an enslaved person who throws himself at Lincoln’s
feet and cries, “Here is our savior” has been revised to read, “Don’t kneel to me. You
must kneel to God only and thank Him for your freedom.” It previously stated that
Lincoln had responded with “Glory, glory hallelujah” (d’Aulaire, I.P. and E.P. 1939,
2015).

They Were Strong and Good, written and illustrated by Robert Lawson, won the
gold medal in 1941. The first appearance of a Black person in this book is a young
Caribbean boy shown carrying two monkeys and balancing sticks on his head. The
second is of a woman chasing two American Indians from a house with a broom. She is
wearing mammy style clothing often used to portray African American women at the

26

time. No mention of her is made in the text. The third image is of an African American
boy in worn clothing watching as a preacher goes by on his horse. Again, he is not
mentioned in the text. The fourth time we see an African American person, he is shown
out hunting with the author’s grandfather who “had two dogs and a colored boy.” His
name, Dick, is mentioned in the text contrasted against the dogs’ names: Sextus Hostilius
and Numa Pompilius. The next time we see an African American is accompanying the
narrative that the grandfather is going off to fight the Yankees. In this image we see the
African American boy and the mammy figure previously depicted with their faces buried
in their hands. Accompanying such text, the implication is that they are weeping because
they are so sad their master is leaving. The final image of an African American is of a
young man riding through town on a horse. The accompanying text, “the country all
about was filled with deserters and runaway slaves,” would suggest that he is one of the
escapees (Lawson, 1940). Revisions to some of the text in this book were made in 1994
at which time the text accompanying the image of the hunters was changed to "When my
father was very young he had a Negro slave and two dogs. The dogs were named Sextus
Hostilius and Numa Pompilius. The Negro boy was just my father’s age and his name
was Dick. He and my father and the two hound dogs used to hunt all day long" (Sieruta,
2009).
In An American ABC, the 1942 honor book written and illustrated by Maud and
Miska Petersham, the single image of an African American in is in the illustration for “G
is for George Washington.” In this picture, young George Washington is shown on a
horse while a young African American boy with exaggerated facial features watches from

27

a fence surrounded by Washington’s hat, jacket, and horse tack. Perhaps he is intended to
be Washington’s slave or stable hand (Petersham, 1941).
A book with a biblical focus, Small Rain: Verses from the Bible, illustrated by
Elizabeth Orton Jones and written by Jessie Orton Jones won an honor award in 1944.
The illustrations feature an African American boy in five of the images as well as the
cover (albeit the cover is the back of his head and the cover image is repeated from one of
the internal images). Accompanying assorted verses from the Bible, he is featured
playing with the other children, wearing similar clothing and with similar features (Jones,
1943). African American librarian Charlemae Rollins stated that the illustrations would
“help portray children of all kinds doing things happily together” (Rollins, 1950) and this
title appears later in an article with recommended books about Black children. The
author called it “truly delightful” and appreciated there were images of “children of all
major biological and religious groups doing together all of the things children do” (Boyd,
1958).
In Prayer for a Child, the 1945 medal winner illustrated by Elizabeth Orton Jones
and written by Rachel Field several Black faces are shown in the crowd illustrating the
other children “far and near” from the primary character’s prayer (Field, 1944).
Charlemae Rollins felt that “any little Negro child will be proud to identify himself with
the appealing children drawn by Elizabeth Orton Jones” (Rollins, 1950).
The 1946 gold medal winner, The Rooster Crows: A Book of American Rhymes
and Jingles, written and illustrated by Maud and Miska Petersham was the third of the
Caldecott titles to ultimately be revised due to its negative portrayal of African

28

Americans (Peterhsam, 1945). The original publication included two pages featuring
African American boys with “great buniony feet, coal black skin, and bulging eyes (in the
distance, a dilapidated cabin with a black, gun-toting, barefoot adult)” (Larrick, 1965).
This book of rhymes became the “focus of controversy when the NAACP contended that
the book portrayed Blacks in an unfavorable light.” In response, the publisher revised the
text in 1963 removing the Black content altogether, rearranging the rhymes featuring
white people, and resulting in removing all African American representation from a book
proclaiming to be a book of American rhymes (Pescosolido, et al., 1997).
Sing in Praise, a 1947 honor book illustrated by Marjorie Torrey and written by
Opal Wheeler, features a page of multi-racial faces among which one African American
boy is included. In the image, he is shown leaning against and gazing at Jesus while
Jesus’ arm rests on his shoulder (Wheeler, 1946).
Henry Fisherman, a 1950 honor book written and illustrated by Marcia Brown, is
the first to feature a Black primary character. This is the story of a young boy on a
Caribbean island who longs to be a fisherman like his father and other men in his family.
Brown tells the story of the boy’s relaxed days on the isle and his family’s activities and
his ultimate success with fishing. Interestingly, the book jacket text states the tale is of an
American boy but nothing in the narrative indicates this is the case. An author’s note
indicates she was inspired to tell this story after spending summers on the St. Thomas
(Brown, 1949).
Dick Whittington and his Cat, a 1951 honor book also written and illustrated by
Marcia Brown is the story of young Dick whose cat is offered to a Moorish king to rid the

29

palace of mice. The king, queen, and other Africans are depicted gratefully enjoying the
cat’s presence as he helps to remove the pesky rodents. The king gratefully sends
treasure back to Dick as payment for the cat (Brown, 1950).
Another 1951 honor book, If I Ran the Zoo, written and illustrated by Theodor
Seuss Geisel, is the story of a young Gerald McGrew who re-imagines the zoo as it
would appear if he were in charge. As he travels around the world gathering unusual
creatures, the reader sees Africans portrayed as caricatures of “Bushmen,” or San people
(Seuss, 1950). These images remain the same in today’s editions.
Fly High, Fly Low, a 1958 honor book written and illustrated by Don Freeman, is
the story of a pigeon’s misplaced nest and includes an African American man who keeps
it intact en route to its new location. The man is depicted carrying out his workaday
activities while caring and concerned about the pigeon’s home (Freeman, 1957).
A Snowy Day, which won a gold medal in 1963, was the first book to feature an
African American as the primary character. A young African American boy, Peter, steps
out of his house and into freshly fallen snow and the reader follows him as he explores
and plays in his neighborhood. Ezra Jack Keats, a white Jewish man, was raised in inner
city New York during the Depression and attributes most of his illustrations to this
experience (Keats, 1962). Of his decision to illustrate an African American child he said,
“My book would have him there simply because he should have been there all along”
(Nahson, 2011). A great deal of controversy has revolved around this seemingly simple
book. Besides the Caldecott committee, some contemporary reviewers praised its content.
Among them was African American librarian Augusta Baker who said “The author-artist

30

has made a beautiful picture book about the fun which a small boy has in the deep soft
snow” (Baker, 1963). Langston Hughes found the book “‘perfectly charming’ and
lamented that he did not have ‘grandchildren to give it to’” (Nahson, 2011). Others
disapproved because the book failed to mention that Peter is Black (Larrick, 1965) and
one critic was “skeptical of what he believed was Keats’s attempt to humanize and
normalize a black child by depicting him as racially neutral, enjoying ‘snow and
whiteness as well as everyone else’” (Nahson, 2011). Retrospectively, in 2014, M. Tyler
Sassner looked back on The Snowy Day and its reception in the Civil Rights Era with a
review of the Keats Archive at the de Grummond Children’s Literature Collection. He
found there much support from Harlem Renaissance leaders such as Langston Hughes,
Ellen Tarry, Grace Nail Johnson and Charlemae Hill Rollins and resistance from Black
Power Movement leaders who felt “whites can only give a white interpretation of blacks”
(Sassner, 2014). A look at the perspective of authors and illustrators today find many –
from Sherman Alexie (Nahson, 2011) to Katheryn Russell-Brown (Lyons, 2015), Sean
Qualls (Tate, 2008), Zetta Elliott (Tate, 2009) and Bryan Collier (Tate, 2012) – who
found great inspiration in Ezra Jack Keats’s work.
A 1969 honor book, Why the Sun and Moon Live in the Sky, was illustrated by
Blair Lent and written by Elphinstone Dayrell. This African folktale of how the sun and
moon came to live in the sky is told through illustrations featuring Africans dressed as the
moon, sun, water, and assorted animals. Source notes indicate this story was heard from
the Efik-Ibibio people in Southwestern Nigeria but that the artist was influenced by “all
Africa” (Dayrell, 1968).

31

Goggles, a 1970 honor book written and illustrated by Ezra Jack Keats, was his
second Caldecott title. This is another story starring the African American boy we met in
A Snowy Day. This time Peter and a friend find some motorcycle goggles they’re very
excited to play with but before they get to enjoy them, they’re bullied by the big boys in
the neighborhood, ultimately getting away safely with their treasure (Keats, 1969).
A Story A Story was the 1971 medal winner written and illustrated by Gail E.
Haley. Inspired by time in the Caribbean, here she retells an African story about Ananse
and how he manages to get the world’s stories from the sky god, and make it possible for
humans to tell stories. Haley studied African folklore to prepare to tell this tale and used
woodcut illustrations throughout (Haley, 1970).
Moja Means One: Swahili Counting Book was a 1972 honor book and the first of
two illustrated by Tom Feelings and written by Muriel Feelings, an African American
couple. With this award, came the first male African American illustrator and first
female African American author to receive a Caldecott honor. The book features
numbers 1-10 in Swahili with a two-page black and white illustration accompanying a
scene from East African life (Feelings, 1971).
Jambo Means Hello: Swahili Alphabet Book was a 1975 honor book, the second
illustrated by Tom Feelings and written by Muriel Feelings, and a companion book to the
preceding Moja Means One. Featuring 24 letters, one for each of letter of the Swahili
alphabet, children are introduced to words representing each letter along with vivid black
and white illustrations in the same style as their previous title (Feelings, 1974).

32

Why Mosquitoes Buzz in People’s Ears was the 1976 medal winner illustrated by
Leo and Diane Dillion and written by Verna Aardema. With this win, Leo Dillon became
the first African American to be awarded the gold medal for his work. Dillon’s artistic
partner, and wife, Diane, was white. Cause and effect are the theme of this West African
tale (Aardema, 1975).
Illustrators Leo and Diane Dillon are back with another gold medal winner in
1977’s Ashanti to Zulu: African Traditions, which was written by Margaret Musgrove.
Through exhaustive research the author studied many African cultures. In this book, she
focuses on one tribe per letter of the alphabet. Using watercolor, pastels and acrylics, the
Dillons attempt to bring the most information to the reader by including one man, one
woman, one child, living quarters, local animal and local artifact in their images
representing each tribe (Musgrove, 1976).
The Way to Start a Day illustrated by Peter Parnall and written by Byrd Baylor
won a silver medal in 1979. In this story of multicultural people singing a morning
greeting, Baylor includes images for drumming “sunrise songs in the Congo” and
Egyptians proclaiming “the only sound at dawn should be the sound of songs that please
the morning sun.” Parnall chooses predominantly yellow, turquoise and green to
emphasize different parts of the landscape, with pink and turquoise as the primary colors
for peoples’ clothing (Baylor, 1978).
Ben’s Trumpet was a 1980 honor book written and illustrated by Rachel Isadora
which tells the story of an aspiring African American jazz musician accompanied by
black and white illustrations (Isadora, 1979).

33

Previous winner Marcia Brown received another gold medal for her illustrations
in Shadow in 1983. Shadow is the translated work of Blaise Cendrars, a French poet who
traveled extensively in Africa, who wrote this poem in an effort to capture the African
experience of shadow (Brown, 1982). However, because this book depicts Africans as
people distant from modernity and instead part of the “fast-vanishing Africa,” the book
was met with severe criticism for “negative and destructive stereotypes about Africa and
black people” and concern that “Black children will transfer to themselves a primitive
and denigrating image” (Howard, 1983).
In the same year, A Chair for My Mother author and illustrator Vera Williams
makes her first appearance on the Caldecott list. In this story about a young girl whose
family loses their home to a fire and then saves for a new chair, an African American
woman is depicted working in a restaurant alongside the protagonist’s white mother
(Williams, 1982).
Ten, Nine, Eight, a 1984 honor book written and illustrated by Molly Bang, is the
first time we see a female African American as the primary character in a Caldecott title.
This full color story counts down from ten to one as a little girl gets ready for bedtime
with help from her daddy (Bang, 1983).
The Polar Express was the 1986 medal winner written and illustrated by Chris
Van Allsburg. There is a single image of an African American child who is shown
engaged in conversation with a white child on a train (Van Allsburg, 1985).
The Village of Round and Square Houses was a 1987 honor book written and
illustrated by Ann Grifalconi, a white woman. It is the tale of a remote village in the hills

34

of the Camaroons in Central African where the women live in round houses and the men
in square houses following a volcanic explosion that leaves only two buildings standing
(Grifalconi, 1986).
Written and illustrated by John Steptoe, Mufaro’s Beautiful Daughters: An
African Tale, won an honor award in 1988. It was also the Coretta Scott King Illustrator
Award winner that year. Steptoe was inspired by a folktale collected from the Zimbabwe
region in 1895 to create a modern tale of two sisters, one evil and one kind, who are
vying for marriage to the king (Steptoe, 1987).
Mirandy and Brother Wind was a 1989 honor book illustrated by Jerry Pinkney
and written by Patricia C. McKissack which also won a Coretta Scott King Illustrator
Award. Featuring a young Southern African American girl who tries to capture the wind
to help ensure she wins a dance contest, Pinkney adds to the tale with full color
watercolor images (McKissack, 1988).
A 1990 book, The Talking Eggs: A Folktale from the American South, was also
illustrated by Jerry Pinkney and in addition to a Caldecott honor received a Coretta Scott
King Illustrator Honor award. Written by Robert D. San Souci, it is a retelling of a
Southern folktale of two sisters, one lazy and one hard-working. With pencils, colored
pencils and watercolor, Pinkney brings the story to life (San Souci, 1989).
“More, More, More,” Said the Baby: Three Love Stories was a 1991 honor book
written and illustrated by Vera B. Williams. Illustrated with gouache paintings, this book
includes three little stories about babies being loved by different people in their lives, one
of which is an African American baby with their white grandma (Williams, 1990).

35

Tar Beach, a 1992 honor book written and illustrated by Faith Ringgold, an
African American woman, also won the Coretta Scott King Illustrator Award. The story
features young Cassie, who takes flight from “tar beach,” her family’s apartment rooftop.
Acrylic paintings show Cassie flying over the city claiming everything in sight for her
own (Ringgold, 1991).
Illustrated by Carole Byard and written by Sherley Anne Williams, Working
Cotton was named a 1993 honor book as well as a Coretta Scott King Illustrator Honor
title. With acrylic illustrations, Byard helps relate this story of a young African American
girl and her family on a central California cotton plantation (Williams, 1992).
Grandfather’s Journey, the 1994 medal winner written and illustrated by Allen
Say is the story of the author’s grandfather’s journey to America. A single image of an
African American man accompanies the text “He shook hands with black men and white
men, yellow men and red men” (Say, 1993).
Yo! Yes?, named a 1994 honor book, was illustrated by Chris Raschka and edited
by Richard Jackson. Watercolor and charcoal pencil illustrate this sparsely worded story
of two boys, one African American and one white, who meet on the street and quickly
become friends. In fact, the Library of Congress catalog description summarizes this
book as “Two lonely characters, one black and one white, meet on the street and become
friends” (Raschka, 1993). However, Raschka himself stated that it was his “intent to
portray an interracial situation while noting that the characters were deliberately drawn
ambiguously to allow for ‘depth and resonance’ with more people” (Pescosolido, et al.
1997).

36

Smoky Night was the 1995 medal winner illustrated by David Diaz and written by
Eve Bunting. A young African American boy and his mother need to escape their
burning building following the riots in Los Angeles which followed the verdict in the
Rodney King case. The features of the many races are quite similar while the Latino and
Korean people appear to have lighter skin. Diaz used a variety of collage materials to
create visually strong images. This story with an African American male primary
character is told by a Latino male illustrator and white female author (Bunting, 1994).
The language, from a white woman’s perspective, does not appear to have the benefit of
the African American experience. One reviewer stated “Rather, in Bunting’s trivialized
interpretation of the South Central rebellion, there’s no racism, no poverty, no injustice—
just angry people who enjoy looting and can take a lesson in getting along from a couple
of cats.” Using the child’s voice, she purports, gives Bunting leave to avoid having to
explore the complex social issues surrounding the riots (Slapin, 2012). Still others found
the violence inappropriate for a picture book audience. Yet noted book reviewer Zena
Sutherland opined that television violence children are exposed to every day is far worse
and that he “can’t see the violence of an actual event is going to harm them” (Sutherland,
1997).
John Henry, a 1995 honor book, illustrated by Jerry Pinkney and written by Julius
Lester is the story of African American folk hero John Henry. Inspired by the song of the
same name and abundant folklore, Pinkney weaves the visual tale with vivid watercolor
images (Lester, 1994).

37

Swamp Angel, another 1995 honor book, was illustrated by Paul O. Zelinsky and
written by Anne Isaacs. This “tall tale” features a white female protagonist with three
African Americans in background images dancing, playing an instrument and riding in a
boat (Isaacs, 1994).
Zin! Zin! Zin! A Violin was a 1996 honor book illustrated by Marjorie Priceman
and written by Lloyd Moss. An African American woman is featured in this counting
book starring classical music instruments (Moss, 1995).
The Faithful Friend, a 1996 honor book illustrated by Brian Pinkney and written
by Robert D. San Souci, is the retelling of a tale from the French West Indies featuring
several Black characters from various regions. The illustrator also won a Coretta Scott
King Illustrator Honor award (San Souci, 1995).
A 1997 honor book, The Paperboy, was written and illustrated by Dav Pilkey.
Illustrated in watercolor and India ink, this contemporary story features a young African
American paperboy rising at dawn and going about the business of delivering the
neighborhood’s newspapers (Pilkey, 1996).
The Gardener was a 1998 honor book illustrated by David Small and written by
Sarah Stewart. This story of a young white girl who travels to the city to stay with her
uncle after his father loses his job features a helpful and loving African American couple.
The couple, who appear to work for her uncle, help the girl create a stunning rooftop
garden (Stewart, 1997).
A 1998 honor book, Harlem, was illustrated by Christopher Myers and written by
Walter Dean Myers and also won a Coretta Scott King Illustrator Honor. This rhythmic

38

poem of the story of the African American experience in Harlem, incorporating
references to Africa, Sugar Ray, Langston Hughes, Martin Luther King, Jr., the Cotton
Club, and more is illustrated with bold collage, ink and gouache and features a multitude
of African American characters (Myers, 1997).
Duke Ellington: The Piano Prince and His Orchestra received a Caldecott honor
award in 1999 as well as a Coretta Scott King Illustrator Honor. Illustrated by Brian
Pinkney and written by Andrea Davis Pinkney, the story of Duke Ellington is told
accompanied with vibrant images created using a scratchboard technique (Pinkney,
1998).
An honor award was received for A Child’s Calendar in 2000. Illustrated by
Trina Schart Hyman and written by John Updike, this series of poems highlighting a
child’s experiences from January through December features several images of African
Americans including an African American father, white mother, and their biracial
children (Updike, 1999).
Martin’s Big Words: The Life of Dr. Martin Luther King was a 2002 honor book
illustrated by Brian Collier and written by Doreen Rappaport which also won the Coretta
Scott King Illustrator Honor award. This picture book biography of Martin Luther King,
Jr. was illustrated in Collier’s signature watercolor and cut paper collage (Rappaport,
2001).
The Stray Dog, a 2002 honor book written and illustrated by Marc Simont, about
a white family hoping to rescue a stray dog includes images of three African Americans
in park scenes (Simont, 2001).

39

Ella Sarah Gets Dressed is a 2004 honor book written and illustrated by Margaret
Chodos-Irvine. In this story about Ella Sarah getting dressed, friends show up at the end,
one of whom is an African American girl who is featured with the protagonist and their
friends at a tea party (Chodos-Irvine, 2003).
Coming on Home Soon, illustrated by E.B. Lewis and written by Jacqueline
Woodson, received an honor award in 2005. White’s watercolor images bring life to
Woodson’s tale of a WWII era African American daughter whose mom who finds work
in Chicago and needs to leave her with her grandmother for a while (Woodson, 2004).
Knuffle Bunny, a 2005 honor book written and illustrated by Mo Willems, features
an animated African American male in the background as the family runs down a New
York City street (Willems, 2004).
Rosa, a 2006 honor book illustrated by Bryan Collier and written by Nikki
Giovanni, was also the Coretta Scott King Illustrator Award winner. Illustrated with
watercolor and collage Collier aids Giovanni’s retelling of the time celebrated Civil
Rights activist Rosa Parks refused to give her bus seat to a white man (Giovanni, 2005).
Flotsam, the 2007 medal winner, was written and illustrated by David Wiesner.
In this wordless story vibrant watercolor images tell the tale of a camera washing up on
shores around the world where the receiving child takes a photo and tosses it back. Two
of the images of children are Black boys (Wiesner, 2006).
Moses: When Harriet Tubman Led Her People to Freedom was 2007 honor book
illustrated by Kadir Nelson and written by Carole Boston Weatherford which also won
the King Illustrator Award. In Moses, Kadir Nelson’s vibrant images accompany the

40

author’s fictional tale of Tubman’s spiritual journey compelling her movements on the
Underground Railroad (Weatherford, 2006).
Henry’s Freedom Box: A True Story from the Underground Railroad is a 2008
honor book illustrated by Kadir Nelson and written by Ellen Levine. Nelson’s second
honor title in as many years, Henry’s Freedom Box relates the story of an enslaved man
who, after suffering horrific loss, gains his freedom by having himself mailed to a free
state (Levine, 2007).
The Wall: Growing Up Behind the Iron Curtain was a 2008 honor book written
and illustrated by Peter Sis. This picture book autobiography includes text from his
original journal entries. Surrounding those entries are a number of iconic photos from
pop culture of the time, one of which is African American Jimi Hendrix (Sis, 2007).
All the World, a 2010 honor book illustrated by Marla Frazee and written by Liz
Garton Scanlon, includes several families interacting with the world around them. Frazee
has included an African American father, white mother, and their biracial children among
them as well as a Black father and baby (Scanlon, 2009).
Dave the Potter: Artist, Poet, Slave, a 2011 honor book written by Laban Carrick
and illustrated by Bryan Collier brought Collier his third Caldecott title as well as another
Coretta Scott King Illustrator Award. Using watercolor collage, Collier brings Carrick’s
poetic homage to “Dave the Potter” to life (Carrick, 2010).
Blackout was a 2012 honor book written and illustrated by John Rocco. This tale
of a family’s night of amusement when their power goes out includes an African
American mom, white father, and their biracial children (Rocco, 2011).

41

The 2014 gold medal winner, Locomotive, was written and illustrated by Brian
Floca. In this book about the first transcontinental railroad trip, there is an African
American shown working beside two white men building the rail lines and another image
in which an African American porter is placing some luggage overhead (Floca, 2013).
In 2016, of the medal winner and four honor books, three featured African
Americans as primary characters. Two were authored by African Americans, one female
and one male. One was written by a Latino man. Two were illustrated by African
American men and one by an African American woman. The medal winner, Finding
Winnie, was illustrated by Sophie Blackall and written by Lindsay Mattick, both white
women. Controversy ensued as some people raved about the excellent choices, and
appreciated “the diversity reflected in the selections” while others raged about the
choices, blaming the committee for deciding to “promote diversity over quality”
(Robinson, 2016).
Last Stop on Market Street, which was illustrated by Christian Robinson and
written by Matt de la Peña, received an honor award. This is the story of young African
American protagonist CJ and his experience on a bus ride he takes across town with his
grandmother. Using digital manipulation, acrylic paint, and collage, Robinson fills the
pages with multiple African American characters including the bus driver, other
passengers, and people on the street (de la Peña, 2015). Last Stop on Market Street also
won the Newbery gold medal in 2016.
Voice of Freedom: Fannie Lou Hamer Spirit of the Civil Rights Movement,
illustrated by Ekua Holmes and written by Carole Boston Weatherford, also received an

42

honor award in 2016. Told in verse, this is the story of African American Civil Rights
activist, Fannie Lou Hamer, and the numerous efforts she made in the fight for equality.
It is illustrated by Ekua Holmes in full color collage (Weatherford, 2015).
The second autobiography to appear in the Caldecott canon is Trombone Shorty,
which was illustrated by Bryan Collier and written by Troy “Trombone Shorty”
Andrews. This picture book tells the tale of contemporary African American jazz
musician, Trombone Shorty, from his childhood to the successful music career he enjoys
today. Illustrated with Collier’s pen and ink, watercolor and collage images, the vibrant
tale comes to life (Andrews, 2015).
Black people have been represented in a myriad of ways in the Caldecott titles
over the decades. The majority of the portrayals are historic, take place in another
country, or are African or African American folktales. Interestingly, Abraham Lincoln,
They Were Strong and Good and The Rooster Crows have all been revised since their
original publication to alter racist and/or stereotyped images or language. Very few of
the Caldecott titles place the African American in contemporary times and, as Larrick
(1963) stated “it is no small comfort to read of the Negro slave who smilingly served his
white master” to a present day child. Of the 62 titles which include a Black character,
only 21 include an African American character in a setting contemporaneous with the
date of publication and only two of those were medal winners, both in books contentious
at the time of publication and still today: A Snowy Day and Smoky Night. Of those 21
featuring an African American in a contemporary setting, 14 are the primary character.
While 62 books is significant as 19% of the books compared to the 2014 African

43

American population estimate of 13.6%, it is important to note how African Americans
have been depicted in them, as detailed above. Inasmuch as only 21 books portray a
contemporary setting, it reduces the total in which a child could potentially recognize
themselves to just above 6%.
American Indian Representation
Of the 332 Caldecott titles from 1938-2016, 6% (21 titles) included images of
American Indians in some capacity: seven featured male American Indians as primary
characters and four featured females; 13 featured males and nine included females as
secondary characters; and ten featured males and six females as background characters
(see Figure 5). Ten of the 21 titles, or 3%, featuring American Indians were about

Data compiled from author’s research.

The first appearance of American Indians in the Caldecott titles was in the 1940
medal-winning Abraham Lincoln, a biography of the 16th president, by Ingri and Edgar
Parin d’Aulaire (d’Aulaire, 1957). Among the illustrations, on a two page spread, one
sees a small caricature of a dancing American Indian man in the upper left hand corner
across from a full page illustration of Abraham Lincoln with Chief Black Hawk, who is
shown hunkered down behind him. In honor of the 75th anniversary of its publication, a
reprint was issued with a number of revisions. In particular, Chief Black Hawk’s bent
knees (creating the appearance of cowering behind Lincoln) have been removed so that
he appears to be standing straight. In addition, Chief Black Hawk’s hand is now on the
hilt of Abraham Lincoln’s sword whereas previously it was on his waist (see Figure 6).
Slight changes to the text have been made as well. Debbie Reese, a Nambe Pueblo
Indian woman who runs the blog American Indians in Children’s Literature, states that
simply changing Chief Black Hawk from cowering to standing erect does nothing to
correct the “white savior theme” (Reese, 2016). She takes further exception to an
illustration of toddler Abraham Lincoln, where the accompanying text states that “Abe is
solemn like a little papoose,” perpetuating the stereotype of the stoic American Indian
(Reese, 2016).

edition of the book, and the one on the right is from the 2015 edition. Reprinted from
Abraham Lincoln, by I. P. d’Aulaire and E .P. d’Aulaire, 1957, Garden City, NY:
Doubleday. (Original work published 1939). The image from the 1957 edition is

The following year we see American Indians in They Were Strong and Good,
written and illustrated by Robert Lawson, which won the gold medal in 1941. The sole
image of American Indians features a man and woman running from a house chased by
an African American woman wielding a broom along with the textual information that
the author’s grandmother did not like the “Indians” who “would stalk into the kitchen
without knocking and…not leave until my mother’s mother gave them something to eat”

46

(Lawson, 1966). Interestingly, in another case of editing a reprint, the sparse text
accompanying this image was revised in 1994 to remove text previously describing the
Indians in the image as “tame ones” (Reese, 2011).
1942 brought us three Caldecott honor books featuring American Indians in some
capacity. In An American ABC, author-illustrator team Maud and Miska Petersham
depict American Indians on pages for the letters J (Jamestown), K (Knickerbocker), R
(Redskins), and T (Thanksgiving). For Jamestown, Captain John Smith is illustrated
engaged in finding “a way to get corn from the unfriendly Indians” for hungry colonists
(Petersham, 1941). As Smith is depicted holding blue cloth out to an American Indian
man standing beside a bucket of corn, one can deduce from the illustration that one way
to get corn was to trade fabric. The American Indian man is wearing moccasins, a loin
cloth, an arrow and quiver, and single feather on his head. Knickerbocker referenced a
Dutch family who settled on Manhattan and whose family members are engaged in trade
with an Indian man. The colonists depicted are a fully clothed boy and girl holding a
piece of blue cloth while the Indian man shown is wearing moccasins, leather pants, and
two feathers in his short Mohawk while carrying an armful of furs. For “R is for
Redskins, the first real Americans,” the illustrators chose to depict Squanto, “one of the
friendly redskins” teaching a hungry Pilgrim child “how to tread the stream for eels.”
Finally, the pages dedicated to “T is for Thanksgiving” feature American Indian men
wearing single pieces of cloth with feathers in their hair.
In My Mother’s House illustrated by Velino Herrera and written by Ann Nolan
Clark, features American Indians in both full color and black and white illustrations.

47

Included are images of their homes, farms, and surrounding desert and mountain terrain.
People are shown plowing, preparing food, dancing, and in ceremony. The people’s
faces are left white in the black and white illustrations and are brown in the full color
images (Clark, 1969). While Velino Herrera, a Pueblo Indian man (Benes, 2004), has the
distinction of being the only American Indian illustrator—or author—of a Caldecott
book, Ann Nolan Clark was a white woman who believed that the stories of American
Indian children needed to be told (Kunitz, 1951).
In the third honor book of 1942, Paddle-to-the-Sea, written and illustrated by
Holling Clancy Holling, an American Indian boy creates a model of a canoe and
American Indian figure, who he names Paddle-to-the-Sea which he sets free on a bed of
snow to have an adventure when the snow melts into the river. Indeed, he has many
adventures as he travels from Northern Canada to the Atlantic Ocean and watercolor
images on each page show Paddle-to-the-Sea traveling through a beaver pond, over
waterfalls, and into a saw mill, where the little canoe is damaged and repaired by a
lumberjack. After four years of journeying, he finally reaches the sea where he has a
quick chance encounter with his creator (Holling, 1969).
The Mighty Hunter by Berta and Elmer Hader won an honor award in 1944 and
features Little Brave Heart, a “brave little Indian boy,” as he takes a day off of school to
go hunting. Beginning with a small animal, each subsequently larger animal encourages
him to wait for the prize of an even larger animal and when a large mother bear is
angered to learn he is hunting for sport instead of need, she starts to chase him. He opts
to head quickly to school (Hader, 1967).

48

1945’s winning book, Prayer for a Child, illustrated by Elizabeth Orton Jones and
written by Rachel Field is the goodnight prayer of a little white girl. On just one page in
particular, one sees a sea of children’s faces intended presumably to represent the “other
children, far and near” who appear in the young girl’s prayer. From the coloring and
clothing, one can deduce that the light brown boy and girl with dark hair in red
headbands were probably intended to be representatives of American Indian people as the
illustrator made an effort to include children of multiple backgrounds to accompany this
text. A portion of this image appears on approximately one-third of the cover as well,
surrounding an image of the white female child (Field, 1944).
The Thanksgiving Story illustrated by Helen Sewell and written by Alice Dagliesh
was a 1955 honor book which tells the stereotypical story of Thanksgiving most
Americans attending public school are taught: the story of the Mayflower voyage,
settlement, hunger, and finally cooperation, friendship, and celebration with the
American Indians. There are small stories within the text of the pilgrims’ interactions
with the American Indians but it is not until the last illustration that they are depicted at
all. When they are finally illustrated, they are seated at the table with minimal clothing,
beside the pilgrims, all smiling and eating (Dagliesh, 1988).
Houses from the Sea illustrated by Adrienne Adams and written by Alice E.
Goudey is a 1960 honor book that tells the story of two children gathering shells on a
beach. Illustrations depict their imaginings and in one such illustration, an American
Indian man is shown handing shells to white man with text describing that Indians would
use the shells as money or give them as gifts of peace to early white settlers. The

49

American Indian is portrayed with dark skin, feathers in his hair, leather boots and a
leather wrap (Goudey, 1959).
In 1963, The Sun is a Golden Earring illustrated by Bernarda Bryson and written
by Natalia M. Belting received an honor award. Author and folklorist Natalia Belting
tells the story of the sun by weaving excerpts from several cultures’ tales to create one
longer narrative. American Indian portions include legends from Navajo, Chippewa and
Ute nations and some small pencil illustrations to accompany them. These illustrations
include a man leaping from “mountain top to mountain top” (Ute) and another man
floating atop a cloud while fashioning the sun from rock crystal (Navajo) (Belting, 1962).
The Angry Moon illustrated by Blair Lent and written by William Sleator received
an honor award in 1971. An illustrator’s note indicates that the style is based on Tlingit
motifs, though they are not meant to be authentic. Accompanied by full watercolor and
ink illustrations, the story is told of a young American Indian girl who insults the moon
and is held prisoner by him until her friend reaches and rescues her. Both of the child
characters are shown with brown skin, long dark hair, and wearing leather (the boy pants,
the girl a knee-length dress). The boy is aided on his rescue mission by a child who
appears to him and takes him to his grandmother for guidance. These child and
grandmother figures appear to be loosely based on totem pole motifs themselves because
although they have arms and legs like people, their heads resemble totem pole symbols
(Sleator, 1970).
When Clay Sings written by Byrd Baylor and illustrated by Tom Bahti was
awarded an honor in 1973. Illustrations inspired by pottery etchings fill the pages of this

50

book about “ancient Indian pottery.” The illustrator credits ancient potters from the
Anasazi, Mogollon, Hohokam and Mimbres cultures (Baylor, 1972).
Arrow to the Sun, a Pueblo Indian tale written and illustrated by Gerald
McDermott won the gold medal in 1975 to much controversy that continues to more
contemporary times (McDermott, 1974). Selma G. Lanes wrote a scathing review in
School Library Journal at the time stating that McDermott’s illustrations “lumber
graphically forward with about as much natural grace and motion as those mechanical
rabbits that launch dog races” and calling the content “archaic” and “ludicrous” (Lanes,
1975). In more recent times, Debbie Reese has called into question the authenticity of
parts of the tale, such as the “dance of life,” which was created by McDermott according
to his biographer (Reese, 2008). Reese expresses dismay at his depiction of their sacred
kiva spaces as well as the “illegitimacy” of the protagonist, a concept which does not
exist in the Puebloan family structure (Reese, 2006).
Peter Parnall was the illustrator and Byrd Baylor the author of two Caldecott
honor books awarded in 1976 (The Desert is Theirs), and 1977 (Hawk, I’m Your
Brother). In Desert, Baylor tells the story of the Papago Indians, or “desert people,” and
their interconnected relationship with the land. Parnall’s simple illustrations are
highlighted with color for select parts of the desert in each image. In Hawk, Baylor tells
the story of a young boy who longs to fly. After nurturing an injured hawk to healing, he
feels he does just that as the two are now intrinsically connected. Here, Parnall illustrated
in just black and white. In each book, Parnall’s simple illustrations gracefully aid
Baylor’s storytelling. Interestingly, although he does use color to emphasize portions of

51

his artwork, in all three of his Caldecott titles, Parnall allows the American Indians’ skin
tones to match that of the paper: white.
1979 saw American Indians featured in both the winning book and an honor book.
The Girl Who Loved Wild Horses written and illustrated by Paul Goble won the gold
medal. This is the tale of an American Indian girl who loved horses so much she went to
live among them eventually becoming one of them, forsaking her family and community.
Unfortunately, this story appears to be another instance of a tribal legend with no source
notes and no evidence of its existing as a Native story prior to Goble’s publication
(Reese, 2014a). He has gone on to tell more than 30 tales purportedly connected to
American Indian legend. Perhaps he was responding to criticism for his appropriation of
American Indians’ stories when he began using a trickster character, Iktomi, to ridicule
his critics within the introductory material of future picture books (Seale, 2005).
The Way to Start a Day illustrated by Peter Parnall and written by Byrd Baylor
won a third honor for the duo. In this book, accompanied with Parnall’s signature style,
Baylor tells the story of multiple world people, including American Indians, singing a
morning greeting. Here, Parnall chose predominantly yellow, turquoise and green to
emphasize different parts of the landscape, with pink and turquoise as the primary colors
for people’s clothing (Baylor, 1978).
Where the Buffaloes Begin illustrated by Stephen Gammell and written by Olaf
Baker won an honor award in 1982. Little Wolf, after hearing the legend of the origin of
buffaloes, visits the site where they began and saves them from man. With soft black and
white illustrations throughout, Gammell depicts a tale of plains Indians as they search for

52

buffalo across prairies and hills to the lake, where they are said to be born. The
American Indians depicted are shown with long dark hair, often on horseback, with fur
and leather clothing (Baker, 1981).
In Grandfather’s Journey, the 1994 medal winner written and illustrated by Allen
Say about his grandfather, a single image of an American Indian man accompanies the
text “He shook hands with black men and white men, yellow men and red men” (Say,
1993).
That same year, Raven, a Trickster Tale from the Northwest, written and
illustrated by Gerald McDermott won an honor award. McDermott used the raven, which
appears in a number of Pacific Northwest tribal legends, to create this tale of Raven’s
search for the sun (McDermott, 1993). Like Arrow to the Sun, Raven was not
enthusiastically received by the American Indian community. One reviewer rated the
book poorly due to “no acknowledgements and no introductions offered by any tribal
agencies or personal acknowledgements from any Native peoples,” yet did not
acknowledge herself that it was intended to be an original tale influenced by tribal
legends, not a legend itself (Martindale, 2004). Another took offense to this
amalgamating of Pacific Northwest First Nations and felt “Universalizing and
generalizing retellings such as this degrade sacred cultural teachings into mere tales”
(Seale, 2005).
The American Indian made another appearance a 2009 honor book, A River of
Words: The Story of William Carlos Williams, illustrated by Melissa Sweet and written
by Jen Bryant. In this biography of William Carlos Williams, a collage includes the

53

words “The Song of Hiawatha” beside a black and white image of two American Indians.
Both have shoulder length dark hair, one is wearing feathers in his hair and the other is
playing a flute (Bryant, 2008).
Two additional Caldecott titles feature white people dressed as American Indians.
1950 brought America’s Ethan Allen, an honor book, illustrated by Lynd Ward and
written by Stewart Holbrook. In this biography, Ethan Allen, a son of early colonists, is
depicted as a pious and mighty builder. In a struggle for the right to some land, Allen’s
party dressed as “fake savages” to scare the conflicting party off and two separate
illustrations feature white people dressed in a stereotypical feather and headband and
American Indian clothing (Holbrook, 1949).
The following year, 1951, The Two Reds won a Caldecott honor award.
Illustrated by Nicholas Mordvinoff and written by William Lipkind, this is the tale of a
red-haired boy, “Red,” and his red-haired cat who set off for adventures in their
neighborhood. Red is soon in conflict with a band of white neighborhood boys who call
themselves the Seventh Street Signal Senders. The Signal Senders – up to 15 in an image
– are shown wearing full headdress or single feathers and with many wielding swords or
bows and arrows. One is depicted with a cowboy hat (Lipkind, 1950).
American Indians have not appeared in a Caldecott title since 1994, over 20 years
ago. Their appearances prior to that varied from being depicted as historical figures to
appearing in tales purporting to be legends from several nations’ oral traditions. As
historical figures, the men are seen wearing feathers and leather and often engaged in
trade or gifting white colonists with food or other materials. (The exception to that

54

depiction is in They Were Strong and Good, in which the American Indian people are
depicted as nuisances to the white settlers; this book is the only instance of a woman
appearing as a historical figure.) When white men and boys are shown dressed as
American Indians in two Caldecott books, America’s Ethan Allen and The Two Reds,
they are feared by other white people. Several of the stories are or purport to be
American Indian legends. Just under half of the titles feature contemporary American
Indians and in all of those they are seen communing with or coexisting supernaturally
with nature, living in the desert, or working the land. Just three of the titles with an
American Indian primary character are in a contemporary setting. There was a fairly
steady, if not robust, presence into the early 80s, when there was a 12-year gap followed
by the current 22 year lapse. As described herein, only one American Indian, Velino
Hererra, has illustrated a Caldecott title. In 2006, the American Indian Library
Association established the American Indian Youth Literature Award “as a way to
identify and honor the very best writing and illustrations by and about American
Indians.” Awards are given every two years to books that “present American Indians in
the fullness of their humanity in the present and past contexts.” Most recently, in 2016,
the award for best picture book went to Little You illustrated by Julie Flett and written by
Richard Van Camp, which was published by Orca Book Publishers in 2013 (American
Indian Library Association, 2016).
Asian and Asian American Representation
Asian and Asian American people have appeared visually in 9%, or 29, of the 332
Caldecott titles through 2016. These representations include Asian people from countries

55

throughout the world such as America, China, Japan, Korea, Thailand, India, as well as
many whose origin is indiscernible from images or text. As primary characters, they
have appeared in 13 titles, of which three were gold medal winners (see Figure 7).
Thirteen, or 1%, of the 332 titles have been exclusively about Asians or Asian
Americans. Of the 29, seven were illustrated by an Asian American and five were
written by an Asian American. The first appearance of an Asian character was in Mei Li
in 1939, shortly after the inception of the award. The only time a gold medal has been
awarded to a book in which the protagonist was Asian American was Grandfather’s
Journey, which was an historical tale about the author’s Japanese grandfather’s
immigration experience decades earlier. The first Asian American to illustrate a
Caldecott title was 12-year-old Plato Chan who illustrated his father’s book, Good-Luck
Horse, about a Chinese legend. Asian American illustrators and authors have created
three Caldecott books in which no Asian or Asian American characters have appeared:
Seven Blind Mice written and illustrated by Ed Young; The Adventures of Beekle: The
Unimaginary Friend, written and illustrated by Dan Santat; and This One Summer,
illustrated by Jillian Tamaki and written by Mariko Tamaki. A gold medal has never
been awarded to a book with a contemporary Asian American primary character.
However, contemporary Asian or Asian American characters have appeared as primary
characters in five of the Caldecott titles.

Figure 7. Caldecott titles in which Asian and Asian American people appear, through
2016. Data compiled from author’s research.
In 1939 Mei Li, which was written and illustrated by Thomas Handforth, won the
gold medal. Mei Li, a little girl who lives in Northern China, must hurry home after
visiting a nearby city for the New Year’s fair. Set in contemporary 1930s, the text
incorporates current activities with adherence to Chinese traditions and lore, such as
returning from a new year celebration in time to greet the Kitchen God. There is a four
color cover with black and white illustrations throughout (Handforth, 1938).

57

Small Rain: Verses from the Bible, illustrated by Jessie Orton Jones and written
by Elizabeth Orton Jones, received an honor award in 1944, features children from
various ethnicities on several pages. There is an Asian girl on the cover and in three of
the illustrations (Jones, 1943).
Good-Luck Horse was a 1944 honor title illustrated by Plato Chan and written by
Chih-Yi Chan. This Chinese legend was illustrated in alternating orange and blue or
black and white illustrations by the twelve-year-old son of the author (Chan, 1943;
Peabody Bimonthly Booknotes, 1945).
Prayer for a Child, which won the medal in 1945, was also illustrated by
Elizabeth Orton Jones and was written by Rachel Fields. Several Asian faces are
depicted in the crowd with the other children on the page for the prayer for children “far
and near” (Field, 1944).
In 1946, author and illustrator Kurt Wiese won an honor award for You Can Write
Chinese, the story of an American boy named Peter attending a school in China. The
book takes the reader on a journey with Peter as he learns to write several words in
Chinese, many such as bamboo, ox and rice, significant to Chinese culture. Simple red
and black or blue and black illustrations accompany the tale which was considered even
decades later to be a “fine example of the way Chinese writing differs from our own”
(Wiese, 1945; Orton Society, 1973).
Fish in the Air, which is set in China and was also written and illustrated by Kurt
Wiese, won a 1949 silver medal. In this brightly illustrated tale of a boy named Fish,

58

who loves all things having to do with fish, he is carried away by his giant fish kite in a
big gust of wind (Weise, 1948).
Sing in Praise, a 1947 honor title illustrated by Marjorie Torrey and written by
Opal Wheeler, includes a single page of multiple diverse faces in this 95-page book, one
of which is an Asian girl carrying a baby on her back in a carrier (Wheeler, 1946).
If I Ran the Zoo, which was an honor book in 1951, was written and illustrated by
Theodor Seuss Geisel. As protagonist Gerald McGrew travels the world seeking
characters for his zoo, he goes for a hunt “in mountains of Zomba-ma-Tant, with helpers
who all wear their eyes at a slant.” The Asian characters, dressed in robes and
exaggerated wooden clogs, are represented by three men balancing the “fine fluffy bird
called the Bustard” in a cage on their heads. In addition, there is a reference to “eight
Persian princes” who are depicted with exaggerated turbans and puffy pants carrying a
basket of assorted creatures (Dr. Seuss, 1950).
An honor title for 1956, Crow Boy was written and illustrated by Taro Yashima
and set in Japan. The first of three Caldecott titles to his credit, this is the story of a
Japanese school boy who is taunted and ostracized by his classmates for being shy and
unusual until the day they discover his extraordinary gift of mimicking crow calls. Full
color illustrations help bring this story to life (Yashima, 1956).
Fly High, Fly Low, a 1958 honor book, was written and illustrated by Don
Freeman. In the story set in San Francisco, Mr. Hi Lee, a Chinese man, feeds the pigeons
regularly and follows them to their new home to continue caring for them (Freeman,
1957).

59

In 1959, author/illustrator Taro Yashima won another honor award for illustrating
Umbrella about a Japanese American girl who receives an umbrella on her third birthday
and then has to wait patiently for the rain to come. This second Caldecott title from
Yashima includes full color illustrations (Yashima, 1958). Decades later it is still
appearing on recommended readings lists for Asian American children’s literature for its
universal experience of the Japanese American protagonist (Pang, et al. 1992).
Houses from the Sea, a 1960 honor book illustrated by Adrienne Adams and
written by Alice E. Goudey, is the story of two children gathering shells on a beach. As
they do so, they imagine limpets as Chinese hats and the accompanying illustration is of
three Chinese men. Two are carrying one in a palanquin and they all wear the conical
bamboo hats the limpets called to mind (Goudey, 1959).
Once a Mouse, the 1962 medal winner, was illustrated and retold by Marcia
Brown. Woodblock prints in greens and reds tell this fable “from ancient India”
featuring a male Indian hermit (Brown, 1961).
The Sun is a Golden Earring illustrated by Bernarda Bryson and written by
Natalia M. Belting received an honor award in 1963. In this tale weaving several
cultures’ narratives to tell of the sun, there is an entry from India accompanying text
which describes the shadows on the moon as an old woman spinning thread while her
husband sits next to her smoking his long water pipe (Belting, 1962).
The Wave, a 1965 honor title illustrated by Blair Lent and written by Margaret
Hodges, is an ancient Japanese tale of a grandfather who outwits nature and saves his
village. This is the first of two Caldecott titles retold as children’s stories that were

60

originally collected by American journalist Lafcadio Hearn. Both were illustrated by
Lent. This title is illustrated in shades of brown and black (Hodges, 1964).
In 1968 with Seashore Story, we see a third honor awarded to illustrator and
author Taro Yashima. In this story, he returns to a Japan setting and tells the story of
Japanese students who visit the seashore and wonder aloud at the meaning of a tale of a
Japanese fisherman (Yashima, 1967).
The Emperor and the Kite, illustrated by Ed Young and written by Jane Yolen,
received an honor award in 1968. Full color illustrations depict this tale of a young
Chinese princess who, usually ignored by her father, saves him with her kite (Yolen,
1967).
The Funny Little Woman, the 1973 medal winner illustrated by Blair Lent and
written by Arlene Mosel, is another book based on a tale collected by Lafcadio Hearn. In
this tale, an old Japanese woman searches for a lost dumpling and outsmarts the tale’s
tricksters (Mosel, 1972).
The Way to Start a Day illustrated by Peter Parnall and written by Byrd Baylor
was a 1979 honor title. In addition to diverse representation discussed in each of the
other sections herein, there are depictions of Chinese, Japanese and Indian people with
cultural iconography such as the Buddha in China and the Ganges in India (Baylor,
1978).
The 1981 medal winner, The Grey Lady and the Strawberry Snatcher, is a
wordless picture book written and illustrated by Molly Bang. This tale features a blue
man following a grey woman as he pursues her strawberries. There is a single image of

61

an Asian woman, bejeweled and in colorful dress, holding a basket of snakes riding a
skateboard (Bang, 1980).
The Boy of the Three Year Nap, a 1989 honor book retelling of a Japanese
folktale, was illustrated by Allen Say and written by Diane Snyder. This first Caldecott
book illustrated by Allen Say, with full color brush line illustrations, is the story of a
Japanese mother who plots to change her son’s lazy ways (Snyder, 1988).
Lon Po Po: A Red-Riding Hood Story from China, which was the 1990 gold
winner, was the second Caldecott by Chinese-American Ed Young. This Chinese tale
tells of three sisters who outsmart a wolf disguised as their grandmother (Young, 1989).
In 1994, Grandfather’s Journey won the gold medal and was both written and
illustrated by Allen Say. This story of Say’s grandfather’s life in America and Japan and
love for both countries is illustrated with full color paintings. A Chinese man appears in
the illustrations as well accompanied by the description “yellow” man (Say, 1993).
Smoky Night, the 1995 gold medal winner was illustrated by David Diaz and
written by Eve Bunting. African American protagonist Daniel finds friendship with his
Korean neighbor Mrs. Kim in the aftermath of the Los Angeles riots as the two bond over
their found cats (Bunting, 1994).
Zin! Zin! Zin! A Violin, was a 1996 honor title illustrated by Marjorie Priceman
and written by Lloyd Moss. The multicultural orchestra features an Asian female playing
the flute (Moss, 1995).
Hush! A Thai Lullaby was a 1997 honor book illustrated by Holly Meade and
written by Minfong Ho. The lullaby includes animals, such as a monkey, water buffalo

62

and elephant which would be found in Thailand as well as illustrations of clothing and
structural and natural environments authentic to the culture. Full-color cut-paper collage
and ink illustrate this lullaby as a Thai mother asks the animals to let her baby sleep (Ho,
1996).
In Tibet Through the Red Box, a 1999 honor title, Peter Sis both illustrates and
narrates the true story of his acquisition of his father’s “red box,” and the tales he
discovered of his father’s journeys in Tibet. Some of his father’s encounters with the
Tibetan people are included in the full color illustrations (Sis, 1998).
Flotsam, the 2007 gold winner, was illustrated by David Wiesner. In this
wordless picture book about a camera washing up on shores around the world, readers
see two Asian children as the camera makes its rounds (Wiesner, 2006).
Locomotive, the 2014 gold medal winner written and illustrated by Brian Floca, is
about the first transcontinental railroad trip. Chinese people are shown carrying tools to
work on the railroad at the beginning of the story as well as walking in a scene at the end
of the book when the white family arrives at their Sacramento destination (Floca, 2013).
In spite of their visual depiction, Floca was criticized for excluding the depth of their
involvement in building the railroad from the text itself (Reese, 2014b).
With 29 of the books including a person of Asian descent, we see representation
in almost 9% of the titles. Among these 29 titles featuring an Asian person in some
capacity, eight were illustrated by an Asian American and six were written by an Asian
American. However, as some recipients were recognized more than once, there are only
four unique illustrators and four unique authors among these. There has been a steady

63

appearance of Asian characters in the books over the years, with eight years being the
greatest amount of time between books. However, Asian and Asian American people
have been primarily depicted as foreign, historical or legendary figures. Although others
have included contemporary settings in Asian countries, only four honor books have
featured contemporary Asian American characters, a dearth of opportunities with which
Asian American children might identify. There was no award winning book featuring an
Asian as the primary character for the 21 years between 1968 and 1989 during which
time the Asian population increased from 1% to 3% of the total population. The
Asian/Pacific American Librarians Association (APALA) began issuing an award for
picture books by and about Asians or Asian Americans in 2004 and issues the award
every other year. There has never been any overlap in a book selected as a best or honor
picture book by the APALA and Caldecott committees.
Latino Representation
Latinos have been visually represented in the Caldecott canon in a total of ten
books, or 3%. In six of these, or 2% of the Caldecott collection, the story was
exclusively about Latinos. As primary characters, they have appeared in six, two of
which were medal winners; as secondary characters in eight; and in seven as background
characters (see Figure 8). Five of the six appearances as primary characters have been in
a setting contemporary with the date of publication. There have been just two Latino
illustrators of Caldecott books: David Diaz in 1995 and Yuyi Morales in 2015. Twenty
years passed between Latino illustrators winning the Caldecott, which is the same amount
of time that passed between appearances of a Latino person in a Caldecott.

64

The first appearance of a Hispanic person as the primary character in a Caldecott
book was 1939, the second year of the award. It wasn’t until 1950 that the gold medal
was awarded to a book featuring a person of Hispanic origin as the primary character. In
fact, that gold medal went to Song of the Swallows, one of three Caldecott titles written
and illustrated by Leo Politi, thus making him, an Italian-American, the primary

Figure 8. Caldecott books in which Latinos were represented, 1939–2016. Data
compiled from author’s research.
The first appearance of a Latino person in a Caldecott was in The Forest Pool
written and illustrated by Laura Adams Armer which won an honor in 1939. This story
of two Mexican boys trying to capture an iguana is illustrated with colorful paintings of
the two boys as they explore the forest in near their Mexican homes. Their light brown

65

skin, black hair and simple clothing appear against the backdrop of luscious greens, reds
and oranges.
Prayer for a Child illustrated by Elizabeth Orton Jones and written by Rachel
Field won an honor in 1945 and, like the American Indian representation described
earlier, features what is likely Latino children on the page depicting “other children, far
and near.” In a sea of faces of many colors, one sees a brown child with straight dark
hair wearing what is most likely a sombrero. It seems that it was the author’s intent to
portray as many cultures “far and near” as she could in this image filled with colorful
faces. Portions of the image are repeated on the cover as well (Field, 1944).
Pedro, the Angel of Olvera Street, which was written and illustrated by Leo Politi,
won an honor award in 1947. This is the first instance of a Latino child portrayed as the
primary character. Primarily illustrated in full color, the book portrays Pedro, a Mexican
American boy, living on a busy street in Los Angeles. Dozens of characters are depicted
in a variety of imagery including bustling street scenes, men working such trades as
blacksmith and pot maker, and community festivities. Because of his beautiful singing
voice, Pedro is chosen to lead the Posada, a processional play of the story of Mary and
Joseph. Dozens of Mexican Americans are shown in each illustration with the exception
of one page of music where four angels are represented as white children. In the small
nativity set, Joseph is wearing a sombrero (Politi, 1946).
Sing in Praise: A Collection of the Best Loved Hymns, illustrated by Marjorie
Torrey and written by Opal Wheeler won an honor award in 1947. Like Prayer for a
Child, it includes just one page with diverse people. In this case, it is an image on the

66

verso page of Jesus surrounded by fifteen children, four of whom are children of color
one of which is wearing a poncho and sombrero. The other 94 pages feature Christian
hymns, their history, and images of white people (Wheeler, 1946).
In 1949, Leo Politi won another honor award with Juanita. In Juanita, Politi
returns once again to Olvera Street in downtown Los Angeles, this time with a female
protagonist. With full color and black and white illustrations, he once again highlights
festivities of the Mexican American culture. The Blessing of the Animals, Easter and
Juanita’s birthday are the focus of this tale featuring only Mexican Americans (Politi,
1948).
Song of the Swallows, written and illustrated by Leo Politi, won a gold medal in
1950, and was Politi’s last Caldecott title. In Song of the Swallows, Politi leaves the Los
Angeles setting and takes his readers to the Mission of San Juan Capistrano and the
relationship between young Juan and the mission’s gardener, Julian. Together, they
enjoy the swallows’ song, their birth and growth, eventual migration and—much to
Juan’s delight—their return. Full color illustrations of the coastline, farm and mission
grounds help to illustrate this tale (Politi, 1949).
Another book featuring a Mexican celebration, Nine Days to Christmas,
illustrated by Marie Hall Ets and written by Aurora Labastida (Lembke, 1962), won a
gold medal in 1960. Hall Ets’ illustrations take viewers on a journey with young Ceci as
she and her family plan their Christmas posada. Illustrations depicting excited piñatas
coming to life for Ceci as they try to convince her to take them home for the party and

67

colorful depictions of life in a Mexican town add vibrancy to this tale of a Mexican
experience (Labastida, 1959). This is the only winning title by a Latino author.
The Way to Start a Day, illustrated by Peter Parnall and written by Byrd Baylor,
won an honor award in 1979. Baylor tells the story of multiple world cultures through
the song of a morning greeting in which people “leap and sway to Aztec flutes in
Mexico,” and “chant at dawn in the sun temples of Peru” which are the two images
representing Latinos. With a simple color palette, Parnall weaves images of the cultures’
people into its landscapes (Baylor, 1978).
Smoky Night, illustrated by David Diaz and authored by Eve Bunting, received the
gold medal in 1995. This is the story of one family’s experience following the riots in
Los Angeles that occurred after the verdict in the Rodney King trial in 1993. The
controversy surrounding this particular book is discussed more fully herein under the
African/African American Representation section. However, the Latino representation in
Smoky Night is in the form of the Ramirez family, a mother and father with their two
children who are escaping their burning building along with the African American
protagonist Daniel and his mother. The illustrator used a variety of collage materials
including soles of shoes, cereal and dry cleaning supplies to add depth to his colorful
acrylic paintings. The people in Smoky Night are all depicted with similar features
though the Latino family and Korean woman appear to have lighter skin (Bunting, 1994).
Viva Frida, written and illustrated by Yuyi Morales, won an honor award in 2015.
Morales uses the mediums stop-motion puppets made from steel, polymer clay, and
wood, acrylic paints, photography, and digital software to create the images of Frida

68

Kahlo in this vibrant biography. Viva Frida was also the Pura Belpré medal winner for
illustration in 2015 (Morales, 2014).
Among the Caldecott books, only three authors and two illustrators have been of
Hispanic origin. The first Latino author was in 1960 with Aurora Labastida’s Nine Days
to Christmas and the next not for 55 years, when Yuyi Morales won an honor for Viva
Frida. The third, Last Stop on Market Street, was authored by Matt de la Peña and won
an honor in 2016 (de la Peña, 2015).
David Diaz won the medal in 1995 and twenty years passed before Yuyi Morales
won an honor for Viva Frida. Three of the ten Caldecott books featuring a Latino
character were written and illustrated by Leo Politi, an Italian American.
In fact, there are only 10 instances of the 332 Caldecott titles in which a person
who is demonstrably of Hispanic origin appears. Of these, six remain in print: Prayer
for a Child, The Way to Start a Day, Smoky Night, Viva Frida, and all three books by Leo
Politi. This translates to just 3%, in spite of the fact that, other than white, Hispanic
people make up the majority of the population. Fully 20 years passed between
appearances of a Latino person in Caldecott books while our nation’s population went
from 6.4% Hispanic in 1980 to 17.4% in 2014. (Data was not collected for the Hispanic
population prior to 1980 and 2014 is the most recent year for which we have data.)
(Gibson & Jung, 2005). During this period of significant growth in the Hispanic
population, one out of 143 Caldecott books featured a Latino person in any capacity:
Smoky Night. The Latino representation in Smoky Night was of a family living in the
same building as the African American protagonist.

The following is a list of 20 books designated “indeterminate” because the content
was lacking in cultural specificity or text to help enable the determination of a
character(s)’s race. In some, such as Nana and the City, the first instinct was to catalog
the dark-skinned man dancing on the street to music from a portable stereo as African
American (Castillo, 2014). Upon further reflection, it was determined by the researcher
that this man could be a mirror to any number of dozens of racial groups including
Latino, Filipino, Tongan, African American, Cambodian, and numerous others. For this
reason, this book is included in this Indeterminate category. Likewise, in others, such as
Knuffle Bunny, Too and More More More Said the Baby, the ambiguous identity of some
of the characters offers an opportunity for multiple cultures to meaningfully participate in
the narrative (Willems, 2007; Williams, 1990).
In Prayer for a Child, the 1945 medal winner illustrated by Elizabeth Orton Jones
and written by Rachel Field, there is the one multicultural image previously mentioned in
each of the categories. Many cultures were able to be determined based on either
stereotypical or culturally-specific images of clothing, headwear or hair style and/or
texture. In addition to the identifiable images in this sea of many faces, there are many
whose heritage is indiscernible (Field, 1944).
In Sing Mother Goose, an honor book from 1946 illustrated by Marjorie Torrey
and written by Opal Wheeler, there is a single black face in the 104-page book. He is
dressed in what may be Indian or North African clothing holding the dress train of a
white girl. This image accompanies the lyrics to “A Little Nut Tree,” which is about the

70

“queen of Spain’s daughter” visiting. In addition, there is a white boy and a monkey in
the image, both dressed in European clothing (Wheeler, 1945).
One Wide River to Cross, a 1967 honor book illustrated by Ed Emberley and
written by Barbara Emberley purports to be a “rollicking picture book adaptation of the
traditional African-American spiritual.” From the endnotes, it appears to be a Noah’s ark
story, yet the animals enter the ark not just two by two but four by four, five by five, and
so on up to ten. Mythical animals such as unicorns and griffins are included as well as
roller skating. There is no way to discern what race the human characters are although it
is an African American spiritual (Emberley, 1966).
A 1972 honor award, If All the Seas Were One Sea, written and illustrated by
Janina Domanska, explores how the world would look like if everything were one, if all
men were one man. A colorful composite of a number of geometric shapes illustrates this
tale which includes an image of a multi-hued man made up of green, red, blue and black
(Domanska, 1971).
In 1981, The Grey Lady and the Strawberry Snatcher, written and illustrated by
Molly Bang, received an honor award. In this tale, a grey lady is followed by a blue
creature apparently seeking her strawberries. Having escaped the blue strawberry
snatcher, she goes home to her family of racial ambiguity (although with arguably brown
skin instead of grey) to share her strawberries (Bang, 1980).
A Chair for My Mother, a 1983 honor book written and illustrated by Vera
Williams features a family that is all white. There are many brown faces in a street scene
but their race is difficult to determine lacking description in the text (Williams, 1982).

71

More More More Said the Baby: Three Love Stories, a 1991 honor book written
and illustrated by Vera Williams features an African American baby in one of the three
stories. In the final story, a duo is featured that could provide a mirror for any number of
races including Asian American, American Indian, Latino and others (Williams, 1990).
In the Small, Small Pond, a 1994 honor winner illustrated and written by Denise
Fleming, the reader sees one child who is depicted on both the cover and the first pages.
This light brown child could be any gender, or one of many races. Although the story
focuses on a frog’s experience of the seasons in its pond, this presents an opportunity for
many children to find themselves in this experience of the everyday. Colored pulp
poured into hand cut stencils illustrate this vibrant tale (Fleming, 1993).
In 1996’s medal winner, Officer Buckle and Gloria, written and illustrated by
Peggy Rathmann, the reader hears the tale of a police officer and his successful safety
seminars with his dog companion. A number of student faces appear in each audience.
Some varying shades of brown with different textures of hair may be intended to
represent children of various races. In addition, there is a brown-skinned teacher whose
race is not easily determined. Full color illustrations throughout embellish this amusing
tale (Rathmann, 1995).
Sector 7 is a 2000 honor book written and illustrated by David Wiesner. In this
wordless picture book, a boy embarks on a journey from a cloud at the top of the Empire
State Building. A few brown faces of indiscernible race appear in the illustrations, one of
which works in a lab and one that is on the street (Wiesner, 1999).

72

In Ugly Duckling, a 2000 honor winning adaptation of the Hans Christian
Andersen tale, author and illustrator Jerry Pinkney portrays the story with full color
watercolor paintings. In one scene a dark-skinned man is seen rescuing the swan for his
children, who are depicted in the background. Their race is indiscernible in the
illustration or text (Pinkney, 1999).
The Hello, Goodbye Window was the 2006 gold medal winner illustrated by Chris
Raschka and written by Norton Juster. In this story of a little girl’s time spent with her
grandparents, the reader sees the girl, her parents and grandparents. Both the mother and
grandmother (with the exception of one image where the grandmother is clearly white
with the text “Nanna is English”) are pictured with dark skin and the father and
grandfather with light skin. The girl’s skin is a color in between. It is hard to tell what
Raschka’s intentions were, if this is a multiracial or biracial family and, if so, what
race(s) they are intended to represent (Juster, 2005).
Knuffle Bunny, Too: A Case of Mistaken Identity, was a 2008 honor medal written
and illustrated by Mo Willems. In this follow-up story to Knuffle Bunny, the
protagonist’s stuffed bunny is mixed up with that of a classmate’s. The classmate and her
father have much darker hair and skin but there are no cultural or other references to aid
in the discerning of their race. There are other classmates and pedestrians depicted with
dark skin but their race is indiscernible as well (Willems, 2007).
The House in the Night, the 2009 medal winner illustrated by Beth Krommes and
written by Susan Marie Swanson, names the many things one can’t see in the night. It
includes a young girl whose race is unable to be determined. Illustrated in black, white

73

and yellow with scratchboard and watercolor, there are no discernible characteristics to
help define her race (Swanson, 2008).
A 2009 honor book, A River of Words: The Story of William Carlos Williams,
illustrated by Melissa Sweet and illustrated by Jen Bryant includes two small background
images of dark-skinned males with no evidence of their racial identity in the words or
image (Bryant, 2008).
In All the World, which won an honor award in 2010 and was illustrated by Marla
Frazee and written by Liz Garton Scanlon, a number of families appear throughout this
book which highlights the life of a community. Some of the people in the community
have darker skin but there is no identifying text or clear imagery (Scanlon, 2009).
In Blackout, a 2012 honor book written and illustrated by John Rocco, a street
scene features a number of people outside enjoying the dark. People with darker skin are
shown but nothing to identify their race is present (Rocco, 2011).
Nana and the City is a 2015 honor title written and illustrated by Lauren Castillo.
In this tale about a little boy visiting his grandmother in the big city, a number of diverse
characters appear in several of the illustrations but other than darker skin, nothing to
clearly identify their race or ethnicity is evident (Castillo, 2014).
The Adventures of Beekle, an Unimaginary Friend, was the 2015 medal winner
written and illustrated by Dan Santat, about an imaginary friend in search of his human.
The readers see a number of darker-skinned people in a variety of background images.
Other than dark skin, there is nothing to indicate their race (Santat, 2014).

74

In a 2016 honor title, Last Stop on Market Street, illustrated by Christian
Robinson and written by Matt de la Peña, a number of characters with varying shades of
skin appear in the background. Lacking cultural specificity, there is no way to determine
their race (de la Peña, 2015).
Limitations and Further Research
While this review of the Caldecott winning collection did focus on a specific and
important subset of books, it was not a thorough examination of every picture book
published and thus not a comprehensive look at how diversity is depicted in all picture
books. And although these books remain fairly easy to access throughout the ages, and
many are likely to be used in educational settings, they are not necessarily the popular
books children are asking their caregivers to read repetitively. Even though they are
available, if few children are being exposed to them their negative impact is obviously
reduced. Unfortunately, in the case of several of the books, the harmful stereotyping is
still present.
Additionally, there are many ways to interpret literature and there is no real way
to know how a particular book impacts an individual child’s reading. Noting what they
will see and hear during a reading is just the beginning of trying to understand the
influences early literature will have on their lives.
Recording diverse representations in the books as a whole versus per illustration
(as was done in some studies noted in the literature review) skewed the data differently
than counting each face in each book. For example, in a winning year where a single
African American face is depicted in one of five books, it was recorded that there was an

75

African American character in 20% of that year’s winners. However, it may be that
among these winners, there are one hundred images of white faces and one image of a
Black face, in which case the diversity a reader is visually exposed to was just 1%.
Of course, the Caldecott collection has been developed over 79 years and it is
unlikely that the entire collection could match today’s diversity. While diverse
representation within the picture book has not kept pace with the population, the onus
was not on each year’s committee to anticipate the structure of the future population nor
to base their decisions on any such factors.
Not all of the data collected for this research appear in this narrative. The data
can be examined from a number of angles and the information presented here represents
just a few “snapshots.” For example, data could be extracted that would illuminate any
number of time periods, depth of representation, or illustrator and author trends.
In addition, the way the United States collects census data has fluctuated
constantly. Even with attempts at improvement, as recently as 2010 it did not allow for
accurate counting of different ethnicities, let alone multi- or bi-racial people. Accurate
collection is also dependent on education level and interest of the census takers, their
ability to spell the names of the people they are interviewing, whether neighbors or
children are interviewed, and so forth. However, these data from a system wrought with
error are likely the best we have for this purpose.
More research into what was happening socially in the country during the time
leading up to each award year may shed some light on the social construct within which
each of the committees were living.

Summary and Conclusion
It is hoped that this research will contribute to a new perspective on children’s
literature and the body of Caldecott Medal winners in particular. An informed discussion
about how racial diversity has been represented in this body of work as compared to the
diversity in our society will enable professionals to structure their conversations about the
need for change with statistical accuracy. This information will be useful to authors,
publishers, librarians, booksellers, educators, and all of those who work to help positively
impact the lives of our children. The data will help propel the conversation around the
vital work of ensuring access to excellent, diverse literature for our youth.
With the exception of the quality of African American content, there has been no
more diversity in the Caldecott winners since the addition of awards to encourage diverse
authors and content. Since the American Indian Library Association initiated an award in
2006, there has not been a single book by or about an American Indian. Since the Asian
Pacific American Library Association issued the first in award in 2003, there have only
been two books featuring an Asian character in any capacity (Flotsam and Locomotive),
neither by or about Asian characters but merely including them as a secondary or
background character. Following the establishment of the Pura Belpré in 1996, there
have been only two Latino illustrators awarded an honor (Yuyi Morales and Matt de la
Peña) and only one, Viva Frida, has included a Latino character. Since its inception in
1970, the Coretta Scott King Award has been awarded to many African American
illustrators and authors. The overlap Coretta Scott King and Caldecott awards have both
honored twelve of the same titles. The Caldecott committees have acknowledged several

77

additional titles featuring African Americans in different capacities during these 46 years
since it started. Because the criteria are different (i.e., the author or illustrator do not
have to be African American), the Caldecott committees can choose from a larger pool.
In addition, this research has included books in which Africans or African Americans are
featured in any capacity, regardless of role or quality of depiction.
Although not the highest in diverse populations, Black people have been visually
represented in the Caldecott books more than any other racial group, in 19%, or 62 of the
332 books. The majority of these portrayals feature Blacks as historic, take place in
another country, or are African or African American folktales. Six percent (21 titles)
included images of American Indians in some capacity. Their appearances vary from
being depicted as historical figures to appearing in tales purporting to be legends from
several nations’ oral traditions. Asian and Asian American people have appeared
visually in 9%, or 29, of the 332 books. These representations predominantly include
Asian people from countries other than the United States. While the second largest
proportion of the United States population, Latinos have only been visually represented
in the Caldecott canon in a total of ten, or 3%, of the books.
While it does not cover the diversity of the United States from the inception of the
Caldecott through today, the image below is a snapshot of total diversity in the books and
the diversity among primary characters in the 332 books compared to the total diversity
of the United States today, which is significant as the majority of these award winners are
still available on library bookshelves, and in classrooms or stores (see Figure 9).

78

Figure 9. Multicultural representation vs. US population. Data compiled from author’s
research and United States Census Bureau, 2015.
The 43%, or 142 of 332 books, in which people of color, American Indians and
people whose visual depiction allows for access by multiple races, seems sufficient—or
even high—at first glance. Unfortunately, the diverse representation takes on many
forms and this number does not reflect the quality of the representation. The vast
majority of books featuring American Indians or people of color depict them with
stereotyped roles or appearances, in historical settings, in foreign settings, in fantastic
settings, legendary settings, or folk or fairytale settings.
Since most of the books featuring diverse people present them as historical or
fantastical, are folk or fairytales, or take places in countries other than the United States,
these genres do not provide a mirror of a child’s own world but serve only as a window

79

even when the protagonist is of the same race. In fact, of these 142 books including
diverse representation, only 61 (or 18%) feature the person(s) of color, American Indian
or indeterminate character as the primary character. Of these, a mere 29 (>1%) are in a
non-fantasy setting contemporary with the date of publication and just 21 of those are set
in the United States. This means that less than 1% of the Caldecott winning and honor
books have included a primary character in a setting in which a child of color or
American Indian from the era could actively identify. The diversity among authors and
illustrators is even less than the meager primary character representation (see Figure 10).

It is important to remember that the award committees are composed of people
who are existing in and a product of their time. Likewise, the illustrators, authors and
consumers are products of their time. Sensibilities change over time, as has been

80

acknowledged with the books that have been revised. Interestingly, publishers recognize
the staying power of these award winners and attempt to update them by revising or
eliminating the offensive material. In the case of They Were Strong and Good and
Abraham Lincoln, this was not successful. In spite of the assumed staying power of the
award winners, it may be time to let some of them disappear into the annals of history if
we want literature for our youth that reflects the evolution of thought and new
understanding of a child’s development that each year brings. Giving a child a mirror in
which to view smart, strong, successful people who look like them in lieu of stereotyped,
subservient or foreign people who look like them is critical to their self-identity and,
ultimately, to their success. Giving other children the images available in the canon of
Caldecott books as windows into other races’ identities does not serve the best interest of
any child as it perpetuates the stereotypes and keeps the vision of “other” as an unknown,
foreign presence or worse, inferior.
