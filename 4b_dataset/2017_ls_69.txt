Through Increasing “Information Literacy” Capital and Habitus (Agency) the
Complementary Impact on Composition Skills when Appropriately Sequenced
By
Timothy Karas
Abstract

Through a case study approach of a cohort of community college students at a
single community college, the impact on success rates in composition courses was
analyzed based on the sequence of completing an information literacy course. Two
student cohorts were sampled based on completing an information literacy course prior
to, or concurrently with a college composition course. Secondly, student perception
related to their attitude concerning their information literacy skills was gathered.
I pose the question, “What is the effect of information literacy instruction prior to
composition coursework”? Specifically, sequencing information literacy instruction prior
to composition courses improves student success rates and composition skills. The
academic environment is rapidly changing to increased focus on centralized achievement
metrics within a decentralized California community college system. My research
question is framed through literature reviewed on three themes, managerialism, cultural
capital and habitus, and information literacy and composition theory.
The research will reveal that sequencing of information literacy instruction prior
to college composition courses positively impacted the composition course success rates.
Student perception of their information literacy skills was universally high regardless of
prior instruction received.

CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION
In a world of increasing interconnectedness, communication, and information, it

is imperative that people have the skills to navigate, critically analyze, and articulate
reasoning in multiple modalities and audiences. Many students in the community college
system have experienced marginalization (economic, gender, racial, ethnic, orientation).
Marginalization perpetuates the digital (information) and literacy (composition) divides.
Community college can be a change agent in bridging the divide through mindful
applications of instruction in these areas (Artman, 2010; Jacobs, 2009; Mackey &
Jacobson, 2004).

Statement of the Problem
In this study, I contend that students who have acquired understanding of the
principles and concepts associated with information literacy have increased habitus
(agency) and more cultural capital over those who do not. An underlying assumption in
information literacy is that an information literate person is beneficial to society and that
socio-economic issues affect literacy (Congress, 1991; IFLA, 2002). A constructivist
approach could provide valuable perspective on the impacts of student success in
composition courses based on the sequence of learning information literacy skills.
I approach the issue from the concept of cultural capital and habitus. According to
Bourdieu (1986), power is generated both culturally and symbolically, ever presently
legitimized through the interaction of agency and structure. The main way this happens
is through what he called habitus or socialized norms or tendencies that guide behavior
and thinking. Habitus is neither a result of free will, nor determined by structures, but

!

2!

created by a kind of interplay between the two over time. Bourdieu’s concept of cultural
capital referred to the collection of symbolic elements that one acquires through being
part of a particular social class. Cultural capital is a major source of social inequality.
Certain forms of cultural capital are valued over others, and can help or hinder one’s
social mobility just as much as income or wealth.
To explore the impact of increased cultural capital and habitus on success, I would
conduct a content analysis using text coding to understand from their perspective the
factors influencing their success in composition courses. The questions probe the impact
of learning information literacy skills; however, through dialog other factors may arise.
These factors in the end could turn out to be of greater impact than the original query. A
constructivist approach attributes value to multiple meanings in the creation of
knowledge. All the strands discussed above could lead to a rich understanding to the
problem.
In particular, in this study the following research question is investigated:
Is there a relationship between the accumulation of information literacy capital
prior to composition courses and student’s subsequent success?
From the main question, two sub questions arose:
What are the various composition course success rates sequenced to information
literacy coursework?
How do undergraduate students describe their experiences of the study of
information literacy in higher education?

!

3!
In this study, I pose the question, what is the effect of “information literacy

instruction prior to composition coursework?” My hypothesis is that sequencing
information literacy instruction prior to composition courses improves student success
rates and composition skills. The academic environment is rapidly changing to increased
focus on centralized achievement metrics within a decentralized California community
college system (Hom, 2008; Lay, 2010). In this study, I frame the research question
through literature reviewed on three themes: managerialism, cultural capital and habitus,
and information literacy and composition theory.
Through the lens of a historical case study I will use two methods to examine the
effect of information literacy coursework on student success. I will conduct a
quantitative analysis of historical student success data comparing success rates in an
English composition course and information literacy course. A cohort will be formed of
the students enrolled in the information literacy course in the 2012-2013 academic year.
The cohort success in English composition will be measured compared to non-cohort
students. The comparison data will be complied at three points: based on the cohort
taking English composition concurrently, 1 year after, or 2 years after completion of the
information literacy course. Secondly, I coded 6 years of student surveys to examine
student perception related to their information literacy skills. My base argument
concerns the impact of prior instruction in information literacy on student success rates in
a composition course.
Much of the impetus of managerialism is to impact real-world problems and
actions have consequences. Collecting data into tables or scorecards where institutions or
individuals are ranked which are linked to funding reinforces that actions have

!

4!

consequences (Deem, 2005). The impact of management principles and the changing
ethos of students as consumers contribute a significant control mechanism of the system
of offering curriculum. Biesta (2004) contended there is no direct relationship in
accountability between educational institutions and students; there is only an indirect
link. The students’ role is marginalized to solely consumers of education. The
relationship has become less a political relationship, where citizens and government work
together for the common good, than a consumerist relationship with students purchasing
an educational product. The relationship has increasingly turned to an economic
association, where the state is provider and the taxpayer is consumer of public services.
Institutions adapt to auditing rules, rather than the rules following educational best
practices. This system of accountability by rules creates a complex web where measures
are nothing more than metrics used to provide funding (Biesta, 2004). In higher
education, increased attention on student success metrics and “innovative” programs
based on sequenced coursework are being implemented without challenging assumptions
related to the nature of accountability measures and the changing relationship of students
to the educational system. Information literacy and composition theory literature have
not addressed the effect of managerialism on curricular offerings.
My base argument concerns the impact on student success rates in a composition
course based on the sequence of learning information literacy skills. In this study, I will
use quantitative analysis to assert a corollary relationship between student success rates in
composition course and information literacy. In the qualitative portion, I will focus on
isolating perceptions that affect the success rates in the composition course irrespective or
compounded by the sequencing of information literacy skills. Through my research, I

!

5!

will illustrate the power of leveraging to skills, composition, and information literacy to
achieve greater student success and increased cultural capital. Ultimately, achieving
information literacy skills improves the quality of life to make knowledgeable judgments,
such as purchasing a house, employment decisions, investing, and voting. A thriving
democracy is built on the foundation of an information literate citizenry (Brose, 2004).

Background
In the early 2000s, the California Community College System’s (113 colleges)
commitment to information literacy rapidly expanded. The Statewide Academic Senate
approved information literacy as a locally developed graduation requirement, and the
State Chancellor’s Office and Board of Governors approved regulatory language
mandating an information literacy graduation requirement (Academic Senate, 2002). At
the penultimate step of adoption, the California State Department of Finance blocked the
regulatory language citing negative financial impact to the state (Academic Senate,
2002). This decision solidified the current regulatory landscape of information literacy
implementation as a solely localized item at each college without any system wide
mandates (Brose, 2004).
Collaboration between the composition and information literacy disciplines to
improve student success is not well documented. This may be due to the common reality
of disciplines working in silos, where gathering information and collaboration with
faculty outside of one’s discipline is not considered due to lack of awareness (Ivey,
2003).

!

An underlying assumption in information literacy is that an information literate

person is beneficial to society and that socio-economic issues affect literacy (Shelley,
1998). A constructivist approach could provide valuable perspective on the impacts of
student success in composition courses based on the sequence of learning information
literacy skills. Within a hegemonic educational system where historically marginalized
groups have been disproportionally hindered, lower success can result in detachment
from school, deviant actions, and fewer opportunities in life (Goodman, 2010). The
concepts of cultural capital and habitus provide powerful tools to understand
performance, self-perception, and community within a hegemonic society.

Research Methodology
Creswell (2009) summarized that case studies are bound by time and activity.
The researcher collects detailed information over a sustained period of time. Stake
(1995) observed that case study research is concerned with the complexity and particular
nature of the case in question. Case study research is valuable in circumstances of
complex issues, to extend or add to previous research through detailed contextualized
analysis of a limited number of conditions or events and their associations. Eisenhardt
(1989) stated that case studies are
Particularly well suited to new research areas or research areas for which
existing theory seems inadequate. This type of work is highly
complementary to incremental theory building from normal science
research. The former is useful in early stages of research on a topic or
when a fresh perspective is needed, whilst the latter is useful in later stages
of knowledge. (pp.548-549)
My study is focused on a limited historical framework involving the examination
of student success data and content analysis of student feedback surveys distributed at the

!

7!

end of an information literacy course. A case study approach and research design allows
me to conduct a longitudinal study of a specific phenomenon.
I am a practitioner in the environment being a former discipline faculty member
and currently the supervisor for the library and learning skills departments. I contend that
being information literate is critical to a democratic society and can directly improve
success in composition coursework. My research design is comprised of two inquiry
methods to view my hypothesis from multiple positions. Lastly, my intent of the study is
to provide evidence to improve curriculum and course sequencing leading to increased
student success.
My interest in improving composition success rates through course sequencing
focuses on a practical issue, which is problematic, in that through action, being course
sequencing, quantifiable success rates improve. Secondly, through individual action
one’s capital is increased, which expands habitus that can be applied to future situations.
I draw upon the research of Simons (1980), Stake (1995), and Yin (1989) to frame my
dissertation. These researchers have provided techniques and mechanisms to structure
case study research design. The following five steps can define case study research:
•

Define the research question

•

Determine data-gathering and analysis techniques

•

Collect data

•

Evaluate and analyze the data

•

Prepare the report
My target is to illustrate the impact of student success rates in composition

!

8!

through sequencing instruction of information literacy skills. The target population is
based on student cohorts enrolled in a composition course.
A case study analysis will focus on the impact of sequencing information literacy
skills on success in composition courses and students’ self-reflection of the benefits of
attaining information literacy skills. Grounded on the quantitative data analysis of
success rates based on course sequencing and qualitative analysis of student comments, I
will outline improvements to the practice of course sequencing and increasing students’
“capital”.
Yin (1989) defined case study as “an empirical inquiry that investigates a
contemporary phenomenon within its real-life context; when the boundaries between
phenomenon and context are not clearly evident; and in which multiple sources of
evidence are used" (p. 23). Case study method is a favored and traditional approach to
the study of design practice (Hinnells, 1993; Svengren, 1993).
The use of this method becomes essential as Patton (1990) stated, "case studies
are particularly valuable when the evaluation aims to capture individual differences or
unique variations from one program setting to another, or from one program experience
to another" (p. 54). A center theme of this study is to analyze student achievement and
reflections in relation to different program (course sequencing) situations.
The outcome of the research provides evidence for change in practice. This
action leads to modifications in curriculum design and delivery. Vidgen and Barr (1997)
developed a blending of the traditional approaches to case study and action research.
Their focus was Information System Design. They labeled their method action case.
This method is comprised of elements from action research that focuses on practitioner

!

9!

research for social and organizational change and case study research focusing on
knowledge gained through understanding findings (Vidgen & Barr, 1997). The
leveraging of the two methods into a blended form provides a powerful footing for this
study. Mertler (2006) identified an observational case study includes a varying level of
researcher participation. At one end of the gamut the researcher acts completely as an
observer with no interaction with the participants being studies. In this study, I studied
participants through their written responses to questions and an analysis of student
achievement data.
Within the case study the first element used to test the hypothesis is quantitative
research analysis. The hypothesis tested is that students enrolled in an information
literacy course prior to, or at the same time as an English composition course will have
higher success rates than the general student population. Working with the Sparrow
College Institutional Research Department, success rates in English composition of a
student cohort will be analyzed to differentiate success rates, which is defined as
receiving a letter grade of C, B or A, based on the completion of an information literacy
course contiguous or following the English composition course. The success rates of the
cohort will be compared to non-cohort student success rates to determine impact of the
information literacy course on success rates in English composition. Mertler and Charles
(2011) described quasi-experimental design as embodying the characteristics of
experimental design with the exception of a random assignment of participants. The
design is diagramed as
Group 1 (Student Cohort) >> Treatment >> Results
Group 2 (All Students) >> No Treatment >> Results

!

10!
The scientific method is the basis for the overall structure of quantitative design

(Mertler & Charles, 2011). Deductive reasoning is used, where the researcher proposes a
hypothesis, or problem statement, data are collected to examine the problem, the
collected data are used for analysis, and conclusions or recommendations are stated
proving the hypothesis as true or false. Bryman (2008) described a case study that will
improve the understanding of conditions in which a hypothesis will or will not be held as
a critical case study.
The second method used to test the hypothesis is a heuristic review of student
responses to surveys conducted at the end of an information literacy course (LIB10) at
Sparrow College. Based on theories developed by Burton, Brundett, and Jones (2008), I
coded 4 years of student survey responses developing a schema to determine an impact
on habitus and capital by completing an information literacy course.
Significance of the Study
In this study, I seek to identify the attainment of information literacy skills as a
factor in the future success in English composition through increased habitus and cultural
capital. The strength of this study lies in the combination of examining student
reflections related to information literacy capital and the applied application in
sequencing an English composition course leading to increased student success.
An intended outcome of this study is to illuminate a gap in the research related to
the sequence of information literacy instruction and composition. My nominal
assumption is that students learning information literacy and composition skills in tandem
are most successful (Shelley, 1998). In this study, I posit that building information
literacy capital prior to composition leads to increased success. Lastly, in reviewing the

!

11!

literature, outside of strict academic frameworks, information literacy skills attainment
based on personal reflection, self-actualization, and increased agency has not been
studied.

Limitations of the Study
This study is based on student data and experiences at a single college. The focus
on a single college restricts the scope of conclusions drawn from this study. While the
college researched, Sparrow College, can be used as an exemplar of community colleges
in California’s system, comprehensive conclusions cannot be assumed. The research
provides an indicator for additional broad-based inquiry. Due to the methodological
framework of this study, results cannot be generalized to any other population.
The research is structured on a specific cohort of students. These were students
enrolled in an information literacy course at Sparrow College in the 2012-2013 academic
years. Cohort data were compiled showing 5 years of English composition course
success rates, 2 years prior to, and after the baseline 2012-2013 academic year, to
compare cohort success in English composition course (ENGL 1A) against the general
student population. Based on the research findings further multi-year cohort studies
would increase the significance of the results.
The overall findings of the study are significant to a cohort of students attending a
particular community college. The endemic environment, region, and other geographic
and societal factors cannot be overlooked. A suburban community college may have
factors affecting cultural capital attainment and civic engagement different from rural and
urban community colleges. These factors were outside the scope of this research study.

!

12!
A limitation of a single case study design is the lack of statistical generalizability.

This study did not have a goal of generalizability but one of understanding a complex
phenomenon.
Summary
In Chapter 1, I have identified the research problem regarding sequencing
information literacy instruction to improve success rates in composition. I identified subissues related to the building of capital by students thus constructing new level and
awareness of habitus (agency) to apply in civic engagement. I explored limiting factors
of the movement towards increased managerialism in community college education.
In Chapter 1, I have identified the goals of the research study as gathering,
analyzing, and reporting the self-reflection of student voices and the quantitative success
rate data related a cohort of students. I stated the significance of the study and its
limitations.

CHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE REVIEW

Introduction
In the literature review, I provide the backdrop for the multi-faceted framework
needed to analyze structures in United States higher education, specifically California
community colleges. In the review, I explore the concepts of cultural capital and habitus
created by Bourdieu. I investigate the central tenets of information literacy theory and
composition theory. These two discreet disciplines have shared beliefs systems. The
latent energy of the two disciplines can be aligned to increase success of students.
To ground this study, the literature review begins with a brief history of higher
education in the United States and then the California Community College System. This
grouping provides the parameters that frame this study and contextualize the results.
Following these sections, the focus is moved to the conceptions of information literacy
and composition theory. Building on the organization of the education system in the
United States and California and structure of attainment of skills and practices building
capital to be deployed by students to further success, I will examine the concept of
managerialsm by Biesta. Aspects of managerialsm provide barriers to learning and
equity. The literature review concludes with the theories of habitus and cultural capital.

Structural Environment: United States Educational System
The Declaration of Independence espoused many democratic ideals and a
powerful vision for an emerging country. The notions of equality, inalienable rights, and
life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness are codified in the Declaration. As noted by
Ellis (2000) the founding of the new American government was the work of a “relatively

!

14!

small number of leaders who knew each other, who collaborated, and collided with one
another” (p.13). Zinn (1999) cited Francis Jennings from the Revolutionary War period
describing the social landscape as a “multiplicity of variously oppressed and exploited
peoples who prey on each other” (p.88). Education would be a factor in forging a new
nation based on democratic principles. McClellan (1985) stated that the founding fathers
were the first Americans to emphasize formal education to facilitate national cohesion.
McClellan (1985) stated there was a “powerful urge to create a system of public
education that would contribute to the difficult task of nation building” (p.34) by the
founding fathers.
According to Beach (2006) the American educational system was founded on
principles of education for all citizens. I use the word citizen because the founders did
not believe in education for all. Rights were restrictive and only available to a fragment
of the total population residing in the United States. Barber (1998) argued that it was
Jefferson who contended that broad civic participation required education:
It remained clear to Jefferson to the end of his life that a theory of democracy
that is rooted in active participation and continuing consent by each generation of
citizens demands a civic pedagogy rooted in the obligation to educate all who
would be citizens. (p. 169)
To educate the population to promote civic engagement the promotion of
literacies (reading, writing, information) was vital. Without a literate electorate the
emerging nation state would flounder. The term information literacy was not used in the
founding period of the country or earlier educational literature; however, the elements
that embody information literacy are integral to the establishment of public education in
the United States.
According to Beach (2006) by the “18th and early 19th centuries, small one-room

!

15!

schoolhouses were numerous and education became more of a community-oriented
affair, although it was still predominately religious in outlook” (p.152). The primary
purpose of schooling was to indoctrinate the young into a “Protestant-republican
ideology” (Tyack & Hansot, 1982, p. 18) to inculcate religious faith and morality, while
encouraging participation in local communities, state organizations, and the growing
federal government. A republican idea of education was implicit in the Declaration of
Independence pronouncement of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness (General,
1776, para 2). An illiterate (reading, writing, information) society cannot prosper and
fulfill the preamble of the Constitution of the United States that
We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union,
establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense,
promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and
our Posterity… (United State Congress, 1776, para. 1)
An individual personifies these fundamental pronouncements through habitus and
the deployment of capital. A citizenry without the capability to select and evaluate
information would encounter difficulties making decisions to ensure the above founding
principles.
As reflected in Beach (2006), over the course of the 19th century, the common
school movement spread across the county and preached the virtues of social mobility,
individual responsibility, hard work, and morality. The movement was bound by a
meritocratic system in fulfillment of an aspirational rhetoric of the American dream. The
century saw increasing disparity of wealth, which eroded the egalitarian nature of the
educational system (Reese, 2000). Within this framework, American schools, especially
urban, were frontlines in a struggle by an amalgamation of interests each seeking a way
to security and prosperity for their children. Marginalized groups, such as racial

!

16!

minorities and middle-income families, championed the cause to increase access to
education. Access to school was a foundational step and solely not enough to succeed in
America. Funding was based on catchment areas; poor immigrant communities living,
for example, in Little Italy or Chinatown did not have the economic capital to compete
with established Anglo-Saxon communities.
Beach (2006) concluded in “light of the structural determinants of class, race, and
gender, the common schools were not really designed as democratic instruments for the
good of all” (p.154). Beach (2006) described the emerging system of schools as seeming
very much at the service of an elite cadre of wealthy men seeking to check the unruly
factions of the working class, immigrants, and racial minorities. The structural
determination and service to a wealthy elite of the common schools masked the deeper
issues plaguing American society. This undercurrent gestates “when diverse
socioeconomic and ethnic classes did mix within the public schools, there was little free
competition where institutional racism, concentrated social capital, and stark economic
inequality pervaded the political ecology of the school” (p.155). The idea of equity for
all children was not a foundational principle in educational planning. Equity was not in
the educational parlance of the period.
A great societal churning in the United States ultimately leading to the Civil War
encumbered the 19th century. Society was torn asunder. Horace Mann (1841), a leading
educational reformer, noted schools would be a rallying point for fellowship and
cooperation. This thinking linked to the egalitarian ethos of society planted by the
country’s founders. This pathway viewed schools as a means to force social cohesion
and sustain an open democratic society. Tyack and Hansot (1982) fortified the notion of

!

17!

cohesion that the common school movement was designed to “produce a homogenous
moral and civic order” (p.19). Within a society of increasing mobility and migration,
schools used their agency to assure fairness and reduce tensions of class and position.
Educators asserted that classroom equality would raise the poor and inhibit the power of
the wealthy (McClellan, 1985). This message was utopian, communal, and societal
divisions are omnipresent in schools; however, educators strive to mitigate conflict and
assert equality. Society was concerned with increasing cohesion to mitigate potential
conflicts in a rapidly urbanizing society with high levels of immigration. Education
remained segregated by race and equity was not present in educational discourse. This
was a period of time the first Historically Black Colleges and Universities were opened to
provide educational advancement to African Americans (Phillips, 2002). Given this
framework of segregation, an individual’s habitus and capital were marginalized. The
formation of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) provided an
opportunity for traditionally marginalized communities and individuals to acquire capital
and develop habitus through formal higher education. HBCUs increased societal
cohesion by being a counterweight to a segregated civic structure that restricted
individuals’ latent habitus and ability to acquire capital.
In the 20th century, groups of reformers, including John Dewey, Ella Flagg
Young, and Helen Keller, offered a retheorizing of the American educational system to
an expansive vision of democratic education built within the tradition of the radical
American Dream. Menand (2001) maintained the foundation of Dewey’s concept of
democracy as free association between individuals motivated by personal agency.

!

18!
Dewey (1962) perceived that schools could be the main agency of progressive

sociopolitical change. Dewey did not address power relations based on sociopolitical
segments surrounding class and ethnic-based interests. He tended to simplify or gloss
over these central tenets in his discourse, which were more focused on individual agency,
cooperation, and collective action (Beach, 2006). As Greene (1988) pointed out,
Dewey’s theories did not account for how matters of power include human agency,
education, and sociopolitical change as they involve notions of public space and public
good, which are not universal. Schutz (2001) noted that in systems of inequity schools
would struggle to “transform into agencies of democratic reform” (p. 7).
A student’s building of agency or habitus is fundamental to education. A
student’s increased capital and habitus can mitigate socioeconomic divisions to produce a
more democratic or egalitarian society. As noted by Greene (1988) notions of public
good is a contested space connected to agency and education. Within the contested space
issues of power and control are central.
The ability for individuals to access, evaluate, analyze, and take action based on
information can change households, neighborhoods, and society. Equality and equity
cannot be achieved without literacy. If an individual cannot read, write, or evaluate
information (critical thinking), they are marginalized from full civic engagement and
economic benefits. To mitigate matters of power and inequality, building information
literacy capital and habitus facilitates educational attainment, the creation of social bonds,
and active civic engagement.

Structural Environment: California Community Colleges
The 1960 Master Plan for Higher Education (California State Department of

Education, 1960) preserved and strengthened a three-pronged higher education structure
for California based on locally controlled and funded community colleges, regionally
focused California State Universities, and a statewide research-focused University of
California. As noted by the Legislative Analyst’s Office (2009) and Douglass (2010), the
reality is that innovation and the development of the higher education system in
California has broadly ceased to exist. Douglass (2010) stated, California “needs to think
big, to imagine a more robust and competitive economy, with higher education as one of
its essential building blocks” (p. 2). The Legislative Analys’ts Office (2009) mentioned,
“key higher education funding decisions have been made without the benefit of clear
state policy guidance” (para. 8), which implies a rudderless response to needs, a lack of
vision for higher education, and marginalization of collective impact and cooperation.
In California, the state education code codified four requirements for community
colleges: lower-division education coursework leading to an associates’ degree and/or
transfer to a 4 year institution, career technical education (vocational), basic skills
(remedial education), and lifelong learning opportunities (adult education). The Master
Plan for Higher Education established community colleges to be a comprehensive
institution and to admit all adults without regard of prior education (i.e., high school
diploma or equivalent) or any other aspect of background or ability (California State
Department of Education, 1960).
The California Community College System is the largest system of higher
education in the world, with 72 districts comprised of 113 colleges, and 70 educational

!

20!

centers. The California community colleges are publicly supported, locally controlled,
through an elected Board of Trustees, districts that provide basic skills (pre-collegiate),
career technical education (workforce), and transfer programs to approximately 2.4
million students (California Community College Chancellor’s Office, 2016).
The higher education system is moving towards a consumerist model of delivery.
Leaders are faced with providing education in an environment where they are effectively
running a business whose income is dependent on their success in attracting customers
within competitive universal education markets (Simkins, 2000). Increasing student
success and achievement metrics accountability becomes a perpetual demand for both
educational administrators and instructors. Government educational policy is
increasingly holding educational leaders and instructors accountable for student
achievement and success factors leading to profound procedure and policy changes at the
institutional level (Biesta, 2004; Deem, 2005). A central assumption in my research is
the impact of sequencing courses to increase student success rates and composition skills.
The focus on success rates correlates to the increasing need by state institutions to tie
learning to achievement metrics.
Based on Biesta (2004), I assert that educational attainment has swiftly moved from
concerns about the common good and civic responsibility to economic levers. The
government and public view the state, or increasingly for-profit companies, as service
providers to educational consumers. The Committee for Economic Development (2013)
stated,
If current trends continue, more states are likely to surpass California’s level of
postsecondary attainment in the workforce. At the same time, there are already
signs that California businesses will not have all the well-prepared employees
they will need to remain nationally and internationally competitive. (p. 10)

!

21!

This has pressured legacy institutions, publically funded institutions of higher
education, to re-position themselves and rationalize scale and transferability to provide
accountability to taxpayers for services rendered. Biesta (2004) contended that there is
no direct relationship in accountability between educational institutions and students;
there is only an indirect link. The indirectness is caused by the lack of an opportunity for
students to participate in an open discourse concerning education.
Deem (2005) believed at its core this is the ideology of quantitative indicators of
achievement, quasi-market completion for students based on choice, increased regulation,
and less public funding. This ideology produces a system of institutional accountability
to regulator and/or funding agencies, not to the public or students. The key stakeholders
becomes entities providing financial resources to institutions. Institutions adapt to
auditing rules, rather than the rules following educational best practices. This system of
accountability by rules creates a complex web where measures are nothing more than
metrics used to provide funding. This ideology is reflected in publications by
government and think-tanks, like the Committee for Economic Development (2013),
which summarized “for California, as for the nation as a whole, rising standards of living
depend upon process improvements in the production of goods and services” (p.5) and
“Meeting California’s current and future needs for higher education opportunity and for
economic competitiveness requires that postsecondary institutions improve their success
rates” (p.4).

Information Literacy
To provide a framework, I will briefly summarize the historical outline of

information literacy initiatives and practices in the State of California. In 1998, the
American Library Association Presidential Committee on Information Literacy provided
a definition: “To be information literate, a person must be able to recognize when
information is needed and have the ability to locate, evaluate, and use effectively the
needed information” (American Library Association, 1998, para 3).!!ALA!President!

(American!Library!Association,!2016,!p.!33). Being the primary professional
association for library and information scientists’ membership denotes agreement with
core values, code of professional ethics, and common definitions. The Committee!on!
Information!Literacy!definition of information literacy was widely accepted within the
library and information science profession.
Two principal documents underpin the professional code in library and
information science; these being the Library Bill of Rights (American Library
Association, 1996) and the Librarian Code of Ethics (American Library Association,
2008).!The Library Bill of Rights states, “resources should be provided for the interest,
information, and enlightenment of all people of the community” (American Library
Association, 1996) and the Librarian Code of Ethics requires professionals “in a political
system grounded in an informed citizenry, we are members of a profession explicitly

!

23!

committed to intellectual freedom and the freedom of access to information” (American
Library Association, 2008)!
As outlined in the California State Budget 2015-16: Higher Education (California
State Department of Finance, 2015), California public higher education is a tiered system,
made up of the University of California (10 campuses), the California State University
(23 campuses), and the California Community Colleges (113 campuses). Beginning in
1995, the California State University System endorsed information competence skills as
essential for graduates and funded pilot projects to institute information competency
curricula and assessment strategies (Commission, 1995). In 1996, the California
Community College State Chancellor’s Office identified information competency as a
system-wide priority leading to adoption by the State Academic Senate for California
Community Colleges of a resolutions 9.01 and 9.91 supporting information competency
(Academic Senate, 2003). Working with this basic underlying assumption, many
universities and colleges begin piloting localized models and planning initiatives (Brose,
2004).
In the early 2000s the California Community College System commitment to
information literacy rapidly evolved with the 2002 Statewide Academic Senate Plenary
adopted resolution 9.91 (Academic Seante, 2003) requiring information competency as a
locally designed graduation requirement and the State Chancellor’s Office and Board of
Governors approval of regulatory language mandating an information competency
graduation requirement. At the penultimate step to statewide implementation, the
California State Department of Finance blocked the regulatory language citing negative
financial impact to the State. This decision that solidified the current regulatory

!

24!

landscape of information literacy implementation is a solely localized item at each
College without any system-wide mandates (Academic Senate, 2002; Brose, 2004).
An underlying assumption in information literacy is that an information literate
person is beneficial to society and that socio-economic issues affect literacy. The
Presidential Committee on Information Literacy highlighted this belief stating,
to say that information literacy is crucial to effective citizenship is simply to say
it is central to the practice of democracy. Any society committed to individual
citizens in order to protect personal liberties and to guard its future. (American
Library Association, 1998, para.18)
Information has value to society, and individuals holding this value can use it to
participate in a democratic society. The Framework for Information Literacy for Higher
Education (Association, 2016) addressed this notion as the
value may also be leveraged by individuals and organizations to effect change and
for civic, economic, social, or personal gains. Experts also understand that the
individual is responsible for making deliberate and informed choices about when
to comply with and when to contest current legal and socioeconomic practices
concerning the value of information. (Association, 2016, para. 17)!
!
Information literacy is universally important in all cultures and communities. The
International Federation of Library Associations (IFLA) advocates at an international
level the fundamental right of access to information and an information literate society.
IFLA (2006) stated, information literacy
empowers people in all walks of life to seek, evaluate, use and create information
effectively to achieve their personal, social, occupational and educational goals. It
is a basic human right in a digital world and promotes social inclusion of all
nations. (para. 2)
The world is becoming increasingly interconnected through technology, such as
mobile telephony and social media, and information flow and production increases at
accelerating rates in this “environment of rapid individual, community and workplace

!

25!

change, a static body of knowledge cannot equip people with the capabilities to adapt,
thrive or advance” (IFLA, 2006, para 1). Information literacy and composition skills are
essential in a world structured around communicating and responding to complex ideas
and problems.
Beginning in the 1970s the position of libraries in the realm of literacy skills
significantly increased through information literacy activism (Mutch, 1997; OwusuAnsah, 2004). Librarians, from university to school, responded by magnifying the
discourse, scholarship, and theoretical practices concerning information literacy (Rader,
2002; Virkus, 2003). The United States ranks fifth in adult reading literacy skills,
compared to other industrialized nations, through the practical application of information
literacy skills. Worldwide, there are 774 million adults who are illiterate in their native
languages (ProLiteracy, 2008; Kavanaugh, Puckett, & Tatar 2013).
The Association of College and Research Libraries (2004) argued that
information literacy “forms the basis for lifelong learning” (para. 2) by ensuring
“individuals have the intellectual abilities of reasoning and critical thinking” (para. 6) that
can be applied to their “roles as informed citizens and members of communities” (para.
6). Through the work of professional organizations, such as the American Library
Association, libraries promoted themselves as key institutions for universal access to
current information, continuous updating of information resources and formation of
information literacy skills for workforce development, civic engagement and personal
enrichment (American Library Association, 1998; McShane, 2011).
The promotion and defending of free and universal access to information is not
limited to the United States; the Library Association of Australia’s (ALIA) Statement on

!

26!

Information Literacy for all Australians announced, “to promote the free flow of
information and ideas in the interest of all Australians and a thriving culture, economy
and democracy” (ALIA, 2006, para. 1). The 1979 ALIA information literacy policy
statement third revision states,
rapid social change, the emphasis of lifelong learning, the increasing rate of
technological change and the movement towards an information-based society are
factors which suggest, as never before, that literacies are an essential instrument
for effective participation in society. (ALIA, 2006, para. 1)
Literacy is a complex skill comprised of factors related to values, social
engagement, economic prosperity, and cultural capital (Luke & Freebody, 1999;
McShane, 2011). McShane (2011) examined the current debates surrounding “schoolbased literacy as a battleground” (p. 385). To simply frame information literacy as one
solely related to competence and skill building fails to recognize the long history of
challenges over the issues related to literacy education. Information literacy instruction
implies systemic shaping of social, cultural, and economic capitals and investment in
generational habitus of communities and cultures. Furthermore, access to technologies
and information objects and to the organizations where these tools and information
objects are available for use (e.g., university, worksites, libraries) have individualistic,
civic, and societal impact (Luke & Freebody, 1999; McShane, 2011).
According to Bennett, Rhine, and Flickinger (2000), reading contributes to
knowledge about current events. Reading facilitates engagement in and attention to the
contemporary world. People who read regularly can more easily assimilate new
information. Bennett et al. (2000) stated reading is the core of civic literacy. People who
read more frequently can more easily decode information, thus contributing to political

!

27!

participation, which is critical to democracy. Reading is built on capital (social and
cultural) acquired and applied through agency to engagement with civic affairs.
Lupton (2008) described generic skills as “processes, skills and knowledge that
often include written communication, information literacy” (p. 400). The literacy agenda
has been informed by the increased recognition relationship of information literacy as a
generic skill. This has provided fodder to the creation of curricula and academic
programming. Information literacy cannot exist in a void; it is a lived action.
Information literacy practices overlap and interweave with composition skills.
Composition involves creating new knowledge through a process of searching, selecting,
and evaluating information. These are fundamental aspects of information literacy skills.
Information literacy is a hollow set of skills without the content (for example, written
communication) to make it a lived experience (Lupton, 2008; Mackey & Jacobson,
2004; Artman, Frisicaro-Pawlowski, & Monge, 2010).
Despite an increased interest in information literacy skills in higher education, it
is surprising that little empirical research has been conducted on the relationship between
composition and information literacy. As stated by Breivik (1998), “the best place to
start information literacy planning is with general education or core curriculum” (p. 44).
By segregating the research process from the writing process, we have obscured the fact
and thereby impoverished both the writing process and the research process. This
segregation reflects institutional divisions, but not the reality of student work (Artman,
Frisicaro-Pawlowski, & Monge, 2010).
Collaboration between the two disciplines to improve student success is not well
documented. Ivey (2003) wrote “a review of the literature over the past decade identified

!

28!

many existing information literacy programs… it failed to find information about the
roles of partners and the collaborative process of planning” (p. 100). This may be due to
the common reality of disciplines working in silos, where gathering information and
collaboration with faculty outside of one’s department is not considered due to lack of
awareness. McGuiness (2006) wrote, “to date, the actual voices of faculty have been
featured to only a marginal extent… dealing with information literacy in particular” (p.
573). As stated by Jacobs (2009),
Information literacy cannot exist in a vacuum; it has to be part of a lived
response to research. In other words, theory and practice must combine with our
experiences to create a pedagogy whose goal is to fully engage students, and
ourselves, to work with them to achieve their goals, and also, perhaps, some goals
that they don’t know that they have. (p. 73)
The connection and collaboration between faculty and librarians is palpable.
Disciplines are operating from a space of introspection. In this study, I will analyze
through student comments the intersection of information literacy and composition
through increased student habitus.

Composition Theory
Ivey (2003) and McGuiness (2006) expressed that documentation to improve
student success through collaboration of the composition and information literacy
disciplines is lacking. This may be due to the common reality of disciplines working in
silos, where gathering information and collaboration with faculty outside of one’s
discipline is not considered due to lack of awareness. Artman, Frisicaro-Pawlowski, and
Monge (2010) summarized the goal is to create a lexicon of understanding to meld theory
and practice informed by multiple disciplines to fully engage students to achieve their

!

29!

goals. This is further implied in Hager, Holland, and Beckett’s (2002) research that
highlighted how generic skills overlap and interweave producing something more than
their individual components. They raised “the danger of treating them [generic skills] as
a simple mechanistic list of separate traits” (p. 7).
Professors make multiple assumptions concerning students’ prior learning and
skills when assigning composition. Assumptions like the ability to develop a thesis
statement, locate supporting documentation, evaluate information, and synthesis are
applied by professors. Furthermore, common convention of the specific discipline may be
applied. All of this is embedded within the frame of academic writing (MacKinnon &
Manathunga, 2003).
Many of these assumptions overlap with information literacy skills. Building on
the assumptions identified by MacKinnon and Manathunga (2003) that examined
assumptions professors make about students’ abilities in assigning essays, I will examine
student success in English composition based upon the acquisition of information literacy
skills. In this study, I will examine that through sequenced learning these competencies
can be leveraged to increase student success.

Managerialism
After a multi-year initiative to have a statewide information literacy requirement
in California community colleges was not adopted by the Board of Governors the issue
became completely localized. With this decision the effort to achieve an information
literacy requirement pivoted from a collective action from the field on a single entity, the
California Community Colleges Chancellor’s Office, to diffused action at each college to

!

30!

inform local policy. A state mandate would result in uniformity and mitigate localized
issues and politics. Without a uniform expectation each college jurisdiction becomes a
competitor with varied graduation requirements. At the local environment every issue is
influenced by “new managerialism” (Biesta, 2004 p. 236). The concept of new
managerialism can be understood as an ideological configuration of ideas and practices
recently brought to bear on public service organizations, management, and delivery, often
at the behest of governments or funding agencies. At its core this is the ideology of
quantitative indicators of achievement, quasi-market completion for students based on
choice, increased regulation, and less public funding. The wider notion of business
analytics is a mechanism to implement, measure, and guide new managerialism (Biesta,
2004).
Primary sources of new managerial ideology in higher education is through
increased prescriptiveness codified in government policies and regulations on higher
education, which emphasize quantitative indicators of performance and service metrics,
linked to funding mechanisms (Biesta, 2007). Within the California Community College
environment, visible markers of this concept are the annual Student Success Scorecard,
Transfer Velocity indicators, and published institutional effectiveness measures. In 2015
institutional effectiveness measures were implemented “focused on accreditation, fiscal
viability, student performance, and compliance with state and federal guidelines”
(California Community College Chancellor’s Office, 2016, para 1). Funding patterns are
shifting to throughputs, like number of student educational plans completed, to fund
counseling services. The Student Success and Support Program Funding Guidelines
(California Community College Chancellor’s Office, 2014) explicitly state funding is

!

31!

determined by the “number of students who received orientation; assessment; counseling,
advising” (p. 4.2)
Deem (2005) and Biesta (2004, 2007) argued that elected leaders and government
appointments emphasized practices and philosophies from the corporate sector for
adoption by the public sector based on the assumption that the latter are superior to the
former. Kirkpatrick and Lucio (1995) studied the association of compulsory external
accountability measures, including benchmarking, scorecards, indicators, and
performance management, with managerialism in education. The new managerialism
emphasis of devising quasi-markets for public services, which may include education,
auditing quality of service and employee performance were explored by Farrell and
Morris (2003) in the field of service delivery pursuit of efficiency, and Vogt (2001)
identified workforce restructuring to enable more teamwork and flexibility. These
practices may be applied across the public sector, including education.
This has put profound pressure on departments to maximize their curriculum and
course sequences to produce results that can be displayed on system-wide league tables
of success and retention rates. If departments cannot raise rates, they are vulnerable to
elimination. With no state mandate for information literacy programs and decisions
being solely determined at the local college level, information literacy programs need to
advocate for their development and continuation within the language of new
managerialism (Deem, 2005; Power, 1997).
According to Parry (2010), California had the “largest and most coherent system of
higher education in the United States” (p.223). The current framework was launched in
1960 with the Master Plan for Education (California State Department of Education,

!

32!

1960). The master plan served California residents well for many decades; however,
mounting policy and taxation changes have increasingly stressed the framework (Parry,
2010). Approaching the 50th Anniversary of the Master Plan for Education the
Legislative Analyst’s Office concluded, “overall, the state’s vision for its higher
education system is less cohesive than it was a half century ago. There is little methodical
state oversight and planning, and the linkage between state budget decisions and policy
goals is weak” (Legislative Analyst’s Office, 2009, para. 11).
Douglass (2010) highlighted a phenomenon called the “Brazilian Effect: when
public higher education cannot keep pace with growing public demand for access and
programs” (p.5). For-profit institutions fill the opportunity gap left by public institutions’
incapability to address capacity issues. In this scenario for-profit institutions rapidly
grow and become large providers of education. He coined this term after finding more
than 50% of Brazilian students enroll in for-profit institutions. His research found other
countries worldwide, such as Korea and Poland, echoing this stratagem. The growth of
for-profit institutions shifts underlying values and assumptions concerning higher
education. It questions philosophical paradigms of the government’s responsibility,
equity, and access to higher education.
The Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) is a triennial
international survey that aims to evaluate education systems worldwide by testing the
skills and knowledge of 15-year-old students. The most recent 2012 assessment in
reading, mathematics, and science included 65 countries (PISA, 2012). The PISA
Snapshot of performance in mathematics, reading, and science (2012) listed the aggregate
results for all 65 countries sorted by performance above and below Organization for

!

33!

Economic and Co-operation and Development (OECD) mean performance. In all three
areas, reading, mathematics, and science, the United States was below the mean
performance.
The National Center for Educational Statistics (NCES) documented the below
average performance of students in the United States compared to their international
peers. The NCES publication Performance of U.S. 15-Year-Old Students in
Mathematics, Science, and Reading Literacy in an International Context (2013) reported
the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) results. The United States
ranked below or at the average of Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD) countries. Specifically, in mathematics the United States average
score was 481, which was lower than the OECD average of 494, in science the United
States average score was 497, which was lower than the OECD average of 501, and in
reading the United States average score was 498, which was not measurably different
from the OECD average of 496 (pp.9-10).
To frame Douglass’ concepts, I argue that the halcyon days of California public
education are over where California was among the top tier in student achievement and
access. Currently, California ranks in the lowest quartile among States in most
educational categories. The National Education Association (NEA) Report (2014),
Ranking and Estimates 2013-2014, documents California’s ranking 46th in State and
Local Government Expenditures as Percent of Direct General Expenditures (p. 53) total
and California’s 38th ranking in Current Expenditures for all Public K-12 Schools per
Students in Fall Enrollments, 2012-2013 (p. 55).
In response, the state has moved towards implementing a consumer-centric model

!

34!

for education. In higher education increased attention on student success metrics and
“innovative” programs based on sequenced coursework are being implemented without
challenging assumptions related to the nature of accountability measures and the
changing relationship of students to the educational system. Hegemonic structures, like
regional accrediting agency and the Federal Department of Education, provide
impediments for institutions to challenge the shift to a consumerist model. Faculty and
individuals through published research, articles, and editorials have challenged this
movement. The Committee for Economic Development’s (CED) Boosting California’s
Postsecondary Education Performance (2013) stated,
California’s postsecondary education will have to achieve better results with the
resources it already has and use new public and private resources to leverage
productivity increases through improvements in practice, policy and educational
innovation. Existing institutions must boost performance to become more
productive and more effective. (p. 4)
Further reflected in the CED report are conclusions that “education is also
associated with better health, and with more involvement in society and greater
satisfaction with life broadly” (p. 5) and “our state’s [California] performance in higher
education access and attainment has slipped relative to other states and nations, including
many of our economic competitors” (p. 2). The model of education is under fundamental
pressures to change and adapt. In my study, I will demonstrate how curriculum
sequencing can increase student success rates and raise students’, cultural capital and
habitus.
Cultural Capital and Habitus
Community college students are a heterogeneous group with exposure to various
levels of marginalization or alternative social constructs. With increasing globalization,

!

35!

changing workforce skills from manual to intellectual, and increased technology-based
services it is imperative students develop a high level of information and communication
literacies. Otherwise, students will not be successful in their academic goals and face
increased marginalization and lack of mobility.
The ability to communicate and understand information effectively is rarely a
deliberate learning experience. From birth we are bombarded with information and
communication leading us to adapt and learn intuitively. Formal education attempts to
teach us these skills in settings that do not recognize the capital we bring to the
classroom. The concepts of cultural capital and habitus stated by Bourdieu (1977)
provided a framework to examine a student’s information literacy and composition skills.
My research project will build on the framework created by Bourdieu to
demonstrate the impact of gaining information literacy skills on increasing cultural
capital. Cultural capital is the accumulation of scholastic wealth such as skill attainment,
literacy, and course success. The ability to navigate an information rich environment is a
cultural totem that is valued by society, provides status, and leads to advancement in the
field. Students employ habitus, created by their conscious and unconscious actions and
perceptions, to achieve social mobility and academic progress.
Bourdieu’s concept of cultural capital refers to the collection of symbolic elements
that one acquires through being part of a particular social class. The valuation of certain
types of cultural capital contributes to social inequality. Social mobility and economic
opportunities can be accelerated or obstructed through the accumulation of specific types
of cultural capital in much the same way as wealth impacts mobility.

!

36!
I approach the issue from the concept of cultural capital and habitus. According to

Bourdieu (1986), the forces of structure and agency continuously interact to create and
legitimatize symbolic and cultural power. The mechanism for this to occur is through
habitus, which is the collection of dispositions, norms, or customs that guide behavior
and thinking. Habitus is neither a result of free will, nor determined by structures, but
created by a kind of interplay between the two over time. Furthermore, habitus is not
static and predetermined; individuals with opportunity, information, and access can
consciously or unconsciously break from their generational history and forge a new path.
Altered habitus through increased information seeking and composition skills enhances
scholastic wealth and academic mobility.
Bourdieu and Passeron (1990) interpreted habitus as the “tastes, habits, norms,
values, and traditions of a particular society or community of likeminded agents” (pp. 5265). An individual acquires habitus as a member of a specific social class or group
through agency, perception, and action. Significantly, Bourdieu and Passeron (1990)
reasoned that agency, either individual or group, operates at an unconscious level
profoundly affecting the experience and responses to environmental factors and social
interactions. Habitus, in this study, is manifest in the capital students have acquired
through information literacy coursework. As noted by Moore (2012) cultural capital “is
not always fixed per se: rather it is dynamic and fluid depending on the socio-cultural
context” (p.68). A student’s information literacy habitus can be dynamic and fluid prior
to higher education. Upon entering college students’ information literacy habitus are
bound by the colleges structures and “inculcated by the possibilities and impossibilities…
opportunities and prohibitions inscribed by the objective conditions” (Bourdieu &

!

37!

Passeron, 1990, p.54).
West, Fleming, and Finnegan (2013) supported the view that Bourdieu provided a
social reproduction structure for considering student narratives that shapes how students
behave, speak, think, and communicate one with another. This encompasses the concept
of habitus, which represents a kind of embodied agency where ideas, practices, and ways
of being in the world are in play. West et al. (2013) and Bourdieu and Wacquant (1992)
stated habitus consists of a frame created by mental and temporal experience and insights
accumulated within an individual.
As noted by James and Bloomer (2001) habitus is a “durable but transposable set
of dispositions, representing the physical and mental embodiment of the social but at the
same time offering choices” (James & Bloomer 2001, p. 34). The past and present
experiences in the world through familial, individual, cultural, and public interactions
influence the notion of habitus. Habitus is always in flux, being remade and
reconstructed based on the surrounding environment, actions, and individual choices.
Both success and failure contribute the evolution of habitus. James, Busher, and Suttill
(2015) stated habitus is not just a set of attitudes and values, but is embodied in terms of
how people feel and think. James, Busher, and Suttill (2015) and Czerniewicz and
Brown (2013) expanded on this notion by emphasizing habitus is structured, not random,
in that it is fashioned by experiences and shapes future actions.
For Bourdieu, individuals have always been positioned relative to others but these
positions vary at different times, in different places, and are continuously altered.
Although individual behaviors follow a pre-determined or unconscious pattern, habitus
includes the “permanent capacity for invention” (Bourdieu, 2004, p. 63).

!

38!
Habitus is not fixed certainties, but rather a system open to possibilities, aptitudes,

and change. As individuals encounter the unfamiliar, habitus can change and evolve
incorporating new information. In Bourdieu’s terms, the habitus is in process of ongoing
change and individuals can change the trajectory of their life experiences (Maclachlan &
Tett, 2007). To further elaborate Holt (2008) specified habitus as the “embodied
materialization of individuals’ capitals, or internalized capital” (p. 232) and Bourdieu and
Thompson (1991) defined habitus is expressed by individual’s via embodied agency,
largely subconsciously. Jenkins (1992) identified three key ways within Bourdieu’s
notion of habitus in which natures are utilized: first that habitus affords an “unconscious
framework and resource” (p.76) to organize and an individuals’ engagement with the
humanity; second, as a “way of being” (p. 76) that is inclusive of conduct, speech, and
presentation; and third as ‘”tendency, propensity or inclination tastes” (p. 76).
Czerniewicz, and Brown (2013) contended habitus could be “empirically viewed
obliquely by asking students how they see themselves, and how they see the role of
information literacy in their learning and social lives” (p.47). Jenkins (1992) concluded
higher education is the social area that students’ habitus must be measured. Social
habitus is built upon circles of friends, groups, memberships, and social networks.
Higher education and college life is a network comprised of many different groupings,
(e.g., classmates), and memberships (e.g., honor societies). As a social arena higher
education operates as a relatively autonomous field. This influences the concept from
Czerniewicz and Brown (2013) that habitus can be empirically viewed by asking
questions of students themselves. A student’s social habitus incorporates higher
education, which includes coursework that can be measured through direct student

!

39!

feedback. The structure of habitus is either reinforced or altered based on constantly
changing experiences. In my study, I will analyze how a student’s habitus is modified by
the exposure to formal information
Jawitz (2009) described, “each individual…carries a habitus which is a collection
of techniques, references, a set of beliefs, formed out of past experiences and
socialization processes” (p. 602). As noted by Jawitz, the “concept of habitus
encapsulates more than just experience. Each individual’s habitus also generates
strategies that form the basis of the actions they perform” (p. 602). Bourdieu argued that
these actions are “consistent with the objective interests of their authors without having
been expressly designed to that end” (Bourdieu, 1993, p. 76). Furthermore, the habitus of
individuals exposed to the same “logic of action” (Bourdieu & Passeron, 1990, p. 58)
creates ”class habitus” (p. 58) through the pressure of time which constructs the
synchronized practices without any “direct intervention or ... explicit co–ordination” (p.
58). Thus a collection of individual habitus may alter a community, class, or society.
Bourdieu (1993) described how individuals react to situations through the application of
habitus. The application of habitus is spontaneous having elements of strategic
calculation and unconscious replication of structures of which they are a creation.
Bourdieu’s colleague Wacquant (1971) called this ‘”fuzzy logic of practical sense”
(Bourdieu & Wacquant, 1992, p.19).
Kloot (2009) professed that habitus, which may be thought of as “systems of
durable, transposable dispositions” (Bourdieu, 1977, p. 72) determines a reflexive action
even while individuals consciously calculate. Bourdieu contended that social action is
dynamic continuously responding to the environment and consciously and unconsciously

!

40!

reconfigured through individuals’ habitus, hence action is not a “mechanistic obedience
to a rigid set of rules” (Kloot, 2009, p.473).
Bourdieu identified four forms of capital: economic, social, cultural, and symbolic
(Bourdieu & Wacquant, 1992). Mahar, Harker, and Wilkes (1990) conveyed access to
fiscal resources, typically wealth, as economic capital; networks of relations built by
individuals as social capital; education and the process of learning as cultural capital; and
symbolic capital as “culturally significant attributes such as prestige, status and authority”
(p. 13). The process of learning is informed by the acquisition of different literacies, one
being information literacy, making it within the dominion of cultural capital. Buttressed
by West et al. (2013), Bourdieu’s (1986) ideas on cultures, of how we internalize a range
of norms, including how to think and physically how to relate to others in our
dispositions, are connected to Winnicott’s (1971) concept of changing experiences of
selfhood and how we may develop more open, less defended orientations to experience.
Portes (1998) emphasized the Bourdieuian notion of the elusive character of
social capital relative to other types of capital. Social capital is built on the interplay of
relationships, whereas economic capital has tangible aspects, like the amount of money
one can access. To have social capital, an individual interacts with others, who generate
the capital. In isolation an individual does not have social capital. Hence, through social
capital, individuals can gain economic capital, for example access to subsidized loans, tax
information, rebates; cultural capital can be increased through contacts with experts or
institutions that confer valued knowledge, skills, credentials, or degrees. Thus through
successful information literacy instruction, an individual’s institutionalized cultural
capital is amplified (course success), which increases an individual’s embodied cultural

!

41!

capital and may be applied in situations to gain economic capital.
Czerniewicz and Brown (2013), in researching computer literacy skills, concluded
student habitus was deployed through the use of economic and cultural capital possessed,
for example, by the use of mobile phones for academics. The decision to use a mobile
phone was shown to be a secondary strategy. Their initial choice was a computer to
complete the task. Students “actualized habitus” (p. 50) in the choice they made to use a
mobile phone instead of a computer to complete tasks.
As Holt (2008) reasoned, Bourdieu offered a refined rationale “beyond conscious,
habitual, embodied and non-reflexive elements of practice” (p .232) of the individual
through habitus. A key significance of Bourdieu’s (1986) work emphasized the differing
capital value of relationships. Capital can be activated and transformed by an individual
through access to networks of people or resources. Different capitals could be formed
through the use of divergent networks. Thus, Bourdieu’s conception of habitus is
socially situated practice influenced by both conscious and unconscious acts.
West et al. (2013) emphasized the formation of capital and the impact on society
through describing the importance of lived experiences and power. According to West et
al. (2013), stories are clearly informed by lived experiences of social power. Bourdieu’s
notion of a particular habitus, for instance a specific university culture, is the
accumulated capital people have acquired through internal and external experiences.
They will be more or less confident with the rituals of communication and language,
including what is expected of them in writing, presentation, and assessment. These
Bourdieuian ideas about forms of capital and the ways they operate offer a tool for
understanding the enduring impact of social inequality in students’ lives.

!

42!
Bourdieu (1989) wrote, “capital is a social relation ... which only exists and

produces its effects in the field in which it is produced and reproduced” (p. 113). James,
Busher, and Suttill (2015) focused on understanding, using Bourdieu’s theory of habitus
and field, the Access to Higher Education (AHE) students’ discourses and experiences of
the different causes of marginalization that they experience, and how, in becoming an
AHE student, there is the potential for change, most realized through the individual’s
shifting dispositions as he or she comes into contact with new fields. James, Busher, and
Suttill (2015) found that habitus could be transformed through a process that can raise
individual expectations. For example, in the study conducted by James, Busher, and
Suttill, AHE students brought with them various forms of social, cultural, and symbolic
capital, recognizing them as resources, as well as great aspirations for their learning and
for better social futures (James et al., 2015).
Research suggested that developing an identity as a learner is shaped by the
complex interaction of a number of factors that relate to social capital, because learning is
essentially a social activity (Tett & Maclachlan 2007; Croll, 2004; Falk & Kilpatrick,
2000). These can include cultural capital (which consists of what is perceived to be
legitimate knowledge, skills, and titles), social capital (networks of social connections
that exist between people who hold shared values and behaviors), or economic capital
(wealth and money). The acquisition of one or more of these types of capital allows
people through habitus to gain status and power within society (Hodkinson, Biesta, &
James, 2008).
Habitus can include past learning experiences and the impact of family influences
upon them, as well as the norms and values of the social networks that individuals belong

!

43!

(Crossan, Field, Gallacher, & Merrill, 2003). For example, middle-class parents who
know from experience and knowledge how the institution of education works have the
capital to help their children to benefit from it (Bourdieu, 1989). Those individuals who
grow up in a culture of low educational expectations are more likely to develop a habitus
that does not understand its importance (James et al., 2015).
Furthermore, James, Busher, and Suttill (2015) examined narratives about
students’ life experiences and the impact of family. These were an important source of
inspiration leading to the acquisition of social capital and shifting attitudes towards
education. Moreover, in some cases these narratives were pivotal in the enhancement of
cultural capital in that relationships often raised other family members’ educational
aspirations. Growth in students’ confidence and competence heightened social and
cultural capital. The accumulation of capital shifted the students’ habitus towards
learning (Bourdieu & Passeron, 1990; James et al., 2015). Theoretically, students may
use the increased information literacy capital and habitus to forms of civic engagement,
such as voting.
James, Busher, and Suttill (2015) concluded that the powerful influence of
students’ prior learning experiences and struggles can help them to recognize what they
wanted to achieve in life, showing how processes of negotiation between their agency,
the social settings, and policy discourses, some of which were reified as institutional
structures, resulted in shifting learner identities. Hodkinson, Biesta, and James (2008)
summarized engagement in learning was influenced by a student’s past and current
experiences resulting in modifying one’s habitus.
Holt (2008) contended that Bourdieu (1986) offered a “nuanced and embodied

!

44!

account of agency via the concepts of practice and habitus” (Holt, 2008, p.228). Habitus
can be understood through the contextual and reflective nature of practice. Bourdieu
(1986), Loury (1977), and DeFilippis (2001) illustrated how power, specifically unequal
relations of socio-economic capital, was replicated through social networks. Butler and
Robson (2001) and Holt (2008) reinforced Bourdieu’s concept of the concealed
reproduction of privilege and disadvantage through the construction of capitals
(economic social, cultural, and symbolic).
Maton (2008) explained habitus as demonstrating students’ “ways of acting,
feeling, thinking and being” (p. 53). Students construct the present through the lens of
past history to enable them to make choices and on how to act or not act. Through
Bourdieu’s theories of habitus and capitals the complex relationships of identity,
background, and perception can be untangled. The relationships of identity, background,
and perception was deployed by Czerniewicz and Brown (2013) to examine how access
to capital(s) allowed the “elaboration of aspects of students’ habitus” (p. 44) in their
technology ownership or access, choice of technology to use to complete a task, and
attitude towards learning.
In this study, I will generate a categorization process iteratively evolved to
capture concepts of habitus and cultural capital from students’ words and phrases relating
to their perceptions of information literacy instruction. I will draw upon habitus and
cultural capital as conceptualized by Pierre Bourdieu. Within the context of my study,
cultural capital is based on Moore’s (2012) view that cultural capital is a manifestation of
the student’s habitus and his/her negotiation of the field in higher education, specifically
information literacy instruction.

Summary
In this review of the literature I have given the background of the United States

Educational System, the California Community College System, Composition Theory,
information literacy, managerialism, cultural capital, and habitus as defined by Bourdieu.
The literature revealed that information literacy has been the focus of worldwide
significance and progress. Information literacy has been a key area of study in academic
and public settings. The ability of students to gain information literacy skills to progress
academically has been studied.
A sustained effort within the higher education in California, specifically
California community colleges is well documented. No comprehensive system-wide
solution has emerged. Each local district in California has been left with addressing the
information literacy needs of students locally. Limited in-depth localized research on
information literary has been conducted.
Within the context of the structural system of higher education in the United
States I identified key factors that support the increased student success in composition
courses through linkage with information literacy coursework. Building on the energy
created through linking disciplines, conditions are laid to increase the cultural capital and
build habitus among students. These information literacy practices and wealth can be
leveraged in future academic coursework or applied to civic duties and responsibilities.
!
In reviewing the literature, the majority of research documents the perspective of
the practitioner/professional or addresses theoretical grounding of information literacy.
Limited research has been conducted on an individual perspective or value of information
literacy skills. This is amplified in the higher education setting. Most user perspective

!

46!

research stems from the public library sphere. My research project will build on the
framework created by Bourdieu to demonstrate the impact of gaining information literacy
skills on increasing cultural capital. Cultural capital is the accumulation of scholastic
wealth such as skill attainment, literacy, and course success. The ability to navigate an
information rich environment is a cultural totem that is valued by society, provides status,
and leads to advancement.

CHAPTER THREE: RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
Case studies provide a means of disseminating action research through capturing

“real data which can act as a basis for action” (Koshy, 2005, p. 106). A powerful
advantage of case studies is they are grounded in reality. This advantage stems from
“case studies are down to earth…in harmony with the readers own experience, and
provide a natural basis for generalisation” (p.107). Case studies provide a step to an
action. Conclusions and findings contribute to direct interpretation leading to staff or
individual’s “self-development, for feedback within the institution, for formative
evaluation, and for education policy-making” (p. 107).
Research Design
Bryman (2008) framed the general characteristic of basic case study research to
involve the detailed and intensive analysis of a single case. Stake (1995) observed that
case study research is concerned with the complexity and particular nature of the case in
question. Case study research is applicable to contemporary events when the relevant
behavior cannot be manipulated. Case study research may use a variety of evidence from
different sources, such as documents, artifacts, interviews, and observation, and this goes
beyond the range of sources of evidence that might be available in historical study
(Rowley, 2002; Rule & John, 2015).
This level of flexibility to analyze a variety of data sets form various historical
sources aligns with my dissertation. Yin (1989) summarized case study research as “a
how or why question is being asked about a contemporary set of events over which the
investigator has little or no control” (p.9). Yin defined a case study research as inquiry

!

48!

that “investigates a contemporary phenomena within its real life context” in which the
“boundaries between phenomenon and context are not clearly evident” (p.13).
According to Mertler (2006) a case study is “formally defined as a detailed
examination of a single setting, a single subject, or a particular event” (p. 67). The
breadth, depth, and complexity of a case study can vary. In the research design for the
focus of this dissertation the case study is focused on a single setting, one college. The
case study design provides a vehicle to “enable people to find effective solutions to
problems they confront in their everyday lives” (Stringer, 2007, p.1).
A case study approach provides a mode of inquiry for an in-depth examination of
a phenomenon. A strength of case studies is the ability to examine a phenomenon in its
context; it is not necessary to replicate the phenomenon in a laboratory or experimental
setting in order to better understand the phenomenon. Stake (1995) indicated that a case
study approach is advantageous in circumstances when “opportunity to learn is of
primary importance” (p.244).
Yin stated that the “distinctive need” for case study research “arises out of the
desire to understand a complex social phenomena” (p. 14). The case study enables the
use of multiple methods for data collection and analysis. The primary sources in this
study were primary source materials and student achievement data. Multiple sources of
evidence and different data collection techniques (documentary evidence, and statistical)
are methods that Patton (1990) suggested to improve the quality of the data and research
findings. Bryman (2008) noted that case studies are generally associated with qualitative
research, however an over-identification with solely qualitative research is not

!

49!

appropriate. Case studies frequently employ the use of both quantitative and qualitative
research methods.
The guiding light is practitioner practice, whether individual or group, to achieve
increased understanding or insight of an issue, question, or query. Qualitative research
design is a root of action research through the collection and analysis of data related to
practitioner experiences. According to Wallace (2001) the localized, small-scale, and
contextualized nature of practitioner action research used to inform, uncover, build, or
monitor changes of practice are a major advantage.
The key ingredient is people-centric environment where a practice, policy, or
procedure needing change. Case studies can be used in a multiplicity of areas, for
example, changing the delivery mode of teaching; adjusting to values and attitudinal
changes, adopting new learning strategies to include multiple learning styles, or altering
policy and procedural schemes to solve an issue or transformation. My target is to
illustrate the impact of student success rates in composition through sequencing
instruction of information literacy skills. The target population will be based on a student
cohort enrolled in a composition course. (Rule & John, 2015)
The research design gathers two data elements from a quantitative and qualitative
stance. The quantitative data were gathered through an analysis of student success data.
A quantitative analysis was conducted to measure the impact of sequencing information
literacy skills on success in composition courses. The analysis is based on the scientific
method (Mertler & Charles, 2011). The system of constructing and offering curriculum
in a defined sequence with associated outcomes is explored. Specifically, the sequence
of offering information literacy coursework and its relation to success in composition is

!

50!

examined. This study has components related to systemic and systematic approaches
(Reason & Bradbury, 2008).
Qualitative research assumes that the whole phenomenon is under study and that a
complex system cannot be meaningfully reduced to several variables and linear causal
relationships. Qualitative research focuses on describing and understanding a
phenomenon. Description includes a detailed account of the context, the activities, the
participants, and the process. Patton (1990) stated, “the advantages of qualitative
portrayals of holistic settings and impacts is that greater attention can be given to nuance,
setting, interdependence, complexities, idiosyncrasies, and context” (p. 51). Yin (1989)
stated that documentary information “is likely to be relevant to every case study topic”
(p.81).
The qualitative element is comprised of gathering data through an analysis of
classroom artifacts. The artifact is student responses and reflections provided on an endof-term course feedback form. This form is used in all sections of the information
literacy course regardless of instructor. Mills (2007) outlined a classroom artifact as a
visual or written data source “that contribute to our understanding of what is happening in
our classrooms” (p.72). Using existing documents and records is a standard practice in
action research design. Mertler (2006) defined existing documents and records as
“anything collected for a reason other than the action research study, but are now being
used as data for the study” (p.100). Questions from the end-of-term feedback form were
used to gather data on increasing students’ habitus and cultural capital through the
attainment of information literacy skills. Based on the quantitative data analysis of
success rates based on course sequencing and qualitative analysis of student comments, I

!

51!

will outline improvements to the practice of course sequencing and increasing students’
habitus and cultural capital.
I worked through the data collected in student feedback surveys through an
inductive process to determine the categories, patterns, and working hypothesis. This
will provide a way of establishing parameters and characteristics of the data set. Through
an open coding framework I examined the data to develop emergent categories related to
the idea of attainment of cultural capital and habitus. As referenced by Bogdan and
Biklen (1997), developing coding categories is accomplished by inspecting data for
patterns, commonalities, topics, and other unified characteristics. Patton (1990) stated,
“the purpose of coding the data is to facilitate the search for patterns and themes” (p.
384). Huberman and Miles (2002) defined codes as “tags or labels for assigning units of
meaning to the descriptive or inferential information compiled during the study” (p. 56).
The coding of data provides an avenue to conduct a content analysis of the documents
and artifacts. Patton (1990) explained content analysis as the “process of identifying,
coding, and categorizing the primary patterns in the data” (p.381).
Quantitative design is described by Mertler and Charles (2011) as embodying the
characteristics of experimental design with the exception of the random assignment of
participants. The design is diagrammed as,
Group 1 (Student Cohort) >> Treatment >> Results
Group 2 (All Students) >> No Treatment >> Results
Deductive reasoning is used, where the researcher proposes a hypothesis, or
problem statement, data are collected to examine the problem, the collected data are used
for analysis, and conclusions or recommendations are stated proving the hypothesis as
true or false. In 1938, Dewey described a procedure for quantitative design. Mertler and

!

52!

Charles (2011, p.4) outlined this procedure as,
1. Clarify the main question
2. State the hypothesis
3. Collect, analyze, and interpret information
4. Form conclusions derived from the analysis
5. Use the conclusion to verify or reject the hypothesis
Through analyzing student data, a systematic lens is used to determine whether
success rates in composition are impacted through sequencing information literacy
coursework. This will leverage the “hard” systems thinking approach where a sequenced
curriculum can be engineered. A systemic lens will supplement this linear, step-by-step
systematic lens. I will examine the phenomenon of increasing cultural capital and habitus
through a system of learning.
By combining the quantitative and qualitative elements I could draw on the
strength of both approaches. The quantitative analysis would provide a foundational
element by confirming or denying a statistical correlation on student success rates in a
composition course based on previously completing an information literacy course.
Qualitative analysis would provide information about traits affecting success rates from
intrinsic student perceptions affecting the accumulation of cultural capital and habitus.
Both of these bound together would provide a powerful argument for elements
that affect student success rates in a composition course. These would answer my initial
research hypothesis that sequencing an information literacy course prior to a composition
course improves student success rates.

!

53!
The research project is composed of a quantitative analysis of student

achievement data and an examination of student-generated comments. The quantitative
analysis is designed to compare success rates of students in a capstone composition
course with success rates of students who completed an information literacy course prior
to enrolling the composition course. The examination of student comments is viewed
through the concept that increased cultural capital and habitus improves academic
achievement.
This study utilizes student success rates over the course of multiple years.
Multiple years worth of data would be needed to mitigate any one-time factors that could
have affected a particular class or the entire institution in one semester. Without a
sufficiently large dataset it would be difficult to establish statistical significance of the
findings.
Through implementing a quantitative analysis, I would be able to determine the
association between student success and completing an information literacy course prior
to a composition course. This process would illuminate whether there is a significant
relationship between the two courses and provides a foundation for further investigation.
An alternative outcome could be there is no significant correlation on success rates by
sequencing the two courses. This would answer the hypothesis that sequencing
information literacy skills prior to a composition course increases student success rates,
but would open the door for the formulation of a new hypothesis. Finally, the analysis
could project a result contrary to the hypothesis. For example, a student success is most
affected by taking the two courses concurrently and not sequentially.

!

54!
My base argument concerns the impact on student success rates of a composition

course based on the sequence of learning information literacy skills. The quantitative
aspect will focus on the analysis of data to assert a relationship between student success
rates in a composition course and information literacy. The qualitative aspect will focus
on isolating perceptions that affect student success rates in the composition course
irrespective or compounded by the sequencing of information literacy skills.
Summary results from a quantitative analysis would be accepted in a
managerialist culture where tabulating score cards and rankings are favorable tools in
decision-making processes. This culture would value the deterministic approach of a
quantitative analysis.

Setting(s)
The California community colleges are the setting for this study. Specifically, a
single college, Sparrow College, is the basis of data gathering. The first set of data was
gathered by the College Institutional Research Office through the college’s management
information system (MIS) on student success rates in information literacy and
composition courses. I gathered a second qualitative data analysis of student comments
concerning the benefits of taking an information literacy course from an anonymous endof-term course feedback form. The feedback forms were delivered to me through the
library department as part of the research study approved by Sparrow College.
Participants
Participants in the study included students enrolled in an information literacy or
composition course at Sparrow College between the academic years 2010-2013. The

!

55!

student cohort consisted of 633 individuals that enrolled in the information literacy
course in the 2012-2013 academic year. The College Institutional Research Office
provided student success data based solely on student ID numbers and I grouped this data
into three cohort groups:
A. Completed information literacy course prior to composition course
B. Concurrently taking information literacy and composition course
C. Completed information literacy course after composition course
I received aggregated data, not linked to any specific student or individual; the
overall success rates of composition courses numbers were provided to me by the College
Institutional Research Office. I have no direct link to individual student records or data.
I utilized the College Institutional Research Office to pull data and aggregate data. No
individual student data were used for data analysis. The College Institutional Research
Office pulled all data from the college MIS data, which is transmitted to the Chancellor’s
Office.
The qualitative data were acquired through analysis of anonymous responses to
course feedback questions given at the end of the term in the information literacy course.
Instructors to gather student perceptions on the course content and general course
satisfaction distribute the feedback survey. The department to improve course delivery
and modify content discusses the comments. The optional survey is not tied to any
formal assessment or evaluation of the course or instructor performance.
Sparrow College, located in the San Francisco Bay region of California, serves a
diverse student population reflecting the wide range of cultural, racial, economic, and
ethnic backgrounds in the San Francisco Bay region. In terms of ethnicity and cultural

!

56!

background, student populations have steadily shifted with fewer White, Non-Hispanic
students. There has been an increase in students of Hispanic origin with the largest
student ethnic and racial group remaining Asian Pacific Islander. Compared to the
overall population in the San Francisco Bay region, Sparrow College’s student body is
under- represented in both Hispanic and White populations, with a corresponding higher
representation in Asian Pacific Islander students.
Sparrow College presents an environment, illustrated in the detailed demographic
data below, to conduct research in an environment where the student body is not from the
traditional dominant Western culture. Students bring divergent cultural capital and
habitus to the construction of knowledge and traditional notion of literacy. The delivery
of education is part of a larger power struggle and cannot be separated from social justice,
equity, self-determination, questioning authority, and community building (Pascarella,
2008).
The series of tables below illustrate the student demographic data for Sparrow
College. The student cohort followed in this study is from the 2012-2013 academic year.
The student cohort is comprised of students enrolled in the library studies department.
The department consists of a single information literacy course. Demographically the
cohort’s three largest ethnic categories were Asian (29%), White (16%), and Hispanic
(14%). Comparatively, the English Department, which teaches the composition course,
ethnic categories were Asian (30%), Hispanic (17%), and White (14%). Sparrow
College’s overall student ethnicities in 2012 were Asian (37%), White (18%), and
Hispanic (15%). The cohort followed in this study aligns with the overall college and
English Department ethnicity demographics.

Demographically the cohort’s gender balance was male (62%) and female (35%).
Comparatively, the English Department gender balance was male (46%) and female
(54%). Sparrow College’s overall student gender demographic was male (44%) and
female (56%). The student cohort followed in this student diverged from the overall

Data Gathering/Procedures/Instruments
Data collection began with the extraction of student success data from the college
management information system for the academic years 2010-2013. Using student
identification numbers as a unique identifier, the data were broken into three cohort sets.
To test the association of student success rates in the composition course based on
the sequencing of an information literacy course, a cohort of students was followed over

!

60!

6 years with the baseline academic year being the 2012-2013 academic year. According
to the Campaign for College Opportunity (2104) report on the state of higher education in
California it found “California Community College (CCC) students who earned an
associate degree only in 2012-13 took a median of four years to complete their degrees,
which is twice as long as a full-time student is expected to take” (p.3). Students in the
cohort, enrolled in the information literacy course in 2012-2013, enrolled in an English
composition course over the broad 6 year period. Cohort students enrolled in English
composition prior, during, and after the baseline 2012-2013 academic year. I compiled
and compared the cohort composition course success rates to the composition course
success rates of non-cohort students.
Second, a hermeneutic review will be conducted of student comments. All
student comments provided in an end-of-term information literacy course feedback form
were read. The forms were analyzed by discovering text segments that relate to concepts
that emerged from the literature review. The text segments were coded to themes related
to cultural capital and habitus. This analysis builds on concepts of sociological
hermeneutics in which meaning can only be acknowledged within the context of the
originating phenomenon.
To distill and engage with the data collected through student responses a
categorizing and coding method is used. This method identifies units of meaning
(student reflection) within the written comments and organizes them into categories
based on concepts of habitus and cultural capital that encapsulate the perception of the
students towards their experience taking the information literacy course. The process and
procedure followed the categorizing and coding steps outlined in Stringer (2007):

Critical ontological insights become important in a learning environment
sequencing two literacies to achieve greater success rates. Neither of these literacies
represents a neutral perspective. Students’ understanding of themselves, inclusive of
their, gender identity, racial/ethnic awareness, political opinions, spiritual beliefs, and/or
education goals, in light of the dominant institutional power structure to manage
knowledge and shape outcomes need to be addressed within the education system of
course delivery and accompanying praxis implemented by educators (Pascarella, 2008).
The mechanics of coding of the text is imbedded in grounded theory approaches.
This inductive research strategy provides a framework to analyze the open text responses
by students and link, through coding, to the existing theories of cultural capital and
habitus. This will provide an additional reflection point, accompanying the quantitative
analysis, for the research question (Greener, 2011).

Plan for Analysis of Data
Large data sets were compiled and analyzed using quantitative methodology to
establish association between the cohort and non-cohort data. Student achievement and
success data were drawn from three academic years (2010-13), data sets for 48 sections
(LIB10) of an information literacy class and 90 sections of an English composition class
(ENGL1A). Student ID numbers were used by the College Institutional Research Office
as a unique identifier. Students enrolled in the composition course were divided into

!

62!

three cohort groups based on their registration (prior, simultaneous, or post) in the
information literacy course. The Sparrow College Institutional Research Department
generated student success rates for the composition course for each cohort. These cohorts
were compared against the baseline aggregate student success data for the composition
course. The data was analyzed for patterns to demonstrate changes to composition
success rates based on the sequence of completing an information literacy course.
The survey instrument is an open ended text-based feedback form given to
students at the completion of the information literacy class. The purpose of the feedback
form was to elicit comments from students about the class experience, their perceptions
of the class, and general experiences. The feedback form was developed by library
department faculty as a tool to continuously improve the information literacy course. The
survey is anonymous and sent to all students enrolled in the information literacy course
regardless of instructor. Anonymity is maintained by not collecting student ID or names
on the feedback form.
Surveys from 48 classes over a period of three academic years (2010-2013)
amounting to 1,200 individual responses were analyzed. The survey is composed of 12
questions. I chose to focus on responses from three questions:
•

What did you like best about this course?

•

Did this course meet your expectations?

•

Do you have any additional comments?
I coded the text segments from these three open-ended questions according to the

themes identified in the literature review. I developed a heuristic from themes related to
cultural capital and habitus.

Ethics
Sparrow College does not have a formal IRB process or board. To gain college

approval to collect and analyze student achievement data, the Director of Research,
Planning and Institutional Effectiveness reviews all research requests. The Director
reviews the type of data being requests and any instruments used to collect student data.
The Director makes a recommendation to the College President who will make the final
decision. The process ensures state and federal regulations on privacy of student records
are upheld.
In January 2015, I submitted an application to conduct research on human subject
to the Fielding Graduate University Institutional Research Board (IRB). My study,
methods, design, and research instrument for this study were reviewed and approved by
Fielding Graduate University’s IRB. As part of the formal IRB procedure I was required
to provide CITI Certificate of Completion.
To maintain personal integrity and professional standing within my field it is
paramount to ensure my research design is deliberative. Data elements must be carefully
selected and any empirical analysis follows the fundamental rules of statistics.
Participant anonymity and confidentiality must be ensured. The individual researcher is
accountable for the choices he or she makes, rather than a defined code. I am required to
be reflective due to the situation and the context of the research being undertaken. We all
bring our own morality to every issue in life. This is one reason that is paramount to
acknowledge one’s biases.

Summary
In this research methodology chapter I have given the conceptual research design
being used for this study, the setting in which the study takes place, the process used for
data gathering, the plan for analysis, and ethical considerations. This study is based on a
case study research design approach. This study is a detailed analysis of a single case.
The case being studied involves a cohort of student’s enrolled in an information literacy
course in the academic year 2012-2013 at a single community college.
The setting of the study is a single community college located in California. A
pseudonym of Sparrow College is used in this study. The community college is a
medium-sized public college with a diverse student ethnic and racial background. The
majority of students identify their ethnic background as Asian.
Data were gathered in conjunction with Sparrow College’s Office of Institutional
Research. Student achievement data were pulled and compiled by the Sparrow College’s
Office of Institutional Research. The data included student success rates in an
information literacy course and English composition course over three academic years,
beginning in 2012-2013. Students enrolled in an information literacy course in 20122013 formed a cohort that was compared against non-cohort students in English
composition course success rates. Furthermore, the Library Department at Sparrow
College provided results from course feedback forms given to students at the end of their
information literacy course. The feedback forms are optional and anonymous.

!

65!
The Sparrow College Office of Institutional Research compiled the quantitative

analysis of student achievement data. These data sets were analyzed in this study to track
the cohort success rates over time against non-cohort students. The plan of analysis
included tracking English composition success rates based on the sequence of taking an
information literacy course. An open coding scheme was deployed to analyze the
feedback forms to gather emergent themes related to student acquisition of habitus
through the completion of an information literacy course.
The research methodology and design constructed will allow an analysis of data
and information to illustrate the effect on English composition success rates based on the
completion of an information literacy course. The optional student feedback forms will
be analyzed through text coding to undercover the attainment of information literacy
skills to build student habitus and cultural capital. The acquired habitus and capital can
be leveraged and used throughout a student’s educational pathway and for civic
engagement. The next chapter will discuss in detail the results of the research design.

CHAPTER FOUR DATA RESULTS
Introduction
Chapter 4 provides an analysis of data gathered in this study. This chapter
correlates to Stage 3 of Kemmis, McTaggart, & Program (1988) fundamental
components of action research:
Stage 1: Clarify vision and targets
Stage 2: Articulate appropriate theory
Stage 3: Implement action and collect data
Stage 4: Reflect on the data and plan informed action
The data are organized in two ways, first through a quantitative analysis of
student success data over a period of 5 years (2010-2015). Students enrolled in a LIB10
Information Literacy course at Mission College are the cohort followed in the analysis.
The cohort’s success rates in ENGL1A composition course are tracked over 5 years.
Secondly, guided by the process and procedure outlined in Stringer (2007).
Categorizing and coding steps are utilized to report data within the theme identified in the
literature review. The data were gathered through a survey, hermeneutic review of
existing student surveys over the 5 year period. Results were gathered around the premise
that increased “habitus” is achieved through enrollment in information literacy courses.
Through analyzing student data a systematic lens is used to determine whether
success rates in composition are impacted through sequencing information literacy
coursework. This will leverage the “hard” systems thinking approach where a sequenced
curriculum can be engineered. This is based on ontology structured in a lexicon of
problems and solutions. A systemic lens supplements this linear, step-by-step systematic
lens. The phenomenon of increasing cultural capital and habitus through a system of

!

67!

learning was examined (Reason & Bradbury, 2008)
I contend that students who have acquired understanding of the principles and
concepts associated with information literacy have increased habitus (agency) and more
cultural capital over those who do not. An underlying assumption in information literacy
is that an information literate person is beneficial to society and that socio-economic
issues affect literacy. A constructivist approach could provide valuable perspective on the
impacts of student success in composition courses based on the sequence of learning
information literacy skills.
All the strands discussed above could lead to a rich understanding of the problem.
In particular, the following research question was investigated:
Is there a relationship between the accumulation of information literacy capital
prior to composition courses and their subsequent success?
From the main question, two subquestions arose:
What are the various composition course success rates sequenced to information
literacy coursework?
How do undergraduate students describe their experiences of the study of
information literacy in higher education?
I pose the question, “What is the effect of ‘information literacy’ instruction prior
to composition coursework?”
Research Sample
The research sample is comprised of two components. The analysis of student
success rates in ENGL 1A based on completion of LIB 10 Information Literacy course

!

68!

was tracked using a cohort of 633 LIB 10 students from the academic year 2012-2013.
The second element was a document text review of anonymous student surveys
provided to students at the end of LIB 10. Surveys from academic years 2012-13, 20132014, 2014-15 were identified. Student responses totaled 591. Document review was
completed by reading, coding, and recording text segments from the surveys; these were
then organized by themes.
Analysis of Success Rates
Students enrolled in a LIB10 Information Literacy course in the 2012-2013
academic year are the cohort used to base the impact on success rates in an ENGL1A
composition course upon the completion of the LIB10 information literacy course. The

Analysis of Cultural Capital and Habitus
I approach the issue from the concept of cultural capital and habitus. According to
Bourdieu (1986), power is culturally and symbolically created, and constantly legitimized
through the interplay of agency and structure. Cultural capital is a major source of social
inequality. Certain forms of cultural capital are valued over others, and can help or hinder
one’s social mobility just as much as income or wealth.
To explore the impact of increased cultural capital and habitus on success I
reviewed student comments from a survey that is given to students at the end of a LIB10
course. The survey is anonymous and optional for students to complete. I reviewed
student surveys from every section of LIB10 offered over 5 academic years (2010-2015).
Surveys were analyzed by discovering text segments that relate to concepts that emerged
from the literature review. The text segments were coded to themes related to cultural
capital and habitus.
To distill and engage with the data collected through student responses a
categorizing and coding method is used. This method identifies units of meaning
(experience/perception) within responses collected and organizes them into categories
that summarize the perception of the students towards their experience taking the
information literacy course. The categorizing and coding steps process and procedure
followed are outlined in Stringer (2007):
•
•
•
•

Review the collected data
Unitize the data
Categorize and code
Identify themes

!

75!
•
•

Organize a category system
Develop a report framework

The questions probe the impact of learning information literacy skills; however,
through dialog other factors may arise. The data collected derives from an end-of-the
term student survey. The survey is offered to students to complete at the end of each
Library 10 course section. The survey is anonymous. The same survey instrument is used
for every course section regardless of instructor. The data collected were from three
academic years (2012-2013, 2013-2014, 2014-2015) totaling 36 course sections and 591
individual responses.
The survey is composed of 12 questions. Upon analyzing the questions, I chose to
focus on responses from three questions:
•
•
•

What did you like best about this course?
Did this course meet your expectations?
Do you have any additional comments?

These specific questions were chosen because the open-ended narrative response
format could capture student reflections on the increased capital or habitus engendered by
the course. None of the questions had a specific prompt to capture data on capital and
habitus. An open text review was used to code, establish themes, and categorize
responses. The coding focused on student responses that suggested the information
competency skills would be used in the future as part of daily life or other coursework.
The categorization process parsed responses into three general themes:
•
•
•

Responses that indicated an increase in capital and/or habitus
Responses that were neutral
Responses that were not applicable; generally due to being yes/no response,
about the course format, or concerning an instructor.

Upon completing the data review, a reporting mechanism was developed. For
each academic year responses that reflected an increase in capital or habitus were
consolidated by question. Below are the aggregated results from the survey by question.

The appendix includes aggregated responses that were neutral to the research question or
not applicable. The results are captured verbatim.

This is a good course and I always learn
something new each time. I felt like the time
flew when I went to class .What I like best
about this course is search engines. Overall
this course was very useful and benefited me.
I liked that i was able to use the information i

my English 1B class.

I was able to learn so many

very helpful for my future
courses.
it will benefit me in future.
It helped me with my English 1B
class where I had to write essays
that strictly imposes citations and
reliable sources.

useful for future research
The information learned in this course could
be really helpful at the beginning of your
college experience.
I like that there was a thruough amount of
information we can apply to the rest of our
classes, specifically research papers and
different types of research assignments. I
found a lot of stuff that I didnt know.
I like everything about this course over all; I
learn a lot of things from this course. And I
recommend that the other students should
also take this course before taking English
1A.
I will be more confident when searching,
evaluating and citing sources for my future
research projects.
I liked learning new skills that I feel will help
me in the future.
It helped me site sources for other classes
because it introduced me to noodletool.
I liked that I learned alot, and am able to
utilize what I learned with my current
classes, and future ones.

I think the greatest take away
from this course was a better
understanding of plagiarism,
copyrighted materials, creating an
accurate citation and most
importantly, how to effectively
analyze resources to ensure that
they are a value-add to research
or just simply for general
knowledge purposes.
Although this course is a short
course and it counts as a 1 unit
but it contains many helpful
information to help students
understand more about the
Library 10 course. It gives me
how the concept universal
computer works. It enhances my
skills and knowledge about the
computers that previously
something I do not understand the
computer completely such as
databases, URL, http, citations,
search engines. These names
seem to be strange and unfamiliar
to me. Since I got this course, I
found out there are many names
on computer and the terms I need
to know which help me
understand more about using

how to use noodle tool for MLA citation.
That is really helpful for English courses
What I liked best is learning different
techniques when evaluating websites for
research papers, I feel that these will be
beneficial to me in the future.
The whole class over all, it increased my
ability to reasearch

computer.
I learned so much that I cant
remember it all. But I do know
where to find the answers now. I
have a great reference tool for the
rest of my college career about
how to submit assignments, do
research, and cite my work
correctly.

This course will help my me to do my
research better and more effectively.
The content of this course is very helpful and
can be applied to all of my classes. Taught
me plenty of information that I didn't know
before.

I really appreciate the information
this course had to offer. It is
important information that will
only benefit college students
moving forward.

That I know how to search "better," and what
information is good/bad for my future
research papers.

Learning valuable information I
need to use for school and
adapting to the "real world."

It helped me with my English 1A class.

That I know how to do some
things for some of my future
classes

The information provided in this course will
help me with my researches in the future.
Prior to my entrance in this course my
experience with writing a research paper was
a struggle. In this course I gained a good
amount of experience from reading
materials, PowerPoint presentations, and
assignments. Lastly, GREAT
PROFESSOR! Professor Sargent was always
available and provided quick response to my
emails and positive feedback at all times.
Learning how to use Noodletools, it save so
much of my time, and help me a lot in other
classes as well.
Learning about things that we are actually
going to use in the future.
I like the information that we learn about
because i can use the information that i learn
outside of school in my daily life.

What I liked about this course
was how occupied I always was
with this course and the life-long
skills that I learned from it.
This course helped me learn how
to know search information on
the internet and article for my
future class. I have learned which
information of the website was
verified. I knew why the books,
journals or the web have a cite,
reference.
One thing that I really liked about
this course is that I learned how
to do proper research because it
will definitely help me in the
future.
Is that I like the class, is that a lot
of the information of this class I
will need it later in school.

This course was really beneficial to me
Great class, although it's the hardest 1 unit I
have taken in my life.
Library 10 online class has been a great
class.
I spent way more than 3 hours per week
doing this homework. That was frustrating. I
think the class could be a lot shorter if they
didn't try to cram so much knowledge into
our brains that we can't possibly remember.
It would be better if they gave us general
information and then made very detailed
pesentations available in the library online
for us to reference, sitting there ready for us
to use as the need required. The class tried to
teach us citing for every circumstance, but
how many times are we really going to cite
something? It would be great if when I
needed to cite something, if I could go to the
library online and watch the presentation for
whatever scenario I was in;magazine article
on the web, or book with two authors, etc.
Because I found with the class, that I still
didn't have all of the scenarios covered, I
wasn't sure what to do in some cases and just
guessed. Even with all of the information
that the class provided, it still couldn't cover
everything. There was no way to possibly
remember everything learned in this class,
and when it came time to answer questions
for the homework, I would go back to a
presentation and try to find the answer that I
new I saw earlier, and it was very time
consuming to try to re-find
something,because there was so much to sift
through.
This course was overall very good but I think
for the amount of work that you do for this 1
unit class is a bit too much. If anything the
head of Academics at Mission college should
change this class to at least 2 unites instead
of 1 because there is a lot of work to do. So 1
unit I think is a little unfair.
I really love this class, and I would like to

yes, Thank you Mission College
for providing these online
courses; It makes it easier for us
the older adults to continue our
education.
I was okay with the course, some
assignments i wish were graded
personally by the instructor
because sometimes the online
corrections are too technical.
It would be nice if the assignment
did worth so much points. its
really hard to pull up your grade.
This class is too much homework
for just one credit.
For the students who are from the
old school it’s a challenge, my
suggestion and comments would
be to break the class into two
basic and advance and give it
more units. After all it is all about
Mission College Library not too
many materials are about the
outside search engine. Over all
this class was a big 10.
This class should be broken down
in to two levels so students have
time to master what is being
taught. I see that this is a class
that should be mastered by all and
not just for a grade, but that is
me. I honestly wish I could have
more time to really learn about
citations. How it is I have spent at
least three to four hours a week
on homework, which is much
more than many higher unit
classes. Maybe more scheduled
classroom time or a independent
study hall where students can
drop in and work with the
instructor(s) one on one.
I enjoyed exploring in internet

There was A LOT of work for just a one unit
class.
I learned stuff what I didn't know about, so
Thank you for that
Well in general everything was excellent, but
improve the angel to be compatible with the
last versions of the browsers in the market is
what you have to improve.
Usually, I prefer to take my classes in a
traditional classroom setting. When I initially
signed up for this course I was worried that it
would be very hard and that I would not be
able to navigate my way through everything.
However the instructor made everything very
simple and easy to follow and the
presentations and handouts were always
helpful.
Thanks for your comments and feedback to
all students throughout the semester. This
was a really good class for me to take as my
first on-line course.
THANK YOU! I truly enjoyed this course. I
have a genral comment on all online courses.
I see the need to have due dates for
assignments, both for the instructor and the
class participants, I do think that it would be
nice for there to be some flexibility on due
dates. An idea would be,fixed dates for some
assignment and all quizes but it woudl be
nice to go back and be able to complete
assignments we missed and receive credit for
them.
Only thing, really is that the voice recordings
need to be redone on some of the
presentations, the splices were distracting at
times.

world.
Thanks for your interesting class.
I have studied a lot of useful
things in this course.
Should shorten the some of the
work load it would help by doing
some of the work in class rather
than after.
For a one unit course, this class
shouldn't be this hard. Too much
homework every week! In class
activities were given 10-15
minutes before time. While we're
doing it, that's the time she'll
explain the homework for the
following week. How are we
going to understand what she's
talking about when we're too
busy doing the in class activity?
I have a co-worker that takes the
same class but in the different
school, she was already done 2-3
weeks ago.
This course should be more than
one units - at least three!
According to the greensheet, you
specified that the homework
would take only take two hours.
This is not true: I and other
students spent several hours on
each homework assignment.
Please consider about the amount
of homework for this class. It's
only one unit :)
It would be better if we could
email the citations we had to
create for homework instead of
having to deal with trying to
make them look right in ANGEL.
We had to do way to many
citations I understood it the first
time we did them. I did not like
all of the things throughout the
course that related to the
instructors political views.
Political views need to be kept to
your self, this is a library class
not a political class!

I don't find this course helpful at all. The
things I already knew just made it more
confusing.

If the class is going to be this
extensive, it should be worth
more units.

More activity in class.

Really helpful course.

I would like to say that we should make up
for our assignment.This way be can learned
more by practice and get better grade. more
make up more practice.

Now I know how to do a better
research.

This course was very helpful and I learned a
lot.
I enjoyed the knowledge I gained from the
class. I definitely enjoyed the Professor, and
I don't have anything negative to say. I liked
participating, and learning new things I had
no clue about before I waltzed into this class.
My only criticism would be to have more in
class work.

2014S2015!

I really like this online class. I think it's fun
and I learned a lot too.
Some students in class may argue that the
work felt heavy for the credits awarded upon
completion but I strongly believe the content
was taught well, taught effectively, and some
valuable skills that apply to future
coursework and careers were presented. If a
debate were to occur, my argument would
lean towards suggesting we keep all the
content and re-evaluate the units awarded.

This online class is not only
useful to students, but also helps
a lot to everyone that needs it.
I like to take this course and I
gain alot of knowladge about the
plagiarism and web evaluation.
Thanks for providing many useful
skills.

It is a really good class because it
prepared you to attend the more
advanced writing classes.
This course is so helpful. I wish
that I could take it sooner.
This course was very helpful and
I learned skills that I could apply
in future courses.
I should have taken LIB10 a long

Summary
In this chapter I have reported the results of the two-phase data analysis employed
in this study. Examination of the 633 LIB 10 student cohort success rates in English 1A.
Overall, the data suggest a link between completing an information literacy course and
success rates in English composition course.
The second phase examined through document text review identified themes

!

84!

based on the literature review. The themes identified increased cultural capital and
habitus as reflected in student responses. Very encouraging is the level of student
responses to the benefit of information literacy coursework, a strong indication that
college should continue to support information literacy instruction.
Finally, this study provides relevant and demonstrable data that will be
disseminated to librarians in the California Community College System. This is the
largest study of its kind; utilizing this approach will inform future practice in the system.
By sharing this information, this research can be evidence toward advancing information
literacy instruction. Chapter 5 provides the full conclusions and implications of this
study.

CHAPTER FIVE: DISCUSSION, IMPLICATIONS, AND CONCLUSION
Introduction
All of the major themes found support across the three research methods in this

study. What follows is a thematic discussion regarding both the success and challenges in
student composition course success rates related to enrolling in an information literacy
course and a creation of cultural capital and habitus through the acquisition of
information literacy skills. This chapter ends in a synopsis of the limitations of the study
and recommendations for further study and practice.

Information Literacy and Composition Skills
To paraphrase Breivik (1998), the best place to start information literacy planning
is with general education or core curriculum. Despite an increased interest in information
literacy skills in higher education, it is surprising that little empirical research has been
conducted on the relationship between composition and information literacy.
Collaboration between the composition and information literacy disciplines to
improve student success is not well documented. This may be due to the common reality
of disciplines working in silos, where gathering information and collaboration with
faculty outside of one’s discipline is not considered due to lack of awareness (Mackey &
Jacobson, 2004).
The identification of information literacy as a generic skill has influenced
curricula and has provided further momentum to the information literacy agenda. Purdue
asserts, “Information literacy cannot exist in a vacuum; it has to be part of a lived
response to research. In other words, theory and practice must combine with our

!

86!

experiences to create a pedagogy whose goal is to fully engage students, and ourselves, to
work with them to achieve their goals, and also, perhaps, some goals that they don’t
know that they have” (Jacobs, 2009, p.73). This assertion is further enforced as Hager,
Holland, and Beckett (2002) as stated in practice skills overlap and interweave like the
threads in a carpet and universities that identify generic skills need to avoid the danger of
treating them as a simple mechanistic list of separate traits (Lupton, 2008).
When professors assign an essay they enable student-learning outcomes such as
analysis and synthesis of content, and transfer of this knowledge in an academic or
professional writing style that relates to the conventions of the academic discipline. They
may list assessment criteria such as use of a wide range of sources, use of evidence,
development of argument, logical structure, accurate referencing, clarity of expression
and so on. Professors may make a number of assumptions about students’ prior
experience with essay writing (MacKinnon & Manathunga, 2003).
In his work, Libraries and Writing Centers in Collaboration: A Basis in Theory,
Elmborg (2005) noted that the research/writing process is related at least in part to the
recurring interplay between writing and information. By segregating the research process
from the writing process, we have obscured the fact and thereby impoverished both the
writing process and the research process. This segregation reflects institutional divisions,
but not the reality of student work.
As Artman et al. (2010) noted in A Blended Method for Integrating Information
Literacy Instruction into English Composition Classes, there is a "natural fit and shared
goals of information literacy and English composition programs," as both "writing and
researching are viewed as non-linear processes and both require individuals to work back

!

87!

and forth through a number of stages of discovery, development, and critical thinking" (p.
97).
The data from analyzing a cohort of students’ success rates in an English
composition course based on the completion of an information literacy course showed a
significant difference between the cohort and non-cohort success rates taking both
courses simultaneously. The cohort’s composition course success rates were higher by
11.8% over non-cohort students. Eighteen percent of the cohort completed the
information literacy and English composition course simultaneously. The application of
the information literacy course could be a significant variable in increased success rates.
As illustrated in the literature there is a connection between composition skills and
information literacy skills.
There appeared to be less of an impact on composition success rates when the
information literacy course was taken one year prior to the composition course.
Composition success rates were identical to the cohort and non-cohort students. Eight
percent of the student cohort were in this course sequence. The number of cohort
students taking the information literacy course prior to the English composition course
was small.
In looking at a further time interval in completing the information literacy and the
English composition courses the data became insignificant. Only 22 out of 633 cohort
students or 3% completed the English composition course 2 years after completing the
information literacy course. For this small sample, their success rates in English
composition were actually less than non-cohort students. Due to the limited focus of this
case study and sample size, no definite conclusion can be drawn.

System Structure and Managerialism
Since my research project is bound within a particular educational system and

environment, it is important to provide a framework to the reader. Different structures
and beliefs underpin the educational systems in various parts of the world. The North
American model is a particular variant with California being a distinct flavor. A
compounding element has been the introduction of a parallel advancement in “new
managerialism” imbedded within the public education system.
Place cannot be disconnected from the human experience. The cultural and
physical elements of a particular place influence our reactions to situations and problems.
This is no different for education. In the context of this paper, the relationship between
college completion and “readiness” for non-traditional students may be influenced by the
“place” the education is happening.
A sense of place is commonly used in relation to those characteristics that make a
place special or unique, as well as to those that foster a sense of authentic human
attachment and belonging. One definition of place, proposed by Tuan, is that a place
comes into existence when humans give meaning to a part of the larger, undifferentiated
space. Any time a location is identified or given a name, it is separated from the
undefined space that surrounds it. I agree with this supposition. Students apply
definitions and conditions on the spaces where learning takes place, whether it is a
physical room or a cyber-space forum (Tuan, 1980).
Robust identity and character creates a strong sense of place deeply felt by the
local population. A sense of place is a social phenomenon that exists independently of

!

89!

any one individual's perceptions or experiences, yet is dependent on human engagement
for its existence.
Places change in size and complexity and in economic, political, and cultural
importance as networks of relationships between places are altered through population
expansion, changes in climate, and changes in transportation and communication
technologies. A place can be dramatically altered by events both near and far. Ones
awareness of preparedness or readiness is applied to a place and this interaction of values
and thought affects the condition of learning (Cresswell, 2005).
Beginning in 1995, the California State University System (23 universities)
endorsed information competency skills as essential for graduates and funded pilot
projects to institute information competency curricula and assessment strategies. In 1996
the California Community College State Chancellor’s Office identified information
competency as a system-wide priority, leading to adoption by the State Academic Senate
for California Community Colleges of a resolution supporting information competency.
Working with this foundation many universities and colleges began piloting localized
models and planning initiatives.
Without a statewide strategic mandate for the localized environment, the subject
became influenced by “new managerialism.” The concept of new managerialism can be
understood as an ideological configuration of ideas and practices recently brought to bear
on public service organization, management, and delivery, often at the behest of
governments or funding agencies. At its core this is the ideology of quantitative
indicators of achievement, quasi-market completion for students based on choice,
increased regulation, and less public funding (Deem, 2005).

!

90!
There is an intense emphasis on infusing ideas and practices from the corporate

world into the public sector, on the assumption that the latter are superior to the former.
Efficiency and effectiveness are extensively pursued in the field of service delivery and
workforce restructuring is advocated to enable more teamwork and flexibility. Finally,
new managerialism is associated with imposed external accountability, including use of
performance indicators, scorecards, league tables, target setting, benchmarking, and
performance management (Kirkpatrick & Lucio, 1995).
This has put profound pressure on departments to maximize their curriculum and
course sequences to produce results that can be displayed on system-wide league tables
of success and retention rates. If departments cannot raise rates, they are vulnerable to
elimination. Information literacy programs are facing a crossroads to advocate for their
development and continuation within the language of new managerialism.
Biesta (2004) contended that there is no direct relationship in accountability
between educational institutions and students; there is only an indirect link. The lack of
opportunity for students to participate in an open discourse concerning education causes
an indirect experience between the two entities. Their role is marginalized to solely
consumers of education. The relationship has become less a political relationship, where
citizens and government work together for the common good. The relationship has
increasingly turned to an economic association, in which the state is provider and the
taxpayer is a consumer of public services.
This dichotomy produces a system of institutional accountability to regulator and/or
funding agencies, not to the public or students. The key stakeholders become entities
providing financial resources to institutions. Institutions adapt to auditing rules, rather

!

91!

than the rules following educational best-practices. This system of accountability by rules
creates a complex web where measures are nothing more than metric used to provide
funding (Biesta, 2004).
While there are reasons for the emergence of the culture of accountability in
education, the rise is part of a much wider social and economic transformation that has
affected most spheres of modern life. This transformation was captured by Michael
Power (as cited in Biesta, 2004, p. 233) in his notion of an audit society. This notion
purposes that all activities should be presented in an auditable format. A tangible
example is the increasing use of scorecards and data-dashboards to compare and rank
schools.
As society transitioned to increasingly consumerist models of service delivery, the
school became the central supplier. This caused an indirectness of an opportunity for
students to participate in an open discourse concerning education. Consumerism
increased the demand for accountability and auditing. These are the tools required by
government agencies to assure the public of quality. Thus confirming Biesta’s (2004)
theory that there is no direct relationship in accountability between educational
institutions and students, there is only an indirect link.
This concern for increasing test scores and holding educational leaders and
teachers accountable for student achievement is central to government education policy,
and it is dramatically reshaping policies and practices in schools across the country,
particularly, in schools serving impoverished children and youth (Larson, 2011). This is
a multi-national shift in ethos. Gewirtz (2002) characterized this transformation as a shift
from "welfarism" to the "new managerialism". Welfarism is characterized by a public

!

92!

service ethos; a commitment to professional standards and values such as equity and
social justice. New managerialism, on the other hand, is characterized by a customeroriented ethos, decisions driven by efficiency and cost-effectiveness, and an emphasis on
competition, especially free-market competition. Gewitz studied educational reform in
England; however, these trends are applicable to many Anglo-Saxon countries.
This behavior Gewirtz (2002) characterizes as new managerialism. In this
environment free-market competition is a key element. Meeting quantitative equity goals
melds well in this environment. Being able to state the retention, completion, and
transfer rates increased by certain percentage points provides powerful marketing to a
public obsessed with consumerism and government agencies driven by efficiency and
cost-effectiveness measures.
Lessening of a commitment to professional standards and values such as equity
and social justice characterizes this movement. Gewirtz (2004) stated that managerialism
characterized by a customer-oriented ethos, decisions driven by efficiency and costeffectiveness, and an emphasis on competition; especially free-market competition is the
new trend.
The quantitative portion of this research study could be used in a new
managerialist worldview to promote information literacy instruction. The research
showed a significant impact on English composition course success rates when an
information literacy course is taken at the same time. The data became less clear as the
time between taking the two courses increased.
Being a researcher I felt it was important to take time to reflect on the rise of the
new managerial ideology. To have impact and influence the discourse, one needs to

!

93!

address the policy landscape. This lack of acknowledging the audience and policy
environment for research has led to the minimization of research studies on policy
development in California community colleges. I am bound to produce some bias due to
my reality of being an executive-level college administrator, which places me within the
vortex between discipline pedagogy and institutional policies and procedures.

Cultural Capital and Habitus
Elements related to human agency mentioned by Greene (1988) on matters
involving contested notions are not addressed. Agency is an important factor in
conditions of power, such as equity building, where the differing level of power may
need to be mitigated to ensure that intellectual and moral relationships are developed.
The only agent represented in the goals is the institution. Without actively engaging
individuals, can solidarity and tolerance be achieved? An institution can provide structure
and opportunities for students to leave their comfort zones and engage with others to
build relationships and further understanding (Kuh, 1993). Through individual agency
different points of views and open discourse of values and norms are exchanged.
Dewey formulated the arguments that have dominated educational policy and
resulted in a major shift from individual to institutional responsibility in the attempt to
provide an opportunity for all students to develop “whatever gifts” they might possess
(Dewey & Edman 1955, p. 311). The attempt of institutions to provide for students
melds with Bernstein’s (1977) theory of how power and control are spread in society
from the dominant classes via formal education. The individual is no longer the primary

!

94!

agency for change, but the institution as the dominant force prescribes policies and
procedures.
Shared beliefs and values reflect the fact that individuals live in social and
cultural groups or sets of groups. The values of these groups are usually complex and
cover such subjects as ideology, religion, politics, social structure, and economic
structure. They influence how people in a particular group perceive both themselves and
other groups.
The significance that an individual or group attaches to a specific place or region
may be influenced by feelings of belonging or alienation, a sense of being an insider or
outsider, a sense of history and tradition or of novelty and unfamiliarity (Cresswell,
2005). Bourdieu (1977) postulated that learners interpret information through constructs
of cultural capital and habitus. This is the exposure to and level of educational and
socioeconomic backgrounds of the learners, and habitus, the socially conditioned
behaviors and perceptions that tacitly affect students’ decision-making processes and
their academic mobility. Cultural capital is the accumulation of scholastic wealth such as
transitioning to credit programs leading to a degree. The degree is a cultural totem that is
valued by society, provides status, and leads to advancement in the field. Habitus is
defined as the conscious and unconscious actions and perceptions of learners that impact
academic and social mobility (Bourdieu, 1977).
Through habitus, we react to situations in ways that reflect generational
conditioning. According to Bourdieu (1977), individual members of a class that have
high cultural capital know how to access resources within the system through their
habitus. Non-traditional students with origins that provide high cultural capital

!

95!

successfully transition to college with an equal readiness as traditional students. These
students come from environments with individuals with degrees, active social lives,
leisurely travels, and strong financial stability.
Bourdieu (1977) stated that habitus may be deeply ingrained yet can be uncovered
and reflected upon by the individual. Furthermore, habitus was not static and
predetermined; individuals with opportunity, information, and access can consciously or
unconsciously break from their generational history and forge a new path. Learners from
“low” cultural capital may still successfully transition to college.
Colleges and universities should provide a supportive environment in which
disequilibrium and experimentation can occur by increasing interaction among diverse
groups and individuals. Faculty and staff should assist students and provide tools to
mitigate the conflict when individuals share different points of views and encourage open
discourse of values and norms.
When capable educational leaders embrace the broader purposes of education for
increasing social justice for students in a democratic society, they can have an enormous
impact on their communities. Like John Dewey (1916), I believe that a good society is a
quest that must actively involve all its members; this is a quest for a society that is both
democratic and socially just and it must be pursued by the men and women who lead our
government as well as by those who head our public institutions, especially colleges. In
colleges, this can only be achieved if leaders understand the enormous power they have
to facilitate greater social justice through education.

Study Limitations
This study is limited in terms of the perceptions that I bring to research and how

they guide my research actions. The case study followed students from a single college.
This limits any generalizations that can be construed from the findings. This created a set
of data not entirely representative of the community college system in California.
The quantitative analysis compared success rates in an English composition
course between a cohort of 633 students who completed an information literacy course in
the 2012-2013 academic year with non-cohort students. The quantitative analysis focused
on comparing the difference in success rate through the sequential completion of the
information literacy course, either simultaneously with English composition, one year
prior, or 2 years prior to English composition. The case study utilized historical data,
which limited the ability to have a true control group. A noticeable result is that 71% of
the 633 students completed the English composition course prior to the information
literacy course. One hundred ninety cohort students aligned with the course pattern
studied in this research design.

Recommendation(s) for Further Research and Practice
This study combined two different data analysis methods to identify effective
practices in California community colleges. The quantitative analysis illustrated a link
between sequencing information literacy instruction and English composition. The
strongest indication was a significant improvement in English composition success rates
by completing an information literacy course simultaneously. Focused research on this
single aspect could have system-wide implications. A broad-based study utilizing a

!

97!

control group through a quasi-experimental research design could isolate the single effect
of completing both courses simultaneously. If a systemic link is demonstrated, the
practice of course scheduling, academic advising, and the continuation or required
information literacy instruction could be affected.
An emergent aspect from the quantitative data was the choice students made in
taking the information literacy course in relation to English composition. Seventy-one
percent of students enrolled in the English composition course prior to the information
literacy course, 18% enrolled in both courses simultaneously, and 11% enrolled in the
information literacy course prior to the English composition course. The qualitative data
identified that a large segment of the students (71%) who completed the English
composition course prior to the information literacy course, reflected they wished they
knew about or completed the information literacy course prior to the English composition
course. This data and resulting success rate in English composition could affect the
practice of academic advising and educational planning.
Conducting additional research at multiple community colleges to identify student
achievement trends related to the sequencing of an information literacy course and a
composition course and students’ perception related to cultural capital and habitus is
warranted. As quoted in Jenson (2004), E. D. Hirsch Jr. stated, “knowledge builds on
knowledge. Through connecting concepts and leveraging skills, new knowledge can be
created more readily. This builds over a lifetime, producing capital that is deployed
through habitus. Competency in applying and utilizing those skills, habits and attitudes
enables one to make sounder and timelier decisions to cope with personal and family
health and welfare, educational, job-related, citizenship and other challenges (Horton,

!

98!

2008, p. 10).
Conclusion
In this research study, I have asserted that student success in a composition course
could be affected through sequencing of information literacy skills. Results, while
localized, illustrated a positive affect on the student success rates in a composition course
when an information literacy course is taken the same semester. Arguably, a larger scale
project would allow generalizations and causation to be developed. I believe information
literacy is foundation to composition and civic engagement. Without the ability to
analyze, synthesize, and find relevant information, students cannot progress academically
and put themselves at the mercy of others. Recent development in the United States and
globally concerning the dissemination of fake-news or alternative-facts underscores the
importance of an information literate society.
Cultural capital is a concept that has potential value to view information literacy
attributes related to privilege, social justice, and inequity. Groups and individuals with
low cultural capital are at risk from dominant groups with more capital. Habitus can be
altered through conscious and unconscious experiences. Scholarly writing and
information literacy skills taught with the academic setting can alter habitus, which
student can employ to make sounder and timelier decisions to cope with personal and
family health and welfare, educational, job-related, citizenship and other challenges. The
research in this study illustrate that students unconsciously reflected on their increased
habitus through open-ended questions. They articulated the knowledge gained could be
deployed in other aspect of their lives or academic pathway.
Increasingly society is pivoting away from the ideals of public service to

!

99!

consumerists approach. This approach creates notions that public and civic services can
be delivered as commodities to consumers. In education, the consumers are students.
Students, as consumers, are presented with information analogous to purchasing a car.
Benchmarks, scorecards, and accountability measures are deployed to compare and
contrast higher education institutions. This education accountability is aligned with the
ideology of new managerialism. Agencies outside of education audit and make
assessment of teaching and learning resulting in further strengthening mangerialism. The
relationships of power and dominance are changing with students having an increasingly
indirect link to educational policy.
Before I conceived of doing this study, I committed myself to championing
information literacy in community colleges and my local community. In a information
rich world; information is power. I wanted to stop the skills from being places in silos.
Skills from different disciplines can be leveraged to improve student success. I believe
that I have achieved that in this study. I am profoundly changed by the experience and
predict that college will continue to push against consumerist practices and leverage
disciplines for the success of the whole individual.
