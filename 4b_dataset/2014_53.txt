ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
I am very grateful to my four supervisors over the course of this project: Sheila Corrall, Sheila
Webber, Peter Marsh and Sue Ashpitel. In particular, I would like to thank Sheila Corrall, who
formulated the original proposal, recruited me to undertake this research and provided so
much guidance and support in the first two years of this PhD; and Sheila Webber, who
provided valuable new insights after stepping in to act as primary supervisor for the third year
of this research.
Without this supervisory team there would have been no project; without the people who
participated in this research, I would have had nothing to say. I’m very grateful to everyone
who participated in this project, whether as interviewees, survey respondents or the many
British Library staff who have helped me so much. I am also grateful to my colleagues past and
present who took the time to help me test my surveys by responding to pilot questionnaires.
I am grateful to my family, including my parents and brother and sister who have all helped me
in countless ways over the years and who encouraged me to believe in the value of discovery
and learning.
Finally, thank you Jessie, my cariad, for all your support and for your constant enthusiasm for
everything to do with libraries.

ABSTRACT
This collaborative research project, supported by the British Library, used a case study of the
library collection for social enterprise to develop a conceptual approach to the library
collection in the digital world, exploring stakeholder perceptions of collections, terminology
and collection development and management processes.
A mixed-methods multiphase case study design was used to address the research questions.
Three strands of data collection are described: a case study of the British Library’s collections
and content for social enterprise, searches for relevant material on 88 publicly accessible UK
library catalogues, and an exploratory sequential study involving stakeholder interviews (19
interviews with 18 people) followed by two surveys of a larger stakeholder population (149
completed responses in total).
Findings from each strand are described and three core concepts of collection are identified:
“collection-as-thing”, “collection-as-process” and “collection-as-access”. Conventional views of
library collections may tend to focus more on the idea of “collection-as-thing”; this research
emphasises the importance of taking a more dynamic view of collection.
Three models of collection are described: a revised collection development hierarchy which
suggests links to different levels of strategic management; a model of interrelationships
between the three concepts of collection; and a model which examines how collection adds
value to content by providing context.
This research demonstrates that the concept of collection remains highly relevant in the
digital world, although the onus is on libraries to embrace all dimensions of these three
concepts of collection if they wish to add maximum value to the content they identify, select,
hold, make accessible and to which they connect.

1. INTRODUCTION
This research is a collaborative project between the British Library and the University of
Sheffield Information School, supported by a British Library Concordat Scholarship. It aims to
develop a conceptual model of collection in the digital world, by using information for social
enterprise in the UK as an exemplifying case study to explore broader issues relating to
collection and collection terminology in modern library and information services. The project
began in October 2010 and concluded in autumn 2013. The project has taken a pragmatic
approach to addressing the aims and objectives of the research, using a mixed-methods
research design with three main strands: a case study of the British Library’s collections for
social enterprise; catalogue searches of 88 other UK libraries; and 19 interviews with 18 people
to generate ideas about collection in relation to social enterprise, which have then been tested
using surveys of a larger number of library and information practitioners and people involved
in social enterprise.
1.1 Project background
The British Library is the national library of the United Kingdom and, under legal deposit
legislation, it is entitled to receive a copy of every printed work published in the UK. The
Library was established following the recommendations of the National Libraries Committee
(1969). It was underpinned in legislation by the British Library Act (1972), which described its
aim as:
“the establishment for the United Kingdom of a national library, to be known as “the
British Library”, consisting of a comprehensive collection of books, manuscripts,
periodicals, films and other recorded matter, whether printed or otherwise.”
“Collection” is therefore central to the British Library’s legal purpose and, unusually, is defined
in legislation, focusing on printed materials, film and “recorded matter”. As of 2010 it had
around 150 million collection items, including international materials and items in a wide range
of different formats, and is a research library of global importance (British Library, 2010a: 1).
The research proposal, developed by the original project supervisor, Professor Sheila Corrall,
emerged from a successful joint project undertaken by the British Library and the University
from October 2009 to March 2010, involving a six month internship which led to the
development of a number of guides for practitioners and researchers working in the field of
social enterprise (University of Sheffield Enterprise, 2011), as well as to the creation of a
detailed bibliography of relevant items from the British Library’s collection (Walker, 2010). The
field of social enterprise therefore seemed to provide a useful focus for a study about the
concept of the library collection in the digital world.
1

The British Library’s approach to collection strategy since 2006 was outlined in its Content
Strategy (British Library, 2006). The Library has now published its Content Strategy for 20132015 (British Library, 2013b) which identifies the following key principles:
1. Presenting content activities in relation to subjects and disciplines (rather than world
regions or formats);
2. Identifying priority subject areas within disciplines for more intense collecting and
connecting activity;
3. Applying format expertise across subjects and disciplines;
4. Using legal deposit of UK publications as the basis of the Library’s content
development, especially following the introduction of non-print legal deposit and the
start of large-scale harvesting of the UK web domain;
5. Selecting materials for acquisition, which are beyond the scope of legal deposit, based
on their value to research;
6. “Connecting to content will become more important” – a preference is expressed for
connecting to remote digital content, rather than holding materials locally;
7. Increasing focus on supporting inter-disciplinary / multi-disciplinary research;
8. Continuing investment in heritage items and acquisitions;
9. Conducting a review of the budget for acquisitions;
10. Prioritising collection of and connection to digital content rather than print;
11. Exploring new ways of using curator expertise and user and community engagement
to add value to content;
12. Increasing the amount of Library content accessible online to remote users.
The ongoing work by the British Library to review and develop its approach to collection and
content in the digital world illustrates the value of focussing an element of this study on the
UK’s national library. This is also supported by the Library’s reorganisation in January 2013 into
four divisions, including one called “Collections” (British Library, 2013a), a slightly revised
version of its predecessor division “Scholarship and Collections”.
1.2 Researcher perspective and motivation
My personal motivation for undertaking this research was based on interests developed during
my MA Library and Information Studies course at University College London, particularly
relating to collection development in the digital age, and on my previous work experience. I
undertook a Graduate Traineeship at Gladstone’s Library in North Wales – a special library
built around the personal book collection of the 19th century politician and Prime Minister –
which included placements with both the National Library of Wales, where I was based in the
Legal Deposit unit, and with the local public library service. During my MA studies, I benefited
from work experience in a media organisation’s research and information department, and I
have also worked in libraries at Imperial College London, Anglia Ruskin University and, more
recently, at the School of Health and Related Research at the University of Sheffield. This has
given me personal experience of library and information collections in a diverse and varied set
of organisations.
2

My experience as a library practitioner gave me valuable insight into the practical aspects of
current trends and developments in relation to library collections. At Imperial College I had a
minor role in measuring journal backruns for deduplication as part of the UK Research Reserve
(UKRR) project. At Anglia Ruskin I assisted users in accessing and using the Electronic Theses
Online Service (EThOS) and assisted in the development and management of the library’s
collection for health and social care subjects – including engaging in discussions about linking
to PDF and Word documents which are freely accessible on the web and about the acquisition
of electronic books, the variety of supplier models and issues surrounding long-term access to
these materials. I saw this PhD project as an opportunity to pursue my personal interests in
these topics and as an opportunity to make a contribution to current debates on collection
topics within the profession.
Also relevant to the development of my perspective on this project was my experience of
working for some years in college administration at the University of Oxford. My perspective
regarding the value of taking a broad approach to studying perspectives on collection from
different types of organisation was informed by my personal experiences of working in one of
the UK’s oldest academic institutions, as well as in one of its newest universities. Similarly, my
interest in including health social enterprise organisations which have spun out of the NHS
stems partly from my personal experience of supporting library users working in medical and
health and social care subject areas.
1.3 Collection in the digital world and definitions
Despite the relatively recent emergence, during the latter half of the twentieth century, of
collection development and management as key areas of professional library practice, the
concept of the collection has traditionally been central to, and even synonymous with, the idea
of a library (Corrall, 2012a). However, technological changes fundamentally challenge
traditional models of the library collection centred around the ownership and control of
physical holdings or stock, as opposed to the much more fluid reality of what Brophy (2007:
120) terms “the ‘information universe’” of the digital world. These changes include:






the availability of information via the web;
library subscriptions to electronic databases, e-journals and e-books;
the proliferation of new formats;
the development of mobile devices capable of accessing web-based content;
the impact of crowd sourcing, social networks and cloud computing.

This research therefore examines the relevance of “collection” in the modern library and
proposes new conceptual approaches to collection in a world increasingly characterised by the
development and use of digital technologies, referred to here as “the digital world”. Indeed,
3

the British Library’s use of the term content rather than collection suggests that collection may
be more closely associated with the physical library and with ideas of items owned and held by
a library, rather than electronic resources to which a library can provide access.
Collection development and management continues to be “about options – making choices”
(Corrall, 1988: 2) but it can also be seen as being about problems. The term problem is used
here in the expanded sense suggested by Dewey (1933: 121): “whatever—no matter how
slight and commonplace in character—perplexes and challenges the mind so that it makes
belief at all uncertain”. From McColvin (1925) to Ranganathan (1957) to Gore (1976),
discussions of the library collection are characterised by descriptions of problems and
suggested solutions. However, the potential usefulness of a general problem-centred approach
to the collection only rarely emerges. Schwartz (1989: 333) discusses the potential applicability
of the “garbage can process” model to selection decisions, where “problems, participants,
choice opportunities, and solutions” happen to be brought together in a particular context.
Atkinson (1991: 42) expands on this to argue that the approach highlights “the instability and
relativity” of collection development and management processes. Klein (1996: 140-144)
describes the relationship between the emergence of interdisciplinary approaches and the
need to address specific problems. In particular, she highlights how planning theory, based on
assumptions of rationality, has been challenged by approaches which give greater emphasis to
“the day-to-day problems of practice” (Klein, 1996: 142).
The word “problem” can be applied to a range of different interactions relating to library
collections at a number of different levels. Large environmental problems – such as reductions
to budgets, or the “problem of knowledge” (Schwartz, 2007) – may shape collection policies
directly. Smaller problems – such as those encountered by library staff or users on a day-today basis – may remain localised and undocumented, forming part of the tacit knowledge built
up by staff and potentially leading to a proliferation of different procedures for decisionmaking within a single organisation (Schwartz, 1989: 331-332). “Problem” also seems to
provide a useful link word which can connect the user’s motive for consulting, and aspects of
the user’s experience of, the library collection with the issues encountered by the librarian
when developing, managing and facilitating access to the collection. Lee (2005) distinguishes
between user and librarian perceptions of the collection, implicitly identifying the different
problems which define these perspectives, such as problems of access versus problems of
control. A problem-centred approach to the concept of the collection may therefore permit
greater scope for recognising the “dynamic nature of the interaction between the user and the
collection” and the importance of “the active involvement of users” which Lee (2005: 68)
suggests may have been largely overlooked by earlier considerations of collection.
4

It may be argued that the history of terminology of collection activities reflects changing
perceptions of the nature of collection problems. Before the later twentieth century, the core
collection problems were described at a narrower level as “book selection” (McColvin, 1925)
or encompassed in broader terms such as “library administration” (Ranganathan, 1959). The
terms “collection development” and “collection management” subsequently emerged in
response to different sets of problems, as is reflected in the history of the use of the terms
(Johnson, 2004: 14-15). Corrall (2012a: 4-7) outlines the different approaches to using these
terms, particularly the trend towards viewing them as synonymous, and the alternative
argument for maintaining the distinction between the terms by treating them as
complementary: “practitioners generally differentiate staff development from staff
management” (italics from the original) and there is a persuasive case to continue to
distinguish between collection development and collection management. Atkinson (1991: 31)
also notes the trend towards “equal or at least parallel” use of the terms. Atkinson (1998: 1011) advises that the terms “collection management” and “collection development” should be
understood as representing distinct collection processes: “we need terms that separate...
selection (collection development) from policies and actions that affect the status of an object
subsequent to its selection.” He goes on to suggest that the potential loss of a collection
development (materials) budget – as a consequence of greater end user involvement in
materials selection – emphasises the importance of clearly distinguishing between the costs of
developing and managing the collection (Atkinson, 1998: 10-11). For the purposes of this
project the phrase “collection development and management” is generally used to describe
the totality of library collection policies and practices, reflecting Johnson (2004: 2) by using the
two terms “in tandem”. However, they are not used synonymously. Instead, the two
component terms are defined following Atkinson (1998):
Collection development: the “programs and processes by which library materials are
selected”. (Atkinson, 1998: 10)
Collection management: “the activity of adding value to – or deleting value from –
objects subsequent to their selection”. (Atkinson, 1998: 7)
These definitions are quite precise in their treatment of the two concepts of collection
development and collection management. The definition of collection development does not
appear to consider items which have not been actively selected or the level at which selection
might take place. For example, instead of all the individual journals within a Big Deal bundle
being actively selected on their own merit, the subscription may be chosen for its overall
coverage. However, both these definitions provide useful starting points for the discussion of
collection development and management in this thesis.
5

It is also possible to conceive of a library where the nature of the relevant problems means the
collection requires management, but not development – for example, collections located in
heritage sites, such as those maintained by the National Trust (Fuggles, 1988). Less likely, but
not impossible, is the example of a new collection in the early stages of development which is
built up with less emphasis on how it will be managed for the long term. In a single library and
a single financial year, the balance between collection development and collection
management activities can shift according to the availability of financial resources and the
routines and priorities of the parent organisation. The relationship between collection
development and collection management can therefore be seen as more dynamic and fluid
than seems to be suggested by definitions which subsume one within the other.
Broadus (1991: 18-19) suggests that increased interest in collection development policies in
the 1960s and 1970s may have been due to the problems associated with defining collection
priorities in sufficient detail for use with approval plans. Indeed, whilst collection development
and management policies can be seen as “a framework within which individuals can exercise
judgment” (Evans and Saponaro, 2005: 52) they can also be described at least in part as a
series of statements about anticipated problems.
McColvin (1925: 109) provides a useful definition of the library as a “collection of active
elements”, a function of which is to provide a “systematic union of the units of knowledge,
whereby they gain in value and utility”. This may be seen as suggesting some of the
dimensions in which problems relating to the collection may emerge: objects (“units of
knowledge”), systems, and services (adding “value and utility”). Makri et al. (2007) compare
the mental models of traditional and digital libraries held by a small number of postgraduates
studying library and information studies or human-computer interaction. Although the
emphasis is on the users’ mental models, and how these help or hinder access to information
sources, they also describe the problems participants experienced in relation to individual
objects (for example, where an individual copy of a book is located, time taken to locate it,
assessing its relevance), to systems (linking out to different digital libraries, classmark
browsing, catalogue use), and to services (different loan lengths, item requesting services,
enquiry / training services, technical support).
1.4 Social enterprise
To focus this research, the relatively new interdisciplinary field of social enterprise is used to
provide a case study of key issues. Social enterprises are “radically different” to other types of
business (Pearce, 2003: 93). Since 1997, social enterprise has been promoted by successive
governments as an alternative to purely public or private sector approaches to addressing
6

social problems or delivering public services. Social enterprise can be seen combining
particular strengths from public, private and voluntary sectors, providing “business solutions to
social problems” (Teasdale, 2010) and includes organisations such as cooperatives or mutuals.
The field is of interest to actual and potential social enterprise practitioners, to policymakers
and to researchers. Public sector organisations, such as the NHS, have been encouraged to
consider spinning out to form social enterprises, or to commission services from social
enterprise providers (Department of Health, 2007).
For the purposes of this project, the definition of social enterprise devised by the UK
government in 2002 will be used:
“A social enterprise is a business with primarily social objectives whose surpluses are
principally reinvested for that purpose in the business or in the community, rather
than being driven by the need to maximise profit for shareholders and
owners.”(Department of Trade and Industry, 2002: 7)
The problems which may lead social enterprises to seek information may be similar to the
financial and management issues facing other types of business. Like small businesses, social
enterprise stakeholders may “see ‘business problems’ not ‘information problems’” (Webber,
1999: 186).
Some of the particular challenges posed by social enterprise for library collection development
and management include:


its interdisciplinary nature;



the diverse range of potential stakeholders;



the significance of more transient content generated by the social enterprise
community;



the role of virtual communities and networks in the field.

1.5 Collection and information seeking behaviour
Further discussion of problem solving and decision-making is found in the literature of
information behaviour (Case, 2012: 96-99). Although not the main focus of this research,
aspects of the information seeking by, and the information behaviour of, people interested in
social enterprise are explored in this thesis. Information seeking has been defined as “a
conscious effort to acquire information in response to a need or gap in your knowledge” (Case,
2012: 5), whilst the field of information behaviour can be summarised as exploring how people
“need, seek, manage, give, and use information" (Fisher et al., 2005a: xix). Examining aspects
of this in this research should provide insight into the factors involved in the use or non-use of
7

library collections for social enterprise. It may also highlight resources used or created, which
libraries do not currently collect, but for which libraries may have a potential future role in
facilitating access, or preserving.
1.6 Thesis structure and publications from this research
Following this introduction, Chapter 2 provides a literature review focusing on collection, social
enterprise and a brief overview of key models relating to information-seeking behaviour.
Chapter 3 provides a detailed methodology. Chapters 4-7 report on the findings of each of the
strands of this project, referring back to the main research questions. Chapter 8 presents a
discussion introducing three models of collection in the digital world. Chapter 9 summarises
key findings and concludes the thesis.
Parts of the literature review have been submitted and accepted for publication in the second
yearbook in the Chandos Digital Information Review series (Roberts, in press). This also
included a version of the discussion of terms such as sharing, search and collection, found in
section 8.2.1 of this thesis. Results from the interviews and surveys have also been briefly
summarised in previous publications (Roberts, 2013a; Roberts, 2013b).
The initial model of a revised collection development hierarchy outlined in section 8.4 of this
thesis (Table 8.4b) was first published in Corrall and Roberts (2012). The expanded discussion
of this hierarchy draws heavily on material previously published in Roberts (2013b). A version
of Table 9.5.1 was also published in Roberts (2012a).
1.7 Research aim and objectives
Following the detailed review of the literature relating to relevant aspects of collections and
social enterprise and outlined below in Chapter 2, and revisions to the initial aims and
objectives described in the methodology (Chapter 3), the following final research aim was
developed:
To use a case study of the library collection for social enterprise to develop a
conceptual approach to the library collection in the digital world, exploring
stakeholder perceptions of collections, terminology and collection development and
management processes.
The phrase “library collection for social enterprise” has been used to suggest a wider range of
material than just content specifically about social enterprise. The preposition “for” has been
used rather than alternatives (such as “on” or “about”) to include both materials directly
related to social enterprise and those on other topics which may be consulted by stakeholders
in the course of their work relating to social enterprise. For example, a social enterprise
8

practitioner may consult content relating to the purpose of the social enterprise (such as a
social or environmental problem which the social enterprise aims to address), as well as
materials on financial or management issues, which emerge in the course of running a
business. This choice of phrasing was made in the very early stages of the research (November
2010), with the intention of adding further breadth to the project and to allow the project to
reflect the information which people interested in social enterprise actually need and use
rather than a pre-defined view of what constitutes a collection about social enterprise.
The objectives of this research are:
1. To describe the characteristics of the library collection for social enterprise.
2. To describe aspects of the use of the library collection for social enterprise.
3. To investigate the self-described information seeking behaviour of people interested in
social enterprise.
4. To investigate stakeholder perceptions of the library collection for social enterprise.
5. To describe the wider issues relating to collections in the digital world, identified by
this study.
6. To synthesise findings from 1-5 to provide a model of the concept of the collection.
These objectives progress from the descriptive, to more exploratory, investigative objectives,
to a final more theoretical objective. In the context of library collections, “use” is used
throughout this thesis to refer to a broad range of ways in which information, library services
or resources may be utilised. Forms of use can be described by quantitative indicators (usage
statistics) or through qualitative descriptions of particular examples of use of resources by
individual participants. In this thesis, the term “usage” is used to refer specifically to usage
statistics. These include statistics showing how many times documents or items have been
accessed, requested, viewed or downloaded.
In addition to the explicit research objectives given above, the project has attempted to have a
practical impact on the provision of information for social enterprise, both by raising the
profile of social enterprise to the library community and by increasing social enterprise
stakeholder awareness of the resources which libraries have to offer. In particular, the
research has also sought to influence the British Library’s approach to developing and
managing collections relevant to social enterprise, and may also have broader implications for
collection development and management strategies within the Library. At a more basic level,
close interaction with British Library staff and systems has provided opportunities both to
engage in routine ongoing professional discussions within the Library and to offer a fresh
perspective on aspects of the Library’s services and projects.

2. LITERATURE REVIEW
2.1 Introduction
This chapter begins by outlining the methodology used to conduct the literature review. It
discusses key issues in defining “collection” and inter-domain differences between museum,
archive and library approaches to the concept of collection. The literature review then follows
the structure suggested by Evans and Saponaro (2005) and Cassell and Futas (1991), beginning
with discussions of information needs assessments and community analysis, including some of
the challenges posed by emerging geographically distributed communities of practice. It
considers the use of collection policy documents to set priorities for the selection of library
materials, and the process of selection. As this project relates to the British Library, the
challenges posed to legal deposit in the digital world are also briefly discussed. The review
then considers the impact of digital technologies upon access to library collections and
collection data, approaches to collection evaluation and initiatives in collaborative collection
development and management. This is followed by a brief discussion of issues relating to
information seeking behaviour. The final section explores the background to social enterprise,
its terminology, the current UK political context in which social enterprises are operating and
the information needs of, and information services available to, people who are interested in
this field.
2.2 Literature review methodology
Hart (1998: 27) identifies eleven reasons for a literature review. Using these as a starting point,
this literature review aims to provide:




a historical overview of the key topics and the development of knowledge in these
fields;
descriptions and analysis of the main theoretical debates and practical issues relating
to each topic;
discussions of methodological approaches to investigating these topics.

An initial literature review was conducted between January and April 2011, in three main
sections, structured in the following way:




Section 1:
o Collection background and characteristics (how collections have changed)
o Community analysis and libraries for communities of practice
o Approaches to material selection
Section 2:
o Collection access issues
o Approaches to collection evaluation
o Collaborative collection management
10



Section 3:
o Social enterprise

A review of literature comparing public library and academic library collection provision for
small and medium enterprises was completed as part of a Doctoral Development Programme
module ‘Systematically reviewing the literature’, submitted in February 2011. This involved
data extraction from 32 studies written between 1967 and 2009. Of these, only six articles
which appeared to be most relevant to contemporary social enterprise have been included in
the literature review in this thesis. Additional material, including material for the information
behaviour section, was identified and added in 2013.
The main databases searched for material relevant to collection topics were LISA, LISTA, and
Library Literature. Emerald Management Reviews and Web of Knowledge were searched for
both collection and social enterprise topics. For social enterprise topics, the following
databases were searched: ASSIA, IBSS, Social Services Abstracts and Sociological Abstracts.
OpenDOAR and OpenSIGLE were also searched for relevant institutional repository content
and relevant grey literature, respectively. The literature review covers a wide range of topics
and search terms included very broad searches such as “collection development”; “collection
management”; “collection” and “concept”; “social enterprise” and “information”, and more
specific terms, such as “collection” and “personalisation”; “collection” and “customisation”;
“community of practice”; “collection mapping”; “conspectus”. Relevant references from books
and articles retrieved by initial searches were followed up and citation searches were used to
locate later articles referring to particularly relevant items. The items already located also
provided ideas for alternative search terms. Further searches were conducted on collections
for interdisciplinary topics when preparing a paper for the Charleston Conference in November
2011 (Roberts, 2012a). Supervisor recommendations were particularly helpful in developing
the initial approach to the literature review and when preparing the information behaviour
section, which was added in 2013. Early copies of draft supervisor publications (Corrall, 2012a;
Corrall, 2012b; Corrall et al., 2013), together with a copy of an unpublished literature review
and results from a project on Business Information and the Internet (Webber, 2001) provided
useful additional material.
The researcher’s pre-existing personal knowledge of the literature on collection development
and management, gained from modules undertaken as part of a Masters course at University
College London in 2007-2008, and from professional experience of collection development and
management work between 2008 and 2010, also informed the literature review.
Key journals relevant to collection development and management were identified, such as
Collection Building and Collection Management, Serials Review, D-Lib Magazine, Interlending
11

and Document Supply as well as broader academic journals relating to library and information
studies topics, such as Journal of Librarianship and Information Science, Journal of
Documentation, Journal of Academic Librarianship, Journal of Information Science and Journal
of the American Society for Information Science and Technology. A much smaller number of
journals relevant to social enterprise were also identified, including Education, Knowledge and
Economy: A journal for education and social enterprise, Social Enterprise Journal and Voluntas:
International Journal of Voluntary and Nonprofit Organizations. RSS feeds were set up for all of
the journals identified. A complimentary personal subscription to the journal Against the
Grain, provided to delegates of the Charleston Conference, has been an additional source of
very useful information about collection development and management topics from
practitioner, publisher and vendor perspectives.
Relevant materials were recorded using the EndNote X3 bibliographic management tool.
2.3 Problems of definition: collection in museums, archives, records, libraries and the web
Bawden and Robinson (2012: 78) begin their discussion of collections with a single dictionary
definition. However, the term carries multiple meanings: the Oxford English Dictionary (2013)
lists thirteen, including:
“The action of collecting or gathering together”
"The action of collecting money for a religious or charitable purpose, or to defray
expenses, esp. at a religious service or public meeting; also concr. the money so
collected."
“A number of objects collected or gathered together, viewed as a whole; a group of
things collected and arranged, including:
…in a general sense; e.g. of extracts, historical or literary materials…
…of scientific specimens, objects of interest, works of art, etc. spec. The range of
clothes (as for a season, etc.) displayed by a fashion designer; a display of such
apparel…
…A quantity of anything, as water, which has collected into one mass; an
accumulation.”
"The action of collecting or bringing under control (one's thoughts, etc.); the action of
collecting oneself, or state of being collected; composure.”
These definitions convey a range of ideas: collection as a process or activity; collection as
something to which others are invited or expected to contribute; collection as a selected,
structured group of objects; collection conveying an idea of something special or distinctive
(this year’s summer collection from a particular fashion house); collection as an unstructured
aggregation of a substance; or collection as an abstract emotional or mental state. The British
Standards Institution (2009: 2) defines the term collection as the “total body of items, or part
12

thereof, held by a collecting organization”. It deliberately sets out to bring together museum,
library and archive approaches to collections. However, by focussing on the physical ownership
of items, the definition seems problematic for libraries, in which digital resources form an
increasingly significant, if not dominant, part of the collection (Atkinson, 1998: 16; Brophy,
2007: 57-58). Johnson (2004: 255-259) summarises debates regarding access to materials as
opposed to ownership by the local library, observing the impact of journal price increases in
catalysing interest in access-based solutions. Line (1995) advocates the increasing use of access
over ownership mechanisms for older, less well-used material, but advises a continued
emphasis on holdings for more recent publications. In the context of electronic resources
Lagoze and Fielding (1998) define the collection as “a set of criteria for selecting resources
from the broader information space”, echoing Atkinson’s (1996) discussion of the “process of
importation” and the process of defining boundaries to a “control zone” in the online
environment.
Despite the difficulties of attempting to create definitions which apply equally to museums,
archives and libraries, there are potential connections between the approaches to collections
in these fields. The complementary nature of museum and library collections is suggested in a
definition of the two organisations, offered by Brown (1920: 487): “a museum is a collection of
the objects which go towards the formation of a subject, just as a library is a collection of the
literatures connected with a subject or subjects”. Indeed, many donations from individual
collectors which shaped modern museums and libraries included both texts and artefacts.
Macdonald (2006: 84) remarks on what might appear to be the “eclectic and even haphazard”
nature of early modern collections, including “corals, statuary, books, animal skeletons”.
Collections from Hans Sloane formed the basis of the British Museum and its library – the texts
and artefacts “illustrated each other” (Esdaile, 1946: 17-19). Increasing specialisation between
the library and museum saw the books and artefacts separated. Bawden and Robinson (2012:
78-79) define collection as “an organized set of information-bearing items chosen for a
particular purpose in a particular context or environment, and usually unique to that
situation”, and distinguish between “collections of ideas, embodied in documents”, such as a
library, and “collections of objects, which may provoke ideas in the viewer”, such as a gallery.
Although this distinction echoes Brown (1920: 487), it is worth noting that documents are also
objects (physical or digital), just as human-made objects generally do embody ideas.
Pearce (1995: 6-13) situates a discussion of the nature of museum collections and individual
collection of artefacts within a series of possible psychological, philosophical and sociological
discourses. A functionalist perspective examines the relationship between a group of objects
and environment, making economic, social (“prestige”), ideological, and “material culture”
13

statements (1995: 15). It could be possible to apply a similar analysis to a library collection –
these too can involve “prestige” and “institutional capital” (Atkinson, 2006: 245). Developing
library collections may also be seen as “a political task” (Perdue, 1978: 123) although Broadus
suggests that the role of politics was “slow to be recognized” (1991: 10). Pearce (1995: 20-23)
also observes the difficulty of defining the collection in a museum context, but selection plays
a significant role. In a library context, Feather and Sturges (2003: 80-81) provide the definition:
“A planned accumulation of selected artefacts... More broadly, it can also be taken to
include all the information resources to which a library has access, including those
available through physical and virtual networks.”
The initial phrase emphasises the importance of selection in the library collection, providing a
perspective which echoes Perdue (1978: 123): “Collections, to qualify as such, are constructed
by design”. However, the final sentence in Feather and Sturges’ definition – seemingly
intended as a secondary interpretation – appears to conflict with this, suggesting that
accessibility alone (rather than selection) may define the collection.
McColvin (1925: 109) implies that system in organisation, rather than specifically in selection,
constitutes the library collection:
“The library does not and cannot function as an entity, but only as a collection of
active elements... This systematic union of the units of knowledge, whereby they gain
in value and utility, is one of the functions of the library.”
This definition (which in its context seems almost incidental) suggests one significant
difference between the library and museum collection – items in the library have at least the
potential for activity based on what McColvin (1925: 179) later describes as their intrinsic
(content) value. As Ranganathan’s (1957) First Law of Library Science declares, “Books are for
use”. The greater role of use for content in library collections, as opposed to museums and
archives, is echoed by Edwards (2004: 26-27). McColvin’s term “units of knowledge” –
although relating directly to books – seems to have a particular relevance for the modern
library. The idea of added value and utility through entry to the collection may also be seen as
suggestive of later discussions of the privileging of sources through inclusion within a
circumscribed domain of information services (Atkinson, 1996: 241-244).
Elsewhere, Atkinson (1998: 14-15) compares the characteristics of the library for use and the
library as archive or repository, by contrasting the attributes of the library and the archive,
summarised in Table 2.3.

Garfield (1976: 123) also notes a contrast between the perceived preservation and use roles of
archives and libraries, respectively: "To aspire to collect everything is characteristic of an
archivist whose job is to retain materials that are seldom, if ever, used". Although this may
provide a useful way of considering differences between archives and libraries, examples of
each exist at different points on the spectrum of preservation and use. Many research libraries
do include significant holdings of low use older materials, and take active responsibility for
their preservation. Edwards (2004: 28-29) discusses the life cycle and continuum approaches
to processes affecting collected objects, both concepts closely associated with records
management (Shepherd and Yeo, 2003: 5,8-9). Both Manoff (2004) and Edwards (2004)
encourage further examination of how the approaches to collections used by museum and
archive or records professionals can apply to libraries. Some libraries already have explicit
roles in the record management activities of their parent organisations (Jackson, 1988: 61-63;
Atkinson and Morgan, 2007: 65; Griffiths, 2007: 111-112; Nixon and Allison, 2007: 122).
Libraries without a records management role may have other responsibilities for managing
institutional content. Content management is an increasingly significant role, potentially
subsuming collection management (Budd and Harloe, 1997). Content management may
include capturing and making available institutions’ resources (Dempsey, 2003: 34), for
example in institutional repositories or in projects to organise re-useable learning objects
(Belliston, 2009: 285; Morris, 2009). Some of these developments may be seen as having been
anticipated by Atkinson’s (1996: 252-253) advocacy of the potential role for libraries in reappropriating mechanisms for scholarly exchange.
A number of papers have suggested models of the library collection in the context of digital
technology. Manoff (2000) explores some of the conceptual challenges posed to traditional
ideas of library collections by electronic documents and particularly by the web. Heaney (2000)
15

provides a useful model of the relationships between content, items, collections and
catalogues, although his suggestion that “It is possible to envisage a 'Collection' consisting of
one Item” (Heaney, 2000: 5) seems counterintuitive. Casserly (2002) outlines five questions to
inform local collection decisions when building what Rusbridge (1998) termed the “hybrid
library”, where print and digital resources coexist and are integrated “into a library reflecting
the best of both worlds”. Casserly’s questions are informed by four themes from the print
collection: ownership, place, control and permanence (Casserly, 2002: 579-581). Gorman
(2003: 459) suggests four levels to the collection, from physical local items, to the physical
collection available via interlending services, to local subscription-based electronic objects, and
finally the freely accessible electronic collection. Gorman argues that “each level is less
organized and harder to gain access to than its predecessor”, although this claim dramatically
underestimates the immediacy and convenience of access to freely available web-based
documents. More recently, Wickett et al. (2011) have applied formal logic to analyse the
relationship between collections and sets.
Despite these papers, there have been relatively few previous empirical research studies into
concepts of the library collection, although those conducted by Lee (2003a; 2003b; 2005;
2008) suggest possible conceptual frameworks, as well as providing useful examples of how
research in this area may be conducted. Lee (2000) describes some of the problems with
previous attempts to define the library collection, and proposes an approach to collections
based on the perspectives of both the collection provider and the user. Lee’s subsequent
studies have explored the relevance of this framework to various collections, collection
processes and information seeking behaviour. Lee (2003a) uses a case study of the
development of an interdisciplinary women’s studies collection in an American academic
library to explore the role of political and social factors in the collection development process.
Lee (2003b: 432) suggests a model of three types of information space used by academics to
meet their work-related information needs, moving from their “immediate space” of the
offices to the “outside space” represented by bookshops and other external information
providers. The model locates internet access from office computers within the “immediate
space”. A later article brings together studies of academics’ and librarians’ perceptions of the
concept of the collection, highlighting the differences between these perspectives, particularly
between the importance of “instant availability” to users and the largely managerial criteria
suggested by librarians (Lee, 2005). Another study investigated the information seeking
behaviour of undergraduate students, including their use of library collections and suggests
how the structure of collections and the design of library catalogues could be improved, for
example by taking account of the differing intellectual levels of items, as well as subject focus
16

or physical location (Lee, 2008). Lee’s work also provides an example of an individual scholar’s
movement from working on highly technical library-oriented topics – collection control,
formula for material evaluation and methods of predicting likely levels of future use (Lee,
1993) – to a much more user-oriented approach, examining broader topics relating to
information seeking behaviour (Lee, 2003b; Lee, 2008).
Use of the idea of collection in relation to digital sources, including the web and social media
tools, shows how the term is used beyond library or domain-specific environments. This raises
issues including scale – the web itself can be described as a “a vast collection of completely
uncontrolled heterogeneous documents” (Brin and Page, 1998), whilst other sources may
describe much smaller groups of material on particular topics as a collection (PLOS One, 2013).
Docstoc, a document sharing website for small businesses, emphasises not only the topicbased nature of collections, but also the use of collections to “Organize and publish related
documents” (Docstoc, 2013). Flickr (2013) provides detailed FAQs about its collections tool, a
feature of its subscription accounts, describing how collections can include other collections or
sub-groups of images called sets, and how collected content can be rearranged, summarising
collections with the words: “Isn't this just sets of sets? Yes, but no. It's better”.
2.4 Library collection development and management
Evans and Saponaro (2005) describe a cycle of collection development processes which begins
with an assessment of the information needs of the library’s user community (sometimes
known as community analysis), followed by the development of appropriate policies to frame
the library’s approach to meeting these needs. Materials or resources are then selected,
acquired and accessioned into the library and are made accessible to users. Over time, item
use is monitored and the collection is evaluated. Items may be relegated to less accessible
locations (such as off-site stores) or permanently withdrawn from the collection. Alternatively,
they may be conserved and preserved, to keep them accessible for future users. This section
explores some of these processes in more detail, with reference to the opportunities and
challenges presented by digital technology.
2.4.1 Community analysis and communities of practice
Evans and Saponaro (2005: 20-46) examine the process of assessing the information needs of a
community. Here the focus is on the public library context – “a community” based in a
particular geographic area. An academic library generally serves people who belong to that
academic institution, whether or not they are located near the library, although the library
may also permit use by members of the general public or visiting scholars. Similarly, special
17

libraries, including workplace libraries, serve members of a particular audience or interested in
a specific topic. Finally, a national library serves multiple audiences – from users in the local
area, to those living elsewhere in the country, to an even wider international audience. Evans
(1976: 454) claims “Community analysis is as basic to library management as the physician’s
diagnosis is to the practice of medicine”, whilst methods of carrying out community analysis
include the use of census data (Kunz, 1976), tally sheets for librarian observations and
customer surveys (Massey, 1976; Evans and Saponaro, 2005: 37-40) in public libraries, or
course enrolment figures and informal conversations with academics in university libraries
(Govan, 1976). More recently, Whipple and Nyce (2007) have explored the potential
usefulness of ethnography in informing community analysis (in this case, in a community in
Romania) suggesting that it allows “a more inclusive, user-centered analysis; one that
emphasized discovery and interpretation over inference, deduction, and prediction” (Whipple
and Nyce, 2007: 703).
2.4.1.1 Communities of practice and online communities
Although the community served by a library may be based around a particular area, this may
also include numerous communities of practice, defined by O’Sullivan (2009: 183) as a
community of people who “pursue collaboration in shared practice” and by Wenger et al.
(2002: 4) as "groups of people who share a concern, a set of problems, or a passion about a
topic, and who deepen their knowledge and expertise in this area by interacting on an ongoing
basis."
O’Sullivan (2009) shows how the concept of a community of practice can be applied to
influential historical groups – including the scholars of the Mouseion at the Library of
Alexandria, the founders of the Royal Society and the creators of the Oxford English Dictionary.
The groups use innovative contemporary technologies to communicate and share their work
(O'Sullivan, 2009: 32); examples of modern communities of practice can be seen collaborating
and sharing through Wikipedia. Historically, library and information services often develop for
communities of practice, as was the case in medieval universities and at the Royal Society and
other learned associations.
Modern communities of practice often have at least some online presence such as on bulletin
boards or through email listservs (Cox, 2008: 327). In a public library environment, there may
be significant issues about the provision of expensive resources for particular practice
communities, such as business, particularly if the amount of resource usage is likely to be low
(Wilson and Train, 2006: 51). This is not a new issue – McColvin (1925: 154) discusses the
issues surrounding public library provision of materials for professionals. This perhaps
18

highlights one respect in which public library collection provision differs from academic or
special library provision where users are also, broadly speaking, members of congruent
communities of practice.
Brophy (2007: 50,54) discusses the significance of knowledge management and support for
evidence based practice in workplace libraries, as well as the importance of understanding the
particular language and jargon in use within individual communities of practice. Although Budd
and Harloe (1997: 15) discuss the usefulness of the term “knowledge” in comparison to
“information”, McColvin (1925: 109) shows that both terms have been used within library
literature for some time. Ranganathan (1957: 374), influenced by the development of
documentation studies, discusses the organisational “inefficiency of keeping every worker
informed properly of every new achievement of every other worker, which may be at least
partly or remotely germane to the pursuit of many others” – suggesting a role for the library in
the improved management of internal reports, and describing something which might seem
quite similar to an idea of organisational knowledge management. Ranganathan (1957: 374)
also generalises his use of the term “book” to encompass “the nascent micro thought in the
research sphere”.
Davenport (2001) describes three examples of online communities not restricted to a single
organisation and how these can facilitate knowledge creation. This includes a description of
issues involved in creating “‘engineered’ communities of practice”, where small and medium
enterprises need to work together across organisational boundaries (Davenport, 2001: 68), as
well as the “floating communities” of consumers, which emerge through shared use of
particular internet retail sites (Davenport, 2001: 70). These examples contrast with other
studies of communities of practice, which tend to focus on communities within individual
organisations. Although Wenger et al (2002: 219-231) do describe those communities which
exist between organisations, between companies and customers and in wider society – “a
constellation of communities of practice” (Wenger et al., 2002: 229) – the main case studies
focus on communities within organisations. However, Lin and Hsueh (2006) provide a useful
example of a distributed professional community of practice and show how technology can be
used to support and automate information management processes within the community.
Communities of practice provide new opportunities for library and information professionals
to engage with customers. Huwe (2006) argues that academic librarians should be more
proactive in seeking to identify, join and contribute to local communities of practice, which
may not be restricted solely to communities of students and academics, by embedding
themselves into online community forums and networking tools, as well as using cross19

organisational email lists to push out new content out to these wider communities. Urquhart
et al (2010) also emphasise the importance of intensive engagement by library and
information professionals with the communities of practice they aim to facilitate. Both these
approaches suggest a potentially more proactive role for librarians in communities of practice
than one focused only on managing information created by the community, such as that
suggested by Wenger (2002: 103), who describes how a community of practice may:
“realize they need to continuously gather, assess, and organize materials to keep the
practice repository up-to-date and accessible to practitioners. Coordinators frequently
take on this task, but when the community has a large body of information, the task
can be overwhelming, and it becomes necessary to hire a librarian to fill this role."
2.4.2 Collection development and management policies
From the 1960s, collection development (and later collection management) gave rise to policy
documents (Broadus, 1991: 18; Clayton and Gorman, 2001: 16). These policies may be
separate or integrated into a single document (Clayton and Gorman, 2001: 18). Clayton and
Gorman (2001: 17) define collection development as “a subset of collection management”.
Evans and Saponaro (2005: 52) indicate that collection development policies should provide “a
framework within which individuals can exercise judgment”.
Clayton and Gorman (2001: 17-18) suggest that the policy should be complemented by
internal procedure documents indicating how the policy should be applied in practice. The
perceived advantages of having such policies – for example, by providing an aid to
prioritisation and communication – have frequently been set out (Clayton and Gorman, 2001:
19-21; Evans and Saponaro, 2005: 52-53). Johnson (1997) also shows how these principles can
be applied to creating policies for electronic resources. However, other writers such as Snow
(1996) criticise such policies as being unnecessary. Perhaps the most convincing argument of
both their value and their limitations is Atkinson’s (1990: 98-99) suggestion that such policies
are essentially exercises in political rhetoric. These and other policy documents – such as
reading strategies which aim to manage customer expectations about material availability
(Chelin et al., 2005) – may help to justify library resource allocations to the parent
organisation, but may not necessarily aid communication or decision-making within a library.
Although policies can help to establish a context for both collection development and
collection management, it can still remain an “immense and extremely difficult” task to make
explicit the knowledge which enables successful decision-making (McColvin, 1925: 71).
The contents of collection development policies vary widely depending on their intended
audience and the type of library. Cassell and Futas (1991: 29) recommend that collection
policies should cover at least nine topics, including: the needs of the library’s community; the

users served; the library’s philosophy, mission and aims; approaches to selection, evaluation
and collection maintenance; a statement about intellectual freedom; when the policy will be
reviewed; the approval of the policy by the parent organisation. However, in practice,
collection policy statements take a variety of forms, with significant differences even in the
terminology of their titles and focusing on topics of particular relevance to their individual
libraries. The characteristics of three examples from UK public, academic and national
libraries1 are compared in Table 2.4.2.
These three documents suggest different perspectives on collection development in different
sectors. The public library policy document is colourful and clearly designed to engage and
communicate with library users. The terminology it uses focuses on “stock”, suggesting an
emphasis on turnover and use of materials (also echoed in the discussion of “stock
circulation”) and physical items, rather than access to electronic resources. The sections on
“supplier specification” and “customer involvement” illustrate the role of supplier selection
and customer-focused collection development in this public library service.
In contrast, the academic library policy document focuses on describing in some detail the
library’s collections by loan type and format, and discusses electronic resources as well as
printed material. Although the term “stock” is also used, greater emphasis is placed on
“collection” including a specific section describing the library’s special collections. The policy
also considers the library’s curatorial responsibility for preserving collection items.
The national library policy both discusses the library’s local collections and situates itself as a
co-ordinator and collaborator within the nation’s library landscape. Of the three policies
summarised here, this document provides the strongest strategic vision for the library
collection over a five year period. It favours the use of “collection” rather than “stock” and
considers the impact of digital technology on the library, as well as discussing printed materials
and, like the academic library policy, but in much more detail, it describes the library’s
responsibility for preserving materials. Unlike both the public library and the academic library
policies, deselection, withdrawal or stock editing is not mentioned – there is an expectation
that a national library will usually continue to hold materials it has collected.

These three policies were amongst five examples selected by the researcher for a student discussion
activity, which formed part of a collection development lecture delivered in October 2011.

2.4.3 Methods of selection and acquisition
2.4.3.1 Selection by library staff, library users or resource suppliers
McColvin (1925: 9) describes book selection as “the first task of librarianship”, discussing
demand both in terms of volume (popular items demanded by many users) and value (“the
most desirable” texts (McColvin, 1925: 32)) and argues that the public library has a role in
generating or creating demand for material thought to be more valuable to the library user:
“Are there not means by which we can assist in the improvement of demand, in the
bettering of conditions, desires and tastes?” (McColvin, 1925: 85)
More recently, Usherwood (2007: 70) sums up this issue as a question “do you give the public
what they want or do you concentrate on materials considered good?” and outlines three
contemporary approaches to selection in public libraries as librarian selection (favoured by
only a minority of respondents to his survey); customer selection (favoured by 25% of survey
respondents); and supplier selection (preferred by 46%) (Usherwood, 2007: 27-28). However,
mainstream approaches to selection may have limited usefulness in meeting the needs of
minority communities using public libraries, with librarians needing to engage with both their
user communities and with specialist suppliers in order to obtain materials. Listwon and Sen
(2009) describe the role of the Polish Library in London in providing collection materials to
meet the needs of members of the Polish community in Sheffield, whilst Chapman (2013)
highlights the limitations of conventional approaches to material selection in public libraries in
identifying and acquiring LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Trans) fiction materials for children
and young people.
In academic libraries, however, users such as academic staff have tended to have greater
responsibility for selection decisions. In UK academic libraries, the current level of involvement
of academic staff in selection decision-making may vary depending on the type of university –
older Russell Group universities may favour greater involvement of academic staff in selection,
whereas newer universities may favour librarian selection. In the United States of America, the
transfer of responsibility for selection decisions from academics to librarians began in the
1960s (Atkinson, 1989: 507), although Atkinson (1996: 249) – writing before recent
developments in relation to patron driven acquisitions – suggests that recognition of the
particular role of the expert user in developing digital collections for academic communities
may lead to the re-emergence of the user as selector.
The argument for a potential shift in collection responsibility to the user is supported by
Nicholas (2008). Findings from the CIBER (Centre for Information Behaviour and the Evaluation
of Research) research project, which examined deep log data from electronic library resources,
23

suggest a comparison between online information use and online shopping. Nicholas (2008:
156) proposes academic libraries could provide credits for users to use in purchasing individual
journal articles. Horava (2010: 149) describes the variety of opportunities for innovation in
models for information resource provision including “patron-driven acquisition... pay-per-view
systems, print on demand” but maintains the library’s collection management role remains.
These developments may suggest a shift in roles relating to collection development,
potentially moving away from academic staff as expert users or library subject specialists to
university students.
2.4.3.2 Legal deposit
Legal deposit is defined by Larivière (2000: 3) as:
“a statutory obligation which requires that any organization, commercial or public, and
any individual producing any type of documentation in multiple copies, be obliged to
deposit one or more copies with a recognized national institution.”
For legal deposit libraries, building the collection may be seen as an explicitly political activity.
Partridge (1938: 3) observes that there was an early recognition of the potential to use legal
deposit as a mechanism for censorship. In a modern context, legal deposit provides a method
by which national libraries may be able to preserve the “published heritage” of their countries
(Larivière, 2000: vii). Decisions are needed to enable a nation “to be able to live with its
definition of materials to be deposited” (Larivière, 2000: 35).
Some of the potential challenges of legal deposit were apparent before the introduction of
formal legislation. In the United Kingdom, the first step towards legal deposit came with the
agreement between Thomas Bodley and the Stationers’ Company in 1610 (Partridge, 1938:
17). In what might be seen in modern terms as an impressive display of social capital, Bodley
not only persuaded the Stationers’ Company to supply a copy of every book printed by their
members to the library in Oxford, but also worked “’to stir up other men’s benevolence’” to
donate books in order to develop the library’s collection (Wright, 1939: 359). However, soon
after the agreement was made, Bodley discovered that the material being deposited was not
of the quality he had expected – it included “riffe-raffe” and “baggage bookes” (Partridge,
1938: 20-21). Partridge (1938: 37) suggests that after the Copyright Act of 1709, which
designated nine UK libraries for deposit collection and which linked the process of registration
and deposit with legal protection of the copyright of a text, the items collected mostly included
“the cheaper kind” of works. After the Imperial Copyright Act of 1842, Panizzi systematically
pursued publishers who attempted to evade deposit, and used the copyright privilege to

24

collect retrospectively the titles which were still in print but which had not been deposited
when originally published (Partridge, 1938: 83-87).
The Legal Deposit Libraries Act (2003) provides the current legislative context for legal deposit
in the UK. The legal deposit privilege is held by six libraries: the British Library has an
entitlement to receive a copy of every work published in print in the UK within one month of
publication. The other legal deposit libraries are the National Library of Scotland (where the
library of the Faculty of Advocates receives legal material relevant to their members); the
National Library of Wales; the Bodleian Library, Oxford; the University Library, Cambridge; and
the library of Trinity College, Dublin. These libraries may request, and are then entitled to
receive, any work published in print in the UK, subject to certain exceptions. This Act also
established the framework for the legal deposit of non-print materials, including those
published electronically; the secondary legislation required to implement this part of the Act
passed into law in 2013 (Legal Deposit Libraries (Non-Print Works) Regulations, 2013), coming
into force on 6 April 2013 (British Library, 2013c). These regulations enable the large scale
archiving of the UK web domain, and facilitate the legal deposit collection of other non-print
materials although, perhaps significantly for the study of social enterprise publications, there
are a number of exemptions, including one for “micro-businesses” (defined as having “fewer
than 10 employees”) (Legal Deposit Libraries (Non-Print Works) Regulations, 2013) .
This new role for the legal deposit collection of websites suggest a new potential convergence
of issues regarding deposit and copyright – the legislation provides the Legal Deposit libraries
with “permission, as an exception to copyright, to download copies of works directly from the
internet for archiving purposes" (Department for Culture Media and Sport, 2011: 58,66).
2.4.4 Collection access
The conceptual basis for digitisation as a preservation method covers similar ground to the
arguments for preservation microfilming made by Atkinson (1986). Decisions need to be made
about printed items and their preservation needs, and this “discriminating activity”, like
deselection, can be controversial (Atkinson, 1986: 348). The potential for controversy is welldemonstrated by Baker (2002), who provides an emotive account of library microfilming
programmes conducted in the US during the late twentieth-century, giving examples of bound
newspapers and books damaged by the process and of microfilm already unreadable through
technological obsolescence. Problems with the quality of microfilm surrogates mean that
digitisation projects, such as JSTOR, need to re-scan previously microfilmed material
(Schonfeld, 2003: 73). However, unlike microfilming, digitisation can significantly enhance
access to content. Digitisation is particularly useful for lower use materials, such as printed
25

journal backfiles. The development of JSTOR in the late 1990s demonstrated a considerable
difference between the use of printed backfiles and the use of those made accessible,
searchable and linkable by digitisation (Schonfeld, 2003: 169-170,376). More recently, the JISC
(Joint Information Systems Committee) / Research Libraries UK EThOS project to digitise UK
research theses saw two months’ demand and supply of digitised material outstrip that of
conventional delivery for an entire year (Kent et al., 2009). Low-use special collection materials
have also been digitised to reach a wider audience, including art and maps (Leslie, 2004),
fragile and non-standard document types (Landon, 2009), newspapers (Tanner et al., 2009),
maps from books (Kowal and Martyn, 2009) and ephemera (Lambert, 2006).
Although Project Gutenberg, the first major project to provide digital book content, began in
the 1970s and included 28,000 texts by 2009 (Tomaiuolo, 2009), major systematic book
digitisation projects such as the Google programme (which began in 2004) and the Open
Content Alliance programme (which began in 2005) are more recent innovations (Leetaru,
2008). Leetaru (2008) also distinguishes between the “access digitization” offered by these
projects and the “preservation digitization” favoured by libraries, which tends to be more
expensive and which provides the level of technical security necessary to fulfil a preservation
role. The potential impermanence of the Google collection may be one reason why the project
should not be seen as a competitor to libraries (Dougherty, 2010), although this may not
address the potential competitive advantage which the libraries providing Google content can
appear to enjoy over others (Atkinson, 2006: 249).
Whilst digitisation facilitates distributed access to content, local Online Public Access
Catalogues (OPACs) and collective union catalogues provide increasingly sophisticated ways for
users to access information about items in a library’s collection and, in some cases, provide a
route by which material can be requested and accessed by library users (O'Beirne, 2001). In
the British Library and other “closed stack” libraries, placing a request through an online
catalogue may be the only route by which material can be accessed. Additionally, these
catalogues provide detailed data about collections and how they are used (Lavoie et al., 2007:
107). By 1995, there were estimated to be 700-1,000 Internet-accessible catalogues (Tedd in
Nisonger, 1997: 35). In 2009, the Online Computer Library Center (OCLC) union catalogue
WorldCat included data from 70,000 library collections (Lavoie and Dempsey, 2009) and has
been used in a series of studies to provide valuable insights into collection trends and
characteristics. Lavoie et al (2005) used WorldCat data to explore the nature of the five library
collections which provided early partners for the Google digitisation project. Their findings
included indications of the degree of overlap between the five collections, and suggested that
almost 50% of the works provided by these five US and UK libraries could be in languages
26

other than English (English language materials tend to be more frequently duplicated between
the collections). Lavoie and Schonfeld (2006) explored the entirety of the “system-wide
collection” indicated by WorldCat, highlighting issues such as the apparent loss, or lack of
collection, of a significant proportion of the estimated total historic book production – the socalled “book-gap”. Lavoie et al (2007) describes how digital materials are catalogued, whilst
Lavoie and Dempsey (2009) examines the characteristics of US books potentially in copyright,
illuminating some aspects of the discussion about the Google project to digitise and make
accessible such works. In addition to the relatively well-established data-sharing between
libraries facilitated by OPACs and union catalogues, the more recent movement towards
opening up UK public sector data for reuse has led the British Library to provide free access to
its collection data in a range of formats (British Library, 2010b).
Opportunities also exist to enable customers to personalise and customise the way they view
information resources. There are numerous examples of library and information service
portals providing customisation options, including the My Library features of NHS Health
Information Resources (NHS Evidence, 2011) and the British Library’s Management and
Business Studies portal (British Library, 2010c). Recommendations for a new distributed
business information service for small and medium enterprises include suggestions for
“customisable online services” (British Library, 2009: 67). However, findings regarding the
usefulness of these technologies appear to be mixed. Kalyanaraman and Sundar (2006) suggest
that customisation results in an improved user experience of web portals, although this
research is based on assessing responses to a pre-customised site designed by the researchers
to match user interests. Nichols and Mellinger (2007) found a “general lack of energy for
customizing Web sites” when the responsibility for customisation was given to the
undergraduate participants in their research. Shedlock et al (2010) distinguished between
“personalization” – delivering pre-designed sets of resources on the basis of a particular
speciality – and “customization”, where the user was able to make further changes to suit their
individual needs and which appeared to be less well used.
2.4.4.1 Collection access and the physical collection
This thesis does not specifically address the physical manifestation of collections – how they
appear on the shelves, or where those shelves are located. The issue emerges most directly in
relation to the British Library, in which most material is held in large secure stores on the
Library’s sites at St Pancras and Boston Spa. It is useful to note that holding materials in closed
stacks was more common practice until relatively recently. John Cotton Dana (1914: 41) writes
of his work at Cleveland public library in the late 1880s and early 1890s describing the library
27

as "the first one of good size in our country, and I guess in the whole world, to practice open
access" – that is, one of the first to move from closed stacks to making materials accessible on
open shelves for users to browse.
Some approaches to collection evaluation and measurement do involve examining this
physical manifestation of collection. For example, Baker and Lancaster (1991: 41) describe the
“impressionistic method” of evaluating collections, in which library specialists familiarise
themselves with the collection and physically examine the collection.
2.4.4.2 Collection access, open access and institutional repositories
Atkinson’s (1996: 252-253) discussion of opportunities for libraries to re-appropriate the
mechanisms of scholarly communication may be seen as anticipating the emergence of
institutional repositories and the development of open access initiatives.
Lynch (2003) describes the potential strategic role of institutional repositories as key elements
in the scholarly communication chain in the digital world, giving the following definition:
“a university-based institutional repository is a set of services that a university offers
to the members of its community for the management and dissemination of digital
materials created by the institution and its community members.” (Lynch, 2003: 328)
The Budapest Open Access Initiative (2002) set out the aim of opening up access to scholarly
literature:
"Removing access barriers to this literature will accelerate research, enrich education,
share the learning of the rich with the poor and the poor with the rich, make this
literature as useful as it can be, and lay the foundation for uniting humanity in a
common intellectual conversation and quest for knowledge."
Two specific routes for providing access to this literature were proposed: “self-archiving” and
“open-access journals” (Budapest Open Access Initiative, 2002).
In the UK, recent policy activity relating to open access publishing has been catalysed by the
Finch report on open access (Finch Group, 2012). This has led to the adoption of a policy
requiring peer-reviewed articles accepted for publication after 1 April 2013, which
acknowledge Research Council funding, to be made publicly accessible using either Gold (open
access publication, usually involving the payment of an article processing charge) or Green
(self-archiving by the author in an institutional or subject-specific repository) open access
routes (Research Councils UK, 2013).
Hagerlid (2011) demonstrates how national libraries – in this example, the National Library of
Sweden – can effectively act as a catalyst for the large-scale national adoption of open access
28

policies. Graham (2007) shows how the National Library of Australia expanded its role not only
by including open access publications in its collections, but by providing web space for
publishing open access journals using the Open Journal Systems software.
2.4.5 Collection evaluation
Collection evaluation has generally been divided into two categories: analysis of materials and
analysis of use (Baker and Lancaster, 1991; Heidenwolf, 1994: 34; Clayton and Gorman, 2001:
169-180; Johnson, 2004: 270-290; Evans and Saponaro, 2005: 314-334). Butkovich (1996)
describes use methods including surveys, “reshelving studies”, circulation, unobtrusive user
observation, citation methods, and interlibrary loan use. Baker and Lancaster (1991: 41-71)
describe material evaluation approaches including expert assessment, list checking, citation
analysis (overlapping with Butkovich’s categorisation of this as a use method), quantity (the
size of the collection, or the ratio of materials to users), and collection profiling. Both
Heidenwolf (1994: 34) and Johnson (2004: 279) suggest that citation analysis (checking the
library collection for a selection of items cited in particular subject journals) can provide a
particularly useful evaluation tool for interdisciplinary subjects, although Johnson also
advocates use-centred methods for assessing these collections. Studies also emphasise the
benefits of using an appropriate combination of evaluation approaches in order to build a
more complete picture of the specific collection (Baker and Lancaster, 1991: 39, 80; Butkovich,
1996: 366; Hyödynmaa et al., 2010). Tools used to assess printed collections may also be
adapted to evaluate electronic materials. For example, Price (2007) used citation analysis of
articles by academic staff from a single department to establish whether and how the cited
materials could be accessed. As well as providing an indication of the value of particular
electronic resources, this study also provided a snapshot of the actual information use of a
selection of individual library users.
Another approach is conspectus, in which values between 0 and 5 describe the standard of a
collection in a particular subject. A number of writers regard this as a tool for policy statement
descriptions of collecting levels, rather than for evaluating a collection (Baker and Lancaster,
1991: 73; Clayton and Gorman, 2001: 41; Evans and Saponaro, 2005: 57). However, Johnson
(2004: 275-277) does describe conspectus as an evaluation tool, potentially synonymous with
“collection mapping” (treated separately by Baker and Lancaster (1991: 65-71)). Wood (1996)
also regards the conspectus approach as both a tool for evaluation and for developing policy.
Clayton and Gorman argue that conspectus is less relevant in the context of the provision of
electronic resources, although they also show how conspectus could be amended to reflect a
library’s coverage of electronic materials, with an emphasis on CD-ROM material (Clayton and
29

Gorman, 2001: 44-48; Clayton and Gorman, 2002). A more critical perspective was offered by
Line (1997: 69), who summed up conspectus as time-consuming and generally not useful.
More recently, Hyödynmaa et al. (2010) describes how a Finnish version of conspectus has
been combined with usage statistics for both print and electronic materials using a variety of
methods including shelf scanning and electronic journal usage figures. Kim et al. (2009) created
a visual representation of the density of use of material from particular subject areas within a
special library, using network and cluster analysis of circulation data. Electronic resource
usage data may be exploited in increasingly sophisticated ways, as demonstrated by the CIBER
deep log analysis of electronic journal use (Nicholas and Huntington, 2006; Nicholas et al.,
2008; Research Information Network, 2009). Findings from such data can be explored in
greater depth using qualitative methods, as demonstrated by the Research Information
Network (2011).
Flemming-May and Grogg (2010) describes the development of Project COUNTER (Counting
Online Usage of NeTworked Electronic Resources) from 2002 to standardise usage statistics,
followed by PIRUS or Publisher and Institutional Repository Usage Statistics, aiming to facilitate
the sharing of statistics between publishers and repositories. At a practical level, SUSHI or the
Standardized Usage Statistics Harvesting Initiative aims to rationalise and automate usage data
collection from different publishers. Pesch (2007a; 2007b) provides further details about the
SUSHI protocol and the specific challenges presented in gathering electronic usage data –
especially in the contrast between these data, provided and controlled by publishers, and the
library experience of collecting usage data about printed materials controlled by the library.
As well as very specific initiatives to facilitate the management of quantitative usage data from
electronic resources, the generic library service evaluation tool LibQUAL+ (used in particular by
academic libraries) provides a mechanism for surveying customers’ perceptions of actual and
desired levels of library collections (“Information Control”), as well as aspects of library service
and place (Brophy, 2006: 44-48). This enables access to collections to be viewed in the context
of the whole library system, leading to findings such as those described by Gerke and Maness
(2010) apparently suggesting a correlation between customer perceptions of the library as
place and the use of electronic resources.
New catalogue interfaces such as Encore or Primo encourage user involvement through
tagging, rating and adding reviews to records (Stevenson et al., 2009: 70, 73) – aiming to
emulate more user-friendly interfaces such as Amazon (Lewis, 2008). The open source
resource discovery tool Summa provides search term suggestions based on the entries of other

30

users – one particular implementation includes library subject staff in relevant results listings
(Stevenson et al., 2009: 80-81).
2.4.6 Deselection
Johnson (2004: 139) traces an early example of a library withdrawing stock (deselection, or
weeding) to 1883; Ranganathan (1957: 328, 380) and Dilevko and Gottlieb (2003) both refer to
the Quincy plan of 1892 advocating the withdrawal or transfer of significant amounts of
material and the equalisation of “the rate of weeding out and the rate of accessioning, after
the size of the collection reaches an arbitrary norm” (Ranganathan, 1957: 328). Ranganathan’s
treatment of this proposal apparently alters between the first and second editions of his text –
initially, he argues that it is impractical. However, the second edition includes reflections on
the distinction between library “Child-Growth” and “Adult-Growth... growth by replacement of
constituents without increase in over-all size” giving rise to the distinction between the
“conserving library and service library” and meaning that the Quincy plan can be seen as an
acceptable approach to managing the library collection (Ranganathan, 1957: 378-80). Slote’s
(1997: 48-75) literature review on deselection begins with Charles William Eliot’s 1902 article
distinguishing between “books in use, and books not in use”.
Slote (1997: 3-5) sets out clear advantages of weeding or deselecting material, including
increasing circulation, saving space and improving access to materials which are wanted for
use. He makes a distinction between the “core collection” (material in use) and the unused
“weedable part” of the collection (Slote, 1997: xix). An alternative perspective is offered by
Jones (2007: 226): deselection represents an admission of a failure in the collection process or
an item’s loss of value. Slote also explores the reasons why librarians do not appear to weed as
much as they should (Slote, 1997: 5-6), and the limitations of the subjective weeding strategies
generally used by librarians (Slote, 1997: 21-26). Six standards for weeding are described
(Slote, 1997: 16-17), intended to provide a collection which meets 95% or more of demand
using a locally-established shelf-time indicator. These techniques are outlined in a great deal of
practical detail: Slote provides staff training checklists and template forms for implementing
each technique.
Significant debates about deselection in UK academic libraries took place in the 1970s. Enright
(1975: 71) described the need to address “the problem of stock control” in academic libraries
in order to preserve the value of the library, rather than to diminish it. Discussion was
catalysed by the University Grants Committee (1976) which advocated a steady-state or zero
growth approach to university library collections. The proposal met with a range of responses Watson (1978: 15-16) observed that it was neither “the worst possible fate... nor the best
31

possible compromise” suggesting that the government-led nature of the initiative meant that
“debate about [the] problem is circumscribed by the need to respond immediately”. Durey
(1978: 64) observed that the processes for maintaining a steady-state collection had already
been in use in public libraries for some time. Beyond the UK, a range of perspectives on the
problems of collection growth and possible solutions were described in Gore (1976).
Automation was also seen as having the potential to improve the responsiveness of library
collection systems, by providing management information about collection use (Corya and
Buckland, 1976).
2.5 Collaborative collection development and management
Johnson (2004: 237) identifies three different aspects of library collaboration or cooperation:
“resource sharing, bibliographic access, and coordinated collection development and
management”. Atkinson (1990) suggests two methods of collaborative collection development
– synergistic, where clear collection responsibilities are allocated to each partner library, and
complementary, which is less prescriptive and enables libraries to contribute to collaborative
collection development by selecting additional materials closest to its collection priorities. The
potential tensions between local and collaborative collecting are clear (Atkinson, 1990; Line,
1997; Clayton and Gorman, 2001: 59-60). Hazen (1997) discusses the mixed results of several
examples of collaborative collection development initiatives within the single specialised
interdisciplinary field of Latin American Studies, demonstrating the diversity of American
collaborative initiatives within a single subject area. Line (1997) criticises an apparent lack of
emphasis on aims and evaluations of cooperative programmes, suggesting that more
information is needed about individual initiatives and their outcomes. Both Atkinson (1990)
and Line (1997) suggest that library collaboration in preservation and storage may be more
successful than cooperative acquisitions initiatives.
However, electronic resource acquisitions provide particular opportunities for consortia
dealing with library acquisitions. Providing a supplier’s perspective, Schonfeld (2003: 192-195)
describes the difficulty for JSTOR of dealing with consortia aiming solely to reduce their
purchase costs, whilst also indicating a willingness to make agreements with consortia which
enabled JSTOR to make savings, such as JISC, representing UK higher education (Schonfeld,
2003: 254-255). More recently, the Scottish Higher Education Digital Library (SHEDL) initiative
has developed on the NESLi2 framework of e-journal publisher licence negotiations conducted
by JISC, aiming to provide a single shared “common information environment” for subscribed
SHEDL members (Research Information Network, 2010). After only a year, use of the relevant
e-journals appears to have increased significantly, whilst “cost per use” has declined (Research
32

Information Network, 2010: 30). The breadth of the journal content available also seems to be
a particular advantage for interdisciplinary studies (Research Information Network, 2010: 33).
This initiative seems to develop still further the trend, begun by Big Deal bundles, towards less
locally specialised journal collections, as described by Price (2007). However, this is perhaps
most pronounced in the Higher Education library sector – other sectors, such as health
libraries, continue to rely on a significant degree of local selection of electronic resources, to
complement a nationally defined Core Collection (Kelson, 2008).
Interlending and document supply provides another example of collaborative approaches to
collections, which has become increasingly central to the provision of resources from beyond
the local collection (Johnson, 2004: 255). McColvin (1925: 172) suggests that the role of a
National Central Library “is to answer those demands which are insufficient to call for local
provision”. Miguel (2007) provides a brief history of interlibrary lending, from informal
exchanges between monastery libraries to the formalisation of international interlending
arrangements through IFLA (International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions).
The formation of the British Library document supply service is also described by Miguel (2007)
in its earlier form as the National Lending Library for Science and Technology (its
reorganisation into the British Library Document Supply Centre (DSC) is omitted). Line (1997:
70) categorises this as “remote access” rather than interlending, and, because of the charges
involved, does not regard the DSC as a cooperative service. Appleyard (2010) describes other
services provided by the DSC, as requests for interlending and document supply services
decline, including digitisation. However, perhaps the most significant recent DSC initiative in
facilitating collaborative collection management has been the ongoing UK Research Reserve
(UKRR) programme. Eight research libraries collaborated with the British Library during the
first phase of the project to identify journals for deselection and to ensure that the British
Library and two other participating research libraries held copies (Wright and Crawford, 2008).
An expanded membership of 29 subscribed research libraries are participating in the second
phase of the project, aiming to build a “collaborative collection” and to facilitate space-saving
deselection decisions (Boyle and Brown, 2010). The programme also enables the British Library
to improve its collection of journals for document supply, replacing missing issues from the
collections offered for deselection (Wright and Crawford, 2008). The potential for the UKRR is
significant, especially if its membership continues to expand with each five-year cycle (Boyle
and Brown, 2010).

2.6 Information seeking behaviour
Although not the main focus of this research, the literature of information needs and use,
information seeking and information behaviour more generally have been drawn upon
elsewhere in this literature review (Webber, 1999; Bouthillier, 2003; Lee, 2005; Kalyanaraman
and Sundar, 2006; Makri et al., 2007; Tamura et al., 2007; Lee, 2008; Nicholas et al., 2008;
Tamura et al., 2008) and in the project methodology (Andrews, 1991; Kuhlthau and Tama,
2001; Bouthillier, 2003; Lee, 2005; Makri et al., 2006; Makri et al., 2007; Tamura et al., 2007;
Lee, 2008; Tamura et al., 2008; Makri and Warwick, 2010), perhaps reflecting the sentiment
expressed by Case’s (2012: 371) rhetorical question: "Is there any topic in information studies
that has nothing to do with "information behavior"?"
The origins of information behaviour as a field of study are generally traced to library use or
user studies, beginning in the early part of the twentieth-century and gathering pace from the
1950s, when studies of “information need and use” became more frequent (Saracevic, 2011:
xxvi; Case, 2012: 6, 272-273). The term information seeking was more widely adopted in the
1980s, “referring to a set of processes and strategies dynamically employed by people in their
quest for and pursuit of information” (Saracevic, 2011: xxvii). Since the 1990s, the broader
term of information behaviour has been used to encapsulate both the purposive, dynamic act
of information seeking and other more passive behaviours, such as the opportunistic
acquisition of information and information encountering (Erdelez, 1997; Erdelez, 2005) or
behaviours relating to selecting, filtering or avoiding information (Case, 2012: 109-113).
Key information behaviour models are summarised in Case (2012: 133-161) and in Fisher et al.
(2005b). Wilson (1981: 4) provides a diagrammatic representation of the relationships
between eleven concepts of significance to information seeking. These include the user, the
identified need, the user’s information seeking behaviour (including information exchange
with other people; demands on information systems and other sources), failure in the
information seeking process, information use (including information transfer) and satisfaction
or non-satisfaction of the need. This article suggests possible information seeking paths for
individual users, situated in their own “life-world”, including through technology or mediation
contained within information systems, or through professional or peer groups (Wilson, 1981:
6). It also suggests two motivations for research into information seeking behaviour – firstly, to
improve the design of information systems and secondly to explore the reasons behind
people’s information seeking behaviours – as well as suggesting a move away from the use of
the term information need “to speak instead of 'information-seeking towards the satisfaction
of needs'.” (Wilson, 1981: 7-8) The article advocates a “wider, holistic view of the information
34

user” (Wilson, 1981: 10). Wilson (1999) summarises five models presented over the
intervening years, and proposes an alternative approach, depicting information seeking as a
problem solving process, citing models by Kuhlthau and Ellis to support this depiction of an
essentially linear process moving from “problem identification” to “solution statement”,
connected by multiple experiences of “uncertainty resolution” (Wilson, 1999: 266-267).
Kuhlthau’s model is based on extensive research since 1983 in which “real people with real
tasks” have needed to seek information (Kuhlthau, 2005: 230). First described in Kuhlthau
(1991), the model has six stages: initiation, selection, exploration, formulation, collection, and
presentation and describes the changes in participants’ thoughts, feelings and actions over the
course of the search process, including, for example, increased uncertainty in the initial stages,
and greater confidence in the later stages (Kuhlthau, 1991: 367; Kuhlthau, 1993). The focus of
the model is on searching for information relating to tasks, rather than broader problem
situations (Kuhlthau, 1991: 369; Kuhlthau, 2005: 232).
Another useful model is provided by Dervin’s sense-making approach, which is not limited to
problem solving or specific tasks, but to any situation in which people try to make sense of
their experiences. Rather than resolving uncertainties, sense-making is presented as a “gapdefining and gap-bridging” process (Dervin, 2003: 279). Dervin’s sense-making approach is
described as “a set of metatheoretic assumptions and propositions about the nature of
information, the nature of human use of information, and the nature of human
communication” (Dervin, 2003: 270) and as “a methodology seen as useful for the study of
human sense-making (and sense-unmaking) in any context” (Dervin, 1999: 729). Key concepts
include focussing on the individual’s perspective on the “gappy reality” (Dervin, 1999: 730), or
discontinuities, of human experience and “verbing”, or refocusing “attention away from nouns
and substances to verbs and processes” (Dervin, 1999: 732), as a way of bridging those gaps.
Kuhlthau’s terminology of selection, collection and presentation seems to resonate strongly
with collection development and management activities, whilst explorations of personal
information collections or “personal anticipated information needs” (Bruce, 2005) may have
greater relevance to discussions of formal collection development and management processes
– where the emphasis is on anticipating the information needs of, and developing a collection
for, a community – than has previously been discussed.
2.7 Social enterprise – background, context and information needs
In order to explore some of the very broad issues affecting collection in the digital world, this
research focuses on the relatively new interdisciplinary field of social enterprise. This field was
35

chosen because of its interdisciplinary nature, the broad range of potential stakeholders such
as people involved in running social enterprises, academics researching aspects of social
enterprise, and policymakers, as well as library and information practitioners serving users
interested in social enterprise. This section of the literature review provides some background
information about social enterprise in the UK, the current political context of the field,
potential information needs and sources relating to social enterprise, which also describes
relevant studies relating to the provision of business information by library and information
services. Other aspects of social enterprise in the UK and internationally are not discussed in
this review.
2.7.1 Social enterprise background and vocabulary
Definitions of social enterprise differ depending on context. Two main approaches to defining
social enterprise are:



Social enterprise as something that an individual social entrepreneur may do (Nicholls,
2006; Bornstein, 2007);
Social enterprises as organisations with a social purpose which display particular
characteristics (Pearce, 2003; Defourny and Nyssens, 2006).

Teasdale (2010: 4-5) summarises these perspectives by making a distinction between the use
of the term “enterprise” as a verb to describe a type of action, or to refer in a concrete sense
as a noun to an organisation.
Kerlin (2010: 167-169) offers a summary of the development of social enterprise in several
regions, describing a range of different catalysts including reductions in state funding for social
services and, in other countries, the need to compensate for a weak economy. The
international dimensions of social enterprise are described by exploring how prompts from the
market, state, civil society and from international aid intersect (Kerlin, 2010: 172). Borzaga and
Defourny (2001) describe the diversity of social enterprise provision across the EU, focusing
particularly on the provision of social services and work integration schemes: in the UK, the
roots of social enterprise are traced to the Rochdale pioneers (Borzaga and Defourny, 2001:
253). The enterprise-led focus of US and, increasingly, UK approaches to social enterprise
(Defourny and Nyssens, 2006: 12; Birch and Whittam, 2008: 446) is contrasted with an
alternative prioritisation of social purpose (and social as well as trade-based funding) in
continental Europe (Defourny and Nyssens, 2006: 12).
The language of interdisciplinary subjects is often characterised by “insinuating ambiguities”
(Bliss, 1952: 102) and this seems to be true of the vocabulary of social enterprise. Parkinson
and Howorth (2008) and Birch and Whittam (2008) discuss some of these ambiguous terms;
Parkinson and Howorth (2008) suggest a tension between UK policy rhetoric which emphasises
36

the entrepreneurial aspect, and the significance attached to social or community-focussed
language and values by social enterprise practitioners. Teasdale (2010: 9) suggests that the
term social enterprise was favoured by the Labour government following the 1997 election as
a way of avoiding more politically loaded terms, such as those associated specifically with the
co-operative movement. The meaning of the term appears to have expanded relatively rapidly
between 1999-2005, with an increasing focus on “business solutions to social problems”
(Teasdale, 2010: 11-13). However, by 2010, new divisions had emerged, such as those
surrounding the Social Enterprise Mark criteria, and its potential exclusion of co-operatives,
finally leading to the conclusion that “social enterprise is a label rather than a specific
organisational form” (Teasdale, 2010: 14-16). From this summary of the development of social
enterprise in the UK since 1999, it is possible to argue that the key contradictions identified by
Di Domenico et al (2009: 897-899) between corporate and social enterprise organisations –
relating to their objectives, ownership, governance and accountability – also exist between
different types of social enterprise. Spear et al (2009) identify four main types of social
enterprise: mutuals, "trading charities", "Public-sector spin-offs", and "New-start social
enterprises" (2009: 265-266), each facing distinct challenges. Evans (2007) considers whether
activity in the informal economy could be translated into social enterprise activity, echoing
Pearce (2003) in describing the qualities of a “third system” characterised by “reciprocity”
rather than the “redistribution and profit maximisation” which characterises public / private
systems (Evans, 2007: 387).
2.7.2 Political context
Teasdale (2010) notes the significance of the changing political agenda on the development of
social enterprise. The Conservative party’s Big Society vision has resulted in a number of new
policies since the formation of the coalition government in May 2010. Indeed, a statement
about the role of this vision in the policy direction of the government was amongst the first
documents published by the coalition government and included a commitment to “support coops, mutuals, charities and social enterprises” (Cabinet Office, 2010). The government’s policy
suggests some continuity from the previous Labour government’s encouragement of social
enterprise. For example, the Department of Health (2007) encouraged social enterprise
provision of services to the NHS; the Department of Health (2010: 5) expressed the aim to
create “the largest social enterprise sector in the world” through NHS reforms. However,
Errington (2007) suggests a degree of suspicion towards social enterprise provision of services
to the NHS, because of its perceived “private sector” connotations, negative associations with
tendering and contracting, and concerns about individual employment conditions. Other policy
initiatives intended to support social enterprise and other types of social venture include the
37

proposed “right to buy” and the “right to challenge”, aimed at enabling local groups to
purchase community assets or to seek to take over local public services, respectively, and the
“right to provide” to enable public sector employees to form spin-off organisations to provide
their services (Cabinet Office, 2011: 30). Encouraging mutualisation may be one way to deliver
public services more effectively and with greater scope for innovation (Office for Public
Management, 2010a; Office for Public Management, 2010b). Teasdale et al (2013) suggest that
the political agenda of successive UK governments has led to inflated estimates of the scale of
the social enterprise sector, facilitated by artificial adjustments of definitions of social
enterprise and expanded samples for gathering statistical data.
2.7.3 Social enterprise information needs and sources
Some generic business issues – such as management and financial issues – face both social
enterprises and other types of businesses. Social enterprise practitioners may also need
information relating to their social purpose or “niche focus” (Smallbone et al., 2001: 25).
Worth Media (2005: 2), in a report published by the then Department of Trade and Industry,
describes a “‘silo’ approach” to information by social enterprise practitioners, focusing on the
purpose of the business. The document does not mention libraries as a potential source of
information, but library collections – with a mixture of general and specific information, and
tools for connecting customers to other resources – should be well-placed to contribute to
meeting these information needs.
Previous studies of business information provision therefore have relevance to this project.
Bakewell and Roper (1984) used a combination of interviews with library professionals in
London, North West England and North East Wales, and a material-based evaluation of the
library collections using a list of 161 business information sources. This report highlighted the
importance of regional information centres for business. Head et al (1995) described the
unobtrusive testing of 17 Scottish public library business information services by
undergraduate library studies students. The intention was to evaluate service provision –
rather than library collections – but assessment of the information resources also formed part
of the evaluation. Vaughan (1997) summarised responses to questionnaires sent to small and
medium businesses regarding their preferred information sources and library use. A low
response rate was a significant issue with both questionnaires – only approximately 19% of
small businesses and 6% of medium businesses replied. A key recommendation from this study
was that library business services should organise events to provide “opportunities for
personal contacts and networking” and to move beyond the apparent perception of the library
as “a warehouse of information” (Vaughan, 1997: 74). Webber (2001) reported on the findings
of a fifteen month project (1997-1998) on Business Information and the Internet, undertaken
38

by the University of Strathclyde and South Bank University, funded by the British Library, and
involving 29 small and medium enterprises, showing a rising trend in the use of electronic
resources, especially the internet. Convenience, currency and usability were key factors in
determining use of the internet as an information source (Webber, 2001). Bouthillier (2003)
used a grounded theory approach to analyse 11 interviews conducted with managers of small
business about their information needs and suggested considerable diversity in individual
approaches to information seeking – the concept of “habitus” as described by Bourdieu is used
to frame the study’s findings.
Wilson and Train (2006) described two pilot studies, which used a mixture of qualitative
interviews and quantitative surveys to evaluate regional approaches to public library provision
of business information, illustrating the importance of political agendas and alignment with
regional economic development strategies in raising the profile of, and giving new direction to,
public library business information provision. An entirely qualitative approach was used by
Tamura et al (2007; 2008) to investigate the impact of library business information services.
The study’s conclusions echoed Vaughan (1997) in indicating the importance of services which
facilitate “connections to relevant people and organizations” as well as providing access to
information and advice and support (Tamura et al., 2008). The British Library (2009) combined
a range of methods, including 12 workshops with 7-15 participants, 80 interviews and an
online survey which received 50 responses, to examine stakeholder perceptions of issues in
information provision for small and medium enterprises. Unusually in the studies cited here,
interviewees appear to have included one representative from a social enterprise (British
Library, 2009: 86). The report proposed a model which would link online and onsite business
information services, intended to provide greater integration of information services and to
increase desktop accessibility of electronic resources, connecting information provision across
public, academic and national library sectors (British Library, 2009). This approach may
potentially address some of the issues associated with the perceived inconsistency in public
library provision of business information and a lack of clear national policy direction regarding
business information which were identified by Wilson and Train (2006).
Deacon and Golding (1991: 72-73) point to the potential contradictions between
encouragement towards charging for specialised public library services, and the role of the
library as a community information service. Usherwood (2007: 39-41) discusses the
problematic nature of an increasing emphasis on income generation or charging for services in
public libraries more generally. In addition to charging for specific library services, such as
business information – which might be unlikely to earn significant income (White, 1992), or
partnerships with the private sector (Oakeshott and White, 1991) some public libraries have
39

also adopted social enterprise approaches – such as the community trust model used by
Hounslow (Simpson, 2000; Allen, 2001; Higgins, 2005; Edmonds, 2012: 133) – to their own
services.
Deacon and Golding (1991: 76) used four descriptors to categorise the information needs of
voluntary organisations: “national information”, “local information”, “practical information”
and “issue information”, with funding information being most in demand, before observing
that “information needs can often be latent” (Deacon and Golding, 1991: 86). At the same
time, as Dees (2008: 131) observes, the knowledge which might be most useful for social
entrepreneurs – based on the experience of other social enterprises – may be largely tacit and
difficult to share. Grey literature, such as reports or official publications, may also be useful to
people interested in social enterprise, although management of these types of material pose
significant challenges to libraries, including uncertainty about the authority of the documents,
material transience, difficulty locating materials and lack of bibliographic control (Tillett and
Newbold, 2006). Newbold and Grimshaw (2010) explore the particular challenges of managing
born-digital grey literature, including restrictions on archiving, potential loss of access to webbased documents, the preservation role of online repositories and the impact of the abrupt
switch from print to electronic publication of government documents. Datasets may also be of
use to people involved in social enterprise, although emerging approaches to data curation
have focussed on the academic context (Research Information Network, 2008; Buckland,
2011a).
As well as outlining proposals for investment support for social economy organisations, the
Cabinet Office (2011) provides a useful summary of barriers to securing investment for social
enterprises. One issue highlighted is “imperfect information” (Cabinet Office, 2011: 58). The
information needs described here are specific, including: "Information asymmetry between
borrowers and lenders", "Lack of information on social return", "Confusion over terminology”,
"Imperfect knowledge about existing investment provision" and "Lack of information about
government policy" (Cabinet Office, 2011: 58). Libraries are not identified as having any
potential role in meeting these information needs – instead, the document suggests the
“creation of a single web portal or gateway... [potentially] connecting social ventures to
expertise offered by other social ventures, private sector organisations, universities or the
general public" (Cabinet Office, 2011: 34). The Big Society Bank would have initial
responsibility for providing this portal (Cabinet Office, 2011: 42). This would seem to sideline
currently available Business Link web services (Business Link, 2011), as well as library and
information services. However, the limitations of Business Link provision for social enterprise
have been illustrated in earlier research – Smallbone et al (2001: 41) found that only 25% of
40

Business Link services made specific provision for social enterprise, and a minority identified
“distinctive support needs” for social enterprise. Pearce (2003: 93-94) also observed that
Business Links have not been the main source of support and information for social
enterprises, with the most successful arrangements relying on social enterprises to provide
support to other social economy organisations.
Previous research about information needs and use in social enterprises is limited, although
one current project has been examining information literacy and information needs of social
entrepreneurs in the West Midlands, working with third sector organisations, social
enterprises and entrepreneurs, two universities, a Local Enterprise Partnership and a students’
union (Walton, 2013). That project identifies information needs which include broader
principles of social enterprise (“businesses doing social enterprise but totally unaware that
they are”), financial management, personnel management, marketing and mentoring, and
concluding that "there is a clear need for a targeted information service that is both advocate
and provider" (Walton, 2013). Sodhi and Tang (2011) explore four types of supply chain flows,
including “information flows – market information to improve operational efficiency” (Sodhi
and Tang, 2011: 147) of social enterprises working with micro-entrepreneurs. In this example,
a commercial company in India provides next-day market pricing information to villagers via a
web portal, enabling farmers to get a fair price for their produce (Sodhi and Tang, 2011: 149).
Goldstein et al. (2010) provide a complexity science model of the role of collective interest in
addressing a problem, combined with the role of information in catalysing social innovation.
Complexity science covers a range of related fields which include systems theory, cybernetics
and chaos theory. In this article, information is defined as “a difference which makes a
difference” (Goldstein et al., 2010: 106), based on earlier definitions by Gregory Bateson,
including: "A difference which makes a difference is an idea. It is a "bit," a unit of information"
(Bateson, 1972: 271-272) and "A "bit" of information is definable as a difference which makes
a difference" (Bateson, 1972: 315). Goldstein et al. (2010) explore how differences between
individual’s information about an issue, and how they share their information may contribute
to successful social innovation; even if there is a collective will to address a particular social
problem, social innovation may not be possible if “relevant information to address the
problem is too widely dispersed and therefore not accessible” (Goldstein et al., 2010). In both
Sodhi and Tang (2011) and Goldstein et al. (2010), although quite specific aspects of the role of
information in relation to social enterprise are discussed, no mention is made of any potential
role for library or information services in providing or facilitating access to this information.

41

As a community of practice, social enterprise is also supported by a range of online
communities such as Social Enterprise UK (Social Enterprise UK, 2013), the Guardian
Professional Network (The Guardian, 2013), which aims to “connect, promote, network and
assist social enterprises to achieve more of what they do" as well as providing access to “the
largest online directory for social enterprises”, and the Royal Society of Arts Social
Entrepreneurs Network (RSA Fellowship, 2013).
2.8 Conclusion
This chapter has summarised some of the key issues in collection development and
management. It has provided some insight into the emergence of collection development and
management as areas of specialisation within library practice and has discussed the challenges
and opportunities presented by the digital world. Conventional approaches to library
processes such as community analysis may not satisfactorily identify all potential user
communities, especially those which form around communities of practice, communities of
interest or online communities. Collection policies based on approaches to managing owned
and physically held print collections may not reflect or address the complexity of collection in
the digital age. There may be significant and potentially growing differences between the
collection processes of libraries in different sectors.
The literature review has briefly summarised aspects of information seeking behaviour
research and has provided some background to the field of social enterprise and aspects of
information behaviour and provision relating to this field. This chapter has also provided the
basis for revisions to the research aims and objectives and for the development of the research
questions, which are described in more detail in the methodology described in Chapter 3.

42

3. METHODOLOGY
3.1 Introduction
The development of the research aim, objectives and research questions, together with the
broad themes identified from the initial literature review, are described. The philosophical
context of the project is set out, followed by a more detailed description of the methodology,
covering three strands of data collection: a case study of the British Library’s collections for
social enterprise; catalogue searches of a range of UK libraries; and a series of interviews
aimed at developing theoretical approaches to the concept of collection, followed by surveys
to explore the potential wider applicability of these approaches. Methods of analysis, ethical
issues, project costs and the limitations of this study are also discussed.
3.2 Developing the research aim, objectives and research questions
This section describes the development of the research aim, objectives and questions through
three main phases:




an initial phase at the very beginning of the project (November 2010);
a second phase, during and following on from the literature review (April 2011-June
2012);
a final phase, refining some of the questions in the light of comments from a
conference in summer 2012.

3.2.1 Initial research aim, objectives and questions
The first decision to be made related to the overall scope of the research project. A narrowly
focussed study might look at just one library, one sector, or one collection. A more broadly
focussed study would attempt to examine relevant issues across multiple organisations,
sectors and collections, from a range of different perspectives. As the research has been
funded by a British Library Concordat Scholarship, a strong argument existed for making the
best possible use of the opportunity to relate the study to that specific library. However, this
was tempered by an awareness that the unique character of that library and its collections
could significantly limit the extent to which findings could be interpreted as representative of,
or applicable to, a wider range of libraries.
The decision was taken to adopt a broad approach to the topic and this was reflected in the
initial draft aim for the research, originally formulated in November 2010:
This research will use a case study of library collections for social enterprise to
examine current issues in the development, management and exploitation of library
collections more generally. The case study will examine issues relating to formats,
collection development and management processes, access, stakeholder perceptions
and terminology.

43

The term “case study” has been used in the statement of the research aim to reflect an
underlying assumption that a study of the concept of collection in relation to the subject area
of social enterprise can legitimately be considered to be an “exemplifying case” (Bryman,
2004: 51). This reflects Stake’s (2005: 443) observation that “Case study is not a

methodological choice but a choice of what is to be studied". Although the study has
been carried out using a mixed-methods research design, the topic of library
collections for social enterprise was chosen as a case to provide insight into current
issues affecting library collections, including:





the challenges posed by interdisciplinary subjects;
terminological fluidity;
new types of community, including communities of practice and virtual communities;
format issues, especially associated with the proliferation of relevant formal and
informal digital publications.

To support the research aim, eight initial research objectives were also articulated. These
initial objectives are shown in Appendix 1. 13 research questions were also drafted at that
stage, following White’s (2009: 65) suggestion of a maximum of 12-14 research questions.
These are shown in Appendix 2. These questions differed in their scope and, in some cases,
overlapped (for example, question 9: “How could collaborative arrangements between
libraries facilitate greater access to social enterprise material?” and question 10: “How could
access to and use of the library collection for social enterprise be maximised?”).
3.2.2 Literature review and refining the aim, objectives and questions
The initial literature review provided insight into broad themes relating to library collections,
collection development and management, with a cross-cutting interest in how these aspects of
library collections have been affected by the increasing role of digital technology, and social
enterprise. The key themes identified in the literature review were:












definitions of collection;
community analysis and communities of practice;
collection development and management policies and politics;
legal deposit;
issues relating to collection access, including publicly accessible catalogues,
digitisation;
collection evaluation, including conspectus and collection visualisation;
deselection of materials;
collaborative collection development and management;
information seeking behaviour;
social enterprise background and vocabulary;
the political context of social enterprise;
44



social enterprise information needs.

The research aims and objectives were further refined in the light of the initial literature
review. By April 2011, the overall aim of the research was:
To use a case study of the library collection for social enterprise to develop a
conceptual approach to the library collection in the digital world, exploring
stakeholder perceptions of collections, terminology and collection development and
management processes.
The research objectives were:
1. To develop a conceptual approach to the library collection based on the study of
collections for social enterprise.
2. To describe the characteristics of the library collection for social enterprise.
3. To describe aspects of the use of the library collection for social enterprise.
4. To investigate the information seeking behaviour of people interested in social
enterprise.
5. To investigate stakeholder perceptions of the library collection for social enterprise.
6. To investigate library processes relating to collections for social enterprise.
In December 2011, the same research aim and objectives were articulated in the researcher’s
upgrade report, with the single difference that objective 1 was moved to the end of the list of
objectives and articulated slightly differently:
To synthesise findings from 1-5 to provide a model of the concept of the collection.
These objectives were expressed as research questions in June 2012 (question 6 is the main or
overarching research question):
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.

What are the characteristics of the library collection for social enterprise?
How is the library collection for social enterprise used?
How do people interested in social enterprise seek information?
How do stakeholders perceive the library collection for social enterprise?
How do library processes relate to collections for social enterprise?
What constitutes the concept of the collection in the digital world?

3.2.3 Final research aim, objectives and questions
Feedback from a conference presentation in late June 2012 led to a further revision of the
research aim, objectives and questions. The final research aim for this project was:
To use a case study of the library collection for social enterprise to develop a
conceptual approach to the library collection in the digital world, exploring
stakeholder perceptions of collections, terminology and collection development and
management processes.
The final objectives for this project were:
45

1. To describe the characteristics of the library collection for social enterprise.
2. To describe aspects of the use of the library collection for social enterprise.
3. To investigate the self-described information seeking behaviour of people interested in
social enterprise.
4. To investigate stakeholder perceptions of the library collection for social enterprise.
5. To describe the wider issues relating to collections in the digital world, identified by
this study.
6. To synthesise findings from 1-5 to provide a model of the concept of the collection.
Three of these objectives were envisaged as being primarily descriptive (1, 2, 5), and were
thought likely to provide relatively specific enumerative answers, whilst two others (3, 4) were
envisaged as more exploratory, investigative objectives, likely to contribute at a more abstract
level to the final theory building objective (6). The research questions were also re-articulated,
with significant changes shown below in italic text:
1. What are the characteristics of the library collection for social enterprise?
2. How is the library collection for social enterprise used?
3. What are the characteristics of the self-described information seeking behaviour of

The alteration to research question 3 was made to indicate the limitations of this study in
exploring people’s information seeking in relation to social enterprise, relying as it does on
people’s responses to interview or survey questions. Research question 4 was reworded to
make better grammatical sense. Research question 5 was reworded to articulate the intended
underlying meaning of examining broader library and information issues (articulated as “library
processes” in the previous version of the question) in the context of the specific case of social
enterprise, and to strengthen the link to the research aim’s focus on the concept of collection
in the digital world.
3.3 Philosophical context
Within the field of information studies and librarianship, research may be divided between
that conducted for a practical purpose and purely theoretical work. Busha and Harter (1980: 8)
make the distinction between “basic research” conducted “for its own sake” and “applied
research... aimed at solving practical problems.” This is echoed by Powell and Connaway
(2004: 2), who also describe the potential interplay of both types of research within the field of

46

librarianship. The philosophical framework for this research study should therefore reflect the
highly practical nature of librarianship as a field.
Hjørland (2009: 1526) compares four different epistemological approaches: empiricism,
rationalism, historicism and pragmatism and defines pragmatism as “the ideal of basing
knowledge on the analysis of goals, purposes, values, and consequences”, going on to argue
for the value of historicist and pragmatic approaches to research and concept building within
the field of information science. The philosophical perspective offered by pragmatism
therefore seems particularly appropriate for this study.
Pragmatism emerged in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century from the work of
Charles Peirce, John Dewey and William James (Malachowski, 2004: xx). Central to pragmatic
thought is the so-called Pragmatic Maxim:
"Consider what effects, that might conceivably have practical bearings, we conceive
the object of our conception to have. Then, our conception of these effects is the
whole of our conception of the object" (Peirce, [1904]: 402)
This is perhaps defined more succinctly by James (1907: 150), who described “the pragmatic
method... to try to interpret each notion by tracing its respective practical consequences.”
Inquiry should be directed to assessing the practical effects of ideas or concepts, rather than
being a purely theoretical or intellectual exercise. Pragmatic approaches are therefore based
on addressing and, attempting to identify solutions to, particular problems. Dewey (1933: 121)
defined a problem as: “whatever—no matter how slight and commonplace in character—
perplexes and challenges the mind so that it makes belief at all uncertain”. Creswell and PlanoClark (2011: 38-47) also suggest the value of a pragmatic approach for research objectives
which are “problem centered” and “Real-world practice oriented,” and suggest that this
approach enables data collection to focus on “what works” (Creswell and Plano Clark, 2011:
40-42). Library collection development and management is an area of professional practice
characterised by an abundance of problems requiring solutions, from anticipation of customer
demand, to management of format proliferation, to political and strategic decision-making
about the positioning of collection services within the library and the wider organisation.
Sometimes the approach to addressing these problems is somewhat ad hoc, as suggested by
the “garbage can process” model where “problems, participants, choice opportunities, and
solutions” are brought together, which is described by Schwartz (1989: 333).
Another key pragmatic idea defined by Peirce is that of abduction, described as taking place
alongside induction and deduction in the process of inquiry:

47

“Abduction is the process of forming an explanatory hypothesis. It is the only logical
operation which introduces any new idea; for induction does nothing but determine a
value, and deduction merely evolves the necessary consequences of a pure
hypothesis. Deduction proves that something must be; Induction shows that
something actually is operative; Abduction merely suggests that something may be.”
(Peirce, [1934]: 171)
By defining this additional logical process which facilitates the “framing of explanatory
hypotheses” (Wiggins, 1999: 11), pragmatism may be seen as promoting an approach to
inquiry which requires the researcher to move “back and forth between induction and
deduction” (Morgan, 2007: 71). Morgan (2007: 71) identifies three key features of the
pragmatic approach to inquiry in the social sciences: abduction (rather than being purely
inductive or deductive); intersubjectivity (rather than pure objectivity or pure subjectivity); and
transferability (rather than strict generalisability or solely contextual findings).
Creswell and Plano-Clark (2011: 43-44) show how pragmatism can support a mixed methods
approach to research, with some writers suggesting that it might be a “‘best’ worldview” for
these studies, encouraging the use of a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods.
Pragmatism also allows for flexibility in the analysis of data – for example, by using
quantitative as well as qualitative techniques in the analysis of qualitative data – in a way
which “exploits the inherent duality of the data” (Feilzer, 2010: 6).
The mixed methods approach is based on the view that “a strict qualitative–quantitative
dichotomy is not necessary or productive for answering research questions" (Tashakkori, 2009:
288). Appreciation of the value of combining qualitative and quantitative approaches in
research is not limited to explicitly mixed methods researchers. In library and information
studies, combinations of qualitative and quantitative methods offer a number of advantages
including enabling triangulation to “address different aspects of the same research question”
and to “compensate for inherent weaknesses in each approach” (Gorman and Clayton, 1997:
32). Qualitative methods alone may be seen as unduly subjective; quantitative methods may
not capture nuance arising from context or personal experience in the way in which qualitative
methods can (Creswell and Plano Clark, 2011: 12). The practice of collection development and
management may also be seen as an inherently mixed-methods activity, where information
gathered from conversations with customers or documentary sources (qualitative) combines
with statistics regarding usage or numbers of requests (quantitative) to inform professional
decisions about the collection.
Examination of previous studies relevant to this topic demonstrates the use of a range of
different methodologies to address research questions relating to library collections. Table 3.3
compares the approaches of some relevant studies. These studies cover a broad range of
48

research topics including concepts of collection, user’s mental models of collections and
aspects of their information behaviour, descriptions of the characteristics of collections and
their use. Generally appropriate approaches are used to address each of these topics, including
case studies, interviews and document analysis; and quantitative methods such as analysis of
catalogue data, deep logs of electronic journal activity and surveys.

Two studies which feature mixed-methods approaches are described in practice-oriented
reports, although neither explicitly uses the term mixed-methods (British Library, 2009;
Research Information Network, 2011). This may be seen as reflecting both the appropriateness
of mixed-methods approaches to practice-based research, and the relatively limited
discussions of methodology in such research.
The range of methods used in these studies suggests that a methodological approach which
includes both qualitative and quantitative elements, using a mixed-methods design, can both
facilitate triangulation and provide the widest possible insight into the project’s research
questions.
Two further research approaches also merit consideration at this stage, because of their
specific claims in relation to concepts and theory building. Phenomenography emerged from
the field of education, particularly from studies aimed at describing concepts relating to
student learning and understanding (Marton, 1981: 181; Svensson, 1997: 163; Richardson,
1999: 56; Fazey and Marton, 2002). The term was first defined by Marton (1981: 180) as:
“research which aims at description, analysis, and understanding of experiences; that
is, research which is directed towards experiential description.”
50

The aim of the phenomenographic approach is to explore what Marton (1981: 188) calls:
“the second order perspective of statements-about-perceived-reality, which is
considered to have a complementary relationship to the first-order perspective of
statements-about-reality.”
This concern with how objects are perceived may be seen as echoing the emphasis placed on
“conceptions” in Peirce’s Pragmatic Maxim. As Morgan (2007: 72) explains “In a pragmatic
approach, there is no problem with asserting both that there is a single “real world” and that
all individuals have their own unique interpretations of that world”; a view of the
complementarity of subjective and objective perspectives which is also suggested by Marton.
However, the importance attached to the practical consequences of conceptions is not a
feature of Marton’s definition of phenomenography; it is the conceptions themselves which
are the focus of study. Marton and Booth (1997: 121-122) provide this summary:
“the variation in ways people experience phenomena in their world is a prime interest
for phenomenographic studies, and phenomenographers aim to describe that
variation. They seek the totality of ways in which people experience, or are capable of
experiencing, the object of interest and interpret it in terms of distinctly different
categories that capture the essence of the variation”.
Marton and Booth (1997: 130-131) describe phenomenographic interviews based on a specific
task, aimed at getting “the interviewee to bring forth his awareness of undertaking the task, a
state of meta-awareness” – the interview facilitates reflection, where “a concrete reference
point” is used to explore interviewees “hitherto unsuspected reflections”.
Ashworth and Lucas (2000: 299) echo this idea that "The researcher and researched must
begin with some kind of (superficially) shared topic, verbalised in terms which they both
recognise as meaningful". Although phenomenographic studies aim to describe people’s
conceptions of quite abstract ideas – Marton (1981) gives examples such as “time”, or
“political power” – early phenomenographic studies were conducted as “experiments”
(Marton, 1981: 182) around a much more specific focus.
Phenomenography has been very successfully used in the field of education to develop
conceptual models of complex abstract ideas such as learning, understanding or information
literacy, often based around experiences of a particular learning activity. This might be
readings from a textbook (Marton, 1981: 182), a problem to be solved (Anderberg, 2000), use
of an online news database (Andretta, 2007: 163-164), or experiences of a specific course
module (Yates et al., 2012). However, studies may also be conducted without such a precise
focus. For example Limberg describes both her own study of 25 students interviewed at three
points during their work on a specific assignment, as well as Bruce’s much wider study of the
51

experiences of information literacy by higher education professionals, working in a range of
different roles, from a variety of institutions (Limberg, 2000: 59-60). Whether focusing on a
phenomenon in a very specific context or taking a broader approach, the aim of
phenomenography is “to explore the range of meanings within a sample group, as a group, not
the range of meanings for each individual within the group” (Akerlind, 2005: 323).
Phenomenographic studies generally use semi-structured interviews to explore these
variations in people’s experience of a phenomenon, with verbatim transcripts analysed to
identify variations between and across interviews, rather than within individual interviews
(Boon et al., 2007: 210). These variations and the relationships between them are then
represented in a structured way in the “‘outcome space’” (Akerlind, 2005: 322-323), often in
diagrammatic form (Yates et al., 2012: 106). Phenomenography offers a non-dualist
perspective on experience, recognizing “the existence of a real world but... It is constituted of
the totality of ways of experiencing this world” (Limberg, 2000: 55).
In contrast, in this research project, the research questions reflect the pragmatic perspective
of intersubjectivity, requiring an attempt at some degree of objective description of collection
characteristics, as well as exploring people’s subjective perspectives and experiences of
collection. Some of these more descriptive research questions also require a quantitative
approach, which would not usually form part of a phenomenographic research design.
The potential value of a grounded theory approach to answering the project research
questions was also considered. There are also overlaps between grounded theory, pragmatism
and mixed-methods approaches. For example, Glaser and Strauss (1967: 18) suggest:
“In many instances, both forms of data are necessary – not quantitative used to test
qualitative, but both used as supplements, as mutual verification and, most important
for us, as different forms of data on the same subject, which, when compared, will
each generate theory.”
Glaser and Strauss (1967) offer the first articulation of grounded theory and the text includes
the key elements of theory generation from data, theoretical sampling (using emerging codes
and concepts to identify future participants or data sources), open coding and theoretical
saturation (continuing data gathering until no new information is added). Later grounded
theory texts depart over significant aspects of this approach to research. For example Glaser
(2001) seeks to distinguish very clearly between grounded theory and other types of
qualitative data analysis, which he regards as solely descriptive in character, rather than having
potential for concept and theory building. In contrast, Strauss and Corbin (1998: x) describe
“high-level description” as a legitimate additional aim for research. Perhaps the biggest
52

distinction between Glaser’s and Strauss and Corbin’s views of grounded theory is the
development of detailed procedures for “axial coding” as a way of defining relationships
between categories, and their subcategories, from emerging open codes (Strauss and Corbin,
1998: 126).
As this project includes descriptive research objectives, aimed at factual description rather
than intended to generate theory, as well as more exploratory investigative research
objectives, together with a final theory-building objective, a grounded theory approach was
not felt to be the most suitable overall research design. However, the project does also draw
on elements of grounded theory when appropriate and in particular in the use of open coding
in data analysis. The criteria suggested by Charmaz (2006: 182-183) for evaluating grounded
theory studies – credibility, originality, resonance and usefulness – also seem to provide
suitable expectations for evaluating any conceptual models developed in the course of this
research.
3.4 Research design: Overview
The project has adopted a pragmatic research approach using a multiphase mixed-methods
design (Creswell and Plano Clark, 2011: 100-104). Three strands of data collection and analysis
have been undertaken and a model for these is shown in Figure 3.4a. The research began in
October 2010, with data collection beginning in June 2011. Main data collection was
completed by the end of May 2013, although a small amount of final data relating to the
British Library case study was collected in July and early August 2013. In this model, the
strands are shown in the following colours:




Strand 1: British Library case study (primarily qualitative) – yellow;
Strand 2: Library catalogue searches (primarily quantitative) – blue;
Strand 3: Interviews (primarily qualitative) followed by surveys (primarily quantitative)
– red.

The overlapping connection between Strand 1 and Strand 2 is shaded light green; the
overlapping connection between Strand 2 and Strand 3 is shaded purple. The area in which all
three strands are integrated is shaded grey-green. Where applicable, the letter “n” indicates
numbers of participants at each stage in the research design. Data collection for all three
strands has taken place largely concurrently. Two sequential elements were the catalogue
searches in the Strand 1 British Library case study, which provided the bibliographic data for a
core set of items relating to social enterprise forming the basis for the Strand 2 catalogue
searches; and Strand 3, in which a series of qualitative interviews were used for initial

exploration of concepts and ideas about “collection”. These ideas were then incorporated into
a survey instrument, which aimed to see whether any of the ideas appeared to be shared more
widely. Figure 3.4b shows a summary Gantt chart, illustrating the timings of different elements
of the project.
Concurrent data collection across all three strands had a number of practical advantages. It
enabled the researcher to use her time more efficiently than might have been the case if the
strands had been undertaken consecutively. Delays experienced in one strand – such as the
recruitment of some interviewees for Strand 3 – did not delay data collection in the other
strands. Lists which were developed to identify catalogues to search in Strand 2 subsequently
provided a useful basis for identifying possible survey respondents for Strand 3. Engaging with
the British Library for a prolonged period (the full three years of the research project) enabled
the researcher to pursue an iterative process of drafting case reports, discussing these with
British Library colleagues and undertaking further data collection to fill gaps identified by this
process.
Although Strands 1 and 2 were intended to be either primarily qualitative or primarily
quantitative, in practice mixing of methods occurred across all strands. Quantitative data
about the characteristics of British Library collections including usage statistics formed a
significant element of Strand 1, whilst a range of aspects of library collections and catalogues
studied in Strand 2 could be analysed qualitatively.
Apart from the two overlapping connections shown in the diagram, and the penultimate stage
of cross-strand discussion, efforts were made to minimise the connections between the three
strands. This approach was taken in order to allow similar or different themes to emerge
independently from each strand, and to try to reduce the potential for any one strand to
dominate, influence or bias the data collection from the other strands. For example,
interviewees were not routinely asked about their views of the British Library’s collections and
services (although a number of people chose to mention these themselves) or, in the case of
library and information professionals, about their catalogues.
In order to allow for triangulation of results, each research question was addressed in either
more than one strand, or in a single strand which used both qualitative and quantitative
methods, applied to different sample groups. The strands in which each research question is
addressed are shown in Table 3.4.

3.5 Strand 1: British Library case study
This strand addresses research questions 1, 2 and 5. Ellinger et al (2005: 330) suggest that case
studies are particularly appropriate “when the researcher is interested in ‘how,’ ‘what’ and
‘why’ questions”, which suggested that this approach would provide a suitable fit for
addressing these particular research questions. Taking these questions together the unit of
analysis for this case study is the British Library’s collections and services relevant to social
enterprise, and the phenomenon being studied is the impact of digital technology on library
collections.
Ellinger et al (2005: 330-331) observe that many approaches to case studies in social science
research have focused on the collection of qualitative data, despite the extent to which “the
case study clearly lends itself to mixed methodology”. Indeed, Yin (2003: 22) suggests that case
studies are best suited to addressing “’how’ and ‘why’ questions” – rather than the “what”
questions which tend to be more descriptive. Stake (1995: xi) acknowledges, but largely
eschews, “quantitative case studies that emphasize a battery of measurements… a collection
of descriptive variables” found in medical studies and other subject areas. Baxter and Jack
(2008) also focus on case studies as a qualitative methodology. Yin (2003: 42-45) includes
some references to quantitative as well as qualitative data collection and the later edition of
this work contains an expanded section on mixed-methods case studies (Yin, 2009: 62-64). This
57

describes both the use of mixed-methods within embedded case studies – where data
collection from a main case is supported by survey data from other units – and the use of case
studies within the framework of larger mixed-methods research designs (Yin, 2009: 63).
Yin (2003: 3-6) suggests three types of case studies: “explanatory” – studies which provide
insight into why or how something is as it is, “exploratory” – studies which illuminate broader
topics, such as the outcomes of particular interventions, or “descriptive” – describing how
things are in a particular case or group of cases. As the research questions addressed by this
case study are generally descriptive, this strand takes the form of a “descriptive” case study.
This could also be seen in Stake’s (2005) terminology as a primarily “intrinsic” case study –
where the case is of interest for itself – rather than a primarily “instrumental” case study,
where one case is selected on the basis of being representative of others, although as Crowe
(2011) notes, these two categories of case study are “not necessarily mutually exclusive”.
The rationale for this single-case study of the British Library is its uniqueness (following Yin
(2003: 39-41)). The British Library’s uniqueness derives from its status as the UK’s national
library and as a legal deposit library, entitled to receive a copy of every book published in the
UK, which has enabled it to develop vast collections of printed materials, including its legacy
collections from the British Museum Library. It was the British Museum Library’s legal deposit
privilege which the British Library took on under the terms of the British Library Act (1972). It
forms a key part of the library network in the UK, especially through its interlending and
document supply activities, coordinated by the Document Supply Centre (DSC). It also has a
history of innovation in the provision of new services, such as the Management and Business
Studies (MBS) portal, providing access to electronic documents via the Library’s website.
The case study has been carried out using an “embedded case study design” (Yin, 2003: 42-45),
using a range of different units of analysis – catalogue results, usage statistics, documentation
– which were selected from a number of subunits within the library – such as the Business and
Intellectual Property Centre, or the Document Supply Centre. These units were purposively
sampled to provide a range of perspectives on the Library’s collections and services and
because of their perceived relevance to social enterprise. This is in contrast to using a “holistic
design” (Yin, 2003: 42-45), which would instead have attempted to study the whole the
Library’s projects and collections relating to social enterprise.
Although the research was supported by a British Library Concordat Scholarship, the research
was not constrained or directed by the British Library in any way. Instead, the British Library
supervisor acted as a supportive facilitator, particularly by identifying and initiating useful

58

contacts with Library colleagues, and by providing guidance and explanations about the
Library’s services and systems.
Yin (2003: 83-97) describes six significant sources of data for case studies. This strand did not
involve conducting interviews, one key source identified in many accounts of case study
research (Stake, 1995: 64-67; Yin, 2003: 89-92). Instead, the intention was that interviews or
surveys with British Library staff could be undertaken separately as part of Strand 3, which
sought to address the project’s more investigative (rather than descriptive) research questions.
Additionally, informal conversations with Library staff were used to identify more concrete
data sources, such as documentation or statistics.
Participant-observation was also not used, mainly because of concern about potential
elements of bias which this approach could introduce (Yin, 2003: 94-96), but also because of
the potential ethical implications of unobtrusive observation of interactions involving many
people, or the behaviour changes which might be prompted by an awareness of being
observed, for the purposes of research, by an external researcher. It seemed that using
participant-observation would raise significant issues of trust: both regarding the trust the
researcher could place in her own ability to provide an unbiased interpretation of her
subjective observations, and, more importantly, the trust which colleagues could place on the
researcher not to use casual and informal conversations or observations in her research.
Table 3.5 provides a comprehensive list of the data collected and the subunits from which they
originated. Four data sources were either publicly available (Annual Reports, the British Library
catalogue and the UK web archive) or were sourced from the Library’s external web analytics
software, following training provided by the Library.
These data fall into three broad categories: documentation, statistics and catalogue search
results. They include a mixture of qualitative and quantitative sources, covering a range of
subunits, formats (printed materials delivered to reading rooms, electronic documents
accessed via the website, search results on catalogues or in the UK Web Archive) and services
(on-site in the Library and remote, such as the document supply services). They offer a range
of perspectives on the case, from a very narrow focused view based on usage statistics for one
specific resource, to the much broader perspective provided by the Library’s Annual Reports.
They also provide coverage of a wide range of time frames. Although Yin (2003: 26)
emphasises the importance of defining specific time boundaries for a case study, in practice
these were largely defined by the data sources themselves. The final research aim offers two
potential time boundaries – the period over which social enterprise has emerged as a topic of
interest, and that during which digital technologies have developed and have become
59

increasingly widely used. The data sources have their own (and sometimes multiple) time
boundaries. For example, the British Library catalogue searches provide a snapshot of the
collection on a particular day – items may subsequently have been added or removed.
However, it also provides a historical perspective on publications which are potentially
relevant to social enterprise and which were published as long ago as the 1960s. The British
Library’s Annual Reports provide a more holistic view of the Library’s collection activities since
1973 – a period which is partly characterised by the emergence and gradual adoption of digital
technologies.

3.5.1 Implementation
Because of the nature of the systems for managing the British Library’s collections and for
monitoring their usage, much of the data described for this strand were supplied to the
researcher by members of British Library staff. Appendix 3 summarises the main data
described here, indicating whether these were collected directly by the researcher or whether
they were requested from and supplied by British Library staff.

60

In the case of data supplied by British Library staff, the researcher initiated discussions about
the availability of data with her British Library supervisor in the first instance. This was usually
followed by informal discussions with other British Library colleagues about data availability.
Internal documents were either provided on a self-selected basis to provide a range of
examples of different approaches to process and policy documentation, without attempting to
be a representative sample, or were obtained by the researcher through informal meetings.
Title or item information was supplied by the researcher in relation to Reading Room request
data, DSC journal requests, and relevant theses held in the EThOS system. British Library staff
then provided the relevant usage data.
The British Library catalogue was searched for terms relating to “social enterprise”, “social
entrepreneur”, “community enterprise” and “community entrepreneur”. The results to these
searches were compared to a bibliography of relevant materials in the British Library collection
prepared by Walker (2010).
The initial searches took place between 2 June 2011 and 14 June 2011. Both the existing
Integrated Catalogue and the newly introduced Primo resource discovery system were
searched. Primo searches located individual journal articles, as well as monographs and serial
titles – in these cases, numbers of journal articles were recorded separately, but were not
included in the total count of individual items. These searches were used both to identify
relevant items and to explore the effectiveness of different search terms.
A second round of British Library catalogue searches took place solely on Primo. These
searches were carried out between 9 December 2011 and 9 January 2012, in the light of
additional titles located in Strand 2 catalogue searches of other libraries. These known item
searches used titles or other details, such as author names and dates of publication or ISBNs to
locate items which had been found in Strand 2.
The Annual Reports were identified as a useful data source in early 2013 to provide a broader
perspective on key issues relating to the Library’s collections. The electronic database usage
statistics were also identified as a useful potential information source in 2013 and were
supplied to the researcher on the understanding that the data would be reported without
identifying (or rendering identifiable) the individual resources. The UK Web Archive searches
were conducted in August 2013, using the ten search terms used in the Strand 2 catalogue
searches. Figures of total numbers of search results from each year were also recorded.
3.5.2 Analysis
Yin (2003: 111-115) describes three main approaches to analysing case study data:
61





Using the theories which guided the study design;
Exploring and testing alternative explanations;
Describing the case.

As this case study is intended to be descriptive, the analysis takes the form of a case
description. However, this description is also rooted in the original research questions (a
feature of the more theoretical approach to case study analysis) and, where appropriate,
suggests alternative explanations – although with limited options for testing these.
Each of the data sources have been analysed in the most appropriate way, depending on the
type of data they provide. Quantitative data from Strand 1 were analysed using descriptive
statistics, summarising “patterns in the responses of cases in a sample” (De Vaus, 2002: 207).
This included tabular summaries and the visual representation of data using graphs and charts.
In some cases, it was also appropriate to calculate measures of central tendency, such as the
mean, median or mode. The catalogue search results were analysed primarily by publication
date, charting publication trends in relation to specific search terms, and according to type and
place of publication.
Initially, library policy and process documents were analysed using a combination of open
coding and a very basic form of content analysis to record the characteristics of the
documents, such as their length. The open coding approach provided the opportunity to
identify key categories across a range of highly heterogeneous policy and process
documentation. In contrast, the Annual Reports formed a large body of similarly structured
material discussing similar themes and therefore seemed to lend themselves to a more
structured quantitative content analysis. Silverman (2006: 159) describes a primarily
quantitative approach to content analysis, based on counting the instances of, for example,
specific words, concepts or language features, based on pre-identified categories defined by
the researcher; Bryman (2004: 181) also describes content analysis as the application of
quantitative measures to the analysis of qualitative data. However, this form of analysis can
also accommodate qualitative approaches (White and Marsh, 2006: 36-37). Silverman
describes how qualitative aspects can be incorporated into content analysis, including the use
of “extracts which illustrate particular categories” (Silverman, 2006: 161). The analysis of the
Annual Reports included the use of data extraction forms, which were used to set out the
categories of interest and to identify occurrences of these categories in each document
(Appendix 4). Word frequency counts were performed manually. Total word counts for Annual
Reports published until 1998-1999 were also performed manually, whilst automated word
count facilities were used to generate total word counts for reports available as PDF
documents, covering the period from 1999-2000 onwards. However, word counts for all
62

Annual Reports are presented as approximations, rather than as exact figures – automated
word counts may include page numbers or may miscount single words which were split across
two lines.
The key product of the case study is the case study report (Yin, 2003: 141), which forms the
Strand 1 chapter of this thesis (Chapter 4). In addition to presenting a single narrative
describing and analysing the case (Yin, 2003: 146), the intention is that this report should be
useful to the British Library – following Yin’s (2003: 144) suggestion that the “case study report
can itself be a significant communication device”. A draft of this chapter was circulated to four
key British Library contacts in June 2013 as part of a member-checking exercise. Informal
meetings provided valuable feedback about this report, including:


Identifying the availability of further data sources for analysis, such as usage figures
for two relevant electronic databases provided by the Library;



Suggesting ways of clarifying the reporting of some data – for example, charting or
describing changes over time in the use of terms identified from the analysis of the
Annual Reports, or clarifying usage statistics relating to multiple copies of a single
print title;



Updating the researcher on content strategy developments, including the publication
of the Library’s content strategy for the next two years (British Library, 2013b);



Situating the research findings in the broader context of the British Library’s collection
activities;



Identifying particular strengths in the report, such as the presentation of data relating
to title publication by year, or apparently surprising findings, such as the relatively low
level of use of Library services by self-identified social enterprise practitioners.

Reassuringly, none of the key contacts identified any major problems with the report and none
suggested withholding, removing or embargoing any data. Comments from the key contacts
also suggested that they found the case study report credible, potentially useful (the analysis
of the Annual Reports was highlighted as being of particular value) and resonant, suggesting
that the study meets some of the criteria described by Charmaz (2006: 182-183).
3.5.3 Validity and reliability
Yin (2003: 34) suggests a number of tactics for establishing validity and reliability in case
studies. Table 3.5.3 summarises these tactics and indicates whether these are present in this
case study.

63

- Limited – intended as a

- None – a unique single case

mixed-methods protocol
- Computer filing system;
NVivo notes about data only
available on paper.

Overall, this suggests that, by these criteria, the study offers some construct validity (validity
linked to the way the study was designed) and limited internal validity (although the study was
not intended to be explanatory, some potential explanations for some of the data have
emerged during analysis). The nature of the single case design, coupled with the relatively
innovative nature of this study and the uniqueness of the case, limits its external validity and
the prospect of replication. However, the study should be considered as reasonably reliable,
with both a case study protocol (although only as part of the larger mixed-methods design)
and a case study database within the researcher’s computer filing system and itself including a
database created to record the British Library catalogue search results.
3.6 Strand 2: Searching publicly accessible library catalogues
This strand addresses research questions 1 and 5. Word and phrase keyword searches for
terms relevant to social enterprise were used to locate relevant materials in a range of
different types of library. A version of Goldhor’s inductive list-checking method described by
Baker and Lancaster (1991: 46-47) was used to evaluate these results, comparing the results
with the titles located in the Strand 1 catalogue search. Further searches were also conducted
on the British Library catalogue for materials found in these Strand 2 searches, but not located
in the initial Strand 1 catalogue search.

64

3.6.1 Sampling
Publicly accessible catalogue information was used to gain an indication of the extent of library
collections for social enterprise across library sectors. A mixture of sampling methods were
used to identify catalogues to test: university and public library were selected using a form of
random sampling from a list of libraries created by the researcher, based on a list created from
the index of a directory of library services (Chartered Institute of Library and Information
Professionals, 2008). The Excel random number generator was used to identify institutions for
selection from the list. Catalogue websites for these library services were then identified using
Google searches.
However, purposive sampling was deemed more appropriate to identify NHS library
catalogues. The decision to include health libraries in the Strand 2 catalogue searches was
based on an awareness of the political emphasis placed by successive governments on
encouraging the use of social enterprise within the health sector (Department of Health, 2007;
Department of Health, 2010). Including such specialised library and information services in this
strand could provide insights into the development and publication of information resources
relating to social enterprise within a specific field. The researcher also had some personal
professional familiarity with library and information services in the health field and believed
that including this sector in the study would provide a useful comparison to results from public
and academic libraries. Health libraries were located using the Health Libraries and
Information Services Directory (Strategic Health Authority Library Leads and CILIP Health
Libraries Group, [2011]).
Particularly interesting catalogue results contributed to the purposive sampling of interview
participants. One academic librarian was invited to participate in an interview because of the
large number of records for e-books returned by the searches of that university’s catalogue.
Publishers identified as being responsible for a number of relevant titles (or titles which were
retrieved in multiple searches) were also invited to take part in interviews; two publishers
accepted these invitations.
3.6.2 Implementation
88 catalogues were searched between 23 August 2011 and 2 October 2011. This consisted of:




51 public library authority catalogues;
35 academic library catalogues;
2 NHS library union catalogues.

65

53 public library authorities were initially identified for catalogue searching, but three shared a
single union catalogue. The public and academic library catalogues were randomly sampled
from each of the four UK nations and theoretically represent approximately a quarter of UK
libraries in these two sectors. However, co-operative catalogue arrangements meant that
three catalogues searched covered more than one local authority or library board – this
included a single catalogue for all of Northern Ireland’s public libraries. The 2 NHS library
catalogues were purposively sampled, representing health libraries in Wales and in one English
region.
Results were managed using a simple relational database with three linked tables containing
the details shown in Figure 3.6.2. This database was also used to record the results of the
Strand 1 British Library catalogue searches.

Figure 3.6.2: Diagram of database design
890 individual searches were performed. Each library was searched using the following 10
terms:




Social enterprise;
Social enterprises;
Social entrepreneur;
Social entrepreneurs;
Social entrepreneurship;
Community enterprise;

Community entrepreneurs;
Community entrepreneurship.

1 library catalogue, which did not permit phrase searching, was searched with these 10 terms
entered as a title as well as keyword search. However, the title search function on this
catalogue only retrieved items with titles beginning with the terms entered. This led to the
conclusion that title searching was not an effective way of retrieving additional relevant results
in catalogues using this system. 1827 individual results were recorded.
66

When phrase searching was not possible, a selective approach was taken to evaluating the
results, with lists of more than 10 results being browsed for relevant titles. Characteristics
recorded for each search included whether or not phrase searching had been used.
3.6.3 Analysis
Basic descriptive statistics were used to describe the results of these catalogue searches,
focusing on the following aspects:











the proportion of library catalogues permitting phrase searching;
the proportion of libraries for which relevant results were located;
mean, median and mode of the number of results;
comparing the most frequently retrieved titles from academic and public libraries;
the proportion of titles only retrieved in a single search;
the proportion of titles only located in a single library;
titles retrieved in Strand 2 searches not identified in the initial Strand 1 searches of the
British Library’s catalogue;
publication dates of items retrieved;
formats and types of items located;
place of publication.

Except for the first feature (phrase searching) and the final two features, results for other
features were calculated twice, once for all searches and once for only those catalogues which
did permit phrase searching. These results were presented using tables and graphs; some of
these results were also represented in parallel with, or superimposed over, comparable results
from the Strand 1 British Library catalogue searches.
To provide an additional level of analysis, searches of WorldCat, a large online database which
combines catalogue records from 72,000 libraries around the world (OCLC, 2013b), were
conducted in March 2013. The proportions of results retrieved for each of the ten search
terms were compared, to attempt to identify any similarities or differences between the small
sample of UK library catalogues searched and the results from the much larger OCLC database.
3.6.4 Validity and reliability
De Vaus (2002: 53-54) describes four types of validity for quantitative surveys:





Criterion validity – how responses to new measures match responses to existing
measures;
Content validity – how well the measures cover aspects of the concept;
Construct validity – “whether they measure what they intend to measure” (Creswell
and Plano Clark, 2011: 210)
Face validity – a subjective judgement that the measures used “seem to cover the
concept” (De Vaus, 2002: 54)

67

These approaches to validity are described in the context of surveys involved human
participants, but they can potentially be used to evaluate validity for any quantitative study,
such as this survey of results from catalogue searches.
Although the design of Strand 2 may be said to demonstrate good content validity (the results
counted directly reflected the numbers of items located in the collections of different libraries,
and provided data about a range of aspects of these items, such as their dates of publication),
there are limitations to the construct validity of this strand. The searches retrieved items
identified within the catalogue, which may not necessarily represent the true extent of the
collection, and which may not accurately retrieve the most relevant items.
The samples of academic library and public library catalogues searched (around 25% of those
in each of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland) give this strand some claim to
external validity, as the number of catalogues searched represent a significant proportion of
the total populations of UK academic and public library catalogues, allowing for the use of the
finite population correction in reducing the size of the sample required for representativeness
(De Vaus, 2002: 81).
Some reliability should be provided by documenting the searches in detail and recording both
the searches and the results in a database. Unlike surveys involving human participants, a
catalogue search should not result in different responses at different times because of a
change in the participant’s opinion. However, search results may change for other reasons,
such as a change in the catalogue record, or the addition or withdrawal of an item. The
searches were carried out only once. Although De Vaus (2002: 52) acknowledges that in
surveys of people “Unfortunately the test-retest method is a poor one”, retesting the
catalogues, carrying out searches again over time, would have been even more problematic,
with the likelihood of significant changes between sets of results. Only in Strand 1 was
retesting performed; the British Library catalogue was searched for individual titles located in
other catalogues, but not identified in the initial British Library searches.
Overall, this element of the project design had the greatest limitations of the three strands.
The choice of search terms focused on content explicitly about social enterprise (rather than
exploring the wider collection of potentially relevant materials for social enterprise).
Interesting findings from this strand – particularly relating to the differing quality of catalogues
in different library sectors – were of only tangential relevance to the core research questions.
The limited options for searching some catalogues were not anticipated by the researcher,
leading to the introduction of a large degree of researcher subjectivity when trying to identify
potentially relevant items from lengthy results lists.
68

3.7 Strand 3: An exploratory-sequential study: interviews and questionnaire
This strand was based on the exploratory sequential study design described by Creswell and
Plano Clark (2011: 86-90) and is intended to address research questions 2 to 5. This design has
aimed “to generalize qualitative findings... to a larger sample” (Creswell and Plano Clark, 2011:
86).
3.7.1 Interviews
The initial qualitative data were collected through semi-structured interviews, which Gillham
(2000: 7) describes as having “more structure [than informal conversation] although still being
very ‘open’ in its style”. This balance between structure and openness meant that interviewer
was able to focus on key topics whilst providing the interviewee with opportunities to give
detailed responses about his or her individual experiences, aiming for “‘discovery’ rather than
‘checking’” (Denscombe, 1998: 113). Semi-structured interviews have been used to explore
the information behaviour of professionals (Kuhlthau and Tama, 2001: 29; Makri et al., 2006),
information seeking behaviour of students (Lee, 2008), types of information space (Lee, 2003b)
and the concept of the collection (Lee, 2005), suggesting that this is an appropriate approach
to take to investigating these topics.
Three main interview scripts were devised: one for social enterprise practitioners,
policymakers and academics working in the field (Appendix 5); one for library and information
practitioners (Appendix 6); and one for publishers (Appendix 7). Different scripts were used to
allow the interviewees to talk about their areas of expertise and to address the research
questions from different perspectives. For example, the library and information practitioners
were asked directly about their perceptions of collection terminology at a relatively early stage
in the interviews, because this was thought to relate to their core expertise. The interviewees
interested in social enterprise were asked first about their work and their information needs
relating to social enterprise. In those interviews, the topic of collection terminology was
approached more indirectly (asking them first whether they used collections, and then asking
them to explore the meaning of the term “collection”) towards the end of the interview.
The social enterprise interview questions were divided into four main sections:



The interviewee’s organisation and their work (following Kuhlthau and Tama (2001:
29));
Their information behaviour, including the topics about which information is needed,
the information sources used, and the storing and sharing of information within the
organisation (following Kuhlthau and Tama (2001: 29));
69





The concept of “collection” including asking them to describe any collections of
information they have created or used and asking what they understand the term
“collection” to mean;
Their membership and use of libraries.

The questions for library and information practitioners were divided into three sections:




The concept and definition of “collection” and their work in relation to collections;
Social enterprise as a field of interest for their customers and relevant materials
provided by the library or information service;
Collection policies and processes, relationships with publishers and suppliers.

The questions for publishers were divided into three sections:





The interviewee’s organisation and their work;
Social enterprise and publishing issues;
Relationships with libraries;
Concepts of collection including examples of how the term “collection” is used in their
publishing company.

Both the social enterprise and library and information practitioner interview scripts also
included critical incident style questions. Interviewees interested in social enterprise were
asked to describe a recent occasion when they became aware that they needed information
and how they went about locating it. Library and information practitioners were asked to
describe an occasion when their service assisted a customer interested in social enterprise.
The Critical Incident Technique was defined by Flanagan (1954: 335) as “a procedure for
gathering certain important facts concerning behavior in defined situations." These facts could
be obtained from a range of data sources, including interviews (with individuals or groups),
questionnaires or record forms (Flanagan, 1954: 340-343). Andrews (1991: 5) described the
potential value of the Critical Incident Technique for library studies, despite an apparent
scarcity of such studies by the 1990s. More recently, Urquhart et al (2003: 70-71) have
described how the Critical Incident Technique can be used in studies into information
behaviour, highlighting differences in the scale of the studies which use the technique, the
level of depth with which it is used, and whether the technique provides the main focus of a
study or is used "as one technique in a repertoire of qualitative techniques, to develop theory"
(Urquhart et al., 2003: 71).
The interview script for social enterprise stakeholders was piloted with a project supervisor
whose research interests include social enterprise. Scripts were revised following later
interviews and customised for individual organisations. However, the broad structure of these
interviews was maintained. A follow-up interview was conducted with one social enterprise
70

interviewee to explore the interviewee’s approach to collecting and managing materials in
their personal computer system. An outline script for that interview is included in Appendix 8,
along with examples of MS-Dos Command Prompt scripts which could have been used
alongside screenshots to capture information about the file structure on the interviewee’s
computer system, although in the event time constraints meant that neither of these
additional methods of data collection were used. This follow up interview was used a basis for
developing a proposal for an action research project to explore an archive of electronic
documents collected by a social enterprise practitioner, with potential practical outcomes
including the extraction of bibliographic information about the documents and the
reorganisation of the collection.
3.7.1.1 Sampling: Interviews
18 interviewees were identified using purposive sampling, in order to provide a range of
different perspectives on the research questions. Potential social enterprise interviewees were
identified using regional listings such as Social Enterprise Yorkshire and the Humber (2011)
(n=385) or Social Enterprise London (2009) (n=169) as well as listings for national subsets of
social enterprises, such as lists of co-operatives (n=4990) (Co-Operatives UK, 2011) or
Community Interest Companies (n=5111) (Regulator of Community Interest Companies, 2011).
Aspects of social enterprise in the health sector were explored in interviews with two people
involved in running or supporting NHS social enterprise spin-outs, although no interviews were
conducted with library and information practitioners from the health sector. Publishers were
identified in the course of the Strand 2 catalogue search and specific contact details were
identified from publishing company websites. Other potential stakeholder groups (such as
public sector employees or social enterprise customers) were not interviewed. A small number
of additional interview invitations (approximately 6) were also sent to other organisations, but
no replies were received. One person declined an invitation to be interviewed.
3.7.1.2 Implementation
19 interviews with 18 interviewees took place between 24 June 2011 and 28 June 2012 with 5
people involved in running or supporting social enterprises, 6 library and information
practitioners, 2 academics, 2 policymakers, 2 publishers and 1 administrator. This included one
follow up interview with a social enterprise interviewee, who was interviewed twice. Social
enterprise interviewees were selected with the intention of representing a broad range of
organisation types including a co-operative, a public sector spinout, and a social enterprise
consultancy set up specifically as social enterprise. Library and information practitioner
interviewees were approached to represent a range of library and information sectors. The
71

interviewees included 10 women and 8 men. Interviews took place in Birmingham, Bradford,
Bristol, Edinburgh, London, Milton Keynes, Newcastle, Sheffield and Wakefield. The shortest
interview was 25 minutes and the longest interview was 1 hour 31 minutes.
Generally, the interviews took place in suitably quiet locations. However, extraneous sounds
including street noise from partially open windows, noises from coffee machines, ringing
telephones, computer printers or, in one case, the testing of an intruder alarm, were present
in a number of interviews. Locations for the interviews were selected by the interviewees
themselves. 15 interviews took place in an interviewee’s office, or in a meeting room in the
interviewee’s organisation. 2 interviews took place in a semi-public area in the interviewee’s
organisation – such as a combined meeting space and café area, or a meeting area in a larger
communal space consisting of work desks, which also acted as part of a route through the
building. 1 interview took place in a meeting room at the University of Sheffield’s Information
School. 1 interview began in a commercial café and concluded, following the closing of the
café, at a picnic table of a pub opposite the café.
The interviews were recorded using a digital voice recorder. The first 13 interviews were
recorded using a departmental voice recorder and the final 6 interviews were recorded using a
personal voice recorder owned by the researcher. The recordings were transferred to the
researcher’s password-protected laptop in Windows Media Audio (WMA) format following
each interview and were then deleted from the voice recorders. Their content was then
transcribed in full and anonymised, generating transcripts totalling 134,471 words. A summary
of initial findings from these interviews was sent to all interviewees in August 2012.
All library and information practitioner interviewees were asked whether they would be willing
to share copies of their collection policy and process documentation and 4 provided copies of
documentation relating to their collection, totalling 10 documents.
3.7.1.3 Analysis: Interviews
Although Gillham (2000: 53-54) suggests that analysis of interview data should take place after
all interviews have taken place, Saldaña (2009: 17) advises that coding should begin as data are
being transcribed and Charmaz (2006: 48) emphasises that “speed and spontaneity help in
initial coding”. The results from the initial interview stage of Strand 3 were analysed using the
generic coding approach suggested by Saldaña (2009: 48), including the four suggested “First
Cycle” coding stages, followed by “Second Cycle” codes.
This approach used a mixture of coding techniques, including in vivo coding (using words and
phrases provided by the interviewees themselves) and values coding (using codes which reflect
72

the values, beliefs and attitudes of the interviewees) with an emphasis on openness,
particularly in the initial stages (Charmaz, 2006: 49; Saldaña, 2009: 47). From these initial
codes a range of broader themes were identified. The data were re-examined in the light of
each new interview.
Given the length of time which elapsed between the first and the final interviews (June 2011 –
June 2012), the entire set of interview data was re-analysed during September 2012. This was
done in an attempt to recapture some of the initial openness of the coding and to see the
whole set of transcripts as they are, rather than viewing them in the context of existing codes
or through the prism of the most recent interviews.
NVivo software was used to facilitate coding. Grounded theory approaches have previously
been used in a number of relevant studies (Bouthillier, 2003; Lee, 2005; Makri et al., 2006;
Tamura et al., 2007; Blandford et al., 2008; Tamura et al., 2008; Makri and Warwick, 2010),
and were used to “complement other approaches to qualitative data analysis” as suggested by
Charmaz (2006: 9). Analytic memo writing is mentioned by both Charmaz (2006) and Saldaña
(2009) and was used during the data collection and analysis process.
The 10 collection documents provided by 4 library and information practitioners were also
initially coded using NVivo. This open coding was used to identify broad categories and these
were then re-applied to the data in a further content analysis stage.
3.7.1.4 Validity and reliability: interviews
Creswell and Plano Clark (2011: 211-212) show that validity is generally regarded as a more
relevant concern for qualitative research than the issue of reliability, as well as indicating the
range of different approaches to defining and assessing validity in qualitative research. Miles
and Huberman (1994: 277-280) cluster their criteria for evaluating the quality of qualitative
research around five major headings:


“Objectivity/Confirmability” – whether the study can be replicated and whether it is
free from researcher bias;
 “Reliability/Dependability/Auditability” – consistency and “reasonable care”;
 “Internal Validity/Credibility/Authenticity” – “truth value” and the credibility of the
findings;
 “External Validity/Transferability/Fittingness” – identifying any broader theoretical
implications of the study;
 “Utilization/Application/Action Orientation” – whether the findings can be used in a
practical way
Although some of these criteria overlap with validity and reliability criteria discussed in
relation to Strands 1 and 2, combined in this way they do provide a distinctive perspective on
assessing the quality and authenticity of qualitative research and provide an appropriate

framework for evaluating the conduct and findings of this most qualitative part of the whole
research design. Table 3.7.1.4 lists each of these criteria and provides examples of ways in
which these interviews did or did not meet these criteria. This table suggests that the
interviews partially met the criteria identified by Miles and Huberman (1994) and
acknowledges the limitations of this part of the study. The surveys based on the interview
findings provided an opportunity to test and triangulate some of the emerging ideas.
3.7.2 Surveys
The initial findings from the interviews were used to develop a mainly quantitative
questionnaire containing some qualitative elements, which was circulated to a larger sample
of stakeholders. A small number of potential survey questions were piloted in a Lively Lunch
session at the Charleston Conference on Issues in Book and Serials Acquisition in November
2011 (Roberts, 2012a). This is an annual conference hosted in Charleston, South Carolina,
which brings together library and information practitioners, publishers, vendors and
academics.
The audience was asked to vote on these questions during the session using numbered pieces
of paper. Attendees were also invited to complete a brief paper questionnaire recording their
answers to these questions (Appendix 9). 12 responses were received from:




9 library and information practitioners;
2 vendors;
1 academic.

Although this was a useful exercise in terms of establishing an outline of the general areas to
be covered by the surveys, there were significant differences between this Charleston pilot
and the later versions of the survey. In the Charleston pilot, question slides were included in a
presentation about the research. This meant that terms such as “communities of practice” or
“latent collection” could be explained by the researcher before a relevant question was posed.
All the questions in the Charleston pilot were closed questions, meaning that they could be
targeted at a more abstract level. In the final versions of the survey, a mixture of closed and
open questions were used, meaning that the researcher needed to frame closed questions in a
way which anticipated some possible answers to open questions. For example, in the
Charleston pilot the question “Which of the following definitions do you think best describes
the term “collection”?” provided the following answer options, all articulated at an abstract
level:

75

1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

A thing
Access
A process
Library jargon
A group of sub-groups

In the final version of the survey, an open question was also included, asking whether the
respondent had any other definitions of “collection”. It was anticipated that more concrete
definitions of collection would be needed in the multi-choice closed question, in order to avoid
a large number of duplicate responses in reply to the open question. For this reason, the
definition of collection as “A group of materials on a subject or theme” was included in the
final version of the survey, and other response options were also phrased in a more concrete
way.
In order to select an appropriate online survey tool to use for administering the survey, 11
web-based survey systems were evaluated according to the following criteria:








Compliance – data protection issues;
Compatibility – options for exporting survey data to other software applications;
Clarity – options for flexible survey design, such as the use of skip logic, to provide
respondents with a clear path through the survey;
Cost – whether a free or subscription-based tool;
Languages – support for languages other than English;
Limitations – whether numbers of surveys, questions or responses were limited by the
tool;
Comments – any additional observations.

More than one subscription level was also evaluated for 4 of the 11 survey tools. A summary of
the results of this evaluation is shown in Appendix 10. These results were shared with
colleagues and fellow researchers in the University of Sheffield’s Information School during a
meeting of the researchers’ informal discussion group on 9 February 2012 and through a post
on the discussion group blog (Roberts, 2012b). The open source survey software LimeSurvey
emerged from this process as the preferred tool for survey design and data collection. This led
the researcher to initiate discussions within the department about hosting LimeSurvey on one
of the department’s servers; this software was installed on one of these servers in May 2012.
Before the survey software was installed on the server, initial work on the design of the survey
took place on the researcher’s computer, using an emulated web server environment to run
LimeSurvey locally.
The initial draft version of a much more detailed survey was developed between late April and
mid-May 2012. This version of the survey was piloted between mid-May and early July 2012.
The survey initially consisted of a single instrument, with two distinct routes through the
76

survey for library and information practitioners and for people interested in social enterprise. 4
respondents pilot tested the questions for people interested in social enterprise, with 1
responding as a social enterprise practitioner and 3 responding as academics or researchers. 5
responded as library and information practitioners. All pilot test respondents were known
personally to the researcher and were asked to provide comments and suggestions about the
survey. In the light of these comments, a number of alterations were made including:









Separating the survey into two distinct instruments – the overlap between questions
for library and information practitioner respondents and those interested in social
enterprise was low and uniting these questions in a single survey led to a large amount
of missing data for each respondent. People also experienced some uncertainty about
which stakeholder category to use to describe themselves;
The wording of some questions was clarified;
Some questions were subdivided for clarity;
The ordering of the Likert item scales was reversed;
The Likert item scales for evaluating perceptions of importance were altered;
Information about the use and storage of the survey data was repeated at the end of
the survey;
A back button was added to enable people to navigate more easily through the survey.

The final version of the survey for library and information practitioners is shown in Appendix
11 and the final survey for people interested in social enterprise is included in Appendix 12.
The library and information practitioner survey contained 31 questions and the social
enterprise survey contained 28 questions. The themes for these questions are briefly outlined
in Table 3.7.2.

3.7.2.1 Sampling: Surveys
783 questionnaire invitations were distributed:





351 to social enterprise practitioners;
37 to academics / researchers working in the field;
57 to policymakers;
338 librarians and information practitioners in public, academic, national, health and
organisational library and information services.

A mixture of cluster and random sampling was used to identify social enterprise organisations
to approach, based on a listing of Community Interest Companies (CIC) from the Regulator of
Community Interest Companies (2012). A version of this listing from 4 April 2012 archived by
the National Archives was used. This provided details of 6397 CICs. The current regulator
website no longer includes this list and these details have now been incorporated into the
Companies House database. Although not all social enterprises are CICs, all CICs can be
assumed to be social enterprises. A random sample of 777 CICs, identified using Excel’s
random number generator, were searched for using a basic Google search. Of these, websites
were located for 465 organisations. Email addresses were identified for 353 (326 from
England, 4 from Northern Ireland, 12 from Scotland, 11 from Wales), although two addresses
were not used because of concerns about the accuracy of the information. This gave a sample
of 5.5% of the total CIC listing. A further 79 websites included a contact form, but no direct
email address. Given the high proportion of CICs for which no email address was located
(54.6%) the final invitation listing represents a mixture of cluster and availability sampling,
based on random identification of organisations and the availability of email addresses. This
approach, especially the decision not to send out paper copies of surveys, added an element of
bias to the survey, meaning that all responses came from people with internet access.
To develop an understanding of attitudes to the concept of the collection across a wide range
of different types of libraries, contact details were identified for academic and public library
authorities, based on a revised version of the list developed in the course of the Strand 2
catalogue searches. Further searches of individual library websites facilitated the identification
of specific named library respondents in academic libraries (usually a business, management or
social science subject librarian), and generic contact details for public library authorities, or for
a specific library within that authority. Purposive sampling was used to identify contacts in
health and organisational libraries and to identify potential respondents in a single national
library.
A revised version of the list of university libraries created in Strand 2 was also used to identify
UK academics and researchers working in the field of social enterprise. Excel’s random number
78

generator was used to identify a random selection of institutions. Google searches or local
website searches were then used to identify one academic from each of those institutions with
stated research interests relating to social enterprise. The process was repeated until a
sufficient sample of academics had been identified.
Policy makers were identified from relevant websites, including those of the main
representative bodies of the devolved nations of the UK and those of a random sample of local
authorities, based on the list of public library authorities created as part of Strand 2.
3.7.2.2 Implementation
Invitations were sent out to people involved in social enterprise and to library and information
practitioners from all library sectors except national libraries between 8-15 July. The survey
deadline was the end of 26 July, giving all respondents at least 10 days to reply. Invitations to
library and information practitioners from the national library sector were sent out between
24 September and 6 October with a deadline for responses of 12 October. The online survey
tool LimeSurvey was used to generate individual identifying tokens for each invitation and to
send personalised invitation and reminder emails.
As this was the first time that the LimeSurvey software hosted on this server had been used for
the collection of research data, this also acted as a pilot test of the survey technology. One of
the potential disadvantages of local hosting was illustrated by a short powercut to the server,
which led to the surveys being briefly inaccessible. An additional technical issue was identified
during the process of sending out reminder emails. A small number of duplicate six character
token codes were generated for the social enterprise survey. Each of these codes should have
been unique. One set of 21 duplicate codes was manually amended and the amended codes
were included in the relevant reminder emails.
Library and information practitioner survey
338 invitations were sent out:





116 to academic librarians (generally in business / management subject areas and
included one additional email contact, identified from an automated email response);
187 to public libraries;
15 to special libraries – including 5 NHS librarians and 3 government librarians;
20 to national library library and information practitioners.

299 invitations were sent out by the end of 11 July 2012; 19 further invitations were sent out
by the end of 15 July. Reminders were emailed between 22-23 July to those who had not
responded. 13 responses from library and information practitioners in a national library were
79

received between 24 September and 12 October. In total 103 completed responses were
received, representing a response rate of 30.5%. In addition, 53 incomplete responses were
recorded, where respondents closed their internet browser before clicking the submit button;
38 of these contained no responses beyond the basic demographic questions. These
incomplete responses were excluded from analysis.
Social enterprise survey
445 invitations were sent out:




57 to local authority, devolved administration or central government policy makers;
37 to academics or researchers;
351 social enterprise practitioners (CICs).

270 invitations were sent out by the end of 11 July 2012; 175 further invitations were sent out
by the end of 15 July 2012. Reminders were emailed to those who had not responded on 21
July 2012. 46 completed responses were received, representing a response rate of 10.3%. A
further 25 incomplete responses were also recorded and 19 of these were not completed
beyond the introductory demographic questions. Again, these incomplete responses were
excluded from the data analysis stage.
3.7.2.3 Analysis: Surveys
The data from both sets of completed surveys was exported to SPSS. Contact details of
respondents who indicated that they wished to receive a copy of a summary of the survey
results were extracted and saved in an Excel worksheet. These contact details were then
deleted from the final SPSS dataset. A two-page summary of the survey results was sent to
these participants in January 2013 and they were invited to comment on these results. This
summary was also sent to people who had assisted in pilot testing the survey instrument.
SPSS was used to generate frequency tables, giving a detailed breakdown of response totals
for each question. This provided basic descriptive statistics for the results, summarising
“patterns in the responses of cases in a sample” (De Vaus, 2002: 207). SPSS has also been used
to cross-tabulate responses, facilitating the comparison of responses to individual questions
from different stakeholder groups within each survey (for example, comparing responses from
academic librarians, public librarians or national librarians). However, it was found that Excel
provided a better tool for creating charts and graphs, especially when attempting to illustrate
cross-tabulated results.

80

In addition to analysis using descriptive statistics, inferential statistics – tests which can
indicate whether responses could be generalised to the wider populations from which samples
were drawn – have also been used to identify any statistically significant correlations or
relationships between results from the two surveys (De Vaus, 2002: 208).
Most of the survey questions were presented as Likert items. There is some debate as to how
responses to these types of questions can be analysed – whether they should be treated as
ordinal data and analysed using non-parametric tests (Jamieson, 2004), or whether they can be
analysed as interval (or scale) data using parametric tests. De Winter and Dodou (2010)
suggest that either type of test might legitimately be performed on these data. However, given
the small number of responses and the more stringent assumptions made when performing
parametric tests the decision was taken to treat these responses as ordinal data and to limit
more advanced analysis to non-parametric tests, following Pallant (2010: 204) . These include
the chi-square test of independence and particularly an alternative to this called Fisher’s Exact
Test (Fisher, 1925: 84-90; Cohen and Holliday, 1996: 218-220), to test for statistically
significant differences between results from different groups of respondents, such as public
librarians or academic librarians. Although Fisher's Exact Test is often recommended when
testing for the independence of variables in 2x2 contigency tables (Cohen and Holliday, 1996:
218; Pallant, 2010: 217), it can be applied to contingency tables of more dimensions (r x c
contingency tables, where r is any number of rows and c is any number of columns) (Freeman
and Halton, 1951; Mehta and Patel, 1999: 142). As an exact test, it works for tables where
some cells contain low numbers of responses, whereas the chi-square test requires
frequencies in each cell of 5 or more (or of 5 or more in at least 80% of cells) (Pallant, 2010:
217). The main factor which may prevent the use of Fisher's Exact Test in these circumstances
is the demand made on computational power to calculate the exact values and significance
probabilities (Mehta and Patel, 1983).
Although chi-square and Fisher’s Exact tests were applied both to the library and information
practitioner survey and to the social enterprise survey in an attempt to test for independence
between question responses and stakeholder roles, the small sample sizes meant that the
values in the frequency tables were repeatedly found to be too low to satisfy the requirements
of chi-square test. In recognition of the limiting nature of the sample sizes, only the Fisher’s
Exact test results for the three sets of questions which appeared in both the library and
information practitioner and social enterprise surveys are used in the final analysis reported in
this thesis. These were the sets of questions about definitions of collection, the perceived
importance of information sources relating to social enterprise and the perceived importance
of library activities. In these cases, Fisher’s Exact test was used to test for independence
81

between library and information practitioner responses and the answers given to the same
questions by the social enterprise survey respondents.
Free-text responses to open questions were analysed using coding. The codes used to describe
these responses were developed from the survey data, rather than being pre-defined based on
codes developed during the earlier analysis of the interview data.
3.7.2.4 Validity and reliability: Surveys
Considering the validity and reliability of the survey results, the most important observation is
that the relatively small proportion of each population who were invited to participate in a
survey, combined with the relatively low response rate from those who were invited to take
part, limits the external validity of the survey results.
Returning to the criteria suggested by De Vaus (2002: 53-54) for assessing the validity for
quantitative surveys, the Strand 3 surveys have the following strengths and limitations:






Criterion validity – the individual measures were not compared with any pre-existing
instruments;
Content validity – the surveys were extensive (indeed, their length may have
discouraged some responses) and aimed to cover as many different aspects of the
issues involved as possible;
Construct validity – the initial piloting process, although relatively small scale, helped
to refine the survey instrument in a way which clarified questions and routes through
the survey, increasing the likelihood that the questions would “measure what they
intend to measure” (Creswell and Plano Clark, 2011: 210)
Face validity – given the limitations of the survey in relation to the first three types of
validity, detailed descriptions of the development and conduct of the survey are
provided in order to attempt to support a subjective judgement that the survey did
“seem to cover the concept” (De Vaus, 2002: 54).

The survey pilot test was carried out with a very small number of people, all of whom were
known to the researcher and some of whom knew little about the topic of social enterprise.
The survey was only carried out once, partly acknowledging the limited subject knowledge of
some respondents (people inventing answers are less likely to demonstrate consistency when
asked the same question again). Although this is a significant limitation in the way the survey
was developed, representing a failure to test the reliability of the survey instrument, De Vaus’s
(2002: 52) observation that “the test-retest method is a poor one” may suggest that less was
lost by not carrying out a retest than might initially be assumed.

82

3.8 Discussion, strand integration and final analysis
The interpretation of mixed-methods analyses may be described as inferences. Bazeley and
Kemp (2012) provide a metaphorical cookbook for ways in which mixed-methods analyses may
be integrated. These include complementary (“combining”) approaches:




“for completion: bricolage, mosaics and jigsaws” – creating a patchwork based on
availability, or fitting things together to complete a total design (Bazeley and Kemp,
2012: 58-59);
“for enhancement: sprinkling and mixing / stirring” – adding small details to enrich
analysis / reporting or selecting and stirring some of the ingredients together (Bazeley
and Kemp, 2012: 59-60);
“to detail a more significant whole: triangulation and archipelago” – using known
points to map an unknown point or improved understanding of an unseen whole
(Bazeley and Kemp, 2012: 60-64).

And generative approaches:




“exploration through transformation involving blending, morphing or fusion of data
elements ” – introducing new variables, transforming data – for example from
quantitative to qualitative or vice versa – or creating a hybrid (Bazeley and Kemp,
2012: 64-67);
“conversation and DNA as iterative exchange” – moving between different speakers,
rebuilding to accommodate divergence (Bazeley and Kemp, 2012: 67-68).

The emphasis here appears to be on a more creative approach to integration than may be
seen in some of the arguably more formulaic descriptions of approaches to mixed-methods
analysis and interpretation, such as those described by Creswell and Plano Clark (2011: 212238). Bazeley and Kemp (2012: 69) set out eight principles for integrating mixed-methods
analyses, including suggesting that reports of such studies should be shaped around the
research issues, rather than around the methods – this approach should form the basis of the
discussion section of this thesis. Bazeley and Kemp (2012: 70) advocate taking “every
opportunity to fully exploit the integrative potential of mixed data sources and analysis
methods”.
These metaphors for integration can be applied to the analysis and interpretation of results
from each of this study’s strands. The data are integrated in as many ways as possible, across
all strands, helping to identify core issues for discussion.
The catalogue search aspects of strands 1 and 2 can be integrated relatively easily, and to
some extent have already been integrated in the course of the analysis for Strand 2. Some of
the Strand 2 results may also integrate well with other data sources from Strand 1. This
includes, for example, identifying the number of EThOS titles which appear in other library
catalogues, or examining whether there appears to be any correlation between the number of
83

catalogues in which a title was identified and the number of times it was requested in the
British Library’s Reading Rooms.
The Strand 2 catalogue search results can be morphed or transformed to qualitative
descriptions. For example, the insights they offer into the differing extent of the library
collection for social enterprise in public versus academic libraries, or any sectoral differences in
the provision of relevant electronic resources. These can be compared to sectoral differences
identified in the Strand 3 interviews. Quantitative expressions of any sectoral differences
found in Strand 2 can also be compared to sectoral differences identified in the analysis of the
Strand 3 survey data.
Documentation from Strand 1 can also be re-analysed alongside and synthesised with the
analysis of documentation from other libraries collected in the Strand 3 interviews. Using
content analysis to study these documents also provides opportunities to transform qualitative
data into quantitative data, which can enable comparisons of themes and categories with
responses to any relevant survey questions.
In Strand 3, interview data can be transformed into quantitative data (for example by counting
the occurrence of particular codes or themes) and this can then be compared to the
quantitative data from the Strand 3 survey. Free-text responses from the survey can also be
compared to qualitative findings from the interviews.
As the topic of library collections for social enterprise was selected as a case study, this final
discussion also returns to two of Yin’s (2003: 111-115) main three approaches to analysing
case study data:



Exploring what the combined analysis of these three strands suggests about the main
research questions and about the issues perceived to be facing collections more
generally, which social enterprise library collections were thought to exemplify;
Using the combined analyses to explore and, if possible, to test alternative
explanations.

3.9 Mixed-methods validity
Addressing validity and reliability for each of the three strands should contribute to the overall
validity of the study as a whole. Creswell and Plano Clark (2011: 239) define mixed-methods
validity as:
“employing strategies that address potential issues in data collection, data analysis,
and the interpretations that might compromise the merging or connecting of...
strands... and the conclusions drawn from the combination.”
84

By integrating the data and analyses in as many ways as possible, it should be possible both to
show that the appropriate strategies have been used, and to explore in appropriate detail any
divergent findings.
3.10 Ethical issues
This project was ethically reviewed in accordance with the Information School’s ethics review
procedure. According to Sieber (1992: 3), ethics in research is about “how to make social
research ‘work’ for all concerned.” Ethical research not only minimises negative impacts on
participants, but offers positive benefits to those who participate and to wider society. Sieber
(1992: 18) outlines the three core ethical principles which should guide research:




“Beneficence – maximizing good outcomes for science, humanity, and the individual
research participants while avoiding or minimizing unnecessary risk, harm, or wrong.”
“Respect – protecting the autonomy of (autonomous) persons, with courtesy and
respect for individuals as persons, including those who are not autonomous…”;
“Justice – ensuring reasonable, nonexploitative, and carefully considered procedures
and their fair administration…”.

Sieber (1992: 19) outlines the “six norms of scientific behavior” which help to ensure that
projects meet these principles, emphasising the importance of effective research planning,
competence in carrying out the research, consideration of potential risks, appropriate
sampling, “Compensation for injury” and “Voluntary informed consent”.
Miller and Wertheimer (2010: 4) describe consent as a “communicative act” by which “an act
or outcome that would not be permissible absent the consent is given a normative sanction.”
They identify four requirements for such consent to be given: competence, voluntariness
(“free from coercion”), informed (“based on understanding”), and made with intent (Miller
and Wertheimer, 2010: 13). Participation in an interview should be based on voluntary
informed consent (Denscombe, 1998: 109). Sieber (1992: 26-39) discusses issues surrounding
obtaining voluntary informed consent from research participants and describes consent as “an
ongoing process”. For Strand 3 interviewees taking part in this project, a Participant
Information Sheet was developed and is included in Appendix 14. This provides information
about the project and interviewees were asked to read this, together with a consent form, and
to ask any questions they may have about the research before indicating whether or not they
consented to participate in the interview. A version of this information was also be provided to
participants responding to the Strand 3 questionnaire, and a mandatory question was included
at the start of the survey asking whether they consented to participate. Summaries of initial
findings from Strand 3 have been shared with participants.
85

Sieber (1992: 44-45) describes the relationship between concepts of anonymity,
confidentiality and privacy, defining confidentiality as relating to “how data are to be handled
in keeping with subjects’ interest in controlling the access of others to information about
themselves.” Powell and Connaway (2004: 187) observe that confidentiality rather than
anonymity tends to be “more the norm” in qualitative research in library and information
science, as well as identifying areas where interviewees may discuss potentially sensitive
topics, such as misuse of libraries, plagiarism or breach of copyright. Data must also be
obtained, processed and stored in accordance with the eight principles of the Data Protection
Act 1998 (Information Commissioner's Office, [No date]); this includes the principle that
personal data should not be transferred out of the European Economic Area, which was a
factor in the choice of online survey tool for the Strand 3 questionnaire.
Powell and Connaway (2004: 187) describe how removal of identifying details and other
approaches can help to ensure the confidentiality of qualitative research data. In this project,
interview and questionnaire results were anonymised and data has been held on a passwordprotected computer system. Data from publicly accessible catalogues or from documentation
was identified descriptively (for example by sector) rather than by library name. Usage
statistics should not include any personally identifiable data. However, it is difficult not to
identify the British Library, due to its unique collections and the focus on the use of these
collections for this research project. The British Library has provided permission for the use of
its data in this project (Appendix 15). Key contacts in the British Library have been invited to
review and comment on draft versions of reports which include data from Strand 1 as part of
the study validation process (Yin, 2003: 159-160).
Benefits to research participants, researcher, university and funder may take a range of forms
(Sieber, 1992: 101-106). In addition to sharing a summary of findings from the initial interviews
with participants, opportunities also emerged to provide active assistance in locating
information relevant to social enterprise – both for social enterprise practitioner participants,
and for library and information practitioners or academics. In these circumstances, where the
researcher was acting in the role of a library and information professional by providing
guidance or advice on accessing information, the professional ethical principles set out by
Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals (2011) also applied.
3.11 Finance
This project has been funded by a British Library Concordat Scholarship. The main costs
associated with the project were related to transport, particularly for undertaking Strand 3
interviews. These costs were initially estimated as likely to be around £300 (an average of £30
86

per return journey for 10 interviews). The actual costs of travel tickets over £10 for these
interviews are shown in Appendix 16.
The use of an open source online survey tool hosted on a server in the Information School
meant that there was no need to subscribe to an enhanced version of an online survey tool or
to a separate web hosting service. This had been anticipated to cost up to £30 per month,
based on charges for Smart-Survey, a UK based online survey tool which is Data Protection Act
compliant (Smart-Survey, 2011). The surveys were administered entirely online, saving
potential postage costs for issuing any printed copies of the questionnaire by post.
3.12 Study limitations
This study aimed to offer a broad perspective on the library collection for social enterprise,
using this to suggest possible approaches to the concept of collection in the digital world. At
the same time, it aimed to provide greater depth in more focused areas, such as in the British
Library case study. There is a potential tension between seeking to provide both breadth and
depth within a single study, with a risk that in some areas the data collection or analysis may
appear shallow. There are also more specific limitations in each of the project’s three strands.
In Strand 1, the sheer scale of the work of the British Library meant it was a significant
challenge to identify potentially relevant projects or data sources. The data gathered is a very
incomplete view of the Library’s work, although the analysis of the Annual Reports does
provide a more holistic perspective. Some of the Library’s projects which would have been
potentially useful for this study – such as the long-delayed introduction of electronic legal
deposit, and the development of the BIPC (Business and Intellectual Property Centre) National
Network programme – have not been fully implemented within the timeframe of this research.
Much of the data were organised and provided by people other than the researcher. This
means that the researcher did not have as much control over these elements of data collection
for the study as others. It also means that quantitative data series end at different times – for
example, the Document Supply Centre statistics end in late summer 2011, but the website
usage statistics cover a period up to autumn 2012. This does not reduce the usefulness of the
data, but it does limit the potential comparisons which could be made between those sets of
data.
In Strand 2, the varied quality of library catalogues themselves limit the conclusions which can
be drawn from this part of the study. The original plan had been to include a range special
library catalogues in the catalogue searches. However, this was not possible in the timeframe
identified for searching the public, academic and NHS library catalogues, and conducting those
87

searches at a later point (perhaps several months after concluding the other searches) would
have significantly reduced the opportunity to make useful comparisons with the earlier search
results.
In the Strand 3 interviews, the biggest challenge was in getting publishers to participate in the
interviews. Although two publishers were interviewed, the amount of time taken to
successfully recruit publisher participants led to the decision not to include publishers in the
next stage of data collection: no publishers were invited to take part in the online survey.
Although an element of random sampling was used to identify potential survey participants,
this was mixed with availability factors such as the presence of a contact email address. This,
combined with the relatively low response rates, limits the potential representativeness of the
survey results and the certainty with which conclusions can be drawn.
3.13 Conclusion
This chapter describes the methodological approach taken to addressing the research
questions identified for this project. The study has taken a pragmatic approach to exploring
concepts of collection in the digital world, focusing on information for social enterprise. It has
used a multiphase mixed-methods research design including: a case study of a unique library
collection at the British Library; a wide-ranging search of other library catalogues in the UK;
and an exploratory sequential study, using interview data to generate theories which have
then been tested for transferability using surveys of a larger group of stakeholders.

4 STRAND 1: BRITISH LIBRARY CASE STUDY FINDINGS
4.1 Introduction
This chapter summarises findings from the case study of the British Library’s collections for
social enterprise. This case study features both quantitative and qualitative elements and aims
to examine the characteristics of the British Library’s collections, particularly as they relate to
social enterprise, and how they are used. The case study addresses the following research
questions:
1. What are the characteristics of the library collection for social enterprise?
2. How is the library collection for social enterprise used?
5. What does this study suggest about the wider issues relating to library and
information collections in the digital world?
6. What constitutes the concept of the library collection in the digital world?
The methodology chapter provides detailed information about how the data described in this
chapter were collected and analysed. Appendix 3 summarises the main data gathered,
indicating whether these were collected directly by the researcher or whether they were
requested from and supplied by British Library staff.
Content analysis of British Library Annual Reports since 1973 explored issues affecting
collection development and management, the impact of technology and the role of business
information services over nearly 40 years. Collection policy and process documentation
provided insight into the ongoing review of the Library’s content strategy, as well as the
concepts used and issues involved in the day-to-day development and management of the
collections for both BIPC subject areas and for specific formats. Descriptive statistics showed
the relatively small scale of the British Library's collection for social enterprise, as revealed by
catalogue searches, and provided information about its characteristics, such as publication
dates, types of publication and usage statistics for items requested or accessed in the British
Library's Reading Rooms. Further statistics also indicated the relative levels of usage of
materials about social enterprise from two electronic databases provided in the BIPC Reading
Room.
Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the use of materials relevant to social enterprise
provided by some of the Library’s remote services, such as document supply, EThOS digitised
theses, as well as usage of web-based subject guides and the MBS portal. Searches of the
permissions-based UK web archive also gave an indication of the amount of material
containing terms relating to social enterprise. Data from two examples of other British Library
services – feedback from BIPC events and online enquiries – illustrate the relatively small scale
89

of the British Library’s social enterprise audience. Data from the other two strands which
relate to the British Library are also briefly considered. Finally, findings from these data
sources are discussed and initial responses to each of the research questions are proposed.
4.2 Analysis of British Library documentation
4.2.1 Historical overview of the British Library collection, technological developments and
business and information services – content analysis of Annual Reports
The British Library’s Annual Reports provide a rich source of data and give an overview of the
development of the Library, showing the impact of political, economic, social and technological
changes on the Library. Content analysis was performed on the 39 Annual Reports published
between the Library’s inception in 1973 and 2012, with data extracted on the basis of the
criteria identified in Appendix 4.
The quantitative results, including term frequency totals (number of times each term was
counted), years covered and the codes used to refer to each of the Annual Reports are
summarised in Appendix 17. Codes were allocated to indicate the years covered by each
report (AR73-74 covers 1973-1974). A more detailed summary of the key points of the Annual
Reports published within 4 or 5 year time periods is given in Appendix 18. Features marked
with an asterisk indicate projects or services for which further data were analysed as part of
this strand.
4.2.1.1 The British Library and its collection 1973-2012
AR 73-4 set out the challenge facing the newly created British Library, which merged together
diverse predecessor organisations including the British Museum Library, the National Lending
Library for Science and Technology, the National Central Lending Library, and the British
National Bibliography:
“The object of the Board of the British Library is therefore to weld these hitherto
separate institutions into a great modern library at the hub of the nation’s library
system, setting the pace in meeting the multiple needs of today’s users and satisfying
new needs by creating new services.” (p.3)
It is notable that the emphasis here is both on creating a single institution (“a great modern
library”) and on contributing to the wider national “library system”. The Annual Reports show
how the British Library has gradually established a clear and distinctive identity for itself,
including through small-scale media representation – such as use in a Times crossword and
Mastermind (AR 89-0, p.25). The Library’s profile has grown since its move to St Pancras, with

90

a Mori poll cited in AR 05-6 as showing an increase in awareness of the national library from
50% five years before to 75% in 2006 (p.18).
The role of the Library in the wider information network is highlighted in eight Annual Reports.
The early reports describe this in positive terms (“a new national library system relevant to
every library in the country” (AR 77-8, p.8)), whilst later reports discuss specific initiatives
supported or coordinated by the Library, such as the development of Library and Information
Plans described in AR 88-9 (p.35) or British Library involvement with the Joint Academic
Network (JANET) (AR 94-5, p.25). The 100 millionth Document Supply Centre request is
described in AR 01-2 as showing the “continuing importance of the Library in underpinning the
wider network of UK libraries” (p.7). AR 03-4 describes exhibitions coordinated with public
libraries in the North East and in Leeds, noting that the national library “can seem quite
distant” to many (p.22). Later involvement with public libraries includes providing tours of the
British Library for new professionals working in public libraries known as “BL champions” (AR
06-7, p.17) and “a pilot regional bursary scheme to enable librarians from the [East Midlands]
region to undertake research at the Library into topics of regional relevance” (AR 06-7, p.20).
However, this seems less substantial than the engagement with issues facing public libraries
shown by the British Library’s involvement in assisting the development of cross-sectoral
regional Library and Information Plans (AR 88-9, p.35), or the Research and Innovation
Centre’s work on “the social impact of public libraries” (AR 97-8, p.46). There may also be
some tension between the Library’s position in the national network and its growing role as “a
global information hub” (AR 10-1, p.15).
Between 1973 and 1982 (AR 73-4 – AR 81-2) the Annual Reports are largely structured around
functional groupings suggested by the predecessor organisations (“Reference Division”,
“Lending Division”, “Bibliographic Services Division”). Other sections of the Reports deal with
the specific responsibilities allocated to the Library in the 1972 Act – including the Research
and Development Department, and “Assistance to other libraries”. The challenge of bringing
together very different organisations is perhaps reflected in the differing use of collection
terminology in these early Annual Reports: in the first nine reports, the term “collection(s)” is
more frequently used in the Reference Division sections (averaging 13.9 uses compared to 1.8
uses in the Lending Division section), as is “holdings” (averaging 5.9 uses compared to 1.8 uses
in the Lending Division section). In contrast, the term “stock” averages 5.8 uses in the Lending
Division sections, compared to 1.6 uses in the Reference Division sections. Other terms
referring to collection activities appear later – “collection building” (introduced as a journal
title in 1978 (Emerald, 2013)) and “collection development” were first used in 1983 (AR 82-3).
“Collection management” appeared first in 1986 (AR 85-6), ten years after the publication of
91

the first volume of the journal Collection Management (Taylor & Francis, 2013a) indicated the
adoption of the term within the library profession.
The four reports from 1982-1986 (AR 82-3 to AR 85-6) feature “The Collections” as their first
major section after the Chief Executive’s introduction and “Collection development” features
as a main section heading in the next two reports (AR 86-7, AR 87-8). Of the following 24
reports, 10 include “collection” or “collections” in their top level table of contents section
headings, although overall the words “collection” or “collections” occur more frequently in
each of the reports than any of the other terms which were counted. Figure 4.2.1.1 shows
general trends in the numbers of times the different terms relating to collections are used in
each of the reports (dates refer to the end date of the period covered by an Annual Report –

Count of term uses

for example, the figures from the Annual Report 1973-1974 are shown as 1974 in this graph).

Figure 4.2.1.1: Count of term uses relating to collections from 1974 – 2012.
The drop in levels of use of the term “collection” and “collection management / development /
building” may reflect the shorter length of reports from AR 97-8 onwards. AR 96-7 was more
than 36,000 words; AR 97-8 was less than 25,000: a considerable part of this difference may be
accounted for by the move away from including a section on “Staff representation” (present
from AR 92-3 to AR 96-7) which listed staff membership of professional organisations,
including their job titles, which frequently included the term “collection”.
Over time, functions were rationalised and consolidated into a smaller number of units; in
particular, the “common stock” approach adopted in the 1980s (AR 85-6) provided a way of
combining material for lending with reference material, reducing duplication within the
92

collections, although this mainly applied to lightly used material (AR 88-9, p.23). A later report
restates the “principal aim... to realign our resources to operate as a single library holding a
single collection on two main sites” (AR 94-5, p.15). The conspectus methodology for assessing
library collections was considered in the 1980s, first discussed in AR 84-5 (p.11). AR 86-7
reported “experimental steps” in using conspectus, with fuller implementation described in AR
87-8 and AR 88-9, including coordination of UK-wide “Conspectus databases” (AR 90-1, p.27)
The term “content”, although present in earlier reports – for example, AR 82-3 indicates the
“need for conservation of the collections and the preservation of their information content”
(p.15) – has only been counted and recorded from AR 99-0. Use increases following the
Library’s consultation on a new content strategy discussed in the 2005-2006 Annual Report
(AR 05-6). Between AR 99-0 and AR 05-6, uses of “content” average 3.8 per report, compared
to 94.8 uses of “collection(s)” per report (0.04 uses of “content” to one use of “collection”).
Between AR 06-7 and AR 11-2, uses of “content” average 31.7 per report and uses of
“collection(s)” average 133.9 per report (0.24 uses of “content” to each use of “collection”),
suggesting a considerable rise in the relative use of the term content compared to collection
between 2000 and 2012.
The legal deposit privilege – also described as copyright receipt, with other legal deposit
libraries also being described as copyright libraries – is mentioned in every Annual Report. First
mention is made of the possible extension of legal deposit to cover non-print materials in
1990, which records that the Library’s advisory council discussed “the issues surrounding the
extension of legal deposit to non-print materials” (AR 89-0, p.60); this topic is pursued in later
reports with initial recommendations to the government (AR 92-3, p.21), Smethurst’s review
of print legal deposit (AR 95-6), the initial government consultation on extending legal deposit
to cover non-print materials (AR 96-7), the Kenny review of options for non-print legal deposit
(AR 97-8), the initial passage of the Legal Deposit Libraries Act 2003 (AR 03-4) and progress
towards final regulations enabling statutory deposit of non-print materials (AR 11-2).
4.2.1.2 Technology
The Annual Reports also demonstrate the impact of new technologies on libraries. The British
Library seems to be an early adopter of some technologies – both computers and online
resources were mentioned in the first report (AR 73-4) and by 1976 “All major cataloguing and
indexing activities within the Library are now computer based” (AR 75-6, p.4). The term
“digital” was first used in 1978 (AR 77-8), and the term “electronic” was first used in 1980 (AR
79-0). AR 88-9 declared that “The Library is at the forefront of development in the application

93

of CD-ROM technology” (p.21) and the British Library launched its first website, Portico, in
1994 (AR 94-5).
Microfilming initiatives in the 1980s gave way to digitisation projects in the 1990s and 2000s,
including the Turning the Pages digitisation project, part of an Initiatives for Access programme
developed to coincide with the move to St Pancras (AR 96-7). However, there is an overlap –
the digitised Beowulf manuscript was mounted on the internet in 1993-1994 (AR 93-4, p.7) but
a microfilming initiative funded by Mellon ended in 1996-1997 (AR 98-9, p.58). The
development of OPAC 97 also coincided with the opening of St Pancras, forming an integral
part of the book ordering and delivery services (the Automated Book Retrieval System (AR 978, p.29)) for readers in the new library.
More recently, the British Library has contributed to open access infrastructure development
through its involvement in setting up UKPubMed in 2006-2007 (AR 06-7, p.6) and its ongoing
role in supporting this until 2016 (AR 11-2, p.19). It also adds dataset records to its catalogue
(AR 09-0, p.22) and was a founding member of DataCite, the initiative to help “researchers to
find, access, cite and reuse scientific data” (AR 09-0, pp.24-25; AR 11-2, p.15).
4.2.1.3 Business information
Following working party recommendations on improving services to business (AR 79-0), the
launch of the Business Information Service and the Patent Information Network is described in
the 1980-81 Annual Report (AR 80-1). The launch of the Business Information Network took
place in 1989, aiming to develop further the business information links between the British
Library and public libraries (AR 89-0, p.8) although this seems not to have had the same
traction as the Patent Information Network.
The Business and Intellectual Property Centre was launched in collaboration with the London
Development Agency as a pilot of new type of service for businesses in 2004-2005 (AR 04-5,
p.17), providing networking opportunities and speaker events, as well as information
resources. The BIPC was launched as a permanent service in 2005-2006 (AR 05-6, p.4) and was
estimated to have added £11 million of value to the UK economy by 2010 (AR 09-0, p.8).
Social enterprise is indirectly referred to, including in references to Anita Roddick’s Ask an
Expert session (AR 05-6 p.12-13; AR 07-8, p.19); an event involving John Bird, Big Issue
founder, (AR 06-7, p.16); sustainable business events (AR 98-9, p.26, 32) and a Resource
Discovery Network initiative for sustainable business (AR 00-1, p.25).

94

Ideas of social enterprise may also be seen as having deeper, longer-standing relevance to the
British Library. The proportion of expenditure earned by the Library’s trading activities
(between 20% and 28%) is discussed in AR 85-6, AR 86-7, AR 90-1 and AR 98-9; some reports
mention the Library’s contracts with Remploy (AR 91-2, AR 95-6) and BookNet was launched in
1988-1989 (AR 88-9, p.23), as a self-funding organisation to coordinate book and serial
disposals, with “Items left over... donated to UK charities for the benefit of third world
countries” (AR 89-0, p.12).
4.2.1.4 An international perspective: British Library annual reports to CENL
In addition to the main British Library annual reports, the Library also reports on its activities to
other organisations, such as the Conference of European National Librarians (CENL). 12 British
Library reports are available from the CENL website (Conference of European National
Librarians, 2013) covering the period from 1995-2012 (reports for several years are missing)
and were analysed using the same content analysis criteria. The codes used to refer to these
reports, the years they cover and the term frequency totals are shown in Appendix 19. These
reports are considerably shorter with a mean length of 2038 words (to the nearest whole
number) compared to a mean approximate length of over 24,000 words for the main Annual
Reports.
Some reports directly refer readers to the Library’s main annual reports (CENL 06-7; CENL 078; CENL 10-1; CENL 11-2) and the first report from Lynne Brindley’s time as Chief Executive is a
condensed version of the main Annual Report with a similar structure (CENL 01-2). However,
there are some notable differences between these reports and the fuller versions: early CENL
reports specifically state the size of the Library’s acquisitions budget (CENL 96-7; CENL 97-8;
CENL 98-9; CENL 99-0), perhaps as an assertion of the spending power of the British Library
compared to other European national libraries. CENL 99-0 (p.8) gives more detail about the
role of the Library’s Think Tank and Policy Unit, set up after the transfer of research funding to
the Library and Information Commission, including some early conclusions such as encouraging
the Library to move “away from ‘collection first’ to ‘users first’”. Most collaborative initiatives
outlined either relate to international work or to coordination of research library projects in
the UK. Only two CENL reports mention regional, cross-sectoral projects, including the
development of the BIPC service model in a number of regional public libraries (CENL 11-2) and
the Inspire pilot project, which was described in CENL 01-2 (p.6) as aiming:
“to create seamless access between public, national and higher education libraries, as
well as special libraries and those in further education colleges and schools, and to
build an effective interface to resources for learning with museums, galleries and
archives.”
95

The term frequencies also show a much smaller gap between the counts of words relating to
‘collection’ and those relating to digital, web or electronic technologies, which might partly
suggest an intention to emphasise to an international audience the Library’s role as a
technological innovator.
4.2.2 Collection policy and process documentation
A highly heterogeneous selection of policy and process documents were provided to the
researcher and the characteristics of 20 of these documents, including the codes used to refer
to them, are summarised in Appendix 20. These documents provide useful contextual
information about the British Library’s approach to collection development and management,
and to collection terminology. These documents also illustrate some of the issues affecting the
library collection for social enterprise and can be broadly described as falling into three main
categories:




Documents relating to the review and refreshment of the British Library’s Content
Strategy (British Library, 2006), identified with the prefix BL CS-;
Documents relating to the Business and IP Centre subject collection processes,
identified with the prefix BL BIPC-;
Documents relating to specific types of materials (datasets, electronic documents,
official publications), identified with the prefix BL PROC-.

The documents also serve to demonstrate both the scale and complexity of the Library’s
collections, and the very wide range of processes which are required to develop and manage
them.
4.2.2.1 Content strategy review documents
Created at an early stage in the content strategy refreshment exercise, BL CS1 provides a brief
outline of the remit for the review. In particular, this document highlights the need to:





Express high level principles in a straightforward way;
Focus on digital and on “connecting” people to digital content;
Review the existing legislative framework for the Library’s collection development and
management activities (“BL Act, White Paper, and Legal Deposit Libraries Act”);
Determine the appropriate level of involvement in collaborative collection
development (“e.g. UKRR”).

BL CS2 also provides an early statement about the principles underlying the content strategy
review, citing and commenting on principles from the existing content strategy. This includes
expressing an intention to “focus on developing a content strategy rather than a traditional
collection development strategy”, emphasising a shift in terminology from talking about
“collection” or “collections” to discussing “content”. This document also identifies both
researchers and business people as key audiences for the Library’s content, and indicates in
96

two comments the importance of identifying priority areas for further content development. A
later overarching statement about the role of the revised content strategy is set out in BL CS3,
a single PowerPoint slide articulating a vision for the Library’s content in 2015. This sets out
the following core principles:




reflecting “the responsibility of the UK’s national library to the nation’s current and
future generations” by:
o collecting by legal deposit, central to “all content activity”;
o collecting by “digital legal deposit..., including the UK web domain”;
o investing in “primary research materials”;
demonstrating responsiveness to “the research priorities of the Library’s users” by:
o considering UK researcher priorities when making decisions about content;
o presenting content by subject;
o collecting “digital as the format of choice”.

BL CS4 and BL CS6 are template documents which give some indication of how the content
strategy review – and particularly the process of prioritising subject areas for collection – has
been carried out in practice. BL CS4 provides a suggested framework for describing each of the
three discipline areas of Arts and Humanities, Social Science, and Science, Technology and
Medicine. In this document, the importance of the shift from format-led to subject-driven
collecting is emphasised, treated immediately after the initial core statement of the 5 strategic
priorities from the Library’s 2020 Vision document (British Library, 2010a). The template then
requires analysis of the current external environment for the discipline, the current internal
situation of the discipline within the British Library (“collecting and connecting”), including
prioritisation of different subject areas, and anticipated changes in the external environment
up to 2020. This analysis is to be used as the basis for describing the “strategic choices
available to [the] BL for your discipline”.
BL CS5 is a final draft of a completed version of BL CS4 for the discipline of Social Science. This
is the discipline which includes Business and Management, the subject area which has been
most closely associated with social enterprise content. BL CS5 highlights the complexity of
subject inter-relationships within the British Library. For example, the Social Science discipline
also manages content from America and Australasia, which includes materials relevant to all
subjects and especially Area Studies for those regions. The draft discusses approaches to
collecting and connecting users to Social Science content and highlights 5 main challenges for
the discipline:





"Changing levels and nature of demand";
"Increasing volume and variety of content (Supply)";
"The ongoing shift to digital publishing" – including issues surrounding opening up
access to research and public sector data;
"Finding and using our content";
97



"Cuts in funding and provision".

Possible responses to these challenges are outlined. The draft document discusses subject
priorities within the discipline, including subjects which may be seen as lower priority areas for
collection development, as well as identifying a role for Social Science in collecting for "interdisciplinary themes". It emphasises a continuing focus on supporting "the research needs of
UK researchers engaged in academic, commercial and public service research". Suggestions are
made for ways of obtaining improved management information about the collection, including
"collecting data about failed searches on our catalogue", and the importance of written
selection policies to mitigate the possible negative impact of staff departures on levels of
knowledge about the collection. Specific potential barriers to the implementation of the
strategy include:




The difficulty of licensing digital content for remote access;
A lack of management information;
Issues with workflows and tools for dealing with digital – especially to support the
introduction of e-legal deposit.

BL CS6 provides a template for outlining content considerations for each subject. It is largely
based around a series of questions, focusing on:





Audience / users;
Size and scale of subject research activity in the UK;
Content;
Content strategy.

The emphasis in this template is on combining subject area expertise with data from
management information relating to the Library’s collections.
BL CS7 is the final published version of the British Library’s content strategy (British Library,
2013b). This articulates the Library’s role as being to "build, curate and preserve the UK’s
national collection of published, written and digital content". It defines the role of the Content
Strategy in terms of selection:
"A content strategy describes why a library selects what it selects and it sets out the
principles which will inform selection in future. The present Content Strategy is the
framework which guides the Library’s acquisition streams – Legal Deposit, purchased
acquisitions, voluntary deposit (for example of sound recordings), donation and
exchange.”
The strategy makes the distinction between collecting and “‘connecting’ activity, linking to
content it does not intend to hold within its own storage facilities”. The strategy describes a
shift towards discipline and subject-based collecting and connecting, based on academic users’
understandings of content, arguing that this approach is also likely to be understood by non98

academic user groups. This appears to represent quite a considerable shift in the Library’s
focus, particularly as it represents a move away from the idea of aiming for
comprehensiveness, in favour of the concept of coherence:
"We will aim for coherence within the disciplines, recognising that a comprehensive
approach is neither ﬁnancially sustainable nor appropriate for our users’ needs."
This concept of “coherence” is not fully defined. However, it seems to represent ongoing
development of ideas about how to describe the aim of the British Library’s collection. BL CS2
suggests that comprehensiveness is not possible, but that “distinctiveness” could be an
alternative aim. BL CS6 describes the role of acquisitions by purchase in developing “a
consistent collection”.
BL CS7 outlines four criteria for identifying subject priorities:





“The Library can offer particularly rich content and services for the researcher,”
“There is strong researcher demand for content in the subject,”
“The subject is a priority of UK research funders,”
“The researcher is under-served by other providers"

Other elements of this strategy include describing the importance of supporting
interdisciplinary study; applying format expertise across subject areas; encouraging user
community involvement in adding value to content, and increasingly prioritising digital over
print content. The importance of facilitating greater access to library content is emphasised.
However, although open access is mentioned, this is only to note that it has been the subject
of “a great deal of debate”.
4.2.2.2 BIPC subjects
Documents BL BIPC1-BL BIPC5 describe practical aspects of particular processes relating to
collection development and management for subjects covered by the BIPC.
Legal Deposit
All 5 documents mention Legal Deposit, emphasising the centrality of the Legal Deposit
privilege to all aspects of the development and management of the British Library collections,
even if Legal Deposit material is being specifically excluded from a collection. For example,
both BL BIPC1 and BL BIPC2 describe collections developed by purchases, rather than through
Legal Deposit; BL BIPC2 (a document describing the business collection) explains that “we
believe that items in this collection will be heavily used and we do not want to place LD
collection items at risk”. In contrast, BL BIPC3 describes the Intellectual Property reference
collection “built primarily by the selection of monographs and serials received through Legal
99

Deposit. Some supplementary material may be purchased”. BL BIPC4 also highlights some of
the ambiguities of Legal Deposit legislation and its possible interpretations: “Our
understanding is that company annual reports do not fall within the strict definition of Legal
Deposit, however many companies deposit their reports with the British Library and these are
accepted into the collection.”
BL BIPC5 describes the reluctance of some business information publishers to deposit and the
need to place embargoes on some content in order to address publishers’ concerns. It also
outlines the dramatic impact of the shift from print to digital publication on the material
received through legal deposit – “the output of many publishers has moved entirely beyond
our reach” – and describes the introduction of non-print legal deposit as the “biggest
opportunity on our horizon”.
Practical vs theoretical works; active vs passive collecting
Both BL BIPC1 (for the Small Business Help collection) and BL BIPC2 (for the Business
collection) describe a contrast between practical and theoretical works, with an emphasis on
collecting practical texts, rather than more theoretical content. To a lesser extent this contrast
is also evident in BL BIPC3, where the emphasis is again placed on practical works, along with
expert and scholarly studies, but in which “very ‘scientific’” texts are excluded. The subject
analysis document for business information (BL BIPC5) defines business information as
materials of “practical use to those needing information to start up or to run businesses in the
UK “. More theoretical works are not discussed in this document, although the potential future
research value of such practical publications is noted: "Business information content assumes
a significant research value as it ages".
BL BIPC4 (a collection policy for Company Annual Reports) outlines an interesting contrast
between “Active collecting”, exemplified by approaching FTSE 100 companies to request
copies of company annual reports, and “Passive collecting”, where material is received either
by Legal Deposit or because of companies’ previous experiences of providing these reports. BL
BIPC5 also refers to “actively collected” material – but passive collecting is not mentioned.
Approaches to selection
All 5 documents also outline the scope of material for inclusion. BL BIPC1, BL BIPC2 and BL
BIPC3 detail material types to include or exclude. BL BIPC2 provides examples of materials
which would or would not be relevant to the collection, emphasising that “The crucial thing is
content”. BL BIPC1 refers to two blogs to aid in identifying possible acquisitions and includes
an example of a completed order form. BL BIPC4 also describes using the web archiving
100

process to request archived copies of FTSE 100 websites, effectively providing an alternative
mechanism for capturing annual reports.
BL BIPC5 provides a more strategic perspective on the Business Information subject area,
which it succinctly summarises as “three streams of content covering




Companies (who is in business/trading)
Products (what are they making/selling)
Markets (why is it selling/where is it selling)”

Processes and problems
These documents outline in detail the processes involved in selecting relevant material, as well
as highlighting possible problems. BL BIPC1, BL BIPC 2, BL BIPC3 and BL BIPC4 all provide
detailed advice on the day-to-day processes of selection and collection management.
Guidance on exclusions are supported by examples, which often seem to be so specific as to
imply that they have been encountered as problems in the past (“we will not select very
popular ‘would you believe it!’ or child oriented publications” (BL BIPC3)).
BL BIPC2 and BL BIPC3 describe a selection process based on reviewing the weekly BNB
(British National Bibliography), and BL BIPC2 describes claims for Legal Deposit material which
are not fulfilled. BL BIPC4 provides a useful brief history of the collection of annual reports,
highlighting prior (and potentially ongoing) double-collecting between the General Reference
Collection and the Business Information Service / BIPC, with printed company annual reports
being recorded on a separate union catalogue. BL BIPC4 describes the need to deaccession
one copy in case of duplication, either immediately (for non-FTSE 100 companies) or once it is
no longer current, whilst retaining the Legal Deposit copy.
BL BIPC5 describes the challenges of moving from print to electronic resource subscriptions,
observing: “Licensing issues... have prevented us from turning existing hard copy journal and
directory subscriptions into e-subscriptions.” It also identifies the particular challenge
presented by more dynamic business information resources, which contain regularly updated
data brought together to create a custom-built output for the individual user. BL BIPC5 also
suggests the limitations of management information currently available to inform collection
decision-making, describing a sample of download data from BIPC Reading Room e-resources
as:
“a rare instance where we capture data on readers who are actively using resources in
the BIP reading room and so (with a variety of caveats) it is a uniquely useful record of
our actual user base”.

101

4.2.2.3 Processes for specific types of material
Datasets
BL PROC1 begins with explanation of the rationale for setting selection criteria for datasets. A
useful decision chart / flow diagram shows decision points and outcomes during the selection
process – this is the only document amongst those collected which provides a diagrammatic
representation of collection processes. Detailed links are provided to sources for identifying
data resources, both in the main text of the selection guide and as an appendix. Guidance for
assessing the relevance and appropriateness of data resources includes descriptions of 5 main
sets of criteria:






scope assessment (subject, audience, language, content type, and out of scope
material);
quality assessment (completeness, ownership, stability and standards);
access assessment;
uniqueness assessment;
provision method (aggregating model / metadata harvesting).

Interdependencies (for example, potential overlaps with Social Science subject areas) are
discussed and a process for reviewing the selection criteria is outlined. 4 outstanding issues,
phrased as questions, are included at the end of the document and “will be explored as we
progress the work”. Appendices include listings of 44 subjects, which are in scope, with more
detailed scope notes on individual topics, as well as descriptions of types of data which are in
scope and out of scope. Criteria matrices provide further definitions and describe test
selections.
Official Publications
BL PROC2 outlines conditions for considering donations of official papers, beginning by
describing exclusions and out of scope materials. It describes local government publications for
inclusion, as well as those excluded from the collection, stating the British Library’s “primary
responsibility for collecting [these] publications from England and Northern Ireland”. The
relevant practical procedures for considering donations are also described.
BL PROC3 and BL PROC5 both discuss approaches to reviewing Official Publications
subscriptions with the intention of making cancellations. Criteria are set out for considering
overseas Official Publications serials for cancellation, including the implementation of web
archiving programmes in the relevant countries. Both also describe collaborative collection
development arrangements which may prevent the Library from cancelling particular serials.

102

BL PROC2 also mentions the collaborative collection management initiative UKRR (UK
Research Reserve) in relation to managing donations.
BL PROC8 describes three levels of collecting activity for official publications from different
countries: “comprehensively for the UK”; “liberally for the US and EU”; “selectively” for other
countries. These suggest three quite different intensities of collection, but all could potentially
contribute to the development of “coherent” collections described by the content strategy (BL
CS7).
Digital documents
BL PROC4 describes types of digital versions of Official Publications which could be included in
(ingested into) the Library’s digital content management system (DLS). Format considerations
are very significant: PDF, Word or Excel documents, or documents in RTF or TXT format are
suitable for ingestion, but not HTML web pages (which could instead be considered by the web
archiving programme). No clear preference is expressed for either digital or paper copies of
these documents: “both print and electronic versions may be taken”.
Detailed subject and format listings
BL PROC6 and BL PROC7 both provide detailed lists of subject headings covered by the Social
Science collections, together with explanatory notes. BL PROC6 lists 58 subjects and BL PROC7
lists 158 subjects. BL PROC7 also provides a detailed list of publication types for consideration
in the selection process (32 types), as does BL PROC8 (31 types). BL PROC7 also sets out 4
broad purposes for the materials held on the open shelves in the Reading Room, including “For
current awareness” and “To encourage serendipity”. This document also describes selection
from the Legal Deposit intake, as well as identifying boundaries between adjacent disciplines
for 8 subjects, such as health (medicine is part of Science, Technology and Medicine, whilst
materials about the NHS are treated as part of Social Science).
4.2.3 Analysis of British Library documentation: conclusions
The Annual Reports, content strategy review and operational process documentation provide
very different perspectives on the British Library’s collection. The Annual Reports are clearly
aimed at an external audience, discussing big projects and providing an account of the
development of the Library over forty years. The public relations function of the Annual
Reports means that they cannot be assumed to give a full picture of the Library’s development
and services over that time; there are few candid descriptions of controversial projects or less
successful services. However, repeated mention of a project or service over a number of years
103

(the British Library website; the BIPC) seems to imply success; other services or projects may
be mentioned very positively in one or two reports but not mentioned at all in later years
(Fathom.com, or the British Library’s Think Tank and Policy Unit). This may imply that these
projects were less successful.
The CENL reports focus on the Library’s distinctive strengths in an international context,
including in early reports the scale of the acquisitions budget and, later, the use of innovative
technology to manage collections and to deliver services. These contrast with the rich detail of
day-to-day processes related to the collection, described in the process documentation. These
documents suggest some of the ways in which collection is conceptualised by people involved
in the operational activities of collection development and management, reflecting day-to-day
decision-making or possible problems. Such documentation from across the organisation
might usefully be analysed on a larger scale, to identify areas of best practice or notable
differences.
The content strategy review documentation focuses on staff understanding of issues affecting
user groups and needs, as well as illustrating the importance of gathering management
information for subject areas within the collection. The recently published content strategy
sets out high level principles for collecting and connecting activity by the Library over the next
two years, and introduces the idea of “coherence” as opposed to “comprehensiveness” in the
Library’s collections.
4.3 Characteristics of the library collection for social enterprise: catalogue searches, item
usage and the UK Web Archive
4.3.1 Catalogue searching
The British Library catalogue was searched for terms relating to social enterprise, community
enterprise and social entrepreneurship. The initial searches took place between 2 June 2011
and 14 June 2011. Both the existing Integrated Catalogue and the newly introduced Primo
resource discovery system were searched. Primo searches located individual journal articles, as
well as monographs and serial titles – in these cases, numbers of journal articles were
recorded separately, but were not included in the total count of individual items. These
searches were used both to identify relevant items and to explore the effectiveness of
different search terms. The search terms used, interfaces searched and the numbers of results
retrieved are shown in Table 4.3.1a.

From these searches, 344 unique titles were identified. 4 other titles were also added from the
bibliography prepared by Walker (2010). Issues identified relating to apparent duplicate
records, or inaccuracies in individual catalogue records, as well as general comments relating
to the implementation of Primo, were reported to the British Library using online feedback
forms.
204 out of 348 items (58.6%) had ISBNs, indicating that they were formally published
monographs. 21 items (6.0%) had ISSNs, indicating that they were formally published serial
publications. However, a sizeable minority of items – 123 out of 348 (35.3%) – had no ISBN or
ISSN, suggesting that these were more informal publications. Broad categories of publications
are summarised in Table 4.3.1b.

from Ireland were from publishers based in the Republic, rather than from Northern Ireland,
possibly illustrating the continuing successful legal deposit collection of material published in
the Republic of Ireland, but also suggesting a possible gap in the coverage of Northern Irish
material.
Figure 4.3.1 illustrates the dates of publication of individual titles against the number of
relevant titles from that year. This chart excludes 45 titles where the date of publication was
uncertain or which covered a range of years. It also includes 22 titles which have been counted
twice, having been retrieved using two different search terms. These duplicates were located
using the following search terms:




social enterprise and social entrepreneurship: 19 duplicate results
community enterprise and social entrepreneurship: 2 duplicate results
community enterprise and social enterprise: 1 duplicate result

Although this chart appears to show a clear trend of increased publications over recent years,
it is interesting to note outlying results from the 1960s which include social enterprise search
terms. The chart provides an indicative illustration of the Library’s holdings. However, retrieval
and cataloguing systems have changed significantly over the time shown here and further
relevant titles from earlier years may not have been retrieved in these searches.

199 additional titles located in the Strand 2 searches were subsequently located in the British
Library catalogue, using known item searching. The second round of searches took place solely
on Primo. These searches were carried out between 9 December 2011 and 9 January 2012. The
results of this second round of searches were shared with the British Library and an Excel
107

workbook containing the details of 103 items, out of 202 which were found in Strand 2 but not
located in the British Library’s catalogue, was provided to the British Library. These 103 items
all had ISBNs or ISSNs; 96 items which lacked ISBNs or ISSNs were excluded, as were 3 items
which did have ISBNs but which were in a format (1 DVD, 1 CD-ROM and one audio book) less
likely to be collected by the Library. The 103 items described to the British Library are
summarised in Table 4.3.1b.

4.3.2 Reading Room requests
The shelfmark information for the titles identified from the first series of searches on the
British Library catalogue was combined with the details of the 199 additional titles initially
located in Strand 2 and subsequently identified in the second series of British Library catalogue
searches to create an indicative list of items held by the Library. No additional process of
selection was applied at this stage, meaning that potentially irrelevant titles, which had been
retrieved during the Strand 2 catalogue searches of other libraries, were included. The list
included multiple copies of some titles and contained shelfmark information for 818 individual
items, including 778 unique shelfmarks. A small number of shelfmarks (26) were duplicated
across multiple items. In some cases this reflected open shelf display locations (“SPIS Journals
Display”), materials in multiple formats or obsolete shelf marks. In other cases this reflected
duplication of shelfmark information in catalogue records or unintentional researcher
duplication of search terms. Only 71 of the 818 items (8.68%) were identified as being on open
shelves in St Pancras Reading Rooms, meaning that the majority of items would have had to be
requested via the ABRS system in order to be used in the Reading Rooms. 30 of the 818 item
shelfmarks referred to Official Publications from UK central government, devolved
administrations, local government, the EU or the UN.
The list was used for acquiring Reading Room usage data. The list was submitted to a member
of the Electronic Services / Reader Systems Support team, who provided usage statistics for
108

each of these items between 1997 and October 2012. 450 items out of 818 (55%) had no
recorded Reading Room usage during this time. Usage had been recorded for items with 363
unique shelfmarks. In total, 1948 Reading Room requests were recorded for these items. 323
items out of 363 (89%) had been requested less than 10 times. The ten most requested items
are shown in Table 4.3.2 and includes two different copies of the same title (Naomi Klein’s No
Logo), which accounted for 259 uses in total.

These figures suggest the different ways in which the British Library’s collections are used:
some of these texts may be being requested for general use or for serious research. The list
includes a journal, a biography and a reference work / directory and none of these most
requested titles are older than 19 years. Use of some texts may be accounted for by a small
number of users (or even a single user consulting the text multiple times); others may be being
used by multiple users.
Total item requests by year are shown in Figure 4.3.2a. Item requests appear to have peaked
at 287 in 2009, comprised of requests for 84 distinct titles (excluding multiple copies and
different editions).

Figure 4.3.2b: Numbers of titles requested by year
A final comparison was made between numbers of distinct titles requested by year (excluding
duplicates) and the numbers of titles held by the British Library by their year of publication
(Figure 4.3.2c). Numbers of titles published peaked in 2010; however, this might reflect the
fact that these data were mainly collected in June 2011, whereas the Reading Room request
data were supplied in October 2012. Similar patterns appear to emerge in both the publication
years and the number of requests, although the publication pattern appears to be more
uneven, whilst numbers of requests display a sharper rise after 2005. One tentatively
110

suggested possibility is that this might partly reflect the impact of the creation of a dedicated
Business and Intellectual Property Centre in the British Library in 2006.

4.3.3 Reading Room usage of electronic resources
Figures for the number of document views from an electronic resource (Resource A) available
in the BIPC Reading Room were supplied, covering a period from May 2009 to June 2013. The
resource had 100582 document views in total during this period. One document relating to
social enterprise was the 23rd most frequently viewed item (506 views) over this time. Table
4.3.3a compares the total number of views of documents potentially related to social
enterprise (featuring words such as “social enterprise”, “co-operative” in their titles, or related

topics such as “fair trade”, non-profits, or charities) with the number of views of two other
subsets of documents – one relating to libraries and information services and one relating
specifically to London.
The 10 documents identified as being relevant to social enterprise account for only 0.60% of
the total number of documents which were viewed between May 2009 and June 2013.
However, they account for 1.64% of the total number of document views over that time. The
mean number of views for each document identified as relevant to social enterprise is also
higher than the overall mean – 2.74 times greater than the mean number of views for all
viewed documents. The documents on library and information topics and about London
account for 0.30% of the total number of viewed documents; the number of views of
documents on library and information is in line with this (also 0.30%), whereas the number of
views of documents relating to London is significantly higher (2.15%, seven times greater). This
perhaps reflects the observation made in BL BIPC5:
“in absence of remote access to vast majority of our content, a major determinant in
make-up of each of the BL audiences described above is (and will continue to be) how
easy it is for them to reach our central London site”
The greater ease of access to London site may also add to the demand for information relating
to London.
Resource B does not include documents specifically focused on social enterprise. However, 3
potentially relevant documents were identified, including two on environmental topics and
one relating to finance-raising for charities. Usage figures for this resource were available from
May 2012 to May 2013.

The 3 documents relating to environmental and charity topics represent 0.56% of the total
number of documents accessed between May 2012 and May 2013, although they account for
1.47% of the total access figures.
This presents a complicated picture of the usage of e-resource documents relating to social
enterprise. In absolute terms, both the number of documents viewed or accessed and the
number of times they were viewed or accessed are low. However, relative to the mean
number of views of documents accessed from Resource A (and to another sub-set of
documents offered by the resource, relating to library and information services), views of
these documents on social enterprise and related topics are higher than might be expected.
Similarly, the 3 environmental / charity documents provided by Resource B documents
appeared to be accessed more frequently than might be expected on the basis of their number
alone.
4.3.4 UK Web Archive searches
The UK Web Archive is a permissions-based archive of UK websites, managed by the British
Library. It was first launched in 2004 and has been archiving websites and making the archived
instances freely accessible via the web since then (British Library, 2013e). As of 8 August 2013,
the archive held 20.13 terabytes of data (British Library, 2013d).
The Web Archive was searched in August 2013, using ten terms used in the Strand 1 and
Strand 2 catalogue searches. However, searches for plural versions of terms (such as “social
enterprises”) returned the same number of results as searches for related singular terms (such
as “social enterprise”). This suggests that some automatic truncation searching may have been
applied, although this is not explicitly stated on the site. Numbers of search results for each
term are show in Appendix 21. In absolute terms, numbers of results for all terms increased
between 2004 and the first eight months of 2013, with numbers of results for “social
enterprise” increasing by over 120 times. Searches were also performed to obtain total
numbers of search results for the whole archive for each individual year from 2004 to 2013 (eg
a search for “2004” using time limits of 1 January 2004 – 31 December 2004). Numbers of total
results also increased between 2004 and the first eight months of 2013 by over 15 times.
These figures also enable the calculation of the annual percentages of total search results
represented by social enterprise related results. These results are shown in Figure 4.3.4.

Figure 4.3.4: Level of search results for social enterprise and related terms, by year, as a
percentage of total search results for each year. “Community entrepreneur” is largely hidden
behind “community entrepreneurship”, with values close to 0% throughout all years.
Although in absolute terms all numbers of search results increased between 2004 and the first
eight months of 2013, only search results for “social enterprise” since 2009 appear to account
for more than 1% of the total search results. This percentage fell below 1% in 2010 and peaked
at 1.46% in the data available for the first eight months of 2013. In 2013, the search results for
all other search terms form similar percentages of the total number of search results to their
original levels in 2004. This is despite earlier peaks in the levels of search results for both the
terms “social entrepreneur” and “community enterprise”.
4.3.5 Characteristics of the British Library collection for social enterprise: conclusions
The British Library’s collection for social enterprise, defined quite narrowly in catalogue
searches for terms such as “social enterprise” but not “cooperatives” or “mutuals” is small, as
may be expected for a relatively new field. Outlying results were located from as early as the
1960s, whilst other relevant material may not have been located because of retrieval and
cataloguing issues. Although 202 items subsequently located in Strand 2 catalogue searches
were not identified in the British Library catalogue, the 818 items identified in the Library’s
collection is the largest set of material from any of the catalogues searched. This suggests that
the Library achieves its aim of strong collections, although not a collection without gaps. These
materials are not heavily used, with over half the items identified having not been requested in
the Reading Rooms between 1997 and 2012.
Usage data for two electronic resources in the BIPC Reading Room also suggests relatively low
levels of use of material relevant to social enterprise, as reflected by numbers of views of
114

documents on this and related topics from two e-resources. The level of UK Web Archive
search results for “social enterprise” and related terms also form a very small proportion of
the archive’s total search results, with only social enterprise terms showing a consistent
upward trend.
4.4 Services to remote users
4.4.1 Document Supply Centre journal article requests
A list of 70 journal titles which included articles relevant to social enterprise was compiled. This
included titles located in the British Library catalogue searches and titles of journals from
which articles were located in the British Library Primo searches. Statistics about the level of
demand for articles from these titles between 2005-2009 and in 2010 were provided by the
Document Supply Centre in August 2011. Duplicate entries were identified for 16 titles and
were only recorded once in the data tables, in order to avoid double-counting, and 5 titles
were found not to be held in the Document Supply Centre, meaning that data were supplied
for 49 journal titles.
Articles from all 49 journals had been requested at some point between 2005-2010. Articles
from 47 journals were requested between 2005-2009 (12442 requests in total) and articles
from 46 journals were requested in 2010 (1761 requests in total). The 5 journals from which
articles were not requested between 2005-2009 or in 2010 are shown in Table 4.4.1a.

The titles identified covered a range of different fields, including business, economics, health
and social work, reflecting the nature of interdisciplinary and cross-disciplinary interest in the
field of social enterprise. More than 100 article requests were received for 33 out of 49
journal titles (67.3%) between 2005-2010. The 10 journals with the highest numbers of article
requests are shown in Table 4.4.1b.

Figure 4.4.1b: Number of requests per year by sector
Requests have fallen from all sectors. In 2009, public library requests were 41.38% the level of
2005, industrial and commercial requests were 48.98% those of 2005, academic library
requests were 61.02% those of 2005, government requests were 71.40% those of 2005 and
other / unknown requests were 96.77% those of 2005.
Only 9 journals showed a net increase in numbers of requests between 2005 and 2010. For 4
of these journals (Journal of Enterprising Communities, Journal of Global Responsibility, Journal
of World Business, Policy and Society) the increase between numbers of requests in 2005 and
in 2010 was 6 or less. The pattern of the increasing numbers of requests for articles from the
other 5 journals, where requests increased by 14 or more between 2005 and 2010, is shown in
Figure 4.4.1c. Of the 5 journals shown, Education Knowledge and Economy has ceased
publication (2007-2011) and the DSC has only partial subscriptions for Critical Policy Studies
(2009-2011). The three other journals have been in publication for between 12 and 7 years:
International Journal of Entrepreneurship and Innovation since 2000, Corporate Social
Responsibility and Environmental Management since 2002, and Social Enterprise Journal since
2005.

increasing by more than 10 between 2005 and 2010
The greatest increases in requests were for articles from the Social Enterprise Journal and from
the International Journal of Entrepreneurship and Innovation, with requests for articles from
these two publications increasing by 84 between 2005-2010. In total, 178 requests were
placed for articles from Social Enterprise Journal between 2005 and 2010. Demand for articles
from this journal in 2009 was more than five times that in 2008, rising from 15 to 78 requests,
with demand rising further to 84 requests in 2010. 88 out of 94 requests (93.6%) placed for
articles from this journal between 2005-2009 were from the academic sector. For requests
submitted in 2010, data regarding the age of the article requested was also available and is

4.4.2 EThOS downloads
23 theses titles recorded on the British Library’s Electronic Theses Online System (EThOS) were
identified, either from the Strand 2 OPAC searches (4) or using the search terms social
enterprise (13), social entrepreneurship (2), social entrepreneur (1), community enterprise (2),
or community entrepreneurship (1). The list of titles together with unique EThOS identifiers
were sent to the Document Supply Centre and data for requests between February 2009 and
May 2012 were supplied.
397 requests were made between February 2009 and May 2012; 19 out of 23 theses (82.6%)
were requested during that time. The distribution of the numbers of requests for theses is
shown in Figure 4.4.2a.

The geographic location of each EThOS request is included in the data. Overwhelmingly,
requests came from the UK (310 out of 397 requests (78%)). However, reflecting the global
reach of this digitised resource, requests were also recorded from 33 other countries. These
included requests from 14 countries in Asia, including Gulf states such as Bahrain, Iran and
Kuwait as well as Uzbekistan, Brunei, India, Pakistan, Nepal, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand,
Japan, South Korea and Hong Kong (no requests were recorded from mainland China); 9 in
Europe; 6 in Africa; 2 in North America and 2 in Oceania. A summary breakdown of
international requests, broadly categorised by continent, is shown in Figure 4.4.2c.

4.4.3 Website usage
Statistics on website usage were accessed using the Library’s Digital Analytix software. Figures
show that the British Library’s (2011) PDF guide to social enterprise and green and ethical
business (subsequently updated by British Library (2012)) was viewed 235 times between May
2011 and October 2012. This guide is located on the Library’s Industry Guides webpage, which
provides links to 30 industry guides and which received 18644 visits during the same time. This
suggests a link-through rate from the Industry Guides page to the social enterprise and green
and ethical guide of around 1.3%. The viewing figures for both webpages should be seen in the
context of figures for the larger library website, which receives more than 150,000 visitors a
week.
The guide to social enterprise and green and ethical business takes the form of a traditional
subject bibliography. It includes 8 sections:


Directories – with shelfmarks referring to open shelves in the Reading Room;



Market research – some with shelfmarks, others are electronic resources;



Trade Magazines and Newsletters – with shelfmarks;



Databases available in the BIPC Reading Room;



Books – all with British Library shelfmarks, some on open shelves and some in the
closed stacks;
122



Our partners – a list of website URLs for organisations with which the Library
cooperates;



Workshops – website details for a partner organisations workshops hosted by the
BIPC;



Internet sources – an alphabetical list of 37 website URLs.

Since March 2012, PDF views for electronic documents held and made accessible in the British
Library’s Management and Business Studies Portal (MBS) have also been recorded using the
Digital Analytix software. Between March and October 2012, MBS Portal PDFs were viewed
1011 times, with 376 individual electronic documents being viewed at least once during that
time.
A list was prepared of 64 electronic documents held in the MBS Portal which were potentially
relevant to social enterprise topics. This was compared to MBS Portal PDF view data from
March to October 2012; 9 of the 64 documents (14%) were found to have been viewed, with 1
viewed 82 times, 1 viewed twice and 7 viewed once.
4.4.4 Remote services: conclusions
Figures for requests for articles from a small selection of journals between 2005 and 2010
indicate that the remote document supply service is the most heavily used of the Library’s
services. There is a declining trend overall for requests from these journals, although a small
number of new journals show rising numbers of requests over the years. Of the small number
of theses relevant to social enterprise that were identified, most have been downloaded at
least once via EThOS, highlighting the benefits of making unique research publications more
accessible through digitisation. The Library’s guide to social enterprise and green and ethical
business is less well-used, suggesting both that the Library’s current social enterprise audience
is relatively small, and that more a interactive approach to providing subject or topic guides
might be better used. PDFs relevant to social enterprise and available through the MBS Portal
had relatively low levels of use.
4.5 Use of other British Library services: two examples
4.5.1 Business and Intellectual Property Centre event feedback
Between April 2011 and March 2012 5952 people completed feedback forms following events
held at the Business and Intellectual Property Centre. Of these only 116 (1.9%) identified
themselves as being from social enterprises. The feedback forms asked whether respondents
would use the BIPC as a result of having attended the event or activity at the Library, with 29
123

social enterprise respondents (25%) saying that they would. 2 (1.7%) said they would not use
the BIPC as a result of having attended the event. These figures suggest both that social
enterprises form a very small part of the BIPC’s audience for events and that attending events
or activities at the library does seem to encourage a sizeable minority of participants to
consider using the Centre’s resources in the future.
4.5.2 QuestionPoint
A Reference Services team manager searched the Library’s online enquiry system
QuestionPoint for enquiries relating to social enterprise and located only one relevant enquiry
to the BIPC reference team (and none to the Social Science or Humanities reference teams)
since the introduction of the ‘Ask a Reference Team’ service. This is in the context of a total of
956 enquiries received by the BIPC reference team through that system in the first year of its
use.
4.6 Summary of findings from other strands
Results from Strand 2 catalogue searches provided links to 4 EThOS documents. In Strand 3,
the British Library was mentioned by one social enterprise interviewee, an administrator, both
publishers and both academics (one remarked of EThOS “They’ve done this wonderful project
to digitise all of the PhDs”), reflecting the profile of the Library. All 6 library and information
practitioner interviewees also mentioned the British Library, in the context of specific projects
(UKRR, the BIPC), technological expertise (handling AV content) or resources (specialist
databases).
4.7 Discussion
The British Library’s Annual Reports provide useful context for understanding the development
of the Library’s collections and services since 1973. The reports show how the Library’s profile
as an individual organisation has grown over that time, as well as highlighting possible tensions
between the role of the Library in serving its own customers and acting as a facilitator or hub
for a larger UK library and information network. Over time, the Library has reduced its formal
financial assistance to other libraries and its research activities into issues affecting public
libraries, in favour of greater engagement with academic and research library networks on
specific projects, such as UKRR, UKPubMed and DataCite. The reports show how long the
Library has worked to advocate for the extension of legal deposit to cover non-print
publications. The content analysis shows how use of collection terminology varied between
different Library divisions in the first decade of its existence, as well as showing how the term
content has come to be more frequently used since the development of the Library’s content
124

strategy in 2006. The reports also show how emerging technologies have been adopted by the
Library and how they have affected the collections. The reports illustrate the significance of
business information provision as part of the Library’s activities since the 1970s, although
social enterprise is only indirectly mentioned in the reports.
The collection policy and process documentation provides an illustration of how the British
Library develops and manages its unique and extensive collections. The content strategy
review reflects a shift in terminology within the Library from “collection” to “content” and a
reorientation towards balancing “collecting” activities with “connecting” activities, linking
users to external content. The content strategy also indicates a shift from the goal of
comprehensiveness to the goal of “coherence” – although this term and the implications of
this shift are not well-defined in the strategy.
BIPC subject documentation highlights both the extent to which all Library collecting activities
take place within the context of the Legal Deposit privilege and the extent of the Library’s
additional purchases. Documentation also describes the processes and, in some cases,
combinations of processes by which the collection is developed and managed. The documents
provide differing levels of detail, and display a range of different approaches to communicating
about policies and processes, including in some cases specific examples to assist decision
making, or lists of relevant subjects or material types.
Searches carried out on the British Library’s catalogues have highlighted some of the
characteristics of the library collection for social enterprise, including the spread of
publications – and the rising trend in publications – from the 1960s onwards. Most of the
publications identified were general monographs, although a significant minority took the
form of grey literature – official publications, research reports and working papers. More than
a third of the titles located in the initial round of searches of the British Library catalogue
lacked an ISBN or ISSN number, suggesting that these were informally published materials.
Most titles located were published in England. However, in absolute terms the amount of
material located, using relatively limited search criteria, is small.
The Reading Room request figures seem to suggest limited levels of use for the materials
identified in the British Library catalogue searches between 1997 and 2012, with over half the
items identified not having been requested. The Reading Room requests include materials
which may be assumed to be relatively widely accessible in many academic libraries such as
Naomi Klein’s No logo. It may be that the creation of the BIPC was a factor in the apparent rise
in requests from 2006. However, the usage figures for Reading Room requests also highlight
the difficulty of focusing specifically on social enterprise, partly because of its interdisciplinary
125

nature (relevant material may be located in texts which appear to be unrelated) and partly
because of the level of ‘noise’ or potentially irrelevant titles located in some of the catalogue
searches. This may apply especially to those titles added into the data gathering process from
the wider catalogue searches of Strand 2.
BIPC Reading Room view or access figures for documents from two electronic resources,
Resource A and Resource B, both show relatively low levels of usage of items relating to social
enterprise or to environmental / charity topics in absolute terms. However, these usage figures
are higher than the mean usage figures for all documents provided by these e-resources.
UK Web Archive search results for “social enterprise” and related terms also form a very small
proportion of the archive’s total search results, although absolute numbers of search results
for all terms have risen by between 20 and 120 times since 2004.
Usage figures for services to remote users appeared to show higher levels of use. There was a
noticeable contrast between the declining overall level of document supply requests for
materials from the DSC and rising levels of requests (although still relatively low in absolute
terms) for some newer journals relevant to social enterprise. A high proportion of the
relatively small number EThOS theses relating to social enterprise have been downloaded or
ordered, suggesting that these types of publication may be of particular value to people
interested in relatively new, emerging fields of interest, where there are only relatively small
numbers of existing formal publications. The EThOS usage statistics also indicate the
international reach of these digitised theses.
The level of usage of the industry guide for social enterprise appeared to be relatively low,
especially compared to the total number of visitors to the guide’s parent page. PDF views of
MBS Portal content relating to social enterprise also seemed relatively low, but unique MBS
Portal content in general seems to be more heavily used than content which is also available
(without registration) from other sources. BIPC event feedback statistics showed a relatively
small number of respondents from social enterprise (less than 2%), although a quarter
indicated that attending the event encouraged them to think positively about using the
Library’s information resources in the future. QuestionPoint statistics also showed a very low
level of directly recorded email enquiries relating to social enterprise. There seems to be a
contrast between the very low level of enquiries and the apparently rising levels of use of
materials about the subject.

126

4.8 Addressing the research questions
4.8.1 What are the characteristics of the library collection for social enterprise?
The British Library’s collection for social enterprise, defined relatively narrowly through
searches for “social enterprise” and related terms, seems small in absolute terms, although –
as Chapter 5 will show – it has the largest single collection of relevant titles identified through
the catalogue searches. However, it also includes materials in a range of different formats,
including electronic theses. The collection is built both by legal deposit and by direct
acquisition, described in one document as passive versus active collection. Comparing the
collection statistics to the titles identified in Strand 2 of the project, the British Library holds
the largest number of individual relevant titles, although the Strand 2 searches also identified
some apparent gaps in the Library’s collection in this field. Relevant material dates from the
1960s onwards, although with a clear rising trend since the late 1990s. A further strength of
the British Library’s collections is the availability of highly specialised materials – such as
environmental information and information about datasets – which could be useful to people
setting up or operating social enterprises with a specific purpose linked to such a field. The
social enterprise audience also seems to be relatively small, with less than 2% of respondents
to BIPC event feedback forms identifying themselves as being from a social enterprise.
The UK Web Archive also features a relatively small amount of material relating to social
enterprise, although the proportion of total search results located using the search term
“social enterprise” has increased since 2004.
4.8.2 How is the library collection for social enterprise used?
Use of most of the British Library’s collection for social enterprise appears to be quite limited.
Usage figures for potentially relevant documents provided by two electronic resources only
account for between 1.47% and 1.64% of total document usage within those resources.
Document Supply Centre material is the most heavily used source (with an overall declining
trend in DSC use contrasted with a rising trend in the use of a small number of individual
journals) followed by materials in the Reading Room. EThOS materials are relatively heavily
used, with one thesis being downloaded 101 times in 3 years. The Library’s own guide on social
enterprise and green and ethical business was viewed 235 times in eighteen months, although
this equates to only 1.3% of visitors to the Library’s Industry Guides page clicking through to
that document. This seems to reinforce the impression, suggested by the BIPC event feedback
figures, of a current social enterprise audience of less than 2% of the BIPC’s service users.

127

4.8.3 What does this study suggest about the wider issues relating to library and information
collections in the digital world?
The Annual Reports show how the Library has responded to emerging technologies since the
1970s. In some areas of the Library’s activities there appear to be multiple cycles of innovation
– for example, with the development of four or five distinct cataloguing systems over four
decades, or in the development of the Fathom dot com to deliver e-learning courses followed,
over a decade later, by British Library involvement in the UK MOOC (Massive Open Online
Course) FutureLearn (Futurelearn, 2013). Services such as EThOS, or the Annual Report
descriptions of Patent Express, illustrate how new technologies, including digitisation of low
use or apparently obscure material can lead to much greater use, with a potentially global
audience.
4.8.4 What constitutes the concept of the library collection in the digital world?
The content strategy presents a concept of collecting and connecting users to content. This is a
more dynamic view of collection than traditionally associated with the Library. The content
strategy introduces the idea of “coherence” rather than comprehensiveness as a guiding aim
for the British Library’s approach to content and collections. Other documents talk about
“distinctiveness”, “uniqueness” or “a consistent collection”.
The Annual Reports show how increasing access to collections through the use of new
technology has been a recurring theme of the Library’s activities, including through the
Initiatives for Access programme in the 1990s, which coincided with the development of the
world wide web. These reports also occasionally suggest a tension between the Library’s
development of its own distinctive identity and its role as a facilitator of a coordinated national
approach to library collections; new technology, in particular, seems to encourage Library
involvement in the global information network at a time when research and resource support
from the British Library to UK public libraries has apparently diminished. However, new
technologies also promote information-sharing about collection development and
management activities, which seems to have been a key feature of collaborative collection
projects including the legal deposit libraries shared cataloguing project, UKRR and EThOS.
The Library has actively sought to assist in the redefinition of collection in the digital world
through advocating, over the course of 23 years, for the extension of legal deposit to non-print
materials. It has used new technologies in innovative ways to provide access to the Library
collection, although other services – such as subject or topic guide PDFs – are still heavily
based on print models. Ideas of passive versus active collection, although used specifically to
128

describe the contrast between legal deposit and purchase acquisition of materials, may also
have broader relevance to the concept of collection in the digital world where the process of
collection can be as much about defining criteria for inclusion (eg in supplier selection profiles,
or when defining the types of materials suitable for deposit in an institutional repository), as
about item-by-item selection. Finally, although BIPC feedback and QuestionPoint services
provide only very limited data from social enterprises, both of these suggest ways in which
Library services may draw upon or encourage use of the Library collection.
4.9 Conclusion
The British Library case study has provided a mixture of quantitative and qualitative data which
illustrate some of the characteristics of the collection for social enterprise in this unique
library. The Library’s Annual Reports show how the Library’s collections and services have
developed over four decades, demonstrating the impact of new technologies and highlighting
the importance of British Library information services to business. Collection policy and
process documents provide contextual information about the Library’s approach to collection
development and management, including the terminological shift from “collection” to
“content”. The British Library operates in a very specific legal framework, with the Legal
Deposit privilege at the centre of its collecting activities. However, some of the broader issues
emerging from the case study will have resonance for library and information services more
widely, including:

5 STRAND 2: OPAC SEARCH FINDINGS
5.1 Introduction
This chapter summarises findings from searches of 88 UK library OPACs between August 2011
and October 2011, as well as a brief search of OCLC’s WorldCat catalogue in March 2013. It
also provides some comparisons between these Strand 2 catalogue searches and the results
from the British Library catalogue searches undertaken as part of Strand 1.
Strand 2 of the project aimed to address the following research questions:
1. What are the characteristics of the library collection for social enterprise?
5. What does this study suggest about the wider issues relating to library and information
collections in the digital world?
6. What constitutes the concept of the library collection in the digital world?
As discussed in the literature review, the library catalogue is both a representation of the
library collection and provides a tool for accessing individual items within the collection.
Conducting catalogue searches for material relevant to social enterprise gives a snapshot of
the scale and characteristics of the UK-wide library collection for social enterprise and
highlights the similarities and differences between library and information collections from
different sectors. Although evaluating online catalogue quality is not an objective of this
research, OPAC quality affects how library and information collections are represented and
how collection items are accessed, illustrating wider issues about library and information
collections in the digital world. This chapter therefore begins with a summary of the
characteristics of the catalogues searched in each of the four home nations and from three
library sectors (academic, public and health libraries).
An overview of the key findings from these Strand 2 catalogue searches is provided, followed
by a breakdown of search results by country, library sector and search terms. The top ten most
frequently retrieved titles from each sector are compared, and comparisons are also made
between search results located on catalogues with or without phrase searching facilities. The
characteristics of online items retrieved in these searches are described, as are the
characteristics of items only located in these Strand 2 searches, including their dates of
publication, and types of material. A brief comparative search of OCLC’s international union
catalogue, WorldCat, conducted in March 2013 is also described.
This is followed by a discussion of these findings, focusing particularly on sectoral differences,
as well as the apparent contrast between the relatively low numbers of items retrieved and
the proportion of these items which are unique to a single search or catalogue. Shared
patterns which appear to emerge between Strand 1 and Strand 2 search results are also
130

discussed, as are findings from Strand 3 interviews and surveys which illustrate the
relationship between different types of catalogue and the characteristics of library and
information collections. The chapter concludes by suggesting some initial answers the research
questions.
5.2 Sampling and searching
88 catalogues were searched between 23 August 2011 and 2 October 2011, including 51 public
library catalogues, 35 academic library catalogues and 2 NHS library union catalogues.
A summary of the distribution of catalogues searched between the three different library
sectors within each of the four home nations (England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales)
is shown in Table 5.2.

890 individual Strand 2 searches were performed. This includes one English public library
authority catalogue where 10 additional searches were made, using the same search terms, in
the title field as well as in a keyword field. Where possible, phrase searching options were
used. 1827 individual results were recorded.
5.3 Overview of catalogue characteristics
5.3.1 Catalogue providers
A study by JISC and SCONUL (2008) explored the types of library management system (LMS) –
and, by extension, the catalogues – in use in UK Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). It
identified four major providers supplying 86.88% of UK HEIs – ExLibris, Talis, SirsiDynix and
Innovative Interface (2008: 51). Although that study covered only academic libraries, and is
now five years old, it does offer a useful point of comparison to the systems identified in the
Strand 2 catalogue searches for this project.
17 types of catalogues were identified and their distribution by country and library sector is
shown in Table 5.3.1. 7 libraries are not included in this table: 4 academic library catalogues (3
in England, 1 in Scotland) did not identify a specific named catalogue provider. It was also
unclear which system provided the catalogue system for 2 other libraries (1 English academic
library, which appeared to be Millenium WebPAC and 1 English public library, which appeared
to be Talis). Finally, 1 Scottish academic library catalogue linked two systems – Primo and
Voyager.
Talis Prism is the most frequently used catalogue (in 27 libraries) followed by SirsiDynix (in 14
libraries). Within the searched catalogues, some systems appear to be preferred by different
sectors. Axiell catalogues appear only in some of the English and Northern Irish public libraries
(13 library catalogues in total). Civica Spydus and Vubis Smart also appear in only public library
catalogues. Koha, an open source library management system, was only used by one library
service, an English public library authority.

5.3.2 Catalogue search facilities - availability of phrase searching
In recording the characteristics of these catalogue searches, two types of search facility were
noted:



Phrase searching allows a searcher to explore a collection based on subject or topic
interests, permitting searches for multi-word terms such as "social enterprise" and
returning results based on how closely they matched this phrase.
Non-phrase searching retrieves any item which includes both or either of the terms,
regardless of whether they appear together as a single phrase.

The presence or absence of phrase searching was initially recorded as part of the audit trail
describing the characteristics of the searches. However, the presence or absence of phrase
searching may also be seen as indicative of differing attitudes to library collections in different
sectors, reflecting assumptions about how the collection might be used, as well as suggesting
differing levels of resources to promote access to the collection. Phrase searching was
preferred, and tended to bring back a smaller number of more relevant results.
Phrase searching is particularly useful for searching for information on a topic when one or
more words within the phrase are ambiguous, such as “social enterprise”: Smith (2012: 16)
writes that phrase searching is often recommended as a search tactic: “specifying a phrase is
useful, particularly if the combination of words is likely to occur in other contexts”. Slack
(1991: 8) comments on the usefulness of phrase searching to identify materials on a subject or
topic and observes that “many subject terms in the English language consist of two words
which are too broad, or have a different meaning when used alone” (Slack, 1991: 5), observing
that, in contemporary OPACs from the early 1990s, it could often be unclear whether phrase
searching was permitted. Borgman (1996: 498) shows that search terms limited to a single
word were characteristic of early OPACs, providing similar access points to traditional card
catalogues (Borgman, 1996: 495), whilst their “second-generation” successors might permit
multi-word phrase entry, but without transparency or consistency regarding how the term
combination would be operationalised in different online catalogue systems. For example,
whether they would combine words using Boolean operators OR or AND, or if they would only
retrieve results where the terms were found in that exact sequence (Borgman, 1996: 498).
In this project, non-phrase searching was found to be a particular issue in catalogue systems
frequently used by public libraries. One system in particular would return an apparently
arbitrary number of results (usually 500 or 1000) in which either or both words were present.
The system did not appear to rank higher any results in which the words appeared next to
each other as a phrase. This suggests that this is a more rudimentary system than those used
in many academic libraries, and that it is not intended to support subject searches, but to
134

facilitate known item searches, such as searches for a book with a particular title or by a
specific author.
Title searching also involves returning results on the basis of matching phrases. In one
catalogue system which did not provide phrase searching, title searches were permitted, but
required the title to be entered as it began: omitting the first word of the title would lead to
zero results.
62 catalogues permitted phrase searching, 26 did not. The proportion of catalogues permitting
phrase searching was higher for academic libraries than for public libraries. 31 out of 35
academic library catalogues (88.6%) permitted phrase searching. Only 30 out of 51 public
library catalogues (58.8%) had a facility for phrase searching. When phrase searching was not
possible, a selective approach was taken to evaluating the results, with lists of more than 10
results being browsed for relevant titles.
The distribution of phrase searching availability across different library sectors in each of the
four home nations is shown in Table 5.3.2. The percentages show the proportion of searched
library catalogues in that sector from each country which do or do not have phrase searching,
with the total column showing percentages for the whole sector.

The very small sample sizes limit the interpretation of these results. However, English and
Northern Irish public libraries do seem to include a noticeably lower proportion of catalogues
which permit phrase searching, compared to academic library catalogues in both of those
countries. In Scotland and Wales the proportions of public library catalogues with phrase

135

searching features are similar to, or better than, the proportion of academic library catalogues
with that functionality.
5.3.3 Numbers of library locations and collections
The number of library locations identified in each catalogue was also recorded. This revealed
great variation in the number of collections, including individual branch libraries or collections
determined by format. Numbers of library locations shown in public library catalogues ranged
from 2 to 196, with a mean of 34.1. This included 7 public library catalogues (13.7%) which
featured collections for specific formats, including 6 web-based, electronic or online locations.
2 public library catalogues featured other organisations as locations, such as a university or a
hospital library. 4 public library catalogues searched were large union catalogues uniting
information about the collections of between 3 and 13 local authorities; there was a single
union catalogue for all of Northern Ireland’s public libraries. These 4 catalogues featured
between 30 and 196 library locations, with a mean of 123.
Numbers of library locations shown in 33 academic library catalogues (2 did not appear to
show numbers of locations) ranged from 1 to 51 with a mean of 8.8. 12 academic library
catalogues (36.4%) featured collections for specific formats such as electronic resources or
resources available on the internet. 1 based locations on 6 separate catalogues, 1 included
access type (eg a walk-in short loan collection) and 1 identified a separate organisation – a city
museum – as a location.
The two health library catalogues covered 22 and 30 locations, and one was a shared
catalogue with a university library.
5.3.4 Summary
This section has described some of the characteristics of the catalogues searched as part of
Strand 2. It has begun to identify some differences between catalogue provision in different
library sectors, which may reflect assumptions about how collections in different sectors are
likely to be used (eg for known item searching or for subject searches).
5.4 Search results: overview
From these catalogue searches, only 5 library catalogues (5.7%) returned zero results (2 English
public libraries, 1 Welsh public library, 1 Scottish public library and 1 English academic library);
one or more relevant items were located in 83 catalogues (94.3%).

136

546 titles were identified in the one or more searches, giving 1827 results in total. 369 titles
(67.6%) were located in only one library, suggesting that they may be unique to a specific
collection; 252 of these titles (68.3%) were located in only one search, suggesting both the
possibility that they could only be retrieved by a very specific search and that they might be
less relevant to the overall field, containing only one version of a relevant search term
somewhere in their record.
Numbers of distinct titles identified varied considerably by library sector. 405 titles were
identified in academic library catalogues (a mean of 11.6 per library catalogue), 180 titles were
identified in public library catalogues (a mean of 3.5 per library catalogue), 6 titles were
identified in health library catalogues (a mean of 3 titles per library catalogue).
None of the individual library catalogues provided as many results as the Strand 1 British
Library catalogue searches, suggesting that the British Library has the most extensive collection
on this topic. Indeed, 147 titles initially identified in the Strand 1 British Library catalogue
searches accounted for 1071 (58.6%) of the search results in Strand 2.
However, 399 additional titles were located which had not been identified in the Strand 1
British Library searches, giving 756 (41.4%) of the Strand 2 results. 326 (81.7%) of these
additional titles were only located in one library; of those, 226 (69.3%) titles were only located
in a single search. This again suggests both that these titles might be unique to a specific
collection and that they might be less relevant to the field of social enterprise, with only one
related term appearing somewhere in the catalogue record.
Many of the additional titles appeared to be unique to a particular collection – such as
typescript documents or individual newspaper cuttings, especially in public library catalogues,
where such material appeared to have local significance. One academic library catalogue
included 23 different iterations (including different ISBNs) of a single piece of government
legislation.
Only 1 academic library catalogue brought back results for individual journal articles, totalling
1130 and using the resource discovery system Ex Libris Primo.

5.4.2 Most frequently retrieved titles
The ten most frequently retrieved titles from all searches and from searches on public and
academic library catalogues, as well as six titles identified in the health library searches, are
shown in Table 5.4.2.
It is interesting to note that there is relatively little overlap between the most frequently
retrieved titles from the different sectors. None appear in the list of the most frequently
retrieved titles for all three sectors. Only 1 title features in both the public and academic
library top ten results, whilst 2 appear in both the public and health library lists. Another
feature which emerges is that the more frequently retrieved results from public library
catalogues appeared to be more recent publications with 7 out of 11 (63.6%) of the top ten
titles published in or after 2008, compared to 4 of the top ten results from academic library
catalogues.

5.4.3 Search results: phrase searching vs non-phrase searching
From the academic library catalogues, 405 titles were located, giving 1315 results. The mean
number of times a title was retrieved was 3.2 (standard deviation 4.6). 365 titles were found
with phrase searching, accounting for 1199 results; the mean number of times a title was
located by phrase searching was 3.3 (standard deviation 4.4).
74 titles were found without phrase searching, accounting for 116 results; the mean number of
times a title was located without phrase searching was 1.6 (standard deviation 1).
331 titles were only found with phrase searching, accounting for 914 results, 69.5% of the
results retrieved from the academic library searches. 40 titles were only found without phrase
searching, accounting for 49 results, 3.7% of the total number of results retrieved from
academic library catalogue searches. 34 titles were found by both non-phrase searching and by
phrase searching, accounting for 352 results (67 from non-phrase searching, 285 from phrase

Number of times title located

Figure 5.4.3a: Academic library search results comparing numbers of times titles were
located with or without phrase searching.
In public library catalogues, 180 titles were retrieved, giving 504 results. The mean number of
times a title was retrieved was 2.8 (standard deviation 4.2). 64 titles were located with phrase
searching, accounting for 132 results; the mean number of times a title was located by phrase
searching was 2.1 (standard deviation 1.5).

143

135 titles were located without phrase searching, accounting for 372 results; the mean
number of times a title was located without phrase searching was 2.8 (standard deviation 3.8).
45 titles were only located with phrase searching, accounting for 80 results, 15.9% of the total
results retrieved from public library catalogue searches. 116 titles were only located without
phrase searching, accounting for 247 results, 49% of the total number of results located in
public library catalogue. 19 titles were located both by non-phrase searching and by phrase
searching accounting for 177 results (125 from non-phrase searching, 52 from phrase
searching), 35.1% of the total number of results located in public library catalogues. Key
differences between the results from academic library catalogues and from public library
catalogues include the greater amount of material identified in academic library searches and
the much higher proportion of the public library catalogue results which were retrieved
without phrase searches. This may demonstrate both the impact of catalogue quality on access
to information about collection items, as well as the role of researcher subjectivity in selecting
relevant titles from lengthy lists of materials returned by catalogues without phrase searching.

Figure 5.4.3b: Public library search results comparing numbers of times titles were located
with or without phrase searching.
In health library catalogues, 6 titles were located, giving 8 results. The mean number of times a
title was retrieved was 1.3 (standard deviation 0.8). 1 title was retrieved with phrase
searching, accounting for 1 result.

144

6 titles were retrieved without phrase searching, accounting for 7 results, giving a mean of 1.2
(standard deviation 0.4).
5 titles were only retrieved without phrase searching, accounting for 5 results, and 1 title was
retrieved in both catalogues with and without phrase searching, accounting for 3 results (2
from non-phrase searching and 1 from phrase searching).
5.4.4 Types of materials
Broad categories of publications identified amongst these 546 titles identified in total in these
Strand 2 searches are summarised in Table 5.4.4a. “Chapters” refers to items which were
originally identified in Strand 1 catalogue searches due to search terms being identified in
individual chapter headings.

The reference works included highly localised directories of social enterprises, specific to a
single city or area. The newspaper cuttings were similarly very specific to a particular area.
Items such as PhDs, exam papers and online module materials tended to appear only in the
catalogue for one specific institution.
The international scope of the collection was illustrated by the identification of titles published
in 18 countries. The countries in which materials were published are shown in Table 5.4.4b.

Most of the titles identified were published in England (284, 52.01%), followed by the United
States (77, 14.10%). 13 titles were identified which were published in Northern Ireland,
although these seemed to be possibly ephemeral local materials, located in Northern Irish
catalogues.
5.4.5 Online items
148 items were available online in at least one catalogue: 27.1% of the 546 titles located in
total. 1 e-book copy of a relevant title was located in a public library catalogue. 26 (74.3%)
academic library catalogues contained relevant online resources, including e-books, e-journals,
online official documents and other documents such as theses or materials in an institutional
repository. The mean number of online items in these 26 catalogues was 11.3. One catalogue
contained 86 unique online items – the largest number of these materials in a single catalogue.
5.4.6 Titles only retrieved in Strand 2
Of the 226 titles retrieved in only one search in only one catalogue, and not located in the
original Strand 1 searches, 143 were located by phrase searching and 83 were located without
phrase searching. The numbers of titles retrieved from catalogues using phrase searching are
compared to those found in catalogues without phrase searching in Figure 5.4.6a.

The titles identified in these Strand 2 searches, but not previously located in the British Library
Strand 1 searches are shown by publication date in Figure 5.4.6a. To allow comparison with

Figure 5.4.7a: Strand 2 titles by search term and publication date
The large number of results from 2004 for search terms relating to community enterprise or
community entrepreneurship is largely due to one academic library catalogue which provided
details (including ISBNs) for 23 different versions of a single piece of government legislation.
Overall, numbers of titles published increase over time; publications continue to be located for
search terms relating to community enterprise and community entrepreneurship, although
results for social enterprise or social entrepreneurship become more frequent in later years.
It is possible to compare the publication date patterns in numbers of titles identified in the
initial Strand 1 British Library catalogue searches with the dates of publication from items
identified for the first time in the Strand 2 searches on other library catalogues (Figure 5.4.7b).

5.4.8 Summary
This section has summarised the results from the OPAC searches, providing an overview of the
characteristics of the search results in different sectors and in each of home nations. The most
frequently located titles for each sector have been identified, as have the most frequently
retrieved titles in total across all three sectors. It has described the implications of the
presence or absence of phrase searching for the number of results retrieved from catalogues
in different library sectors, as well as the availability of online items in catalogues from
different library sectors. Finally, this section has explored the characteristics of titles only
retrieved in this strand, including the types of material located, and has compared the dates of
publication of titles located in these Strand 2 searches with those located in the Strand 1
British Library catalogue searches.
5.5 Comparisons to WorldCat search results
In March 2013, searches for the ten search terms used in Strand 2 catalogue searches were
carried out on the WorldCat database and numbers of results for each search are shown in
Table 5.5a. It should be noted that, in all but two searches, the WorldCat figure for ‘All
formats’ is not the same as a total for the individual format types shown. The format types
shown in Table 5.5a represent the totals for the highest format hierarchy levels shown for
individual format groups – for example, WorldCat subdivides ‘Book’ into ‘eBook’, ‘Thesis /
149

dissertation’, ‘Microform’, ‘Large print’. ‘Video’ includes ‘DVD’ and ‘VHS’ but these two format
types are only shown individually for search results where the higher hierarchy level of ‘Video’
is not displayed. Another format group is ‘Archival material’ (including ‘Downloadable archival
material’) which appears to refer to grey literature publications.
Although the length of time between the Strand 2 searches and these WorldCat searches limits
the comparability of these results, the proportions of ‘All format’ results retrieved using each
search term (shown in Figure 5.5) seem to follow a similar pattern to the total numbers of
results retrieved using each of the search terms in Strand 2 (shown in Figure 5.4.1c).
Individual results were not recorded in the same detail as the other Strand 2 search results,
meaning that it is not possible to say how many results from the different search terms were
duplicates. Results to individual searches were not manually deduplicated, although some
automated deduplication algorithms are applied within the WorldCat system (Calhoun and
Patton, 2011). OCLC (2013a) gives more detail about recent improvements to WorldCat
deduplication processes, including reducing AV duplicates. OCLC (2013a) reports that in the
last four years, 11,294,384 duplicates have been removed from 342,080,141 processed records
(3.3%).

The largest proportion of results was retrieved by the search term “social entrepreneurship”,
followed by “social enterprise” and the proportions of results retrieved in WorldCat by each of
the other search terms were within 0-3% of the proportions retrieved in the Strand 2 searches.
In terms of the overall quantity of titles retrieved, numbers of books identified in the WorldCat
searches range from 3 to 1128 and ‘All format’ results range from 9 to 2919 from total
WorldCat records for more than 70,000 libraries. This compares with the 747 titles identified in
Strand 1 and Strand 2 of this research, from 89 libraries.
5.6 Summary of findings from other strands
In addition to the comparison with the findings from the British Library catalogue searches,
described above, library catalogue quality and its relationship to the library collection were
both discussed in interviews and survey responses from Strand 3 of this project.

152

In the Strand 3 interviews, 4 library and information practitioners discussed their catalogues,
including an academic librarian discussing the implementation of Primo, Ex Libris’s resource
discovery system, emphasising the catalogue as a route for accessing electronic books and its
effective integration with the university’s institutional repository. A government librarian
referred to the diminishing size of the collection and how that relates to reduced expectations
of the library catalogue and other library processes, such as classification:
“the catalogue is these days not what I would regard as a proper catalogue [...] what
we do is a very loose classification: I dare say we’ll be cutting down to about 400 books
- there’s really no need to start classifying when you’ve got so few.”
A national library librarian mentioned needing to set up a separate database to provide title
details of individual publications in a series, because the main national library catalogue only
features the broad series title. An administrator also discussed how an initiative to build a
collection of online material hinged on building “a catalogue that was going to be unique [...]
making a one stop shop destination site for this material to be together”.
The Strand 3 survey results also suggested a high degree of support for including links to freely
available web-based materials (such as PDFs) from the library catalogue, with 67% of
respondents either agreeing or strongly agreeing with this idea.
5.7 Discussion
These Strand 2 searches cast light on the very varied quality of library catalogues in different
sectors and countries. For example, a relatively high proportion of English and Northern Irish
public library catalogues did not permit phrase searching, compared to higher levels of phrase
searching availability in Scottish and Welsh public library catalogues. The larger public library
union catalogues, displaying results for a number of local authorities, did not involve the use of
catalogues with more sophisticated search facilities. The implication here appears to be that
they are being used to reduce costs (combining in a single standard catalogue), rather than to
improve access or resource discovery across authority areas (pooling resources to develop a
catalogue of improved quality). It is also possible that these public library catalogues may
either be older systems which have not been replaced, or that they reflect particular
assumptions about why people might wish to use the public library collection – to locate
known items, rather than to look for a range of material on a subject.
The catalogues searched identified a wide range of numbers of collections or locations; these
were apparently more likely to be defined by format or by types of access available in
academic library catalogues, than in public library catalogues.

153

The catalogue searches suggested a high level of unique content in individual libraries. 67.6%
of all results were identified in only one library, whilst 81.7% of results only found in Strand 2
were only located in a single library.
The Strand 2 searches also more than doubled the total number of titles identified from those
located in Strand 1. This seems to suggest that although the British Library has the most
extensive collection in this field, it is not a comprehensive collection. However, the titles
identified by the British Library Strand 1 searches did account for the majority of Strand 2
search results (58.6%).
Most of the Strand 2 results were retrieved from English library catalogues and from academic
libraries. The search term “Social entrepreneurship” provided most results, followed by “Social
enterprise” although terms relating to community enterprise also provided additional results.
In examining the lists of most frequently retrieved titles, there appeared to be no overlap
between the top ten most frequently retrieved titles for the three sectors. This may be seen as
highlighting the different characteristics of each sector. Public library catalogues provided
fewer results, but the more frequently retrieved titles tended to be more recently published.
Most of the titles identified from public library catalogues were identified without phrase
searching.
The academic library catalogues provided more results, but the most frequently retrieved titles
tended to be older. Searches on two health library catalogues revealed a more specialised
focus on publications of relevance to the health sector. Online items were more frequently
identified in academic library catalogues than in public library catalogues.
Overall, most of the items only identified in Strand 2 were identified using phrase searching,
although a substantial minority were identified without phrase searching. Identifying relevant
results from non-phrase searches involved a great degree of researcher subjectivity in
browsing and selecting results.
The proportion of titles only located in Strand 2 by sector was similar to the sector-specific
proportions of total results identified.
The publication date patterns of new titles identified in Strand 2 followed the publication date
patterns of those identified in the British Library Strand 1 catalogue searches. Although overall
the British Library provided a much larger number of individual titles than any single Strand 2
catalogue, the number of additional titles identified in Strand 2 does suggest that there may be
gaps in the British Library’s holdings.
154

5.8 Addressing the research questions
5.8.1 What are the characteristics of the library collection for social enterprise?
These catalogue searches have provided a snapshot of what might be seen as the formal
catalogue records for a distributed national collection for social enterprise. The library
collection for social enterprise revealed by these catalogue searches is small, varied and differs
between library sectors. The majority of items in the collection for social enterprise identified
by these searches were unique to a single library.
Although the overall number of titles retrieved from public library catalogue searches was
much lower than the number retrieved from the academic library catalogues, the most
frequently retrieved titles from public library collections tended to be more recent
publications. This may reflect different approaches to material selection in different sectors,
with supplier selection for public libraries potentially providing new titles more rapidly.
Electronic materials relevant to social enterprise are available in academic library collections,
with over a quarter of the titles identified for the first time in these Strand 2 searches being
online materials included in academic library catalogues. In contrast, only one public library
catalogue returned a result for an electronic book relevant to social enterprise.
The publication dates of items retrieved by these searches follow a similar pattern to the
results retrieved in the Strand 1 catalogue searches, showing a collection for social enterprise
which has grown over the last decade, although with some outlying results from the 1960s
onwards.
As in the Strand 1 catalogue searches, the largest proportion of items located in Strand 2 were
general monographs. The largest number of items was published in England.
5.8.2 What does this study suggest about the wider issues relating to library and information
collections in the digital world?
The varied quality of the catalogues identified in this strand may suggest differing assumptions
regarding how library collections in different sectors will be used. The lack of phrase searching
in public library catalogues suggests that these are primarily intended for known item retrieval,
rather than for more exploratory subject-based searches. It may also suggest both the age of
the existing catalogues and the lower levels of resourcing for public library catalogue
procurement, reflected in the lower quality of some of these catalogues. This raises
155

fundamental questions regarding the role of public libraries and about the role of library
catalogues in either facilitating or inhibiting access to collection materials.
The contrast between the higher levels of phrase searching seen in Scottish and Welsh public
library catalogues and the lower proportion of public library catalogues with phrase searching
in England and Northern Ireland also seems to raise questions regarding the possible coordinating role of a national library in public library catalogue provision. In addition, these
findings have shown that although the British Library has the most extensive collection on
social enterprise of all those searched, its collection is not comprehensive.
5.8.3 What constitutes the concept of the library collection in the digital world?
This strand could be seen as an experiment in the use of search to build a picture of a
distributed national collection on a specific topic. In some ways, it provides a rich picture of the
variety of material identified in library catalogues from different sectors. The design of this
strand was predicated on the dual idea of catalogues as representations of library collections
and as mechanisms to facilitate access to individual collection items. However, issues
regarding the quality of some catalogues call into question both these assumptions. If a lack of
phrase searching functionality leads to useful results being overwhelmed by irrelevant results,
or leads to potentially relevant results not being retrieved, the catalogue would seem to be a
barrier to, rather than an enabler of, collection access.
5.9 Limitations
The Strand 2 searches reflect an underlying assumption that a catalogue acts at least to some
extent as an accurate representation of the collection.
The searches were conducted on a relatively small sample, although one which includes
around a quarter of academic libraries and a quarter of public library authorities in each of the
four home nations.
Because of the techniques used in searching catalogues which did not provide phrase
searching facilities, a great degree of researcher subjectivity and selectivity was involved in
identifying relevant titles in catalogues without phrase searching.
It is very difficult to tell whether differences in numbers of search results reflect differences
between the collections of different libraries or just reflect differences in approaches to
cataloguing items and in the operation of individual catalogues.

156

No known item searches were performed as part of the Strand 2 searches. A more rigorous
approach would have been to mirror the technique used in the Strand 1 catalogue searches in
all Strand 2 catalogues. This would have involved first searching each catalogue using phrases
or keywords to develop a list of relevant titles and then returning to each catalogue in turn to
search individually for each title identified in any of the other catalogues.
The brief searches on WorldCat were conducted nearly two years after the original Strand 2
searches and individual title results from WorldCat were not compared to the individual titles
located in Strand 2. However, the relatively low number of results to the WorldCat searches
suggests a contrast to the apparent trend of the Strand 2 results, where searching 88 library
catalogues more than doubled the number of titles located from the British Library catalogue
searches. As WorldCat contains records for over eight hundred times as many libraries (72,000
worldwide (OCLC, 2013b)), if this trend had continued – doubling number of results with an
increase of 88 libraries – numbers of search results from WorldCat might have been expected
to be significantly greater.
5.10 Conclusion
This chapter summarises findings from Strand 2 library catalogue searches, highlighting
differences between catalogue quality and numbers and characteristics of results retrieved
from different library sectors. In particular, it suggests that many results retrieved from
individual library catalogues are unique to those specific collections. The Strand 2 results
extend beyond those retrieved in Strand 1 British Library catalogue searches, although they
follow similar patterns in relation to the publication dates of items, types of material, place of
publication and numbers of results for individual search terms.

6 STRAND 3: INTERVIEW FINDINGS
6.1 Introduction
This chapter summarises findings from interviews with 18 people which took place between 24
June 2011 and 28 June 2012. The following research questions were addressed by this element
of the study:
2. How is the library collection for social enterprise used?
3. What are the characteristics of the self-described information seeking behaviour of
people interested in social enterprise?
4. What are stakeholders’ perceptions of library and information collections and
terminology?
5. What does this study suggest about the wider issues relating to library and information
collections in the digital world?
6. What constitutes the concept of the library collection in the digital world?
The aim was to identify key themes relating to library collections for social enterprise from the
perspectives of a range of stakeholders including social enterprise practitioners, academics,
policy makers, library and information practitioners and publishers, and to use these findings
to develop a survey instrument to explore the wider applicability of these ideas to larger
groups of stakeholders.
Key findings described here include the identification of social enterprise information needs
and sources, details of the types of information created by people interested in social
enterprise and how this information is stored. Interviewee definitions of the term “collection”
are analysed, introducing a possible conceptual model of collection-as-thing, collection-asprocess and collection-as-access. A range of themes relating to library collections relevant to
social enterprise are also discussed, including collection documentation (with examples
provided by four library interviewees) and perceptions of collection uniqueness. Publisher
perspectives and the relationships between libraries, publishers and social enterprise are also
examined.
6.2 Interview characteristics
Interviews took place with 5 people involved in running or supporting social enterprises, 6
library and information practitioners, 2 academics, 2 policymakers, 2 publishers and 1
administrator. The interviewees were purposively sampled to provide a range of different
perspectives on the topics discussed. The roles of the interviewees and the identifiers used to
describe them are summarised in Table 6.2 below.

6.3 Social enterprise information needs
Diverse information needs were identified by people involved in social enterprise, academics
and policymakers. This analysis draws on information needs identified in all parts of the
interviews, including in responses to the Critical Incident Technique question, although those
specific responses are also discussed in more detail in section 6.6.1.
6.3.1 Social enterprise concepts, principles and terminology
All interviewees involved in social enterprise described some need for information about
concepts, principles and terminology relating to social enterprise. These included needs for
information about overarching topics, such as “co-op principles” (SE1) and on more specific
aspects of social enterprise, such as employee ownership (SE5) or community share issues
(SE2).
159

An interviewee based within a public sector organisation but with a role of supporting units
interested in or working towards spinning out into social enterprise described how information
needs have changed in a rapidly evolving policy context; having become familiar with the
Community Interest Company model through work on an earlier project, a new government
initiative relating to mutuals and co-operatives has led to a new set of information needs (SE3).
Information about different perspectives on current government policies were also needed by
an academic (A2), who was examining responses from Conservative politicians to specific
pieces of legislation proposed by the coalition government. Another academic (A1) needed
information about the background to the emergence of the social enterprise mark – an
initiative generated from within the social enterprise community itself. A1 also needed
background information about concepts and key people involved in social enterprise or the
cooperative movement, to be used in teaching materials.
One social enterprise interviewee and one academic needed information about international
social enterprise topics, such as the broad terminology used to describe social enterprise in
other countries (“we were using the same terms but talking a totally different language”
(SE4)), or specific terms to describe particular processes affecting social enterprise funding
(A2). A publisher also described problems posed by differences in the terminology used to
describe social enterprise in the US as opposed to the UK (O3).
Finally, a policymaker needed background information about the support needs of social
enterprises in a particular area (PM1).
6.3.2 Business management
Most social enterprise interviewees discussed needing information relating to the day-to-day
running of their organisations. This included quite broad information needs relating to strategy
and operational management (SE1), as well as more specific business management topics. For
example, SE2 discussed needing information relating to managing organisational IT provision
within a volunteer-led social enterprise. SE3 and SE5 both talked about the need for
information regarding the implications of moving from the NHS to a social enterprise
organisation, including issues surrounding staff terms and conditions, pensions and indemnity
insurance. SE5 also reflected on specific past information needs relating to pieces of
documentation which provided the basis for establishing a social enterprise, such as business
plans, Business Transfer Agreements and contracts. These information needs are quite specific
to a particular stage in the development of a social enterprise, and have now been replaced by
a need for information about performance indicators and ways of measuring success (SE5).
160

6.3.3 Information relating to the purpose of the business
All but one social enterprise interviewee spoke directly about information needs related to the
purpose of their businesses. This included information about training courses for bicycle
trainers (SE1); “meteorological information... that’s what can be hardest to get hold of... at no
cost” (SE2), “anaerobic digestion of grass waste” (SE2); “the health system and getting through
the health assurance process” (SE3).
SE5 described how information needs about social enterprise in general merged or developed
into more specific information needs relating to social enterprise in healthcare, and how an
initial encounter with the concept of social enterprise on a training course led to more
purposeful information-seeking in relation to its potential application to the field of health.
In addition to discussing the role of evidence in decision-making and the influence of training
as a medical professional in taking a critical and analytical approach to evaluating information,
SE5 also talked about synthesising information about two apparently quite different topics,
relating to social enterprise and to a specific aspect of healthcare delivery:
“I was largely dovetailing my reading around the evidence base for social enterprise
in health with [the] evidence base for integrated working because I’m quite interested
in integrated care... I was looking for synergies between the two.” (SE5)
6.3.4 Data and its use in marketing
Three social enterprise interviewees discussed their need for data about the social impact of
their organisation and as a tool for marketing or for communicating with people outside the
organisation.
SE1 described the need for information showing the social value of cycle training:
“Some say for every pound you spend on cycle training you save three pounds –
society saves three pounds – well this says it’s higher than that, up to seven times, so
getting that type of info is a bit difficult.” (SE1)
SE2 discussed using quite specialised windspeed data to open up discussions with local
communities about the possible locations for wind turbines.
SE3 also discussed the relationship between gathering data about the social impact of a
healthcare social enterprise and its potential uses both as a marketing tool and as a resource
for health service commissioners, setting out the added social value they should expect
providers to deliver:
161

“it was done more as a kind of an added social value, but it ended up being a
marketing tool as well because what it was trying to demonstrate was the cost of
providing the healthcare support to individuals who were substance abusing” (SE3)
6.3.5 Policymaker information needs
Policymakers needed information about best practice (PM1); evidence to inform policy
development (including data about council operations and activities (PM2)) and information
for benchmarking with other areas (PM2).
6.3.6 Social enterprise information needs: conclusion
The interviews suggested quite a broad range of information needs. These included
information about background concepts and terminology relating to social enterprise;
information about the day-to-day management of a business or relating to the purpose of the
social enterprise (cycle training, health care, environmental projects); data for evaluating social
value and to inform policy development.
Wilson (1981: 7-10) questions the usefulness of the concept of “information needs”,
suggesting instead that “the full range of human, personal needs is at the root of motivation
towards information-seeking behaviour” (Wilson, 1981: 9) and describes these needs as
belonging to three categories: cognitive, affective and physiological needs. The “information
needs” described above can be broadly categorised as a number of cognitive needs, shown in
Table 6.3.6 below. Most, but not all, are linked to the work roles of the interviewees, also
described in Wilson’s (1981: 9-10) discussion of the connection between needs, work roles and
organisational and social environments.
These cognitive needs seemed fairly explicitly identified with quite direct links to the
information needs described in sections 6.3.1-6.3.5. However, other affective (psychological or
emotional needs) were also suggested by some interviewees, with more implicit links between
these needs and information seeking behaviour: one referred to a library as “an oasis of calm”
on a bad day where it’s possible to “have a little look at the self-help things” but suggesting “I
wasn’t formally accessing it, but in passing I’d go and read something”; another linked a sense
of identity as “an evidence-based practitioner” to subsequent information-seeking behaviour;
a third interviewee implied that using technical data to present an informed argument for a
particular course of action could be a way of avoiding confrontation with local people.

6.4 Information sources for social enterprise
6.4.1 Personal knowledge
Most interviewees discussed the value of personal knowledge when looking for information
about topics relating to social enterprise. SE2 described how the direction of the organisation
depended on “the knowledge of our volunteers. It’s very much guided by what they know as to
where we go next... [...] it very much starts with the knowledge of people...” (SE2)
For SE1, one particular colleague would be the first person to ask if information were needed
on a particular topic. The interviewees also discussed the importance of their own personal
knowledge (SE2, SE4, A2).
6.4.2 Personal contacts
All five social enterprise interviewees, both academics and both policymakers discussed the
value of personal contacts in obtaining information about social enterprise topics. A social
enterprise practitioner described the value of personal conversations with others:

163

“they have a lot of knowledge... and they have access to people – they have networks
– they can... sometimes reap better reward than... getting into another thick
document.” (SE5)
Personal contacts were described as facilitating access to more formal information sources:
“there’s all sorts of literature that’s available for civic organisations but it’s very much
about knowing – having a contact and knowing that it exists.” (SE2)
A policymaker also felt that “I would say probably the bulk of the intelligence that we gather is
through conversations really” (PM1), although this was combined by a note of scepticism
when describing the experience of visiting organisations with reputations for innovative
approaches to social enterprise support, saying “generally I always find that the publicity’s far
stronger than the reality” (PM1).
Two social enterprise interviewees also described an iterative process of using personal
contacts and other information sources to explore and validate initial impressions (SE3, SE5):
“and you’re always trying to dovetail what you read with what you see. And I’m doing this all
the time” (SE5).
Finally, both people with experience of social enterprises spinning out from the public sector,
as well as one policymaker, also mentioned trade union representatives or publications as
additional sources of information.
6.4.3 Networks and information sharing
Examples of information sharing through networks were described by people interested in
social enterprise, academics and policymakers. SE3 described how a “support network group”
was created to meet informally over coffee to discuss the health assurance process and the
issues surrounding spinning out of the NHS: “we’d have organisations at different points in the
journey as well, so that was quite useful in terms of learning from each other.” SE3 also
observed that:
“the social enterprise as a sector is very kind of self-supporting in that sense and very
proud of what it does and wants to share that. So we didn’t have any of the – you
know if you try and transfer in some of the NHS networks or commercial networks
you’d have people say “well we can’t talk to you about that” but there wasn’t any of
that at all with the social enterprise.” (SE3)
A1 described creating multiple case studies for use in teaching sessions based on
conversations with social enterprise practitioners: “you can’t do that without having the links
to the practitioner networks, you know, people meeting people at conferences or meeting
164

people through knowledge exchange projects.” A1 also commented on the importance of the
link between teaching, practice and research.
Both policymakers discussed the importance of networks for their work – PM1 commented on
the strength of the network of social enterprise practitioners, researchers and experts in the
local area and commented on the role of personal network members in raising the profile of
potentially useful information:
“So I think if people know what you’re working on, people who are in your network
keep an eye on things then yeah I think information does come to you. But only if it’s
clear what you’re interested in, I suppose.” (PM1)
PM2 also described using a personal professional network to obtain information relating to
work topics: “I do a lot of asking, so if I want information I ask around and I network and I get
stuff from my network.” (PM2).
6.4.4 Presentations and events
A1 described the opportunities conferences provide to meet people, mentioning two major
conferences and discussed the benefits of attending “practitioner-involved forums”, which
provide an opportunity to “come out of my research ivory tower and get my hands dirty in sort
of ongoing and contemporary debates that are affecting the practitioner world”. Both
publishers also mentioned the value of conferences, with O2 describing one publication as “a
result of probably a conversation at a conference”.
The value of training courses or events was mentioned by three people involved with social
enterprise. SE2 talked about a “quick books training course” but noted that resources to
attend other conferences and events were limited. SE3 discussed the useful presentations and
valuable contacts made at the Footsey social enterprise trade fair.
Two social enterprise interviewees also discussed the value of PowerPoint presentations – SE2
suggested it would be useful to have access to “virtual presentations stuff like that which is
normally only available to attendees” and SE5 talked about the difficulty of locating “particular
PowerPoint presentations that were very valuable when you know you go to conferences and
you get copies of slides”.
6.4.5 Support organisations
Support organisations operating as social enterprises themselves and providing advice and
support on topics such as finance, HR issues, legal issues or IT systems were mentioned by SE3:

165

“there are other social enterprises springing up with infrastructure to serve those
organisations.” SE5 echoed this, emphasising that:
“I got much more help from the smaller grassroots – for me it was an organisation
called Social Enterprise Support Centre which is a social enterprise itself set up to
help feed business development.”
6.4.6 Newsletters / current awareness
Current awareness information or newsletters were described as important sources of
information by four people involved in social enterprise. SE3 referred to NHS Confederation
monthly bulletins: “you can pick up there on government policy or research studies... they just
cover the managerial angle”, particularly noting the benefit of having large amounts of
information condensed into a single paragraph. However, PM1 was more sceptical about some
of these current awareness services: “well my in box is full of email... distribution lists and kind
of e-newsletters from adverts and conferences and things like that – to be honest they
generally get deleted pretty quickly.”
SE4 described using current awareness was used to pre-empt possible information needs: “So
we tend to meet our – in fact they may not have occurred because we get so much
information coming through to us really“.
6.4.7 Web-based information
6.4.7.1 Google, websites and YouTube
Three people involved in social enterprise mentioned Google searches as a source of
information, as did both policymakers. Both academics discussed using Google Scholar to find
information.
There seemed to be different motivations to searching Google. SE3 described looking for very
specific information (social enterprises in the local area), whilst SE4 described web searches as
quite infrequent.
SE4 noted the difficulty of searching for information on Chinese websites (“they seem to come
and go”) and preferred the quality of resources created by his own organisation:
“we tend to find that actually information already on the workshops we’ve already had
as good or if not better than the information that we’re getting on the web.” (SE4)
In contrast, PM2 suggested “I always Google just because I like to see the randomness of what
comes back.” SE2 also suggests a degree of randomness in taking a broad approach to
166

searching Google “it may be like wind turbines and research [...] what comes up – are they any
good?”
Some interviewees also mentioned preferred websites which they would consult for
information such as the Social Enterprise Coalition (SE3). SE5 described the King’s Fund
website as “a place I go to quite regularly for analytically informed policy debate” – suggesting
a forum for interaction and engagement (“a place I go” for “debate”) rather than just a web
resource.
One academic discussed the usefulness of YouTube for teaching materials, including short
animated speeches from the Royal Society of Arts (“they’re very amusing... they illustrate...
what the speaker is trying to say in a very graphic way and... they’re just very provocative they’re just terrific teaching materials. Very inventive.” (A1)).
6.4.7.2 Government information and reports
4 people involved in social enterprise described using reports or government information
(including websites) as sources of information, usually from the government department most
closely related to the purpose of the business such as the NHS or Department of Health (SE3,
SE5), or Department of Transport (SE1), but also including departments responsible for more
general issues affecting social enterprises or other businesses, such as HMRC (SE2).
6.4.7.3 Toolkits
Three interviewees involved in social enterprise mentioned a more interactive type of resource
in the form of toolkits. SE3 discussed involvement in creating a toolkit for commissioning and
for assessing added social value, whilst SE5 described using a business planning toolkit to
structure the relevant documentation.
6.4.7.4 Ideas for future possible web information sources
Two social enterprise interviewees (SE2, SE4) mentioned the desirability of a web-based
directory of information about social enterprise with the aim of being “everyone’s first point of
call” (SE2). SE4 described having tried to create such a resource as part of their organisational
website but “it was just too resource intensive and we didn’t have the time to do it”.
6.4.8 Research papers / articles
SE2 discussed the potential value of “research papers as well as other general textbook kind of
things” for specific environmental topics and observed that “having access to research papers
where you could search a bit more like Athens that’s what would be so useful” (SE2). Both
167

academics talked about the research resources available through their university libraries – A1
described using Emerald, Business Source Premier, Sage and Google Scholar; whilst A2
mentioned a social science database and Google Scholar. PM2 also described “taking a bit
more of a kind of [an] evidence based role”, using research skills developed during a
postgraduate course to gather information relevant to professional practice.
6.4.9 Primary data
In addition to interviewees who discussed a need for data (SE1, SE2, SE3), both academics
described collecting or analysing primary data as an important source of information. Both
policymakers also talked about either commissioning primary research or carrying out analysis
on local authority statistics.
6.4.10 Information sources for social enterprise: conclusions
The interviews demonstrated the diverse information sources used by people interested in
social enterprise topics. These include personal knowledge and contacts, including information
sharing through networks. Presentations, events and conferences were mentioned as useful
sources of information by social enterprise practitioners, academics and publishers. Support
organisations and newsletters or current awareness bulletins were also regarded as helpful,
and most interviewees attached importance to Google searches or websites as information
sources. More specialised web-based resources, such as toolkits and government information
and reports were also used by social enterprise practitioners. More academic information
sources, such as research articles, or books were also mentioned by social enterprise
practitioners, academics and one policymaker. The value of primary data was discussed by
social enterprise practitioners, policymakers and academics.
Table 6.4.10 gives an indication of which information sources were used to address the
categories of cognitive need and information needs identified in section 6.3.6.

6.5 Characteristics of digital information
6.5.1 Benefits of brief summaries of information
Three interviewees involved with social enterprise discussed the usefulness of summaries or
“snippets of information”:
“I keep hoping that I’ll come across a really good guide at some point like get little bits
of snippets of information that help.” (SE2)
The social enterprise support manager discussed the advantages of current awareness
bulletins:
“So a lot of sources are there... twelve or fourteen different areas in a single
paragraph.” (SE3)
This was discussed more critically by SE5, particularly in the context of social media where
information seemed:
“a bit dumbed down really – the Twitter, the Facebooks and the social media
engagement forums are about fast-track snippets of opinion-forming and influencing
data that a lot of people get access to very rapidly which takes up the time I think it
probably would take to go into a more interrogative piece but that might be accessed
through a different route.”
The academic interviewee A1 also talked about the benefits of being able to break up video
resources into the sort of “clips that are on YouTube” to use in teaching sessions and also
described the snippet previews of content in Google Books as “incredibly helpful”. Similar
issues were discussed by the publisher O2 who talked about the advantages of “slicing and
dicing” content in a way which would potentially both “allow students to pick and chose which
bits they want” and which could enable authors to provide additional digital summary
documents to complement their full publications, without the prohibitive cost margins of
printing paper copies of such documents.
Librarians and information practitioners also discussed the potential benefits of added
granularity in information sources, such as the digital usage statistics for some resources which
give chapter level detail (LI6) or the opportunities presented to create catalogue records for
individual chapters of books (LI2). The government librarian LI1 also discussed the library’s role
in providing summary documents (“Quick Information Packs”) summarising information on a
particular topic from a wide range of sources, including books, journal articles and social media
sources.

170

6.5.2 “Free” information
Three social enterprise practitioner interviewees described the advantages of “free”
information accessible on the internet. SE4 described stopping organisational subscriptions to
business databases because “so much of the information about it is just available free”. SE2
described the importance for a small environmental social enterprise to be able to access
meteorological data free of charge, whilst the social enterprise support manager SE3 described
a “freebie session” given to emerging public sector spinout social enterprises by a marketing
firm.
The emphasis on the advantages of “free” information for those involved in social enterprise
contrasted sharply with the perspectives offered by both publishers, who emphasised the
value added to information by the publishing process:
“the big thing for me is that people think that digital is free, which you’ll see it really
isn’t... with any digital product.” (O2)
[Somebody has] “to pay for the price of the publishing process and I think [that’s]
unquestionable – I wouldn’t walk into Tesco and demand food free because you
need to eat” (O3)
All library and information practitioners also discussed some of the issues surrounding “free”
information, although all were very aware of the cost of digital materials. LI6 and LI3 both
described directing their library customers to free resources from library websites. LI3
predicted greater reliance on freely available websites as a source of information in the
context of library budget cuts, and also discussed the evaluation process involved in selecting
these materials. LI3 seemed to see an understanding of the importance of free access to
information as central to what public libraries can offer small business: “we are a service that’s
either free or quite cheap so I would hope we could help any small businesses get going”. LI6
described informing national library customers of the range of costs involved in providing
information from different sources, actively promoting free alternatives:
“we say there’s a charge for this but on the other hand you can have this for free. You
know because I don’t want to disadvantage somebody who is far away and can’t
make... their way to the library.”
LI4 also described making reusable learning objects freely available to the general public
through a university website, seeing it as part of the “social mission” of the institution. LI5
described advising students to visit a local public library which, through partnership
arrangements, has access to a different range of business databases:

171

“I would love to recommend students here to go down and access those free of charge
instead of complaining that we don’t have something that they want.”
6.5.3 Characteristics of digital information: conclusions
Aspects of digital information were discussed by social enterprise practitioners, academics,
policymakers, library and information practitioners and publishers. These included the benefits
or disadvantages of short summaries of information and ideas about “free” information –
social enterprise practitioners talked about “free” digital resources, both publishers
emphasised that digital resources are not free and library and information practitioners
seemed to take a middle way, emphasising the library’s role in minimising costs for the
individual user.
6.6 Critical Incident question responses
People involved in social enterprise, both academics and both policymakers were asked to
describe a recent example of a time when they had needed information, how they went about
finding it and whether it was useful. Library and information practitioner interviewees were
asked to describe a time when their library or information service had assisted someone
interested in social enterprise.
6.6.1 Social enterprise, academic and policymaker interviewees
3 people (SE1, SE2, PM2) gave two examples of recent times when they had needed, located
and used information on a topic relating to social enterprise. The remaining 6 interviewees in
this category gave a single example each.
Table 6.6.1 summarises each of the examples discussed. 6 examples were of completed
information seeking activities (shaded blue in the table); 6 were of current or ongoing
information seeking activities (shaded pink). The information sources are listed in the order
they were mentioned, indicating, for example, where someone started with personal
knowledge. In all 12 examples, personal knowledge (either of the interviewee or of a
colleague) is either the first or second information source used. In 6 examples, Google,
websites, internet searching or a web search were either the first, second or third source
consulted. In 3 examples, consulting Google or the web leads on to personal contacts,
although in 3 other examples personal contact follows on from personal knowledge (without
an intervening web search). 2 explicitly described using a library and 1 academic implicitly
suggested this, by referring to downloading journal articles. The inclusion of a final stage of the
review of job descriptions – checking statutory requirements – suggests an awareness of the
potential legal implications or consequences of this process, and the importance of checking
172

compliance with the law before finalising any recommendations. No comparable source is
mentioned in the information seeking processes for the 11 other examples.

In the 6 examples where the information seeking activities have been completed, 4 describe

However, 2 describe more intangible outcomes, such as deepening personal knowledge about
particular topics or people. 2 of the examples of ongoing information seeking activities
describe or envisage tangible outcomes (a presentation, an EndNote file of references, a
research paper), 3 suggest more intangible outcomes. 2 of the examples of ongoing
information seeking activities also describe the emergence of new problems or issues.
6.6.2 Library and information practitioners
Four library and information practitioners answered a critical incident style question about a
time when their service has provided support relating to a social enterprise topic. Two library
and information practitioners were either not asked the critical incident style question,
because an information service was not yet launched, or were unable to answer it. Two further
respondents provided no concrete examples of direct, relevant enquiries:
“I haven’t had anyone directly ask me – certainly lots of questions about business
start up but not specifically related to social enterprise.” (LI5)
“I don’t think anybody’s really told us that they were doing a social enterprise” (LI3)
Examples were provided by two practitioners from a government library and a national library,
respectively:
“it’s like everyone has hazy memories of giving people stuff but nothing very clear! [...]
apart from providing books on request when people come and say get me that book
on social enterprise and we bought it for them so that’s, that’s a definite clear one.”
(LI1)

174

“only [one] enquiry I’ve ever received specifically on social enterprises and how many
there might be and the potential growth...” (LI6)
However, some librarians thought that more people may have made enquiries, but without
identifying themselves as social enterprises:
“we’ve got people that are involved in the environmental side I’m not sure that they
would say that they were a social enterprise I’m not sure how much they’re ploughing
back in there, you know...” (LI3)
“If somebody comes in as an individual I’ve no idea whether they’re attached to a
social enterprise or not. It’s difficult to assess.” (LI6)
Despite this lack of apparent use of the libraries by people involved in social enterprise, two
librarians did describe actively responding once a potential need for information about social
enterprise had been identified. LI1 discussed attending Policy Picnic lunchtime meetings (“a
really useful good way of keeping in touch with what everyone in the department is doing”)
about social enterprise and the Big Society. These “were really well attended so it was clear
from that to me that there was a lot of interest in the area that’s when we bought a few of the
books” (LI1). LI6 showed how a single enquiry highlighted a possible need and prompted the
addition of social enterprise links to the library website:
“I think that largely was a result of that the initial enquiry, that we suddenly realised
that there may be a potential interest in social enterprise and so we added the links to
the website, but I haven’t found much in the way of published research in this, this
sector at all.” (LI6)
6.7 Creating information about social enterprise
All five social enterprise interviewees, both academics and both policymakers described
creating information, including:








Reports (including original research) – some available on the web;
Briefing documents;
Presentations;
Web tools – available on the web;
Social value toolkits – available on the web;
Business plans, tenders, contracts;
Case studies – some available on the web;
Journal articles;
Staff handbooks;
Data on service use and social impact;
Books (whole texts or sections);
Teaching materials.

175

A considerable amount of this potentially useful information would not be captured by
libraries, although some of the web-based publications would now be subject to harvesting
under non-print legal deposit regulations. Both publishers described the field of social
enterprise as an emerging area of interest for formal publications, such as books and journals,
both within the UK and internationally:
“I mean I think it’s a really emerging and... interesting agenda. I’m not sure quite how
many people are writing about it at the moment...”
(O2)
“it’s an increasing and emerging... field of interest within the academic community.”
(O3)
6.8 Social enterprise information and libraries
All social enterprise interviewees described having access to some sort of organisational
collection of books or other information sources, ranging from “a couple of books” (SE2) to a
“fairly extensive library in-house with something like 300 books” (SE4). Both academics had
used university libraries for their work and one policymaker had also used an academic library
for information on related topics. The British Library was mentioned by one of the social
enterprise interviewees (who would encourage people to use the BIPC) and by both
academics: A1 mentioned the British Library’s EThOS service (“they’ve done this wonderful
project to digitise all of the PhDs”).
Two people involved in social enterprise reported using libraries for their work, including a
social enterprise support manager who had used an organisational library but who observed
that “in a way the library element of it is sort of catching up” (SE3) in relation to materials for
social enterprise. This was echoed by SE2 who thought that “the social enterprise aspects and
stuff like that seems relatively new in terms of literature.”
This suggests a perception that library collections are retrospective and reactive, rather than
proactive in anticipating people’s information needs. SE5 further developed this idea
observing:
“Actually again my reading at the time was that there is a paucity of reliable evidence
that said social enterprise would work in health and the curious bit for me is well
actually there’s a lot of evidence that says social enterprise works in other sectors
and to some degree being one of the early adopters or spearheads you then become
contributors to that evidence base.” (SE5)
This identifies a broader gap in the availability of evidence (not just formally published
literature) about social enterprise in a particular context, and shows how an individual
involved in social enterprise may then positively contribute to filling that gap. SE5 also applied
176

this specifically to a library context: “I’m part of that journey, I suspect that in two or three
years time that library will be much better populated”.
Two other interviewees (PM1 and SE1) discussed hypothetical future library use, either for
locating information on a specific topic or if they had a clearer sense of what a library might be
able to offer.
Librarians from public, academic and national libraries discussed the difficulty of ascertaining
whether a customer is looking for information from a social enterprise perspective, or from a
broader perspective to do with business or social or environmental issues. A government
librarian mentioned the speed of developments within the field of social enterprise and
related policy, meaning that significant emphasis is placed on the most current information. A
public librarian identified another issue as:
“a whole problem in itself is... how subjects are seen and whether they’re seen as
important or not. That’s the problem. It’s quite difficult.” (LI3)
This seems to capture well a key challenge for library collection development, particularly in
relation to interdisciplinary subjects, regarding identifying and prioritising emerging fields of
interest.
This challenge of identifying emerging subject areas was also discussed by both publisher
interviewees. They described a mixture of reactive and proactive methods for identifying
potential fields of interest – discussing topics with the academic and practitioner communities,
responding to expressions of interest from potential authors and actively commissioning
experts to write textbooks in relevant fields. Both publishers described this as a process of
engagement with a “community”, whereas library and information practitioner interviewees –
particularly from academic libraries – seemed to describe engagement in more procedurally
defined institutional terms. For example, collection development for new subjects would
depend on budget discussions with departments to fund acquisitions for new modules (LI5) or
on individual faculty policies (LI4).
An academic, a social enterprise practitioner and a policymaker all discussed their experiences
of differing levels of electronic resource provision across library sectors. Two compared the
access they had when they were members of universities, with the limitations they
encountered when they were not:
“having access to research papers where you could search a bit more like Athens that’s
what would be so useful.” (SE2)
“having to just go in and look at things but particularly online things like being able to
get hold of journal articles or whatever was really... it’s hard, it’s exasperating.” (A2)
177

6.9 Storing information
Social enterprise practitioners and academics described a mixture of print and electronic
systems for storing their information, all involving some computer files. They also discussed
some types of information which they did not store: “In terms of keeping a record of webpages
that I might have looked at, I don’t do that.” (SE1)
Tools included USB sticks, Google docs, Endnote, iBooks, GoodReader and intranets. Most of
these were described as being fairly short term information storage solutions. A1 specifically
described one system (GoodReader) as a place “to keep stuff temporarily so this for me this is
like a holding area” before deciding whether “to keep it permanently” in iBooks.
In contrast, both publishers discussed their responsibilities to preserve the materials which
they publish for the longer term, as well as the systems they use to facilitate this. However,
two library and information practitioner interviewees who belong to organisations with a
publishing role drew a contrast between publication and permanent storage:
“What the department does is puts them [departmental publications] online on the
website for as long as they’re accessible and then takes them off again whereas... we
will keep copies of all of them in the library.” (LI1)
“in my mind the website’s documents section will be like a shop window which still has
all the latest publications in stock... but at the same time as you’re looking at that
there’s the portal and then you go up there and there you’ve got the works you know
the filing cabinet.” (LI2)
This can be seen as a demonstration of the importance of the preservation role of libraries,
discussed by four library and information practitioners. Two used the image of their services as
a lifeboat; one described an online information resource – part of a strategy for preserving
“knowledge at risk” (O1) – as being “a sort of lifeboat for information” (LI2) and another
described the process of selection for preservation as being “like choosing who gets in the
lifeboat” (LI4). This image suggests both a role in rescuing at risk materials, referring
particularly to transient digital materials, and a process of selection which might be based on
ideas of perceived value or perceived vulnerability. LI3 also contrasted reference and lending
library approaches within a single public library system: the reference library would retain
material for longer “whereas lending are more ephemeral”.

178

6.10 Definitions of collection
The responses of seven interviewees to the question “how would you define the term
collection?” suggested that they identified the term as library jargon. This included three
library and information practitioners, two social enterprise practitioners, one policy maker and
one publisher. LI1 explained:
“the terms are relevant but I don’t know if I’d use them when I was talking to anyone
outside the library, because terms for a non-library person, chances are if you’re
talking about the collection they would think of a set of books”.
In this case “sources of evidence” would be LI1’s preferred way of referring to library resources
when talking to people from beyond the library. A non-librarian working to develop an online
information service similarly identified the term with a library-specific meaning: “by the way
I’ve learned a lot since I’ve been here about the terminology used specifically in librarianship”
(LI2), whilst LI6 discussed examples of customer perplexity caused by the use of the term
“licensed digital collections” on the library website: “why don’t you just call it databases?”.
Two social enterprise practitioners also closely associated the term with library jargon. SE2
expressed this in two different ways – firstly by describing seeing the word collection in a
library: “it just brings up images of like [the university] library where it says ‘collections’ on a
sign” and then by emphasising “I’ve very much not had a librarian background – I’ve no idea if
that’s right or not.” SE5 also seemed unsure about defining the term: “Am I way off the mark?
Not being a librarian.” However, it should be noted that both SE2 and SE5 provided very valid
and valuable definitions of the term collection, despite their uncertainty about its meaning in
the context of library terminology. Indeed, despite the potential association of the word
“collection” with library jargon, most interviewees offered interesting, complex, and nuanced
definitions, which are explored in more detail below. One librarian (LI3) emphasised the view
that “collections is a better term” comparing it favourably to alternatives such as “resource
discovery” or “stock”.
6.10.1 Collection as process, store and access
The conceptual issues raised by the various definitions of “collection” seemed to be
summarised by one social enterprise practitioner:
“I guess there’s two possible meanings, one is the actual collecting of the information
and data, collecting raw data, and then I guess the other sort of collection can mean
the storage of the data and I guess another collection would be external information
which you’re collecting up so you’ve got access to it – that’s three types!” (SE1)

179

This articulates “three types” of meaning: collection as a process (“actual collecting”),
collection as a store or thing (“the storage of the data”), and collection as access (“so you’ve
got access to it”). The first two definitions echo a couple of dictionary definitions from the
Oxford English Dictionary (2013): “A number of objects collected or gathered together” or “The
action of collecting or gathering together”. The idea of collection as access echoes Feather and
Sturges (2003: 80-81) broad definition of collection as “the information resources to which a
library has access”. However, bringing them together as three elements of a single view of
collection seems to be a novel approach to the concept of collection.
SE1’s comments also highlight how different definitions of “collection” can merge, appearing
together in a single interview. Following further interviews, and examining these alongside
findings from the other two strands, these three meanings seem to broadly delineate views of
the concept of collection.
6.10.1.1 Collection as process: selection, search and service
One comment from a social enterprise practitioner summed up the idea of collection as a
process very effectively by suggesting “collection... feels like a journey, doesn’t it?” (SE5).
Other comments relating to the idea of collection as process seemed to fall into three distinct
but related categories: selection, search, and service.
Collection as process – selection
One academic defined collection as “a body of work that has been brought together using a
particular set of criteria” (A1). One academic and one publisher also discussed the existence of
older materials on related topics such as the co-operative movement, or community
development, which are relevant to emerging fields of current interest, such as social
enterprise.
Two library and information practitioner interviewees also described the role of automated
processes in item selection. These processes included a system for automatically purchasing
additional copies of high demand material:
“it’s an automated system through this new scheme that if demand spikes we’ll just
automatically purchase additional, until hopefully the title disappears off the list and
demand has been satisfied by the additional copies that we’ve got” (LI5)
The other aspect of selection discussed by library and information practitioners related to
deselection: reviewing and removing material from the library collection. Three librarians
specifically mentioned the role of current pressures on space in encouraging this process.

180

LI3 also discussed the challenges of deselection in a public library reference collection,
particularly dealing with a legacy of reluctance to deselect, creating a situation where
materials which are now “old, they’re now important... but if they’d thrown them away at the
time, we wouldn’t have this problem.” Current pressure on space contributed to this sense of
LI3’s retrospective frustration with the legacy of past decisions:
“why in 1950 have we just moved them around so much and just left them to get
really dusty in the outstore why [wasn’t] somebody actually you know throwing them
away at the time? I think we’ve got to be bold enough to think that if it’s no longer
useful, if it’s out of date, we need to actually throw something away.”
LI1 also discussed the difficulty of deselection decisions in the context of radical reductions in
physical library space:
“I think our next step is we’re going to get rid of our entire reference collection... and
that means that we’ll have a little bit of space there. Get new things coming in for a
little time then obviously we’ll start getting rid of things again.”
In contrast, one social enterprise practitioner discussed a strikingly straightforward approach
to discarding journals in his office collection:
“they’re held for six months and unless there’s something very specific, specific that
someone wants to hang on to for any reason, most of those after six months are
recycled.” (SE4)
LI5 described a process of advance deselection, where records for some ebooks which could
be available for purchase using a Patron Driven Acquisitions method were suppressed before
the system was introduced, because they were perceived as not being relevant to the needs of
the academic library users.
Collection as process – search
The dynamic generation of a collection of information through searches conducted within
information resources was discussed by one academic: “you choose your keywords and... you
can actually create your own customized collection” (A1). LI2 discussed using “nil return search
reports” to identify topics which users are searching for, but for which no material is found, to
guide future material selection. Both academic librarians also talked about an integrated
approach to searching for and discovering content within a collection. One described a new
resource discovery system, which brings together institutional repository material with more
traditional collection items, and one discussed a project to develop an in-house system which
would make content in a wide range of formats searchable through a single platform,
potentially including videos, research data and social media content. The aim of all of these
projects seemed to be echoed by a publisher:
181

“I suppose a really good collection is... where you take content and you can merge it,
you can cross-fertilise it, you can... discover easily” (O2).
Collection as process – service
A public librarian described the collection as “what we use to answer our reference enquiries
and our information enquiries” (LI3), suggesting the idea of active information, defined by use.
This can be contrasted with comments from two social enterprise practitioners, who discussed
inactive, unused local collections of electronic documents. One described these materials as:
“dead, sitting in our... own folders of research notes” (SE4). SE5 described information in a
computer archive as having “done its purpose and I don’t need to use it any more and it
probably has some value or some of its value”. In a follow up interview, SE5 described revived
interest in topics covered by some computer folders “it’s an active area suddenly, so there’s
lots of new stuff in there”. LI2 also described a pre-existing “finished collection” which was no
longer being maintained.
6.10.1.2 Collection as store or thing: groups and sub-groups
The term collection was also defined as a store or a thing. A librarian suggested the usefulness
of the term collection in capturing the totality of library’s resources, comparing it to other
terms, such as stock, and observing: “you’d still have to have some concept of the whole and I
think collection just does make it a whole” (LI3).
Collection as store or thing – groups
One policymaker defined collection as “a group of similar things that have got some sort of
aspect in common” (PM1), another described collection as “something you would curate…
with a theme or a kind of motif around it” (PM2). The term “curate” suggests both museum
approaches to collection and the vocabulary of the emerging field of digital curation; this was
echoed in a discussion with a publisher who described some librarians as curators. One
academic concisely summarised the idea of collection as a theme-based group: “More than
one and relating to a theme” (A2). This also raised the question of whether a minimum
number of items are needed for something to qualify as a collection. Four social enterprise
practitioners offered definitions of collection based on a grouping of materials around a
particular topic.
Most people gave a generally inclusive view of the formats of materials that might comprise
these subject groups. Some interviewees remarked on a shift from print to digital: for example,
an academic observed that “it used to be that... you’d be seeking to digitize the paper world
182

whereas now the paper world is a route into building up your digital world” (A1). This also
suggests a different approach to the concept of “digital world” – the use of the possessive
pronoun suggests the totality of an individual’s existence in a digital space, as opposed to using
the term “digital world” to refer to the external world increasingly characterised by the use of
digital technology. One academic librarian identified a potential place for social media sources
within a collection, including organisational Twitter feeds and blogs. A librarian in a national
library observed “it may not be a physical collection but it’s a collection of links” although later
noting “it’s possible that most people still think of a collection as being print” (LI6). A social
enterprise support manager suggested: “I wouldn’t necessarily see a collection as just a row of
books on a shelf: there are probably some books on a shelf, there’s probably a few DVDs, and
there’s [whatever] on the internet” (SE3).
Collection as store or thing – sub-groups
An academic posed the question, “How many sub-groups of collection are there within a
collection?” (A2). This idea of subsets making up a collection was also echoed by three social
enterprise interviewees. LI3 offered a more technical library-focused explanation of the same
idea:
“collection management will actually split down into the different subject areas of
things like... Dewey. So you do split up your collection into different areas by whatever
is relevant in your kind of library.”
These responses suggest that collection is a useful term for implying a hierarchical organisation
of information including subdivisions, as well as capturing the totality of everything within the
whole collection.
6.10.1.3 Collection as access
Seventeen interviewees discussed the concept of access in relation to collections, including all
six library and information practitioners. O1 also gave a definition of collection based on
“access to material via an online resource”. For one librarian, it seemed that:
“now we’ve moved psychologically from the idea of holding physical stuff in this
building and are much more relaxed about thinking about stuff which doesn’t
necessarily belong to us but for which we have a role in providing access”. (LI4)
LI5 echoed this, suggesting that “the term collection can mean anything that we provide access
to for both teaching and research to do with the university”.
However, another librarian saw a potential challenge to the concept of “collection”:

183

“the direction that it’s going is away from anything like a collection, ...it’s more fluid,
you know if you look at social media and things like that we seem to be moving slowly
and steadily away from having solid lumps of information that are the definitive
version and moving to something that’s much, much more fluid.” (LI1)
6.11 Historical collections
In contrast to some of the issues raised about the currency of information in library collections,
the significance of historical collections was also discussed by eight interviewees. Both
academics talked about the relevance to social enterprise research of historical collections
about similar topics – A1 observing that “there are large bodies of... work that exist already. I
mean not specifically created for social enterprise but which are directly useful” and A2
mentioned “co-operatives in the 1980s and 1990s” stressing that “There’s a lot of work that’s
already there”. It seems interesting that this more historical perspective on the potential scope
of relevant information was given by academic interviewees, but not by people involved in
social enterprise or policymakers.
The government librarian LI1 discussed the challenge of digitising and making accessible older
government publications, describing a process of largely ad hoc digitisation based on requests
for specific documents by individual service users. In contrast, the public librarian LI3
emphasised the potential value of a systematic digitisation programme for official publications:
“we have found as part of our retention policy... we’re having to keep things that
we’ve got that are old until they appear on the internet. I mean things like, um, some
of the government publications... they’re fine from a certain date but before that they
don’t exist on the internet yet.”
This highlights the potentially misleading impression which may be given by a collection where
older material, which is only available in printed copy, is on the shelves whilst more recent
publications are only available electronically. It also indicates the potential existence of fairly
widespread collections of historical printed official publications in public libraries, which could
provide alternative collaborative opportunities for approaching a digitisation strategy.
A strong pattern also emerged of library and information practitioners identifying aspects of
their collections as unique. For LI1 this was related to the specialism of the government
department served and the historically valuable legacy publications of predecessor
departments. LI3 also described the “regional remit” of the public library in the context of its
historical collections: “But our really early stuff is still needed because it’s not... it doesn’t
appear anywhere unless you go down to the British Library”. On a much larger scale LI6 also
describes the uniqueness of the national library collection in the context of its national remit –
especially in providing remote access to electronic resources which may not be available from
any other source. LI2 described the thesaurus built to support the collection as something
184

which would make it “more use than other similar collections might be”. LI4 and LI5 identified
unique materials produced by the academic institutions they serve – LI5 in particular
emphasised the importance of curating multimedia learning objects, such as podcasts:
“I think if we can organise our assets and get them out there we can actually affect the
pedagogy – the way in which things are taught”
6.12 Libraries, publishers and social enterprise
Although most library and information practitioners described generally distant and indirect
relationships with publishers, both publishers emphasised the importance of working
effectively with librarians:
“we could work a lot more collaboratively together in order to come to some
conclusions and solutions” (02)
“hopefully we’re all working toward the same goal” (O3)
Both publishers conveyed a strong sense of their purpose in serving academic and practitioner
communities. Both publishers also emphasised the quality of their service and the value this
adds to the information they provide. Key areas where library and information practitioner
issues overlapped with those discussed by publishers included:









Debates surrounding open access models;
The impact of institutional repositories, particularly if their content is made easier to
discover or linked across multiple institutions;
The impact of patron driven acquisitions;
Managing the digital transition:
o its costs, particularly in the context of misunderstandings about digital
information being free;
o the proliferation of new formats;
o the importance of accurate and automated metadata;
o the introduction of legal deposit for electronic publications.
The importance of collaboration;
The impact of shrinking budgets on libraries;
The impact of tuition fee increases on customer expectations of academic libraries.

One publisher and one academic librarian described their organisation as a type of social
enterprise, whilst both policy makers discussed possible opportunities for public libraries to
benefit from a social enterprise approach to service delivery.
6.13 Policy and process documentation
All library and information service interviewees discussed their documentation of collection
policies and processes. LI2 described the process of creating an entirely new online
information resource and documenting this for the first time. He described how this
185

documentation has evolved with the collection itself:
“when I first started very much my priority was to get everything written down first
and then to get on with it but as the scale of it really becomes apparent you need to
start making some progress first so I got quite a lot of draft things jotted down and
then started using them and went back when I needed to change them... that sort of
iterative process.”
Discussions with LI1 and LI3 revealed the different challenges of developing and maintaining
documentation for existing collections. For LI1, the relatively small size of the government
department library collection means the documentation need only be relatively brief, although
a description of one colleague as a “walking, talking” collection development policy suggests a
potential weakness of over-dependence on the tacit knowledge of one individual. In contrast
to LI1’s observation that larger collections, where “you’ve got a lot of people making
decisions,” have greater need for formal documentation, LI3 described the challenges of
devising a single collection policy to cover the whole of a public library collection, resulting in a
series of subject-specific policies, of varying degrees of detail. One policy in particular,
developed for a special collection as it went through an external accreditation process, was
identified as being “a very good document.”
Two library interviewees were either in the process of reviewing their collection policy
documentation or were unsure about the currency of the relevant documents. However, four
library and information interviewees were willing to share copies of documentation relating to
their collection. The characteristics of these documents are summarised briefly in Table 6.13
below.
These documents are highly heterogeneous but give a useful illustration of the different
approaches to collection documentation in different contexts. LI6A provides a formal
statement about the national library collection for business. It discusses legal deposit, web
archiving, the provision of links to freely accessible web resources and approaches to
prioritising budget spending. It also discusses the reallocation of materials with potential
historical value to other departments. As described by LI3, the document LI3B was created as
part of an accreditation process led by an external organisation. This is a more formal (and
more comprehensive) document than the other two from the same library. LI3A and LI3C both
seem to reflect individual informal attempts to capture personal knowledge and experience of
the collection for others. All three of these public library documents include specific treatment
of historical collection materials. LI1A also appears to be a more informal, concise statement
about a government library collection. It states a preference for electronic resources and
describes a historical collection starting in the 17th century. LI1B-LI1E provide examples of
186

Quick Information Packs on specific policy areas. They summarise a wide range of available
materials, including articles, reports, books and (where relevant) social media sources.

LI2A is a thesaurus of terms relating to social enterprise, the voluntary sector, charities and cooperatives, as well as terms relating to theoretical concepts in these fields, groups of people
involved, types of research and relationships between concepts. In thousands of terms, five
uses of the term “social enterprise” and three uses of the term “social entrepreneur” or “social
entrepreneurship” are included. The term “community interest company” appears once, the
term “co-operative” is used 11 times and “charity” is used 8 times.
6.14 Discussion
6.14.1 Concept of collection
The concept of collection suggested by the analysis of these interviews provides a more
dynamic way of viewing “collection” in the digital world. There also appear to be differences
between the way collection is interpreted by people working in library and information
services and by people involved in social enterprise, academics and policymakers. Figure

This appears to show quite different approaches to defining the term between the two groups.
Library and information practitioners and publishers appear to be more likely to define the
term in relation to ideas of access, service and organised groupings, whereas people involved
in social enterprise, academics and policymakers appear to more frequently define the term
around a particular subject or topic, as a process or as jargon.
6.14.2 Critical incident responses
Although the critical incident technique has only been applied in a very basic way in these
interviews, taking the form of a single question in a broader interview (rather than potentially
a whole interview shaped around the critical incident), the responses to this question have
provided some interesting insights. In the social enterprise, academic and policymaker
interviews, all 9 interviewees reported using personal knowledge to address their information
need and 5 used personal contacts or contacts with an external organisation. However, all
interviewees also balanced these more tacit types of information with other sources, including
web information and more formal publications. This might be seen as reflecting SE5’s
comment about the need to balance “soft and hard information”.
In 3 interviews the initial context of the critical incident information need was itself expressed
in terms of an information product:
“we wrote a report” / “we wrote a bid... a quote” (SE1)
“I was asked to participate in a tour and a seminar in the US” (SE4)
“I’m currently preparing a presentation to the Employee Ownership Association.”
(SE5)
6.14.3 Addressing the research questions
These interviews have provided useful insights into the original research questions.
6.14.3.1 How is the library collection for social enterprise used?
It appears that the library collection for social enterprise is only occasionally used and that this
use may well be invisible to library and information practitioners. The interviews suggested
that the most highly regarded library resources – databases, online research articles, e-books –
are those which are accessible remotely, and that having to go to a physical library to access
resources is perceived as a barrier to use. Academic libraries and, in one case, a national library
appeared to be better regarded than public libraries, although the availability of computers in
public libraries was perceived as an advantage by one social enterprise interviewee. All

189

interviewees directly involved in social enterprises also described some sort of organisational
library, such as a collection of books, magazines or maps.
6.14.3.2 What are the characteristics of the self-described information seeking behaviour of
people interested in social enterprise?
Key information needs relating to social enterprise included topics relating to the concepts,
principles and terminology of social enterprise, issues relating to business management, topics
linked to the purpose of the social enterprise and the need to demonstrate social impact and
social value. People interested in social enterprise, including academics and policymakers,
indicated that they draw extensively on their own personal knowledge, the personal
knowledge of particular colleagues and their own personal contacts to address their
information needs, using networks to obtain and to share information. Websites or more
formal information sources, such as reports or research articles, are also used to provide
balance or alternative perspectives. Training courses and resources such as PowerPoint
presentations were also mentioned, although managing and organising these sorts of
information so they can be easily retrieved was described by some interviewees as a challenge.
6.14.3.3 What are stakeholders’ perceptions of library and information collections and
terminology?
There appeared to be some perception of library collection terminology as jargon, both
amongst library and information practitioners and among social enterprise practitioners,
academics and policymakers. Some social enterprise interviewees suggested that the library
collection is seen as reactive and retrospective, rather than proactive in anticipating
information needs relating to emerging fields such as social enterprise. However, it is unclear
whether this is a function of the nature of libraries, or an aspect of relatively slow publication
and literature production processes. Both academics also mentioned the importance of
historical material on different but potentially relevant fields. This may be seen as linked to the
preservation role of libraries, although library and information practitioners gave ambivalent
responses about the implications of preservation for other aspects of the library service.
Access seemed to be a key issue for both library and information practitioners and for
publishers, although publishers appeared to affirm the value of the service they provide within
the publication chain more directly than librarians.

190

6.14.3.4 What does this study suggest about the wider issues relating to library and
information collections in the digital world?
The interviewees discussed the value of “snippets” of information, including from social media
sources, as well as the implications of perceptions of digital information as free. In particular,
library and information practitioners seemed to occupy a middle ground of cost mediation,
seeking to minimise costs for customers whilst also having a realistic understanding of the cost
of particular resources to the library. Digital collection development processes, such as patron
driven acquisitions potentially reorder processes developed in the print world – access by a
small number of library customers leads to the longer term addition of content to the library’s
collection.
6.14.3.5 What constitutes the concept of the library collection in the digital world?
These interviews have suggested a tentative model of the library collection in the digital world
with the following dimensions:





Collection as process:
o Selection
o Search
o Service
Collection as store or thing:
o Groups (on a subject or theme; something special; quantity)
o Sub-groups / organisation
Collection as access

The idea of collection-as-access appeared to be more frequently expressed by library and
information practitioners, whilst the idea of collection-as-process appeared to be more
frequently expressed by people interested in social enterprise. Both of these aspects of the
model suggest a more dynamic view of library collections than may conventionally be the case.
6.15 Survey instrument development
These initial interviews provided a basis for designing online survey instruments to explore the
wider applicability of some of the ideas discussed here. In particular, data from these
interviews enabled the identification of potential variables relating to:







Information needs of people interested in social enterprise;
Information sources used by people interested in social enterprise;
The creation and sharing of information by people interested in social enterprise;
The use of library or information services by people interested in social enterprise;
Stakeholder definitions of collection;
Library and information practitioner collection terminology;

191








Library and information practitioner awareness of social enterprise and related
information needs;
Library and information practitioner perceptions of communities;
Library and information practitioner approaches to policy documentation;
Library and information practitioner collection priorities;
Library and information practitioner approaches to interdisciplinary subjects;
Library and information practitioner approaches to freely available web-based
material.

6.16 Conclusion
The interviews conducted as part of the initial stage of this project have provided valuable
insights into the key topics investigated. In particular, they have helped to identify:









Some of the information needs of people interested in social enterprise;
Information sources used by people interested in social enterprise;
Types of information created by people interested in social enterprise;
Perceptions of different levels of e-resource provision across library sectors;
The potential value of a web-based directory of information sources for social
enterprise;
A tentative framework for defining “collection” in the digital world;
The importance of librarian-publisher collaboration at a strategic level to address
common challenges and concerns;
The potential relevance of social enterprise approaches for library service provision.

The ideas which emerged from these initial interviews were used as a basis for designing
surveys for people involved in social enterprise and for library and information practitioners,
which aim to explore the wider applicability of these ideas.

7 STRAND 3: SURVEY FINDINGS
7.1 Introduction
This chapter summarises the results from two surveys conducted between July and October
2012. Invitations for one survey were sent to 338 library and information practitioners and 103
completed responses were received (30.5% response rate). Invitations to the second survey
were sent to 445 people interested in social enterprise, including academics, policymakers and
social enterprise practitioners, and 46 completed responses were received (10.3% response
rate). The final version of the survey for library and information practitioners is shown in
Appendix 11 and the final survey for people interested in social enterprise is included in
Appendix 12.
These surveys incorporated ideas which had emerged from the Strand 3 interviews and aimed
to answer the following research questions:
2. How is the library collection for social enterprise used?
3. What are the characteristics of the self-described information seeking behaviour of
people interested in social enterprise?
4. What are stakeholders’ perceptions of library and information collections and
terminology?
5. What does this study suggest about the wider issues relating to library and information
collections in the digital world?
6. What constitutes the concept of the library collection in the digital world?
This chapter summarises and discusses the responses received for each survey question,
focusing first on the library and information practitioner survey and then on the social
enterprise survey, mainly using descriptive statistics. Percentages are reported to one decimal
point. All results are given out of the total number of survey responses (103 or 46) unless a
lower total number is explicitly stated, which indicates that not all respondents replied to a
particular question. Fisher’s Exact test has been used to identify statistically significant
differences between library and information practitioners and people interested in social
enterprise in response to variables which appeared in both surveys.
7.2 Library and information practitioner survey: summary of results
7.2.1 Background information, demographics and library types
103 completed responses were received for the library and information practitioner survey, a
response rate of 30.5%. 38 (36.9%) of the respondents were male and 64 (62.1%) were female.
One person chose not to answer this first question. 45 respondents (43.7%) were 25-44, 57
(55.3%) were 45-64 and 1 (1%) was 65 or over. The numbers of responses from different
library types are shown in Figure 7.2.1a. It should be noted that the “National library”
193

respondents were all employed by a single library. Two respondents selected multiple sectors;
one selected “Public library”, “Special library” and “Other”, specifying “business library”; a
second respondent selected “Public library”, “Academic library” and “National library”. A third
respondent, replying to an invitation sent to national library professionals identified “Public
library” in response to the sector question. This suggests that there may be more fluidity in
some professionals’ perception of their sector than is usually considered to be the case. To
avoid including duplicate results when cross-tabulating responses on the basis of library sector,
the two responses which identified more than one sector have been allocated to a separate
category of “Multi-sector”.

7.2.2 Collection terminology
Overwhelmingly, the preferred definition of “collection” (question B1) was “A group of
materials on a subject or theme” which 84 respondents (81.6%) ranked first (1 respondent
(1.0%) chose not to select any first rank options). This was the preferred first rank option
across all library sectors, chosen by between 75% (39 public librarians) and 100% (3 health, 2
special and 2 multi-sector librarians) respondents from each sector.
To give a broader picture of generally favourable ranking choices for the remaining definitions,
responses for ranking options 1, 2 and 3 (out of 8) have been combined in Figure 7.2.2a,
although it should be noted that declining numbers of respondents chose to specify
preferences at each consecutive rank (at rank 1, 1 person did not reply, at rank 2, 6 people
chose not to reply and at rank 3, 10 did not respond). Using this approach, “Provision of access
to resources” and “A set of results created through searching” emerge as the second and third
most popular definitions in these top three ranks.

Figure 7.2.2a: Definitions of collection.
22 respondents also suggested a range of alternative definitions of “collection”. 6 focused on
the idea of selecting or gathering together resources for a particular purpose: “A purposeful
195

selection”. 3 suggested collection was a systematic arrangement of resources, with 2 further
respondents linking collection to sets:
“A set of print-based and electronic information resources that exist dynamically
(managed, expanded, preserved for the future) to serve a certain purpose (teaching,
learning, research or social & cultural enrichment)”
“a coherent and linked set of data”
4 identified the idea of collection with ownership or acquisition by or from a particular
individual or organisation (3) or with the view that “…it is important that every collection is
unique to a particular insitution” [sic]. Finally, 2 respondents identified collection as the
totality of a library’s holdings, perhaps echoing interview findings about collection as a whole.
Library and information practitioners were also asked to indicate which terms they use to refer
to the resources they provide (B3, Figure 7.2.2b). “Stock” was the most popular term for public
librarians (45, 86.5%). It was also the second most popular term for academic librarian
respondents (26, 78.8%), behind “collection” (28, 84.8%) and only just ahead of “holdings” (25,
78.8%). “Other” terms included: “archives”; “Items, resources”; “Learning resources”; “online
resources”; “tend to say display or books for a collection of materials”.

Figure 7.2.2b: Library resources – terms used.
There appeared to be noticeable differences between sectors in some of the terms used. For
example, “stock” was used by 86.5% of public librarians, and 100% of multi-sector

196

respondents, but only by 5 (45.5%) respondents from a national library. “Sources of evidence”
was used only by 2 (66.7%) health librarians and 1 (1.9%) public librarian.
7.2.3 Libraries and social enterprise
In response to question C1, 85 out of 102 respondents (83.3%) indicated that they had heard
of social enterprise; this included both “Multi” sector respondents, 10 of “National library”
(90.9%) respondents; 45 of the public library respondents (86.5%); 25 of the academic library
respondents (78.1%); 2 of the health library respondents (66.7%) and 1 of the special library
respondents (50% ). This suggests a slightly greater awareness of the term in a national library
and in public libraries.
In C2, 65 out of 102 respondents (63.7%) agreed or strongly agreed that they understood what
social enterprise meant – suggesting a gap between having an awareness of the term and
having an understanding the concept. This included 36 public library respondents (69.2%) and
19 academic library respondents (59.4%), again suggesting that public library participants were
marginally more familiar with the term than academic librarians.
80 (77.7%) agreed or strongly agreed that they had heard the term in the media, including 25
academic librarians (75.8%) and 40 public librarians (76.9%). 53 (51.5%) agreed or strongly
agreed that had heard the term in their library or information service or in their parent
organisation, including 12 academic librarians (36.4%) and 27 (51.9%) of the public librarians;
26 (25.2%) agreed or strongly agreed that it was a field in which they had a personal interest
(including 8 (24.2%) of academic librarians and 12 (23.1%) of public librarians).
The UK government’s definition of social enterprise was displayed before question D1 and
responses to the statement “Having read the definition, I understand what ‘social enterprise’
means” indicated an increase in numbers of respondents agreeing or strongly agreeing that
they understood the term (Figure 7.2.3a) with 92 people (89.3%) indicating that they
understood the term.

Figure 7.2.3b: Library resources for social enterprise and perceived use.
A clear majority of respondents (75, 72.8%) agreed or strongly agreed that their library holds
physical materials relevant to social enterprise, including 22 academic librarians (66.7%) and
39 public librarians (75%). Slightly fewer respondents (71, 68.9%) agreed or strongly agreed
that their library provides access to electronic resources relevant to social enterprise, including
24 (72.7%) academic librarians and 33 (63.5%) public librarians. This may suggest a possible
difference in format orientation between the academic and public library sectors: public
198

librarians appear marginally more likely to identify potentially relevant resources in print
rather than in digital formats.
Numbers of respondents agreeing or strongly agreeing that their libraries contained relevant
resources appeared to be noticeably higher than perceptions of social enterprise as an area of
interest for users. Less than half of respondents (46, 44.7%) agreed or strongly agreed that
social enterprise is an area of interest for their customers, including 19 academic librarians
(57.6%) and 20 public librarians (38.5%).
Some sectoral differences in perceived levels of use by people with different types of interest
in social enterprise were apparent. 49 out of 102 (48%) agreed or strongly agreed that their
library is used by people studying or researching social enterprise, including 23 (69.7%)
academic librarians, 16 (31.4%) public librarians and 9 (81.8%) national library respondents. In
contrast, the 40 (38.8%) who agreed or strongly agreed that their library is used by people who
run social enterprises, included 23 (44.2%) public librarians compared to only 9 (27.3%)
academic librarians. 6 (54.6%) responses from a national library also identified use by people
running social enterprises.
A lower proportion of respondents 26 (27.2%) agreed or strongly agreed that their library is
used by people interested in social enterprise, but that the reason for their interest is
unknown. This included similar proportions of respondents from both academic and public
library sectors: 8 (24.2%) academic librarians and 13 (25%) public librarians. Again, there was
also a higher level of agreement amongst national library respondents (5, 45.5%).
Similarly low proportions of respondents (24, 23.3%) agreed or strongly agreed that their
library is used by people involved in policy making related to social enterprise. This included 7
(21.2%) academic librarians, 11 (21.2%) public librarians and a higher proportion of national
librarians (5, 45.5%).
In question D2, library and information practitioners were asked to indicate their perceptions
of the relative importance of different information sources for people interested in social
enterprise (Figure 7.2.3c). Personal networks were most frequently described as very
important or essential (83 respondents out of 102 (81.4%)) followed closely by websites.
Libraries were moderately well-rated, with 59 respondents (57.3%) describing them as very
important or essential, ahead of Google.

Figure 7.2.3c: Importance of social enterprise information sources.
Responses between sectors seemed to follow similar patterns. The most noticeable difference
appeared to be in the replies regarding Audio Visual material including eg YouTube. These
were seen as very important by only 12 (23.1%) public librarians and 10 (30.3%) academic
librarians, compared to 7 national library librarians (63.6%).
In response to question D3, 15 library and information practitioners described other potential
sources of information including:











government information(including electoral registers), government departments and
local or regional support organisations (4);
“blogs”;
“subscription only electronic reference materials”;
“networking” / “existing partnerships”;
“workshops”;
“professional bodies of which they are members”;
“archival materials”;
“Working papers, dissertations and theses”;
“Data and opinions on and from users of the social enterprise”;
“Case studies, if not already included in journals, reports”.

One respondent used this space to indicate difficulty answering the first question in this
section: “being a public library we do not ask why people use us.”

analysis processes. Responses are shown in Figure 7.2.4.

Figure 7.2.4: Library perspectives on communities and community analysis.
Generally, responses appeared to follow similar patterns across all sectors. Most respondents
92 (89.3%) agreed or strongly agreed that they have a good understanding of the community
their library or information service serves and 90 (87.4%) agreed or strongly agreed that their
library or information service serves multiple varied communities.
However, there appeared to be a considerable gap between respondents’ perceptions of their
understanding of the communities they serve, and their confidence in the potential of
community analysis to facilitate the identification of communities for emerging fields. Only 49
out of 102 respondents (48.0%) agreed or strongly agreed that communities of practice are
considered when analysing the community served by their service, including 14 (42.4%)
academic librarians and 21 (40.4%) public librarians. 54 out of 102 respondents (52.9%) agreed
or strongly agreed that communities of interest are considered; this time including a slightly
higher proportion of public librarians 26 (50%) compared to 15 (45.5%) academic librarians.
Only 35 out of 102 (34.3%) agreed or strongly agreed that community analysis enables them to
identify emerging areas such as social enterprise, although responses from public librarians
(19, 36.5%) and a national library (7, 70%) were slightly more positive than those from other
sectors (including 8 (24.2%) academic librarians).
Public librarians were also more likely to agree or strongly agree that they only have access to
basic demographic information when conducting community analysis: 21 (40.4%) public
201

librarians compared to 33 out of 102 (32.4%) overall, 7 (21.2%) academic librarians and 2 (20%)
national librarians.
51 respondents – 17 academic librarians, 1 health librarian, 1 multi sector respondent, 2
national librarians, 29 public librarians and 1 special librarian – indicated how they get
information about the community:


Statistical data – demographic or institutional (15). Two specifically mentioned the
MOSAIC resource;
Surveys / focus groups (13);
Anecdote / staff knowledge / networking (13);
Academic liaison / staff and students statistics (12);
Media, current awareness or “daily alerts” (5).

One respondent said “We should do more work to find out about our users” and another
concluded “With great difficulty these days. Community need is not the motivator of service
provision currently”.
7.2.5 Collection documentation

compared with much lower proportions of responses from other sectors: 10 (19.2%) public
librarians and 9 (27.3%) academic librarians.

202

“Other” responses (2 from academic librarians, 1 from a national library librarian and 5 from a
public librarian) included:

2 indicating that policies are currently being developed;
1 referring to staff experience;
1 mentioning stock plans for individual libraries and areas;
1 referring to “Organisational long-term vision and strategies”;

In response to question F2, 37 respondents out of 97 (38.1%) indicated that their policy
documentation was most recently updated between 2007-2010 (Figure 7.2.5b).

203

Further questions in section F3 asked library and information practitioners to give their
opinions about the purpose of collection policy documents – responses are summarised in
Figure 7.2.5c.
Most respondents agreed or strongly agreed that collection policy documentation is “A
working document setting out how we approach practical problems managing the collection”
(82 out of 101 (81.2%)), suggesting that a primary use for a policy is in supporting staff carrying
out activities relating to the collection.
A majority of respondents also felt that collection policy documentation assisted in
communicating with users about the collection. 75 out of 101 (74.3%) thought the document
acted as “A statement about the current level of service provided by our collection”, and 67
out of 101 (66.3%) described it as “A statement about our aspirations for the level of service
provided by our collection”. 62 out of 100 (62%) respondents felt that collection policy
documents are “A tool for managing expectations”, although a much smaller proportion (26
out of 102 (25.5%)) saw policies as a positive way “to promote the collection to our users”.
Only 18 out of 101 (17.8%) agreed or strongly agreed that collection policy documentation is
“A detailed description of collection policy in individual subject areas, including topics such as
social enterprise”.
Patterns of responses to these questions seemed to be similar across the different library
sectors.
22 respondents – including 6 academic librarians, 1 health librarian, 2 national library
librarians, 12 public librarians and 1 special librarian – indicated other reasons for having policy
documentation including:








Consistency (5);
Quality, performance or budget management (8);
Tool for succession planning, staff training and for continuity (3);
“There are various collection policies, but formal subject policy documentations /
collection statements have fallen out of favour and are no longer required on a regular
basis”;
“A statement of support required from other parts of the organisation; a 'visionary'
purpose to motivate and anticipate change; a plan for cooperation and collaboration
with other organisations; providing clarity and transparency for our users and general
public (not quite the same as promotion)”;
“if we had one it would show the purpose of having a Library!”

7.2.6 Library and collection activities
Question G1 asked for views about the relative importance of a range of activities relating to
the library collection (Figure 7.2.6). “In-library access to e-resources” appeared to be
marginally more popular than “In-library access to print”.

Figure 7.2.6: Importance of collection activities
There were noticeable differences between library sectors in a number of these questions.
Public libraries were more likely to rate as very important or essential “Lending printed
materials” (49 (94.2%)), “Providing in-library access to computers” (48 (92.3%)), or “Providing
opportunities for people to meet each other” 32 (62.7%) compared to academic librarians (30
(90.9%), 28 (84.8%) and just 6 (18.2%), respectively).
In contrast, academic librarians were more likely to rate as very important or essential
“Providing remote desktop access to electronic resources” (33 (100%)), “Providing in-library
access to electronic resources” (32 (97.0%) or “Providing in-library access to print materials”
(31 (93.9%) compared to public librarians (44 (84.6%), 45 (86.5%), 44 (84.6%) respectively).
There were sectoral differences in responses relating to preservation activities – between 9
(81.8%) and 10 (90.9%) national library respondents described preservation activities as very
important or essential, compared to between 15 (29.4%) and 22 (43.1%) public library
respondents. A higher proportion of public library respondents (20 (33.3%)) than academic
library respondents (9 (27.3%)) prioritised preserving informally published customer
publications.
205

24 respondents indicated other collection activities which they considered at least as
important as those listed above. These included:





Information literacy and information skills training (5);
Outreach / social inclusion activities (4);
Supporting advice services (business advice / careers advice) (2);
Remote access (2).

Figure 7.2.7: Attitudes to collection evaluation and deselection.
A slightly higher proportion of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that e-resources should
be reviewed and or deselected, compared to print resources. The responses followed similar
patterns between different library sectors, although “pressure to deselect materials to provide
more space” appeared to be a greater issue for academic librarians, 29 (87.9%) of whom
agreed or strongly agreed with this statement, compared to 31 (59.6%) public librarians.
91 (89.2%) out of 102 agreed or strongly agreed with the statement “I think collection
evaluation and deselection is an integral part of effective collection development and
management”, including 30 (90.9%) academic librarians and 49 (94.2%) public librarians,
compared to just 5 out of 10 (50%) national library librarians, suggesting the lower priority
given to review and deselection by a national library. In contrast, only 50 (49%) out of 102
respondents agreed or strongly agreed that “My library or information service carries out a
thorough review of the collection annually, including deselecting material”. This seems to
suggest a gap between agreement with the principle of evaluation and deselection (and
206

awareness of library policy relating to this) and the existence of retention schedules or routine
annual reviews of the collection to operationalise these principles. However, this apparent
contrast may be a consequence of the quite specific wording of the first two statements,
focusing as they do on retention schedules for particular types of materials and on the process
of annual review, rather than similarly regular but less frequent reviews.

Figure 7.2.8a: Attitudes to interdisciplinary subjects and relevant materials.
Health librarians (3 (100%) and national library librarians (8 out of 10 (80%)) seemed to be
more likely to agree or strongly agree that their information service had systems to identify
new areas of customer interest than either academic or public librarians (13 (39.4%) and 15
(28%) respectively). Public librarians less frequently agreed or strongly agreed that
“Interdisciplinary subjects are an increasing focus for my customers”, with only 9 (17.3%)
choosing these options, compared to 29 (87.9%) academic librarians, 2 (66.7%) health
librarians and 7 out of 10 (70%) national library librarians. A less pronounced difference
between the sectors was also noticeable in responses to the statement “There are relatively
new interdisciplinary subjects for which we currently actively collect”. Again, a lower
207

proportion of public librarians agreed or strongly agreed with this statement (8 (15.4%))
compared to academic librarians (22 (66.7%), health librarians (2 (66.7%)) and national
librarians (7 out of 10 (70%))
Responses to the other statements seemed to follow similar patterns across all library sectors.
In particular, most respondents from all sectors (74 out of 102 (72.5%) agreed or strongly
agreed that relevant materials for emerging interdisciplinary subjects were likely to exist in the
library’s collection.
Question H2 (Figure 7.2.8b) asked about methods of selecting materials for interdisciplinary
subjects such as social enterprise.

Figure 7.2.8b: Methods of selection for interdisciplinary subjects.
There appeared to be similar patterns of responses between sectors for selection based on
customer suggestions and selection by parent organisation specialists. Reading lists and
selection by the library were the two most popular responses for academic librarians (31
(93.9%) and 30 (90.9%) respectively), contrasted with customer suggestions (39, 75.0%) and
supplier selection (33 (63.5%)) which were the two most popular selection methods for public
librarians. PDA was selected by 18 (54.5%) academic librarians, a higher proportion than in any
other sector. Selection based on region or country was more popular with national library
librarians (10 (90.9%)), as was selection from legal deposit materials (9 (81.8%)).

208

Question H3 (Figure 7.2.8c) asked about methods for exploiting collections for emerging
interdisciplinary subjects. The option most commonly ranked first was to improve search tools
(42 rank 1 selections (42.9%)) followed by gathering these together virtually (25 (25.5%)).

Figure 7.2.9: Freely available web-based materials.
Across all sectors 80 (77.7%) agreed or strongly agreed with providing links from somewhere
other than the library catalogue, such as subject guides – this included half or more
respondents from each individual sector. 69 (67%) agreed or strongly agreed with providing
links from the catalogue to freely available web-based resources, such as PDFs – this included a
majority of all respondents from each sector.
The biggest contrast between sectors related to permissions’ based archiving. 10 (90.9%)
national library librarians agreed or strongly agreed with this approach, compared to only 21
(63.6%) academic librarians and 8 (15.4%) public librarians.
This seems to indicate quite a high level of agreement with providing access to such materials
by including links from the catalogue, or from another location, but much lower levels of
agreement about the library’s potential role in archiving such materials.
21 respondents gave suggestions about how access could be provided to these materials,
including:








Lecturers including them on reading lists or in VLEs (5);
Linking to them from the library website (4);
Subject portals (2);
Ingest and create catalogue records on the basis of legal deposit legislation (voluntary
or statutory deposit) (2);
“Link to copy in another repository; subscribe to a service that aggregates and
preserves such material”;
“small sets [...] created and provided by user groups – not just library staff”;
“They should be subject to the same level of scrutiny as purchased resources when
assessing them for inclusion in a collection”;
210



“Public libraries do not have staff resources to do anything except support customers
searching for this material. Not part of our core purpose”.

7.2.10 Final comments
7 respondents made additional final comments, including:
“I think collection management as a whole gets lost in libraries. Parts of it are carried
out regularly but perhaps the overall thought of collections is lost at times but needs
to be kept in mind in order to help manage budgets, increase customer useage [sic]
and plan for the future.”
“Increasingly collection management in public libraries is being removed from the
control of staff and handed over to suppliers and/or automated systems. It makes a
response to a rapidly changing information environment virtually impossible.”
“We don’t experience much call for information from or about social enterprises, but
we have some resources which might be useful (similar to our small business
resources). It would be a small part of our overall information provision to the general
public.”
7.2.11 Library and Information Practitioner survey: conclusions
These results suggest some support for the idea of “collection-as-thing”, “collection-asprocess” and “collection-as-access”. The analysis shows how the use of terminology to
describe library resources, approaches to collection policies and activities such as collection
evaluation and deselection, and prioritisation of different types of services varies between
different sectors.
There also appear to be some contradictions – or gaps – in these results: respondents believe
they have a good understanding of their communities, but feel they lack effective systems to
identify emerging areas of interest; collection review and potential deselection are viewed as
important for both print and electronic resources, but only a minority of respondents report
undertaking such reviews on an annual basis; and, although collection policy documents
appear to be seen as useful in supporting practical problem-solving in relation to the
collection, a small minority of libraries report not having such a document.
7.3 Social enterprise survey: summary of results
7.3.1 Background, demographics and respondent roles
46 completed responses were received for this survey, a response rate of 10.3%. 24
respondents (52.2%) were male, 21 (45.7%) were female and one did not reply to this question
(A1). 1 respondent (2.2%) was aged 24 or under, 20 (43.5%) were 25-44, 23 (50%) were 45-64
and 1 (2.2%) was over 65. One person selected “no answer” for this question.
211

Over half of the respondents (26 (56.5%)) described themselves as social enterprise
practitioners (Figure 7.3.1a). A significantly higher proportion of academics or researchers
responded to the survey: 11 out of 37 (29.7%), compared with 26 out of 351 invitations sent to
social enterprise practitioners (7.4%). The academics / researchers included 3 postgraduate
research students, 7 university lecturers and 1 university professor. Although no respondents
chose to describe themselves as policy makers, two described themselves as having roles
within local authorities: “Economic Development Officer” and “Local Authority Regeneration
Delivery”. Other roles cited included “business support” / “Specialist Business Advisor”; “CSR
professional”, “manager”, “social entrepreneur” and “Interested in Social Enterprise”. One
respondent gave their role as “Other”, but did not specify what this was.

interest in social enterprise, including 4 relating to providing business support and 2 describing
involvement in a social enterprise or in renewable energy.
7.3.2 Information needs
Question B1 asked about people’s information needs relating to concepts and background
topics for social enterprise. Information about the social impact of social enterprise was
ranked as essential or very important by 41 respondents (89.1%) (Figure 7.3.2a). Apparent
differences were found between academics, practitioners and “other” respondents in relation
to their needs for information about research, which was more frequently identified as very
important or essential by academics (11, 100%), than by “other” respondents (3, 33.3%) or
social enterprise practitioners (13, 50%). Similarly, differences were apparent in responses
relating to a need for statistics about regional levels of social enterprise activity, which were
more frequently identified as very important or essential by academics (9, 81.8%) and by
“other” respondents (7, 77%) than by social enterprise practitioners (14, 53.8%).

enterprise was either essential or very important (Figure 7.3.2b). In these responses,
differences were apparent between academics, practitioners and “other” respondents in
relation to their needs for information about invitations to tender for public service contracts,
which were more frequently identified as very important or essential by “other” respondents
(8, 88.9%) and practitioners (18, 69.2%) than by academics (4, 36.4%).

7.3.3 Information sources
C1 asked about people’s perceptions of the relative importance of information sources for
social enterprise. Google and websites were both most frequently rated very important or
essential (37 (80.4%)), followed by personal networks, rated as very important or essential by
34 (73.9%) (Figure 7.3.3). Libraries were least well rated, with 15 respondents (32.6%)
describing them as essential or very important. This contrasts with the responses to the same
question in the library and information practitioner survey, where libraries were more
frequently regarded as an essential or very important information source than Google.
There appeared to be different patterns of responses from different groups of respondents.
Academics more frequently described as very important or essential books (print or electronic)
(10, 90.9%), journals (print or electronic) (11, 100%) and libraries (7, 63.6%). In comparison,
these were only rated very important or essential by 13 (50%), 10 (38.5%) and 6 (23.1%)
practitioners, respectively.

7.3.4 Creating and sharing information
In response to question D1, social enterprise practitioners most frequently described creating
business plans (21 out of 26 practitioners (80.8%)) and reports (19 (73%)) (Figure 7.3.4a). 8
academics or researchers indicated that they create journal articles, followed by 6 academics
or researchers who described creating reports. Differences were apparent between academics,
practitioners and “other” respondents in relation to both contracts (which “other”
respondents (6, 66.7%) and practitioners (13, 50%) more frequently described creating than

216

academics (1, 9.1%)) and journal articles, which academics (8, 72.7%) more frequently

report sharing information through formal publication (eg in a book or journal) (7 (63.6%)),
compared to 2 (22.2%) “other” respondents and 5 (19.2%) practitioners.
“Other” respondents also seemed to prefer sharing information using new technologies: 8

websites, compared to just 2 (18.2%) academics. 6 (66.7%) “others” and 14 (53.8%)
practitioners share materials through social media, compared to just 1 (9.1%) academic whilst
“other” respondents were also more likely to share materials on a blog (4 (44.4%)), compared
to 4 (15.4%) practitioners.

7.3.5 Social enterprise and libraries
Question E1 asked about respondents’ views of libraries (Figure 7.3.5a). Although considerable
numbers of these respondents report having access to public or academic libraries, and fewer
agree that they have access to a national library, only a minority agree that they have used
libraries for information about social enterprise and most of those who have were academics
or researchers. These responses also contrast with responses to similar questions from the
library and information practitioner survey. In that survey, 71 (68.9%) and 75 (72.8%) of
respondents respectively indicated that their library provided electronic resources or physical
materials relevant to social enterprise.
However, only 13 out of 45 (28.9%) social enterprise survey respondents agreed or strongly
agreed libraries provide access to relevant materials, with similar patterns of responses from
all groups (4 (36.4%) academics and researchers, 7 out of 25 (28%) 25 social enterprise
practitioners, and 2 (22.2%) “other”).

Figure 7.3.5a: Social enterprise perceptions of libraries.
There were noticeable differences between responses from academics regarding their use of
libraries, compared to other groups of respondents. They were much more likely to agree or
strongly agree that they have access to an academic library (11 (100%)), or to a national library
(7 (63.6%)); that they had used a library website for social enterprise information (9 (81.8%))
or often use libraries for work-related information (7 (63.6%)); and that they have used a
library for social enterprise information (6 (54.5%)). In comparison, only 3 out of 25 (12%)
social enterprise practitioners and 1 (11.1%) “other” often use libraries for work information.
In E2 respondents were asked which libraries they had used to access information about social
enterprise (Figure 7.3.5b). 16 (61.5%) social enterprise practitioners and 6 (66.7%) “other”
respondents indicated that they had never used a library for this type of information, an
option not selected by any academics. However, 8 (30.8%) practitioners, 2 (18.2%) academics
and 2 (22.2%) “other” had used a public library to access social enterprise information. All 11
academics and researchers had used an academic library to access information about social
enterprise, compared to only 1 (3.8%) social enterprise practitioner. 6 (54.5%) academics had
used a national library, compared to 2 (7.7%) practitioners. One respondent entered “Other”:
“none”. In response to question E3, 13 out of 23 (56.5%) were satisfied or very satisfied by the
service they received from the library they used most recently.

Figure 7.3.5b: Importance of library activities
The respondents to the social enterprise survey gave a higher priority to the provision of
information for social enterprise than library and information practitioners gave in their
220

responses to this question. 9 (81.8%) academics rated this very important or essential,
together with 12 out of 25 (48%) social enterprise practitioners and 3 out of 8 (37.5%) “other”
respondents.
Another interesting contrast between the two surveys is the higher proportion of respondents
who viewed preservation as a very important or essential collection activity (30 out of 44
(68.2%) for print, 28 out of 44 (63.6%) for digital), compared to 54 out of 102 library and
information practitioners (52.9%) giving that priority to preservation of print and 48 out of 102
(47.1%) to preservation of digital items. The responses from people interested in social
enterprise also appeared to include a lower proportion of essential to very important
collection activities, compared to responses from the library and information practitioner
survey.
Different patterns of responses were apparent between academics, practitioners and “other”
respondents, with academics being more likely to regard as very important or essential the
provision of remote access to electronic resources (10 (90.9%)) and lending printed materials
(9 (81.8%)), compared to social enterprise practitioners (18 out of 25 (72%) and 16 out of 25
(64%), respectively) or “other” respondents (6 out of 8 (75%) and 6 out of 9 (66.7%)).
Academics also tended to place greater onus on preservation activities: both preservation of
formally printed materials and digital materials were rated as very important or essential by 10
(90.9%), compared to practitioner responses (17 out of 25 (68%) for preservation of printed
material and 15 out of 25 (60%) for digital preservation) and 3 out 8 (37.5%) “other”
respondents for both printed and digital preservation questions.
Practitioners and “other” were more likely to regard provision of computers in libraries as very
important or essential library services (16 out of 25 (64%) and 6 out of 9 (66.7%), respectively)
compared to academics (5 (45.5%)). In-library access to electronic resources were rated very
important or essential by similar proportions of academics (8 (72.7%)), social enterprise
practitioners (19 out of 25 (76%)) and “other” respondents (7 (77.8%)).
18 respondents went on to provide suggestions about potential library activities which would
be at least as useful as those outlined above including:





Hosting events and providing facilities for meetings (6);
Provide information in the formats users need (6), including e-newsletters; “with
books becoming more of the decor”; “provide easy access to academic research
papers that are normally restricted to university students”;
“Be more proactive about what they can offer”;
221



“Help promote standard classifications / terminology to be used by content providers
when indexing material. Google is great for searching. But the data is has to work with
is largely unstructured.”

7.3.6 Collections
17 respondents answered question F1 by listing collections of information to which they have
access. These included:







Personal collections, including electronic files (2);
Email updates and newsletters (2);
Two subscription resources (2);
Libraries including an “online library” and a home library (3);
The web (1);
Too many to detail or too time-consuming to answer (2).

The rankings of definitions of collection (Figure 7.3.6) seem to follow the same pattern as
those provided by library and information practitioners. An overwhelming majority of people
(98 (96.1%) library and information practitioners and 37 (80.4%) social enterprise respondents)
ranked “A group of materials on a subject or theme” as their Rank 1, 2 or 3 definitions. For
both social enterprise and library and information practitioner respondents, this was followed
by “Provision of access to resources” (49 (47.6%) library and information practitioners; 24
(52.2%) social enterprise survey respondents) and “A set of results created by searching” (38
(36.9%) library and information practitioners; 20 (43.5%) social enterprise survey respondents)
as the second and third most popular Rank 1, 2 or 3 definitions, respectively. However, the
order of fourth and fifth most popular Rank 1, 2 or 3 definitions differed between the two sets
of responses. For respondents to the social enterprise survey, “A group of sub-groups” was the
fourth most popular Rank 1, 2 or 3 definition, followed by “A thing / a store” (fifth). In the
library and information practitioner survey, this order was reversed.
These definition choices seemed to follow similar patterns for all groups of social enterprise
survey respondents.

Figure 7.3.6: Definitions of collection.
4 respondents provided other definitions of “collection” including:





“A file of relevant / related information”;
“A group of related items stored systematically”;
“A number of interrelated objects or materials compiled, collated or available in an
easily [accessible] format or place”;
“Accessible resources connected by topic”.

5 respondents provided final comments including:
“Libraries need a complete brand revamp and spread their age-group attraction / use.
They need to be resited on co-located sites/premises and turn up the volume! Busy =
noisy.”
“Has raised issues in my mind of what relevant information might be available in my
local/regional library.”
“Makes me realise how irrelevant libraries have perhaps become with advent of
google. But sadder that we have a massive waste of resources going into dozens of
agencies trying to make a living out of a fairly simple concept – and actually getting in
the way of simpler access to the key source data.”

223

7.3.7 Social enterprise survey: conclusions
The social enterprise survey responses seem to support some of the ideas developed in the
Strand 3 interviews with people interested in social enterprise. In particular, these results
illustrate the types of information needs experienced by people involved in social enterprise as
well as highlighting differences between the information needs of people in different roles,
such as social enterprise practitioners, academics / researchers or others.
Social enterprise survey respondents described their preferred sources of information for
topics relating to social enterprise as Google, websites and personal contacts; with libraries
being seen as very important or essential by the smallest number of respondents. People
described creating a range of different types of information, and sharing these through
personal networks. Respondents indicated low expectations that libraries would be able to
provide materials relevant to social enterprise and most report not having used a library for
information relating to social enterprise. A significant minority of respondents do not regard
public libraries as being positively accessible to them, with lower levels of perceived
accessibility recorded for other types of library, including academic and national libraries.
Social enterprise survey respondents describe collections of material in both electronic and
print format (although more provide examples of electronic collections). Their choice of
definitions of collection also seem to support ideas generated in the strand 3 interviews of
“collection-as-thing”, “collection-as-access” and “collection-as-process”.
7.4 Comparing the survey responses
34 identical variables were included in both the library and information practitioner survey and
the social enterprise survey. These were in three question groups:




Perceived importance of information sources for social enterprise;
Perceived importance of library activities;
Definitions of collection.

The responses to these questions were extracted from the two original datasets and were
combined in a new SPSS file, identifying each response as being from either a library and
information practitioner or from a social enterprise survey respondent. Fisher’s Exact test was
then applied to identify any statistically significant differences between responses from each
survey. Statistically significant differences were identified in responses to 18 of these
questions. Full frequency tables including Fisher’s Exact test p-values are shown in Appendix
22 (variables relating to information sources and library activities) and Appendix 23
(definitions of collection).
224

In the questions about the perceived importance of information sources for social enterprise,
8 statistically significant differences were identified, including 3 with a p-value of less than 1%
(suggesting highly statistically significant results):






Importance of libraries (Fisher's Exact test p=0.000) – more frequently regarded as
very important or essential by library and information practitioners than by social
enterprise survey respondents;
Importance of Google (Fisher's Exact test p=0.004) – more frequently regarded as very
important or essential by social enterprise survey respondents than by library and
information practitioners;
Importance of AV materials (Fisher's Exact test p=0.008) – more frequently regarded as
very important or essential by social enterprise survey respondents than by library and
information practitioners.

5 had a p-value of less than 5%, suggesting mildly statistically significant results:







Importance of personal networks (Fisher's Exact test p=0.011) – marginally more
frequently regarded as very important or essential by library and information
practitioners;
Importance of social media (Fisher's Exact test p=0.016);
Importance of news media (Fisher's Exact test p=0.020) – marginally more frequently
regarded as very important or essential by library and information practitioners;
Importance of journals (Fisher's Exact test p=0.042) – marginally more frequently
regarded as very important or essential by library and information practitioners;
Importance of datasets (Fisher's Exact test p=0.042) – marginally more frequently
regarded as very important or essential by library and information practitioners.

In the questions about the perceived importance of library activities, 9 statistically significant
differences were identified, including 7 with a p-value of less than 1%:








Information for social enterprise (Fisher's Exact test p=0.000) – more frequently
regarded as very important or essential by social enterprise survey respondents;
One-stop shop (Fisher's Exact test p=0.000);
Reference services (Fisher's Exact test p=0.000);
In-library access to computers (Fisher's Exact test p=0.000);
In-library access to e-resources (Fisher's Exact test p=0.000);
In-library access to print materials (Fisher's Exact test p=0.000);
Pleasant space (Fisher's Exact test p=0.001).

Apart from the first of these differences, all seemed to be due to the much higher levels of
“Essential” responses given by library and information practitioners. 2 had a p-value of less
than 5% suggesting mildly statistically significant differences; again, these differences seemed
to be due to higher levels of “Essential” responses given by library and information
practitioners:

225




Remote access to electronic resources (Fisher's Exact test p=0.022);
Lending printed materials (Fisher's Exact test p=0.034).

Finally, a mildly statistically significant difference (Fisher’s Exact test p=0.023) was identified
between library and information practitioner rank 1 collection definition response choices,
with relatively more library and information practitioners identifying the term with a “group of
materials” (84, 81.6%) compared to a lower proportion of social enterprise survey respondents
(26, 56.5%). Relatively more social enterprise survey respondents identified “collection” first
with “provision of access to resources” (6, 13%), or declined to rank a first choice definition (5,
10.9%). No other statistically significant differences were identified between the responses to
this question given by library and information practitioners and those received from the social
enterprise survey, suggesting that definitions of collection did not vary significantly between
the two surveys. This also suggests that, far from being perceived as library jargon (as
suggested in some of the Strand 3 interviews), there are useful shared understandings of the
term “collection” common to both sets of survey respondents.
7.5 Addressing the research questions
7.5.1 How is the library collection for social enterprise used?
The library and information practitioner surveys showed a generally high level of awareness of
social enterprise in libraries. 85 out of 102 respondents (83.3%) had heard of social enterprise,
although it should be emphasised that the survey invitations were targeted at people
providing business information services or supporting business subjects – this level of
awareness may therefore be assumed to be higher than that of library and information
practitioners in general, with slightly higher levels of awareness indicated by respondents from
a national library and from public libraries. 46 (44.7%) of library and information practitioners
agreed or strongly agreed that social enterprise was an area of interest for their customers,
with 75 (72.8%) agreeing or strongly agreeing that their library provides physical materials
relevant to the topic and 71 (68.9%) agreed or strongly agreed their library provides access to
relevant electronic resources.
Library and information practitioners had mixed perceptions about the levels of use of library
collections by people interested in social enterprise. 40 (38.8%) agreed or strongly agreed that
their library is used by people who run social enterprises, with differences in responses
between library sectors: 23 (44.2%) public librarians identified this type of use, compared to
just 9 (27.3%) academic librarians. Conversely, 49 out of 102 (48%) agreed or strongly agreed
that their library is used by people studying or researching social enterprise, again with a
difference between the sectors (23 (69.7%) academic librarians compared to 16 (31.4%) public
226

librarians). Fewer library and information practitioners agreed or strongly agreed that their
library was used by people involved in social enterprise policymaking (24, 23.3%); or that their
library was used by people whose reason for interest in social enterprise was unknown (26,
27.2%).
A very different perspective on the perceived availability of materials relevant to social
enterprise in library collections was provided by the social enterprise survey responses. Only
13 (28.9%) out of 45 agreed or strongly agreed that libraries provide access to materials
relevant to social enterprise. Despite the UK's statutory public library service, only 38 (84.4%)
out of 45 agreed or strongly agreed that they have access to a public library and only 16
(35.6%) out of 45 agreed or strongly agreed that they have access to a national library (eg the
British Library, National Library of Scotland or National Library of Wales). 24 (52.2%) agreed or
strongly agreed that they have access to an academic library. 10 (22.2%) out of 45 agreed or
strongly agreed that they have access to a specialist library or information service. Only 11
(24.4%) out of 45 agreed or strongly agreed that they often use libraries for finding workrelated information. This included 7 (63.6%) academics and researchers, 3 (12%) social
enterprise practitioners and 1 (11.1%) “other”. However, slightly more social enterprise survey
respondents agreed or strongly agreed that they have gone to a library to access information
about social enterprise (13 out of 44, 29.5%) including 6 (54.5%) academics, 6 (24%)
practitioners and 1 (12.5%) “other”. More respondents (15 out of 45, 33.3%) agreed or
strongly agreed that they have used a library website to access information about social
enterprise. This included 9 (81.8%) academics and researchers, 4 (16%) social enterprise
practitioners and 2 (22.2%) “other”.
8 (30.8%) practitioners, 2 (18.2%) academics and 2 (22.2%) “other” had used a public library to
access social enterprise information. All 11 academics and researchers had used an academic
library to access information about social enterprise, compared to only 1 (3.8%) social
enterprise practitioner. 6 (54.5%) academics had used a national library, compared to 2 (7.7%)
practitioners. 13 out of 23 (56.5%) were satisfied or very satisfied by the service they received
from the library they used most recently.
7.5.2 What are the characteristics of the self-described information seeking behaviour of
people interested in social enterprise?
The social enterprise survey asked about people's information needs relating to background or
conceptual topics. Respondents most frequently described information about the social impact
of social enterprise as being essential or very important (41, 89.1%). Funding for social
enterprise was most frequently described as being either an essential or very important topic
227

relating to the business activities of social enterprise on which information was needed (42,
91.3%).
In response to questions about the relative importance of various information sources, Google
and websites were both most frequently rated very important or essential (37 (80.4%)),
followed by personal networks, rated as very important or essential by 34 (73.9%). Libraries
were least well rated, with 15 respondents (32.6%) describing them as essential or very
important. Websites used by social enterprise survey respondents included government
websites, social enterprise or co-operative organisation websites or the website of the
Guardian (including its professional network for social enterprise).
Social enterprise practitioners most frequently described creating business plans (21 out of 26
practitioners (80.8%)) and reports (19, 73%), whilst 8 academics / researchers described
creating journal articles, followed by 6 academics / researchers who reported creating reports.
Information created by social enterprise survey respondents was most frequently shared
through personal networks (35, 76.1%).
Social enterprise survey respondents most frequently identified remote and in-library access
to electronic resources as either very important or essential (34 respondents (73.9%)),
followed by lending and in-library availability of printed materials. A higher proportion of social
enterprise respondents viewed preservation as a very important or essential collection activity
(30 (65.2%) for print, 28 (60.9%) for digital), compared to 42 library and information
practitioners (46.7%) who gave that priority to preservation of print and 36 (40%) to
preservation of digital items.
Social enterprise survey respondents also suggested a number of other potentially useful
activities which could be undertaken by library or information services, such as providing enewsletters; “provide easy access to academic research papers that are normally restricted to
university students”; “Help promote standard classifications / terminology to be used by
content providers when indexing material. Google is great for searching. But the data it has to
work with is largely unstructured.”
7.5.3 What are stakeholders’ perceptions of library and information collections and
terminology?
84 library and information practitioner respondents (81.6%) ranked the definition of collection
as “A group of materials on a subject or theme” first. Provision of access to resources was the
second most popular definition of collection at either rank 1, 2 or 3 (49, 48.0%), followed by "A
set of results created through searching" (38, 37.3%). Only a minority of library and
228

information practitioners (12, 11.8%) described collection as "Library jargon" in these first
three ranks. Alternative free-text definitions included:





"A purposeful selection";
“A set of print-based and electronic information resources that exist dynamically
(managed,
expanded, preserved for the future) to serve a certain purpose (teaching, learning,
research or social & cultural enrichment)”;
“a coherent and linked set of data”.

Differences were identified between library sector responses to alternative terms for library
resources, including “stock”, “content” and “sources of evidence”.
Social enterprise survey respondents identified personal collections including electronic files,
email updates and newsletters, subscription resources and the web. The most popular rank 1,
2, 3 options for defining collection followed the same pattern as the library and information
practitioner responses. However, there was a mildly statistically significant difference between
the two surveys in the first rank of definition choices: across all respondents, including those
who declined to identify a first rank choice, library and information practitioners more
frequently chose “group of materials” (84, 81.6%), compared with social enterprise survey
respondents (26, 56.5%), and more social enterprise survey respondents identified “collection”
with “provision of access to resources” (6, 13%), or declined to rank a first choice definition (5,
10.9%).
7.5.4 What does this study suggest about the wider issues relating to library and information
collections in the digital world?
Library and information practitioner responses to questions about community analysis
suggested a tension between the majority perception that they have a good understanding of
the community they serve (92 (89.3%) agreeing or strongly agreeing) and that their services
serve multiple varied communities (90 (87.4%) agreeing or strongly agreeing) compared to
much lower levels of responses agreeing or strongly agreeing (35 out of 102 (34.3%)) that
community analysis helps to identify emerging areas such as social enterprise. The impression
that identifying emerging areas is a challenge was supported in responses to a later question in
which only 39 (38.2%) out of 102 respondents agreed or strongly agreed that “My library or
information service has systems in place to identify new areas of customer interest”.
Respondents also indicated how they access information about their communities – two
referred specifically to the MOSAIC market segmentation database, whilst five mentioned
other resources, such as the media, current awareness or daily alerts.

229

Collection policy documents are not universally used, with 4 public librarians and 2 academic
librarians reporting that their organisation has no such document. However, 82 out of 101
(81.2%) agreed or strongly agreed that collection policy documentation is “A working
document setting out how we approach practical problems managing the collection”; 75 out of
101 (74.3%) agreed or strongly agreed that collection policy documentation is “A statement
about the current level of service provided by our collection”; 67 out of 101 (66.3%) agreed or
strongly agreed that collection policy documentation is “A statement about our aspirations for
the level of service provided by our collection”; 62 out of 100 (62%) agreed or strongly agreed
that collection policy documentation is “A tool for managing expectations”. Much smaller
proportions of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that collection policy documentation is
“A document to promote the collection to our users” (26 out of 102 (25.5%)) or “A detailed
description of collection policy in individual subject areas, including topics such as social
enterprise” (18 out of 101 (17.8%)).
In library access to e-resources was most frequently rated either very important or essential by
library and information practitioners (94, 91.3%), just ahead of providing in-library access to
print based materials. Generally, levels of importance attached to providing access to (or
preserving) materials seemed similar irrespective of whether the format was print or
electronic.
Similar proportions of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that resources should be
reviewed and potentially deselected on a regular basis whether electronic (98 out of 103,
95.1%) or print (92 out of 102, 90.2%). However, only 50 out of 102 (49%) reported that their
library carried out an annual review of the collection.
74 (72.5%) out of 102 agreed or strongly agreed that “For some emerging interdisciplinary
subjects, relevant materials already exist in the library's collection”, suggesting some support
for the idea of latent collections suggested by the interview findings. Respondents generally
ranked the use of digital technology for exploiting collections for emerging interdisciplinary
subjects more highly than physical responses – the option most commonly ranked first was to
improve search tools (42 rank 1 selections (42.9%)) followed by gathering these together
virtually (25 (25.5%)), and adding new descriptions for retrieval (12, 11.7%). However,
collecting items together physically was a preferred rank 1 option (10, 9.7%) to sharing user
recommendations or tags (9, 8.7%). Digitisation and text mining were also suggested as
alternative approaches.
Automated approaches to item selection from subjects such as social enterprise were reported
by a majority of public librarian respondents – 33 (63.5%) use supplier selection for this
230

material, compared to 39 (75.0%) using customer suggestions, or the use by academic libraries
of reading lists (31, 93.9%) or library specialist selection (30, 90.9%).However, academic
librarians also reported the use of automated selection systems in the form of Patron Driven
Acquisitions for e-books (18, 54.5%). Some general concerns about this trend towards
automated systems for material selection were raise by a public library respondent in a
concluding comment:
“Increasingly collection management in public libraries is being removed from the
control of staff and handed over to suppliers and/or automated systems. It makes a
response to a rapidly changing information environment virtually impossible.”
A high proportion of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that library and information
services should link to freely available web material (such as PDFs) either from the library
catalogue (69, 67%) or from somewhere else (80, 77.7%). A much smaller proportion agreed or
strongly agreed about the library's role in conducting permissions-based archiving, such as in
an institutional repository (41, 39.8%).
7.5.5 What constitutes the concept of the library collection in the digital world?
The pattern of definitions of collection offered by both library and information practitioners
and social enterprise survey respondents suggests some support for the idea of "collection-asthing" (a group of materials on a subject of theme), "collection-as-access" (provision of access
to resources) or "collection-as-process" (a set of results created by searching). However,
although there is some support for the groups of definitions identified in the Strand 3
interviews, it is noticeable that the apparent contrast between approaches to defining
collection, which suggested that library and information practitioners might favour definitions
relating collection to access and that people interested in social enterprise might favour
definitions based on subjects or themes, was not supported by the survey data. It seems
notable that the examples of collections cited by social enterprise survey respondents focused
more on electronic materials, such as electronic files and email updates, and included a
request for libraries to promote open access to scholarly articles.
Library and information practitioner responses suggest that collection activities relating to
print and electronic resources are viewed as equally important, although there are sectoral
differences. Use of terminology also differs between sectors, suggesting different concepts of
collection. For example the greater use of "stock" in public libraries may suggest more
emphasis on turnover of materials (circulation) as well as focusing attention on physical
resources. There seems to be a degree of ambivalence towards some key collection processes:
library and information practitioner respondents seem to attach importance to understanding
231

their communities, but only a minority feel they have effective systems for identifying new
areas of interest; collection policies are regarded as useful tools for approaching practical
problems relating to the collection, but not all libraries have such a policy; reviewing electronic
and printed resources for potential deselection is viewed as important, but only a minority of
libraries conduct such a review on an annual basis.
Some of these issues were summed up in one public librarian’s final comment:
“I think collection management as a whole gets lost in libraries. Parts of it are carried
out regularly but perhaps the overall thought of collections is lost at times but needs
to be kept in mind in order to help manage budgets, increase customer useage [sic]
and plan for the future.”
7.6 Conclusion
Although the two surveys described in this chapter received only a relatively low number of
responses, some interesting themes have emerged from these data. The survey responses
appear to provide some support for the idea that “collection” may be seen as the provision of
access to resources and a dynamic process (such as a set of results created by searching), as
well as a thematic group of materials or a thing. Sectoral differences in use of terminology and
views of library collection activities and processes have emerged from the analysis of library
and information practitioner survey responses. A clear contrast is apparent between library
and information practitioner perceptions of the comparative importance of libraries to Google
and the very different view of this provided by social enterprise stakeholders. Library and
information practitioners generally perceive there to be more relevant materials in their
collections than social enterprise survey respondents, whilst social enterprise survey
respondents also seem to attach greater importance to the preservation role of libraries than
library and information practitioners.

8 DISCUSSION
8.1 Introduction
This chapter discusses and synthesises findings from the three strands of this research. It
begins with a brief discussion of some terminological issues involved in the use of the word
“collection” and considers evidence from the research findings of differing sectoral approaches
to the use of this term, as well as the meanings attributed to it by non-library and information
practitioners. The term “collection” is reconsidered in comparison to other physical world
terms, such as “searching” and “sharing”, which have taken on new dimensions of meaning in
the digital world.
The chapter then explores a revised version of the collection themes introduced in Chapter 6
(collection-as-thing; collection-as-process; collection-as-access) using this as a basis for
discussion and introducing three models:


a table which links these concepts of collection to levels of strategic management to
suggest a new collection development hierarchy, followed by brief scenarios
describing how this could be used to inform practical decision-making and problemsolving in collection development and management in the digital world;



a diagram which attempts to depict some of the relationships between the concepts of
collection, which provides a basis for considering the role of collection in the digital
world from both librarian and user perspectives;



a diagram which depicts collection as adding or indicating context about content,
which explores links between collection in a library context and information behaviour
more broadly.

8.2 Terminology relating to library collections – sectoral differences and social enterprise
perspectives
The Strand 1 British Library case study and the Strand 3 surveys highlighted the range of
different terms which may be used instead of or as well as “collection” to describe library
resources. In the library and information practitioner survey “stock” was the most popular
term for library resources, chosen by 81 (78.6%) just ahead of “collection” (80 (77.7%)).
However, there were differences between library sectors, with “stock” being the most popular
term amongst public library practitioners and “collection” being the preferred term among
academic librarians. The Strand 1 analysis of British Library Annual Reports also highlighted a
similar contrast, with early reports featuring Lending Division sections which tended to use the
term “stock” and Reference Division sections which tended to use the term “collection”. In
233

more recent data collected as part of the Strand 1 British Library case study, the content
strategy review reflects a shift in terminology within the Library from “collection” to “content”.
Literature from the field of terminology studies, within applied linguistics, offers some insight
into the development and use of specialist terminologies within professions. Sager (1997: 25)
defines term formation as:
“the process of naming the concepts required by a particular special language
community for the development of cognitive processes and communication. It is a
conscious human activity and differs from the arbitrariness of general word formation
processes by its greater awareness of pre-existing patterns and models and of its social
responsibility for facilitating communication and the transmission of knowledge.”
Furthermore, term formation “always occurs in a particular environment” (Sager, 1997: 25) –
the examples given include the lab or workshop, but could easily be extended to include the
library (or the social enterprise).
Bowker (1997b) recommends a shift away from a prescriptive approach to terminology use
within special language communities, emphasising the value of new technology in identifying
multidimensional variations in how professionals and subject experts use their terms. Picton
(2008) explores how the changing frequency of use of term variants over time may indicate
the development of knowledge in a specialised field, drawing on specific examples from the
scientific field of space optics. Bowker (1997b) focuses on the use of “flatbed colour scanner”
compared to “colour flatbed scanner”, noting that both terms are used to emphasise different
dimensions of meaning. Bowker (1997b: 296) concludes:
“An expert may consciously choose to use one term to emphasize a particular
dimension at one time, and another term to focus on another dimension at another
time, even though both terms are referring to the same concept.”
Using the diagrammatic approach used by Bowker (1997b; 1997a), one possible depiction of
the variation between terms used to describe library resources is shown in Figure 8.2.
Bowker (1997a) describes the relationship between terminology and classification, as well as
summarising one explanation for abstract concept formation – shared characteristics are
identified in a number of concepts to establish abstract concepts. In examining the British
Library Annual Reports, the shifting use of terms associated with emerging technologies
suggests a move from more concrete to more abstract terms over time. For example,
“computer”, “computing” and “telecommunications” were widely used initially, but seem to
be displaced over time by broader more abstract terms, such as “electronic”, “digital” or

234

“information systems”, which focus on significant underlying aspects of how the technology
works, rather than on its specific manifestation.

Figure 8.2: Variations in dimensions of meaning: terms for library resources
Definitions of the specific term “collection” provided in the Strand 3 interviews proved to be
nuanced and sophisticated. The distinction suggested by Lee (2005: 80) between a librarian
and a user’s approach to the concept of collection as "that of management, and its emphasis
was on control” did not appear to be echoed in these interviews. Instead, definitions provided
by social enterprise practitioners, academics, publishers and library and information
practitioners all seemed to include elements of what Lee (2005: 80) referred to as “The users’
perspective... of access,... personal convenience and flexibility". Other specific criteria
identified by Lee were echoed in the interviews, including “instant availability” (Lee, 2005: 72),
“selectivity” (Lee, 2005: 72, 76), “subcollections” (Lee, 2005: 73), “Subject” and “Material
permanency” (Lee, 2005: 76), with lifeboat comparisons offered by two interviewees to
suggest the role of collection as a preserving container for material which might otherwise be
lost, and the importance of the process of selection by which materials are identified for
preservation.
Two of the three aspects of collections discussed in this chapter (collection-as-thing and
collection-as-process) echo distinctions made between meanings relating to “actions” and
“things” identified in previous analysis of other terms. The literature review (chapter 2)
highlighted social enterprise debates about the use of “enterprise” to describe an action
(Nicholls, 2006; Bornstein, 2007) or as a concrete noun referring to a type of organisation
(Pearce, 2003; Defourny and Nyssens, 2006; Teasdale, 2010). Buckland (1991) also explored
ideas of “information-as-thing” and “information-as-process” as well as “information-as235

knowledge” and information processing, summarising these ideas in terms of entity and
process and tangibility and intangibility. This is indicative of underlying linguistic connections
between the use of words to refer both to things and also to actions or activities.
8.2.1 Searching, sharing... collecting?
The rich and nuanced responses given by Strand 3 interviewees and survey respondents to
questions about the concept of collection, situating it in relation to both print and electronic
resources, suggests that the concept of collection remains useful in the digital as well as the
physical world. It is relevant both to library and information services and more generally
because of the breadth and sophistication of its potential meanings. Indeed, collection can be
seen as a fundamental human activity. In some ways the term seems to be similar to those
words which describe other real world activities which have become key parts of the emerging
vocabulary of the digital world, such as “searching” or “sharing”. Battelle (2006) traces the
dramatic implications of search technology for the development of the web and on wider
culture, commerce, society and politics, exemplified by the success of Google. Earlier articles
discuss the idea of search as a “quest” (Cohen and Meudell, 1968: 338; O'Connor, 1993: 214),
an activity “common throughout the animal kingdom” (Cohen and Meudell, 1968: 322) which,
in human terms, may take the form of a physical search for a material object, or a mental
search for an immaterial object (Cohen and Meudell, 1968: 338).
Belk (2010) examines ideas of sharing in different cultures throughout history, in relation to
gift-giving and forms of commercial exchange and as an expression of self, noting that social
media sites “have ushered in a new era of sharing that has quickly been embraced by millions”
(Belk, 2010: 715). Wittel (2011: 5) distinguishes between sharing of material and immaterial
objects, noting that “In the pre-digital age sharing is always mutual, always social, and always
based on the principle of generalised reciprocity” and concludes that “sharing in the digital age
is about social exchange on the one hand and about distribution and dissemination on the
other hand” (2011: 8). In his discussion of “sharing” John (2013) identifies four groups of
meaning, including sharing as a process of division (sharing food), observing that "sharing,
whether it involves the distribution of either candies or prey, is constitutive of social relations"
(John, 2013: 169); sharing as “something in common” whether tangible or intangible (John,
2013: 169); sharing as a communicative act (sharing thoughts or feelings) (John, 2013: 170);
and sharing in a specifically computer-based sense, as suggested by “file-sharing”, a mixture of
concepts such as sharing, copying and distribution (John, 2013: 170). A further meaning of
“sharing your world” is identified, first developed in social networking tools and again carrying
ideas of communication, providing access to a common resource or set of materials, or
distribution (John, 2013: 173-175). In suggesting an explanation for why the term has become
236

popular in web 2.0, John (2013: 175-176) focuses on its established use in the context of
computer technology, the versatility of its pre-existing meanings (distribution and
communication), and its “positive connotations of equality, selflessness and giving”.
“Collection” appears to have a similar range and breadth of meanings – process or thing,
involving material or immaterial objects, with possible suggestions of a positive social value –
as well as rich cultural connotations (Pearce, 1995: 6-13). In the final few months of the
preparation of this thesis, one example of “collection” in the digital world – revelations relating
to security agency capture and monitoring of internet communications – have highlighted the
continuing relevance of the term in the online environment. A single news story about these
programmes describes collection as a process of gathering together communications data;
collection as a “staggeringly large” store of data in a range of databases; collection as
something which is kept accessible for a specific period of time; and collection defined by how
it may be searched (Greenwald, 2013). Another interpretation of collection was provided by
the US Director of National Intelligence (Office of the Director of National Intelligence, 2013),
who used an elaborate library metaphor to explain apparent inconsistencies in his description
of these programmes:
"what I was thinking of is looking at the Dewey Decimal numbers of those books in the
metaphorical library. To me collection of U.S. Persons data would mean taking the
books off the shelf, opening it up and reading it."
8.3 A proposed model of collection in the digital world
Based primarily on the interview data described in chapter 6 and with additional elements
from other strands, a model of collection in the digital world is proposed, including the
following elements:






Collection as thing:
o Collection as a group of materials (on a subject or as “something special”)
o Collection as a group of sub-groups (organisation)
o Collection as quantity
o Collection as container / store (including preservation)
o Collection as a whole
Collection as access:
o Collection and connection
o Collection for use (promoting / facilitating use)
Collection as process:
o Collection as selection
o Collection as search
o Collection as service

Examples of all these elements can be seen in each of the three strands (Table 8.3a).

Things “brought

“Collection for use” has been added as a more specific description of an aspect of collection as
access. The idea of “collection and connection”, included here as another aspect of collection
as access, was encountered most directly in the Strand 1 British Library case study, reflecting
the British Library’s shift towards connecting to external content as well as collecting material
to add to its own holdings. This concept was also identified in strand 2 (the presence in some
library catalogues of links to freely available web-based materials, or links to EThOS
documents) and strand 3, where it was most explicitly described by the national library
librarian who suggested “it may not be a physical collection but it’s a collection of links”.
Eight of these definitions of collection were tested in the Strand 3 surveys. Both surveys
included a question asking respondents to rank eight definitions of collection based on how
well they thought the definitions described the term, from rank 1 (best match) to rank 8.
Overwhelmingly, both groups of survey respondents selected “Group of materials on a subject
or a theme” as their rank 1 definition with 80%-95% of respondents ranking this definition
within the top three ranks. The second and third definitions most frequently ranked in the top
three ranks were also the same for both library and information practitioners and social
enterprise respondents. “Provision of access to resources” was the second most popular
definition and “a set of results created by searching” was the third most popular definition
(Table 8.3b).

These results suggest some support for the ideas of collection as thing (“A group of materials
on a subject or theme”), collection as access (“Provision of access to resources”), with “A set of
results created through searching” being suggested as an example of the more dynamic
interpretation of collection as process. Apart from the first rank of definition choices, there
appeared to be no statistically significant differences between the responses to this question
in the library and information practitioner survey, or the social enterprise survey. In the first
rank of definition choices, library and information practitioners more frequently identified the
term with a “group of materials” (84, 81.6%), compared social enterprise survey respondents
239

(26, 56.5%), and more social enterprise survey respondents identified “collection” with
“provision of access to resources” (6, 13%), or declined to rank a first choice definition (5,
10.9%).
The rest of this section (8.3) discusses the ideas of “collection-as-thing”, “collection-as-access”
and “collection-as-process”, with reference to findings from each of the three strands of this
project. Three models are then introduced to explore potential implications of these ideas.
Section 8.4 discusses a proposed new collection development hierarchy, initially described in a
paper delivered at the 2012 Libraries in the Digital Age conference (Corrall and Roberts, 2012)
and further expanded in a paper delivered at the Charleston Conference on Issues in Book and
Serials Acquisition by Roberts (2013b). Sections 8.5 and 8.6 describe two further models,
developed independently of this earlier discussion of the collection development hierarchy.
The first of these models seeks to describe possible relationships between ideas of “collectionas-thing”, “collection-as-access” and “collection-as-process”, whilst the second model depicts
collection as a way of adding context to content, thereby adding value to individual units of
content.
8.3.1 Elements of the model: collection-as-thing
The British Library case study documentation describes collection-as-thing, either in the form
of the totality of the items held by the Library, reinforcing the idea suggested in a Strand 3
interview with a librarian “collection just does make it a whole”, or as sub-sets of material
based on geographical area (European Collections), subject area (Social Science Collections) or
format of material (Map Collections). Newer resources such as the Management and Business
Studies portal or the Electronic Theses Online Service represent digital versions of collectionas-thing, with each resource acting as a container for digital objects which are either united by
a shared subject, or by common formation or production route (such as theses from higher
research degree courses in UK universities). The British Library collection-as-thing is also
represented by the Library catalogue. The previous Integrated Catalogue focused on resources
physically held by the Library, whilst the new Primo catalogue blurs some of the boundaries
between owned materials and other resources, such as journal articles, to which the Library
can provide access. It should also be noted that the link between holding material and owning
material may be more fluid in a national library than in other libraries: the St Cuthbert Gospel
is a good example of an item which was originally placed on loan to the library for safekeeping
(without a transfer of ownership) in 1979, before finally being purchased by the Library in April
2012.

240

The Strand 2 catalogue search results suggest slightly different perspectives on collection-asthing in different library sectors. In public library catalogues, collections and locations tended
to be identified with physical places or specific branches; in academic library catalogues, a
higher proportion featured collections based on the format of resources (such as electronic
resources). 399 titles which had not been identified in the British Library catalogue searches
were located, suggesting that these Strand 2 searches provided a snapshot of a distributed
national collection of materials relevant to social enterprise and related topics. Finding a latent
collection in this way suggests some support for the observation made by one academic
interviewee in Strand 3: “there’s a lot of work that’s already there”. Survey responses also
suggested considerable support for the idea of collection-as-thing, indicated by the numbers of
respondents to each survey who selected “Group of materials on a subject or a theme” as their
rank 1 definition (81.6% library and information practitioners and 56.5% social enterprise
survey respondents).
The idea of collection as “something special” (Strand 3 interview) was reinforced by the Strand
2 catalogue search results: 81.7% of items only identified in Strand 2 were only identified in a
single library. Strand 3 survey responses also highlighted the idea of collection as a special
thing: three respondents suggested their own definitions of collection based on current or
previous ownership by a specific individual or organisation and one said “I think it is important
that every collection is unique to a particular insitution [sic].”
Collection was also seen as a container or store – or as a lifeboat – by Strand 3 interviewees.
The idea of lifeboat representing one perspective on collection-as-thing suggests a preserving,
protective container for material. There was an interesting contrast between Strand 3 survey
respondents’ perspectives about the preservation role of libraries. A greater proportion of
social enterprise respondents described preserving printed materials, preserving digital
materials and preserving informal publications created by customer communities as very
important or essential library activities (Table 8.3.1). Within the library and information
practitioner responses, there were considerable sectoral differences – between 81.8% and
90.9% of national library respondents gave those levels of priority to preservation activities,
compared to between 29.4% and 43.1% of public library respondents. A higher proportion of
public library respondents (33.3%) than academic library respondents (27.3%) prioritised
preserving informally published customer publications.

8.3.2 Elements of the model: collection-as-access
The Strand 3 survey results suggested some support for the idea of collection-as-access. 49
(47.6%) library and information practitioners ranked the provision of access as their first,
second or third choice definition for collection, as did 24 (52.2%) social enterprise survey
respondents.
The Strand 1 British Library case study suggested an increasing role for the concept of
collection-as-access. The content strategy review reflects a shift in terminology within the
Library from “collection” to “content” and a reorientation towards balancing “collecting”
activities with “connecting” or access-led activities, which link users to external content. The
EThOS service is a particularly interesting example of a British Library service based around
facilitating access to previously low-use library materials (research theses). This service uses
single access transactions – one user’s request for a thesis which has not yet been digitised –
to build a collection of digitised material (the digital copy is then added permanently to the
EThOS resource). In the Strand 3 interviews, a government librarian also described a
programme of ad hoc retrospective digitisation of departmental publications, based on
individual requests for copies of specific documents. Access transactions similarly translate
into collection building actions in the PDA system and acquisitions process for high demand
items described by an academic librarian in the Strand 3 interviews.
Further support for the idea of collection as connection was supported by the links to freely
available web-based resources identified in the Strand 2 catalogue searches, and the Strand 3
interview comment from a national library librarian who suggested that the collection could be
“a collection of links”. Ideas of collection as use were suggested in the Strand 3 interview data:
242

a policymaker suggested that a collection is a group of materials “brought together in a way
that’s useable”. The Strand 1 usage statistics from the British Library case study highlight how
much of the collection (print and electronic) is used – and adding to the potential for use of
items identified in both Strand 1 and Strand 2 catalogue searches is arguably part of the role of
both catalogues and collections. These ideas of collection as use as an element of collectionas-access also echoes Ranganathan’s (1957) law of library science “Books are for use”.
8.3.3 Elements of the model: collection-as-process
Definitions of the term collection as process echo Horava’s (2010: 150) advice to "Consider
what a collection does rather than what a collection is". The definition provided by one
academic interviewee who described the term collection as “a body of work that has been
brought together using a particular set of criteria,” seemed to reflect Lagoze’s and Fielding’s
(1998) definition “A collection is logically defined as a set of criteria for selecting resources
from the broader information space”. For Lagoze and Fielding (1998) the implications of this
definition include the idea of the “dynamic growth of the collection”. Tools such as SFX
arguably reflect some of the ideas suggested by the proposed model element of “collection-asprocess” – link resolvers promote and facilitate access to remote electronic resources
(Cochenour, 2004; Curran, 2006), whilst also enabling the library to set criteria for the
inclusion or exclusion of links to available content, such as journals added or dropped in
monthly SFX Knowledgebase updates (Curran, 2006; Collins, 2010). The British Library’s thirtysixth Annual Report describes the Library’s adoption of SFX technology in 2009, following the
development of the content strategy in 2006 which placed more emphasis on the process of
connecting users to content, as well as collecting material to be held by the Library itself.
One academic librarian (LI5) described two examples of dynamic collection growth processes –
Patron Driven Acquisitions and automated purchasing of additional copies of high demand
items, whilst the academic interviewee A1 saw this concept of dynamic collection creation
reflected in the application of specific criteria to the process of searching databases. In both
cases, dimensions of a users’ information seeking-behaviour are given some degree of
persistence by the addition of items to, or the new creation of, a collection.
The catalogue searches carried out in Strands 1 and 2 both served to highlight the gap
between library resources provided – generally small numbers of books and journals – and the
types of information which Strand 3 interviewees interested in social enterprise and social
enterprise survey respondents reported creating, sharing and using. Social enterprise survey
respondents reported using Google and websites as their primary information sources, with
Google and websites both most frequently ranked very important or essential sources of
243

information by people interested in social enterprise (37 (80.4%)) followed by personal
networks (34 (73.9%)) whilst libraries were least frequently ranked very important or essential
(15 (32.6%)). This contrasted with responses to the library and information practitioner survey;
these respondents most frequently ranked personal networks as very important or essential
sources of information for social enterprise (83 (80.6%)) and more frequently ranked libraries
as very important or essential sources of information (59 (57.3%)) than Google (55 (53.4%)).
Relevant website material is generally not represented in library catalogues (with the
exception of some UK web archive content available in the British Library catalogue – although
no examples relevant to social enterprise were located).
The importance of networks as sources of social enterprise information is apparent from the
interview data from all five social enterprise interviewees, both academics and both policy
makers, and appears to be supported by the Strand 3 survey results. The importance of
personal knowledge – from informal networks to using YouTube clips of key thinkers and
practitioners to convey important concepts to students – seems to echo Bill Drayton’s
suggestion, quoted by Bornstein (2007: 120) “People understand this field by anecdote rather
than theory”. Mawson (2010) explores issues relating to the creation of networks to promote
strategic social enterprise development and to support local social enterprises, which are
particularly important in the context of fragmented and low profile formal information and
advice provision; these networks can be used to develop communities of practice to facilitate
knowledge sharing and collaborative learning. However, the observation, by SE5, that a social
enterprise support organisation supporting public sector spin-out enterprises “doesn’t quite
know how to use its community” suggests potential issues for communities created or
designed by established organisations, as opposed to those which emerge from grassroots
collaboration between particular individuals or social enterprises. This also seems to echo the
observation made by Taylor and Corrall (2007: 308) about the lack of popularity of
communities of practice within government departments, partly because of a perception that
these “were under-utilized”.
In both the Strand 3 interviews and in the surveys, people involved with social enterprise
described creating and sharing pieces of information. In the survey responses, social enterprise
practitioners most frequently described creating business plans (21 out of 26 practitioners
(80.8%)) and reports (19 (73%)). 8 academics or researchers indicated that they create journal
articles and 6 academics or researchers described creating reports. Social enterprise
practitioners most frequently used personal networks to share information they had created.
Such information sharing is not supported by any formal infrastructure (either by publishers or
by libraries).
244

This gap raises questions of whether the process of giving persistence to dimensions of
information-seeking behaviour could be replicated in relation to digital and web-based
material. Taylor and Francis (2013b) discuss some of these issues in a recent report about the
treatment of free web-based resources; however, this report focuses on the role of the library
as “purchasers of content” or in “enhancing discoverability” (Taylor & Francis, 2013b: 5) – both
of these roles seem more transient than one which focuses on persistence. Taylor and Francis
(2013b: 8) report survey results showing that “53% of librarians ‘strongly agreed’ that free
online resources add value to the research process” and that 90% either agree or strongly
agree that libraries are “ideally placed” to assess free resources (Taylor & Francis, 2013b: 9).
This seems to suggest some support for the Strand 3 survey findings from this research, in
which between 67.0% and 77.7% of library and information practitioners agreed or strongly
agreed that libraries should provide links to freely accessible web-based resources, either from
the library catalogue or from somewhere else, with only 10.7% agreeing or strongly agreeing
that such materials should be excluded, with the library focusing on purchased and
subscription content.
The Strand 3 survey responses gave some support to the idea of collection-as-process, with
36.9% library and information practitioners and 43.5% social enterprise survey respondents
defining collection as a group of results brought together by searching. The method of
identifying relevant library material in the catalogue searches of Strand 1 and Strand 2 also
suggests the idea of collection-as-process. A type of post hoc distributed national collection for
social enterprise was identified through these searches. The Strand 1 searches of the British
Library’s catalogue highlighted the Library’s preservation role (also emphasised in Annual
Reports and in collection policy and process documentation). These located relevant materials
from the 1960s onwards. The searches highlighted the spread of publications – and the rising
trend in publications – since the 1960s, and the publication date patterns of new titles
identified in Strand 2 followed the publication date patterns of those identified in the Strand 1
catalogue searches. Although overall the British Library provided a much larger number of
individual titles than any single Strand 2 catalogue, the number of additional titles identified in
Strand 2 does suggest that there may be gaps in the British Library’s holdings.
One interviewee, an academic working in the field of social enterprise, suggested the idea of
latent collections – relevant material from earlier waves of interest in related but different
topics, such as co-operatives in the 1980s. This has interesting parallels with the idea,
suggested from a museum studies perspective by Pearce (1995: 21), that “an interesting group
of material” – without having been planned as a collection – may prompt a collecting impulse
once “their potential collectionhood is perceived”. Interesting objects may pass through “a
245

phase of... ‘passive collection’” (Pearce, 1995: 26). This echoes the idea suggested in one
Strand 1 British Library document, which described the contrast between “Active collecting”
(approaching FTSE 100 companies to request copies of company annual reports) and “Passive
collecting”, where material is received either by Legal Deposit or by donation from a company.
In some cases Legal Deposit collection may also be more active – requesting deposit from
publishers or, under the Non-Print Legal Deposit regulations, actively harvesting the UK web
domain.
In the case of library collections more generally, it can be argued that materials may pass
through multiple phases of active collection – initially for their primary discipline or field and
subsequently for emerging fields and especially for new interdisciplinary subjects. Searing
(1996: 318) describes this process in relation to the emergence of women’s studies – initially
“attention was focused on rediscovering forgotten texts by and about women and reassessing
the classics, from Shakespeare to Freud” before generating an original literature of its own,
made up of focused interdisciplinary texts specifically for this subject area. Current work in the
field of linked data (Byrne and Goddard, 2010; Coyle, 2011) may suggest ways of enhancing
the discoverability of latent collections although library implementations of linked data
approaches appear to focus on linking data about individuals or cultural artefacts (Bartlett and
Hughes, 2011) rather than about less well-defined concepts, such as social enterprise. This also
supports the idea, suggested by a library and information practitioner interviewee, that: “a
whole problem in itself is... how subjects are seen and whether they’re seen as important or
not. That’s the problem. It’s quite difficult.” (LI3)
In Strand 3 interviews, there also appeared to be an overlap between library and information
practitioners’ perceptions of issues relating to the process of preservation and issues of
deselection – both forms of selection. Three library and information practitioners discussed
deselection or relegation of collection items to provide more space within the physical library.
Findings from the survey suggested that this might be a more widespread feature, with 91
(89.2%) of library and information practitioner survey respondents agreeing or strongly
agreeing with the statement “I think collection evaluation and deselection is an integral part of
effective collection development and management” and 65 (63.7%) agreeing or strongly
agreeing that “There is currently pressure to deselect materials to provide more space”. This
also appeared to reflect views expressed by social enterprise and academic interviewees
regarding the distinction between temporary or permanent storage of information in local
collections.
Finally, the comments of the reference service librarian who identified the collection closely
with the idea of service echoed Hjørland’s (1998: 617) observation that "A collection should be
246

able to provide ‘satisfactory answers’ to the questions raised by actual and potential users”.
This idea is also given some support by the example of the BIPC event feedback forms and the
QuestionPoint services as examples of library services which either encourage use of the
collection or which potentially use the collection to deliver a service. This adds another
dimension to the idea of collection-as-process.
8.4 Concepts of collection: practical implications for a revised collection development
hierarchy
The ideas of collection as thing, process and access, initially suggested by the Strand 3
interview data and given some modest support in the Strand 3 survey results, can be used to
suggest a revised collection development hierarchy (Corrall and Roberts, 2012; Roberts,
2013b). The first part of Corrall and Roberts (2012) summarises Corrall’s (2012a) book chapter,
including re-introducing a previous collection development model proposed by Edelman
(1979) and summarised as shown in Table 8.4a.

The second part of Corrall and Roberts (2012) reports the research described in this thesis,
conducted by Roberts, and synthesises these two parts by linking the ideas of collection as
thing, access and process to the collection development hierarchy described by Corrall (2012a:
5). In Corrall and Roberts’s (2012) presentation of a proposed revised collection development
hierarchy, “collection-as-thing” is suggested to relate to strategic level decision-making,
“collection-as-access” is related to tactical approaches to the collection and “collection-asprocess” relates to operational collection activities (Table 8.4b).

Three examples, suggested by the interview data, have been discussed in more detail in
Roberts (2013b). In Table 8.4d, the example of Patron Driven Acquisitions is used to show how
considering “collection-as-thing” may assist in developing policies which define where the

boundaries of the PDA collection should be, including its scale (quantity), overarching themes

Considering “collection-as-access” also informs preferences for leasing or renting e-books on a
short-term basis (connecting) or purchasing them for the longer term – with approaches
considered on the basis of actual or anticipated use. Finally, “collection-as-process” describes
the automation of acquisitions activities (selection), as well as the role of automated metadata
in describing actual or potential additions to the collection (facilitating search).
Table 8.4e shows the example of an institutional repository. Considering “collection-as-thing”
may drive both wide policies for including material within the repository (collection as a
whole), and could also describe potential post-inclusion strategies for more focused collection
building within the repository and between different repositories (groups of material and
groups of sub-groups). The idea of “collection-as-access” should encourage multiple access
points to the repository, facilitating use, and should connect to related materials in other
repositories, whilst “collection-as-process” encourages customer self-archiving (selection), as
well as the automation of metadata and of preservation activities (the facilitation of search
and additional services).

Finally, Table 8.4f illustrates the example of deselection. “Collection-as-thing” encourages
strategic decision-making based on where the boundaries of the collection currently are and
249

where they should be in the future, together with setting the boundaries of sub-sets of the
collection which may no longer be needed. Considerations of quantity are also relevant,
especially if the library has an overall zero-growth strategy. Considering “collection-as-access”
means identifying alternative ways to provide access to content from deselected materials
(connection), including in alternative formats or from repositories such as the UK Research
Reserve of printed journals (Boyle and Brown, 2010) or shared print repositories (Malpas,
2011). “Collection-as-process” may also involve some level of automated identification of
materials for review.

This approach may go some way to developing a more dynamic concept of collection, along
the lines suggested by a publisher interviewee in the Strand 3 interviews:
“I suppose a really good collection is... where you take content and you can merge it,
you can cross-fertilise it, you can... discover easily” (O2).
8.5 Relationships between the elements of the model
The strategic management perspective described above suggests ways in which findings from
this research can be related to earlier models of collection development, potentially informing
decision-making about collection issues. However, this approach provides only one perspective
on the potential inter-relationships between the concepts of collection encountered in this
project. Although individually the three concepts of collection have emerged both from the
literature and from the research conducted as part of this project, attempting to map their
inter-relationships in a way which captures more of their potential complexity may offer
original insights into collection in the digital world. In an attempt to achieve this, a further
250

approach to depicting the potential relationships between the three concepts of collection
(“collection-as-thing”, “collection-as-process”, and “collection-as-access”) is shown in Figure
8.5a.

Figure 8.5a: Concepts of collection.
This depicts the ideas described within “collection-as-thing” on two levels. At the first level –
the inner circle – are groups of material, organisation between groups and quantities of
251

materials. These are encompassed by containers or stores (real or virtual), which form the
second level (the outer circle). The boundaries of “collection-as-thing” are depicted using
dotted lines – suggesting that items can move across them, into and out of collection in a fluid
and dynamic way, echoing Lagoze and Fielding’s (1998) criteria-based approach to collection in
digital libraries and Atkinson’s (1996) description of the “process of importation” into the
library “control zone” in the online environment. This diagram also reinterprets the idea of
“collection as a whole”; instead of presenting this as an aspect of “collection-as-thing”, it is
used to encapsulate all three interpretations of collection. The arrows in this diagram indicate
potential relationships between the three interpretations of collection without at this stage
detailing what these may be.
Both “Librarian” and “User” are represented in this diagram. They participate in collection,
with overlapping but different perspectives on all three concepts of collection. They may also
be resources for collection – either as gatekeepers to resources or as resources themselves:
the State and University Library at Arhus, Denmark, goes as far as to include library subject
specialists as “searchable resources” in its implementation of the Summa next-generation
catalogue (Stevenson et al., 2009: 81). Placing both “Librarian” and “User” at the centre of this
diagram suggests potential future roles for co-created collections crowdsourced from users
using new technologies, such as social media, and criteria applied by librarians. This type of
approach is suggested in the British Library’s (2013b: 8) description of a recent project to
crowdsource geo-referencing of historic maps.
The model depicts a pared-back view of collection: processes which are key to collection
development and management, such as acquisition or preservation, are not represented as
separate parts of the model, but instead emerge from the inter-relationships between the
three core concepts of collection. Acquisition of a printed item may be a combination of
“collection-as-process” (selection), “collection-as-thing” (an item added to group, organised
and stored) and “collection-as-access” (accessible for use). In other formats, the emphasis of
acquisition may shift more towards “collection-as-access” and away from “collection-as-thing”.
Preservation is also made up of aspects of all three concepts of collection: “collection-asprocess” (selection for active preservation), “collection-as-thing” (which contains the item
being preserved, either as a physical or digital object), “collection-as-access” (either how
preservation can facilitate continuing access, or levels of actual or anticipated use as criteria
for selecting material for preservation). A similar combination may apply to digitisation,
exemplified both by the EThOS approach of digitising material to satisfy a single access
transaction and then adding it permanently to the larger collection and by the process

252

described by a government librarian in the Strand 3 interviews, where old departmental
printed documents are digitised when copies of specific items are requested.
It is possible to suggest many different potential interrelationships between these three ideas
of collection. These relationships are multidimensional and complex. In Figure 8.5a all these
relationships are indicated using the dual-direction arrows. To provide more detail, it is
possible to describe some examples of these potential relationships between the three
concepts of collection.
Potential relationships can be suggested between “collection-as-thing” and “collection-asprocess”: items are selected (“collection-as-process”) to build the “collection-as-thing”, whilst
individuals may select items from the “collection-as-thing”, with selection for preservation, or
selection for withdrawal being special forms of this process. These ideas were suggested in the
Strand 3 interviews by library and information practitioners who identified selection as a key
component of collection building or who discussed the problems created by failures to select
material for withdrawal from the collection at an earlier stage. Similarly, search (“collection-asprocess”) may help to build a “collection-as-thing”, as suggested by both academic
interviewees. Search can also be used to identify materials within the existing “collection-asthing”, although this may be challenging, as was exemplified by the Strand 1 and Strand 2
catalogue searches.
Potential relationships are also suggested between “collection-as-thing” and “collection-asaccess”. The link between “collection-as-thing” to connection as an element of “collection-asaccess” reflects the increasing role of remote resources, such as e-journals, which are accessed
from representations of “collection-as-thing” (such as a catalogue). In the other direction,
external resources may connect into collections – such as EThOS. There may also be
opportunities for making connections between items within “collection-as-thing” – highlighting
alternative editions in a catalogue, or addressing the challenge described by a public librarian
interviewee of making people browsing the shelves aware of additional resources available as
electronic versions.
Access or use transactions may facilitate collection building, as in Patron Driven Acquisitions
systems, or as exemplified in the EThOS approach to digitising theses – a single access
transaction leads to the permanent addition of a digitised copy of the thesis to the collection.
Potential relationships also exist between “collection-as-process” and “collection-as-access”.
The process of search is a form of collection use – both British Library documentation and one
library and information practitioner described information about failed searches as potential
sources of information about how the collection could be developed. Search also facilitates
253

Figure 8.5b: Concepts of collection, showing details of possible relationships between
concepts.

254

access to collection items, although Strand 1 and Strand 2 catalogue searches suggest that this
is often with varied levels of success.
Finally, collection use delivers services – collection items might be consulted to answer
enquiries – and services promote collection use, with reference enquiries leading to
recommendations to use particular resources.
These examples of some of the many potential relationships between the three
interpretations of collection are shown in Figure 8.5b.
The diagram is not intended to be exhaustive: other aspects of collection (and certainly
additional potential inter-relationships) may be revealed by further research, or by attempting
to apply the model in practice settings. However, in a library context this model could be
useful for the following reasons:


It encourages a move away from focusing specifically on collection-as-thing. The
diagram is non-hierarchical and all three concepts of collection are depicted as being
of equal size and significance;



It encourages a more dynamic approach to “collection” – the process of collection
(gathering objects together) and providing access, either by librarian, user, or
automated system is as significant as the “collection” artefact as a thing;



It encourages opportunity-spotting in relation to collection activities. Services could be
developed, considered or evaluated with reference to each of the three concepts of
collection;



It places both librarian and user at the centre of collection in the digital world,
suggesting a role for users in collection development and management which
potentially goes beyond current developments such as patron driven acquisitions. It
suggests, for example, exploring the usefulness of user linking behaviour or user
searching behaviour as a tool for collection.

8.6 Library collection as adding value: content and context
Another way of interpreting the ideas of “collection” identified in these research findings may
be suggested by two quotations encountered in the literature review. McColvin (1925: 109)
describes the library as “a collection of active elements” which provides a “systematic union of
the units of knowledge, whereby they gain in value and utility”. Atkinson (1998: 7) defines
collection management as “the activity of adding value to – or deleting value from – objects
subsequent to their selection”. The British Library’s new content strategy includes as a key

255

principle “We will add value to content through curation and encourage our users to add value
through community” (British Library, 2013b: 8).
The idea of collection as involving processes which add, indicate or reduce the value of
materials raises questions about how that value is manifested and, more broadly, the nature of
the relationship between individual items, or content, and the larger collection. This offers
quite a different perspective on the discussion of “value” in libraries to current discussions,
which tend to focus on quantitative measures. British Library (2002) used the contingent
valuation technique to calculate that the Library’s value, both directly and indirectly, to the UK
economy was £4.4 to every £1 of public funding. A more recent exercise concluded that the
British Library provided a benefit to cost ratio of 4.9 (£4.90 return on every £1 invested) within
the UK and a benefit cost ratio of 5.1 globally (Tessler, 2013: 2). In particular, the benefit of the
BIPC is valued as £20.8 million for the year 2011/2012 (Tessler, 2013: 2). Oakleaf (2010)
describes five approaches to measuring library value: use (partly expressed by usage statistics),
return on investment, commodity value, impact measurement and user perceptions of library
value in comparison to information alternatives (2010: 20-22). Measures of outcomes
influenced by libraries include return on investment in grant income or increased productivity
potentially attributable to ready access to electronic journals in academic library collections
(Tenopir, 2010; Tenopir, 2012); the Lib-Value project incorporates a range of studies of
outcomes resulting from existing or innovative library services (Mays et al., 2010). Nitecki and
Abels (2013) propose a “library value wheel” focusing on the perceptions of library value
articulated by different stakeholder groups. A flavour of current approaches to value and
impact assessment is provided by a recent issue of Evidence Based Library and Information
Practice which presents the selected papers from the 2010 Library Assessment conference
(Brettle, 2013; Kyrillidou and Jaggars, 2013) and from the proceedings of the annual
Northumbria International Conference on Performance Measurement in Libraries and
Information Services (Hall et al., 2012). Both emphasise quantitative approaches to evaluating
value and impact, and users’ perceptions of these. A different perspective is offered by
Usherwood (2007: 120) who suggests that the library profession should “move on from the
position of addressing agendas that have been suggested by others, to one where it argues
what is necessary and valuable”. These two perspectives on the value of libraries – value
assessed from outputs and outcomes or claimed on the basis of underlying professional
understanding of what is valuable – are summed up by Town (2011: 114-115) as either intrinsic
“value for their own sakes” or “extrinsic value... we exist for the sake of something else”. By
examining in more detail the idea of collection as a source of intrinsic value – and exploring

256

how this value arises – it may be possible to suggest different ways of thinking about collection
value.
It may be that part of the value statement made by collection is due to the contextual
information added to items (content) by their inclusion and location within the collection. For
example, in the print world context is added a book by placing it close to related books within
a given classification scheme. The fact that a book is available on the shelf also adds contextual
information – the processes of selection and acquisition add context regarding the item’s
perceived relevance to the library and its users, as does its current and past loan status.
In the Strand 3 interviews for this project, both publisher interviewees stressed the way
publishers add value to publications. From a publisher perspective O’Leary (2013) argues that
adding context to content is a vital role for publishers in the digital world, although without
considering whether the same may apply to the role of libraries. Lee (2000: 1111) describes
how “any collection forms a context that presents to the user a group of selected and
organized information resources. The context is sometimes physical, sometimes institutional,
and sometimes intellectual”, hypothesising that different types of context apply depending on
whether an individual’s role is as a collection developer or as a user. Palmer et al (2010)
introduce the idea of “contextual mass” in relation to digital collections, with the objective of
creating “a tightly knit system of collections, rather than individual sources, with meaningful
interrelationships among different subject areas and types of materials” (2010: 8). Buckland
(2011b) describes the role of context in helping people to navigate to relevant reference
resources when reading separate web-based texts. The types of context added by libraries and
publishers might be very different. In the physical library, context is added to a book by being
placed next to another on the shelf, or by relegating an item to a remote store. Context is
added to a journal issue by placing the newest copy next to new issues of other journals.
Dervin (1997: 14) describes some of the challenges of discussing context, suggesting that there
is "no term that is more often used, less often defined, and when defined defined so variously
as context". Dervin describes the different approaches taken to context, and the common
issues that varied discussions of context tend to address, including the “inherent dialectical
relationship between product and process, noun and verb” (Dervin, 1997: 18), ideas of
“multiple interdependencies” and context as meaning (Dervin, 1997: 19).
The British Library case study shows how this organisation increasingly uses the term
“content” to refer to aspects of collection, which seems to provide another reason for
examining the nature of the relationship between ideas of content and collection. Heaney
(2000) depicts the relationship between content and collection using the term “is gathered
257

into”. However, the idea of collection as a contextualising process which adds value to content
suggests a much broader multidimensional relationship between content and collection. One
possible model for some of these dimensions – although there may be many more which were
not identified by this research - is shown in Figure 8.6. This diagram re-interprets the concepts
of “collection-as-thing”, “collection-as-access” and “collection-as-process” as types of context
which may be added to content. This model could apply to any type of collection – whether a
formal library collection, a personal document collection, or dynamically generated collection
of material brought together by applying particular criteria (such as a set of search results).
In this diagram, each of the three concepts of collection suggests different types of context.
Again, the dimensions of context depicted in the diagram are not intended to be exhaustive,
but they do show how the concepts of collection may help to contextualise content. They
reflect some of the aspects of context described by Dervin (1997), including potentially
complex interrelationships between different concepts of collection (combinations of structure
– collection-as-thing – and actual or potential links to other sources – collection-as-access),
product and process (collection-as-thing and collection-as-process) and the addition of
meaning to content (who it was selected for, how it could be used).

Figure 8.6: Content, context and collection.
258

The context added by collection may change over time and is inherently dynamic. Interactions
with collection, whether as access, process or thing, can add new context or can remove
existing context. Capturing this context – or changes in context – may add value to collection
content. Different types of context may be emphasised in relation to different collections or
sub collections. This model could be applied to the variations in the collection aims outlined in
documents from the British Library case study. An aim of collection “comprehensiveness”
implies very different context to aims of “distinctiveness”, “coherence” or “selective”.
“Comprehensiveness” might be seen as an expression of context relating to “collection-asthing” and the completeness of a group of materials; “distinctiveness” might reflect the
context of “collection-as-process” (materials gathered together by Hans Sloan; content from
the BIPC which is used to deliver its services); “coherence” might suggest “collection-asaccess” – ensuring that quality electronic resources for a key subject area are accessible. All
these aims can be seen as being statements about the context provided by collection to
content and different aims may be appropriate to different subsets of collection.
This approach to collection may also suggest areas in which library and information
professionals could support individual collection building: Dempsey (2003: 30) notes that
contemporary libraries provide “limited support for the creation of personal collections” whilst
Moss (2008: 82) suggests a role for the library to “return to the collection base as one of the
resources that will stock the shelves of the private space”. Library and information
professionals could help users to identify, create, record and use relevant contextual
information about content based in part on these concepts of collection.
In a library and information service setting, this view of collection as context should encourage
the adjustment or development of systems to surface or make explicit dimensions of context
added by collection. Contextual information provided by inclusion of content within individual
user personal collections, or by connections made to content by other libraries or library
services, could also be shared to add further value to this content.
8.7 Conclusion
This chapter has reviewed findings from Strands 1, 2 and 3 and has considered them in relation
to the terminology and concepts of “collection”. Some similarities between the term
“collection” and other real world terms – such as searching and sharing – which have taken on
renewed significance in the digital age have also briefly been considered. A model of collection
in the digital world has been proposed: collection-as-thing, collection-as-process and
collection-as-access. Each element has been considered in turn and a revised collection
development hierarchy has been proposed. Two further models have explored aspects of
259

these three concepts of collection at a more abstract level. A diagram depicting potential interrelationships between the three concepts has been presented and another diagram suggests
the idea of collection as a value-adding activity which gives context to content.

9. CONCLUSION
9.1 Introduction
This chapter begins by revisiting the background to the project. This is followed by a summary
of the main findings from each strand. The chapter then returns to each of the six research
questions in turn to examine how the findings combine to provide answers to these questions,
and re-examines the assumptions articulated when selecting social enterprise as an
exemplifying case for exploring issues affecting library collections in the digital world. The
contribution to knowledge made by this thesis is outlined, including the models introduced in
Chapter 8. Practical recommendations are suggested for the British Library and for library and
information services more generally, and possible areas for future research are identified.
Publications and presentations arising so far from the project are summarised and topics for
future journal articles and possible conference papers based on this research are proposed.

This project began in October 2010, developing on a project proposal formulated by the
original primary supervisor. The original proposal aimed to build on previous collaborative
work between the British Library and University of Sheffield Enterprise to develop the British
Library’s resources and subject guidance for social enterprise. The field of social enterprise
seemed to exemplify a range of current and emerging issues affecting library collections in the
digital world, including interdisciplinarity, informally produced web-based publications and the
roles of virtual communities of practice or communities of interest. The project has been
funded by a University of Sheffield British Library Concordat Scholarship.
This research has adopted a mixed methods research design, based on a pragmatic
perspective. The detailed structure of the research design has been explained in the
methodology section of this thesis (Chapter 3). in particular, Figure 3.4a shows how the three
strands to this project interrelate and Figure 3.4b provides an outline of the timeline of the
project.
9.3 Main findings: strand summaries
9.3.1 Strand 1: British Library case study
The content analysis of British Library Annual Reports since 1973 provides a holistic
perspective on issues, developments and challenges relating to the Library’s collections over
the past forty years, including the growing role of digital technology in the collections,
initiatives to improve collection development and management, and illustrates shifts in
terminology used in relation to collections and emerging technologies. Annual Reports to CENL
261

also indicate differences between how the Library presents itself to an international – as
opposed to a UK – audience. Collection policy and process documentation provided additional
information about the Library’s approach to collection development and management,
including the terminological shift from “collection” to “content”. The British Library operates in
a very specific legal framework, with the Legal Deposit privilege at the centre of its collecting
activities, combining with its historic holdings to create a unique library collection. However,
some of the issues which emerged in the case study have broader resonance for library and
information services more widely, including the challenges of trying to prioritise between
subjects, managing the shift from print to digital formats, including adopting digital as a
preferred format, engaging with collaborative collection development initiatives and
documenting collection policies and processes effectively.
The quantitative data collected from the case study provided insight into the characteristics of
the Library’s collections for social enterprise and how items within the collections are used.
9.3.2 Strand 2: OPAC searches
88 UK library OPACs were searched between August 2011 and October 2011, including nearly a
quarter of public library authority and academic library catalogues in each of the four home
nations. The characteristics of the search results were compared by country, library sector and
the search terms by which they were identified. The top ten most frequently retrieved titles
from each sector were also compared, highlighting some interesting differences, and
comparisons were also made between search results located on catalogues with or without
phrase searching facilities. The characteristics of online items retrieved in these searches were
described, together with the characteristics of items only located in these Strand 2 searches,
including their dates of publication. A brief comparative search of OCLC’s international union
catalogue, WorldCat, was also conducted in March 2013. Key findings from Strand 2 included
sectoral differences, apparently high levels of uniqueness in the results retrieved and similar
patterns in the publication dates of items retrieved to those identified in Strand 1.
9.3.3 Strand 3: Interviews followed by survey
9.3.3.1 Interviews
19 interviews with 18 people, including library and information practitioners, people
interested in social enterprise, policymakers and publishers, helped to identify some of the
information needs of people interested in social enterprise, the information sources they use
and the types of information they create and share. The interviews explored people’s
perceptions of different levels of e-resource provision across different library sectors and
suggested the potential value of a web-based directory of information sources for social
262

enterprise. Other themes which emerged included the importance of librarian-publisher
collaboration at a strategic level to address common challenges and concerns, as well as the
potential relevance of social enterprise approaches for library service provision.
Most importantly, the interviews also provided a framework for defining “collection” in the
digital world (collection as thing, process and access) and provided variables which were
incorporated into the design of a survey instrument aimed at discovering whether any of these
ideas appeared to have broader applicability to larger samples of stakeholders.
9.3.3.2 Surveys
Two surveys were conducted between July and October 2012, with 103 library and information
practitioner responses (out of 338 invitations, a response rate of 30.5%) and 46 responses
from people interested in social enterprise (out of 445 invitations, a response rate of 10.3%).
The survey results provided some support for the idea that “collection” may be seen as the
provision of access to resources and a dynamic process (such creating a set of results by
searching), as well as a thematic group of materials or a thing. These results also highlighted
the contrast between library and information practitioner perceptions of the comparative
importance of libraries in contrast to Google and the very different view of this provided by
social enterprise stakeholders. Library and information practitioners and social enterprise
survey respondents seemed to have very different perceptions regarding the presence of
relevant materials in library collections. It also seemed that social enterprise stakeholders
attached greater significance to the preservation role of libraries, although this was not a
statistically significant difference.
9.3.4 Strand synthesis and discussion
Following the main phases of data collection, findings from all three strands were brought
together in the development of three models of collection in the digital world, which are
discussed in Chapter 8. Although the framework of the model of “collection-as-thing”,
“collection-as-process” and “collection-as-access” emerged initially from the Strand 3
interviews, support for these ideas was found in all three strands. Some aspects of the model
were also extended by findings from other strands. For example, “connection” as an aspect of
“collection-as-access” emerged most strongly from Strand 1. The three models are
summarised in greater detail later in this chapter.

263

9.4 Addressing the research questions
9.4.1 What are the characteristics of the library collection for social enterprise?
9.4.1.1 Scale of materials available in library collections
Both Strand 1 and Strand 2 catalogue searches revealed relatively small amounts of material
relevant to social enterprise, social entrepreneurship or topics relating to community
enterprise. These materials were generally traditional library resources – printed books or
journals – although a sizeable proportion of the material could be described as grey literature
– official publications, reports and materials which were informally published. A minority of
library catalogues included links to freely available web-based materials, such as PDFs.
Interviews in Strand 3 suggested mixed perceptions of availability of materials – some library
and information practitioners were unsure whether there were relevant materials in their
collections, whilst some interviewees interested in social enterprise were also unsure of the
potential availability of materials in libraries.
In the survey results, the contrast appeared to be more pronounced, with nearly three
quarters of library and information practitioner respondents agreeing or strongly agreeing that
their library held physical materials relevant to social enterprise and over two-thirds agreeing
or strongly agreeing that their library provided access to electronic resources relevant to social
enterprise. In contrast, only just over a quarter of social enterprise survey respondents agreed
or strongly agreed that libraries provide access to materials relevant to social enterprise.
9.4.1.2 Sectors
The Strand 2 searches also cast an interesting light on the very variable quality of library
catalogues in different sectors and countries. For example, a high proportion of English and
Northern Irish public library catalogues did not permit phrase searching, especially compared
to higher levels of phrase searching availability in Scottish and Welsh public library catalogues.
The larger union catalogues, displaying results for a number of local authorities, did not involve
the use of catalogues with more sophisticated search facilities; these union catalogues
generally lacked phrase searching.
In examining the lists of most frequently retrieved titles, there appeared to be a lack of overlap
between the top ten most frequently retrieved titles for the three sectors. This may be seen as
highlighting the different characteristics of each sector. Most of the titles identified from
public library catalogues were identified without phrase searching. Public library catalogues
provided fewer results, but the more frequently retrieved titles tended to be more recently
published. The academic library catalogues provided more results, but the most frequently
264

retrieved titles tended to be older. Searches on two health library catalogues revealed a more
specialised focus on publications of relevance to the health sector.
The sectoral divide between different types of libraries was echoed by two interviewees
interested in social enterprise, who described their sense of frustration when it came to trying
to access information without having access through full membership of an academic library.
There were also significant differences in social enterprise survey respondents’ perceptions of
their own ability to access libraries from different sectors. More than three quarters of people
interested in social enterprise agreed or strongly agreed that they have access to a public
library; more than half agreed or strongly agreed that they have access to an academic library
but only just over a third agreed or strongly agreed that they have access to a national library.
9.4.1.3 Collection currency
Strand 1 searches on the British Library catalogue retrieved less than half as many 2011
publications as the Strand 2 searches. This may suggest longer processing times associated
with legal deposit acquisitions, or it may reflect the willingness of some libraries to display “on
order” items in their catalogues (before any copies of the items have been received).
Alternatively, it might reflect different methods of acquisitions. For example, customer
suggestions were the most popular method of selection for public libraries (39 out of 52
(75%)), closely followed by supplier selection (38 out of 52 (73.1%)). These might both
facilitate greater responsiveness to new publications than the preferred methods of selection
by academic library survey respondents, for whom reading lists were most popular (31 out of
33 (94%)). The use of reading lists may effectively delay the identification of new publications:
academics have to be aware of the title, in some cases they have to have read the title and the
title needs to have been added to a reading list, before an item can be acquired. Selection by
library specialists was the second most popular selection method for academic librarians and
patron driven acquisitions were used by more than half the academic librarians, and by fewer
than one in ten public librarians. The perception of library collections as essentially reactive
and retrospective was echoed by comments from two interviewees:
“in a way the library element of it is sort of catching up” (SE3)
“the social enterprise aspects and stuff like that seems relatively new in terms of
literature.”
(SE2)
One interviewee talked about the opportunity presented by the digital world for libraries to
adopt a more proactive, dynamic role in pushing out content into the wider information
universe, saying “I think if we can organise our assets and get them out there we can actually
affect the pedagogy – the way in which things are taught” (LI5).
265

This arguably represents an opportunity for libraries to shift from outside – in to inside –out
information provision (Dempsey, 2012: 8), moving from collecting materials from the external
information environment to make them available to a local audience, to pushing out unique
local content.
This idea is echoed on a much larger scale by British Library Annual Reports which discuss on
the one hand, the role of the library in giving “its domestic users access to the rest of the
world’s knowledge and information database” (British Library, 1992: 11) and on the other
hand, its role in “Delivering services to the world” . This is later summarised more succinctly in
the recurring tagline “The world’s leading resource for scholarship, research and innovation”
and later still by the slogan “The world’s knowledge”, which seems to capture well this dual
role – both providing knowledge from the world to a local audience, and surfacing local
knowledge for a global audience. This role in pushing content out may take a number of forms
– including, most recently, the development of MOOCs such as the collaborative project
launched by the Open University and eighteen other organisations, including the British Library
and the British Council (Futurelearn, 2013). It is interesting to note the similarities between
this project and the dot com online learning website Fathom.com, led by Columbia University,
and in which the British Library collaborated in the early part of the 2000s, described briefly in
the Library’s Annual Reports.
9.4.1.4 Formats
The items identified in the British Library case study were mainly in print format. However,
innovations such as the Electronic Theses Online Service (EThOS) and the Management and
Business Studies Portal also provide access to materials in electronic format. In the Strand 2
catalogue searches, online items were more frequently identified in academic library
catalogues than in public library catalogues.
In academic libraries, collections or locations appeared to be more likely to be defined by
format or by types of access, than in public libraries.
9.4.1.5 Collection specialness
The Strand 2 search results suggested high numbers of items which were apparently unique to
a single searched library collection. More than two-thirds of titles were only located in a single
library, rising to over three-quarters of titles which had not been located in Strand 1 searches.
Even after the British Library catalogue had been searched again, using known item searching
to look for titles which had initially only been located in the Strand 2 searches, nearly half of
titles identified in Strand 1 and Strand 2 searches were only located in a single library.
266

Although the majority of items were monographs, there were also many examples of grey
literature and informally published works, or publications which were specific to a particular
location or organisation.
The Strand 2 searches also more than doubled the total number of titles identified from those
located in Strand 1. However, the titles identified by the British Library Strand 1 searches
accounted for the majority of Strand 2 search results (58.6%). Less than half the titles originally
identified in the British Library catalogue were identified in the Strand 2 catalogues.
In support of this idea of collection uniqueness, all six library and information practitioner
interviewees mentioned aspects of their libraries’ collections which they perceived to be
unique.
9.4.2 How is the library collection for social enterprise used?
The Strand 1 British Library Reading Room request figures seem to suggest relatively high
levels of use for materials identified in the British Library catalogue searches. These requests
include materials which may be assumed to be relatively widely accessible in many academic
libraries such as Naomi Klein’s No logo. It may be that the creation of the BIPC was a factor in
the apparent rise in requests from 2006. However, the usage figures for Reading Room
requests also highlight the difficulty of focusing specifically on social enterprise, partly because
of its interdisciplinary nature (relevant material may be located in texts which appear to be
unrelated) and partly because of the level of ‘noise’ or potentially irrelevant titles located in
some of the catalogue searches. This may apply especially to those titles added into the data
gathering process from the wider catalogue searches of Strand 2. Usage statistics from two
electronic resources suggest relatively low levels of use of resources relating to social
enterprise in absolute terms, although this usage is perhaps proportionally higher than usage
of resources in other minority fields. The electronic resource usage figures, proportions of
search results for social enterprise terms in the UK Web Archive, the proportion of clickthroughs to the social enterprise guide and the number of BIPC event feedback respondents
who identified themselves as belonging to a social enterprise all suggest a possible social
enterprise audience figure of 2% or less of the BIPC audience.
Other usage statistics presented some apparent contradictions. For example, there appeared
to be a contrast between the declining overall level of document supply requests for materials
for the DSC and rising levels of requests (although still relatively low in absolute terms) for
some newer journals relevant to social enterprise. The value of unique digital collections was
indicated by the high proportion of the relatively small number EThOS theses relating to social
267

enterprise which have been downloaded or ordered. The EThOS usage statistics also indicate
the international reach of these digitised theses.
Usage statistics for the industry guide for social enterprise were relatively low, especially
compared to the total number of visitors to the guide’s parent page. PDF views of MBS Portal
content relating to social enterprise also seemed relatively low, but unique MBS Portal content
in general seems to be more heavily used than content which is also available (without
registration) from other sources. The QuestionPoint statistics showed a very low level of
directly recorded email enquiries relating to social enterprise. There seems to be an interesting
contrast between the very low level of enquiries about the subject and the apparently rising
levels of use of materials about the subject.
In contrast, the Strand 3 results suggest mixed levels of use of library collections by people
interested in social enterprise. Interviewees described their uncertainty about what
information might be available from libraries. In the survey results, fewer than a third felt that
libraries were very important or essential sources of information, whilst only just over a
quarter agreed or strongly agreed that they have gone to a library to access information about
social enterprise.
Although Strand 2 catalogue searches did not provide information about how the library
collection for social enterprise is used, the prevalence of catalogues without relatively basic
search features such as phrase searching suggest that these public libraries are making clear
assumptions about the type of use their collections should expect to have, essentially
focussing on known item searching. In an interview, a policy maker involved in a review of
public library services described how library services may find themselves “making very explicit
people’s assumptions about what libraries are for” – something which may be seen as also
being demonstrated by catalogue choices.
9.4.3 What are the characteristics of the self-described information seeking behaviour of
people interested in social enterprise?
The information needs identified in the Strand 3 interviews with people involved with social
enterprise matched some of those identified by the Cabinet Office, including "information on
social return" and "information about government policy" (Cabinet Office, 2011: 58). Neither
of these were expressed directly as a “lack”, but they do seem to describe areas of identified
information needs and significant information sources. In the Strand 3 surveys, the highest
priority information needs for people interested in social enterprise related to sources of
funding, with nine out of ten describing this as very important or essential, whilst the highest

268

priority need for background information related to the social impact of social enterprises.
Nearly nine out of ten described this as very important or essential.
The Strand 3 interviews with people directly involved in social enterprise indicated the
importance of personal networks as sources of social enterprise information.
In the Strand 3 surveys, Google and websites were both most frequently ranked very
important or essential sources of information by people interested in social enterprise (37
(80.4%)) followed by personal networks (34 (73.9%)) whilst libraries were least frequently
ranked very important or essential (15 (32.6%)). This contrasted with responses to the library
and information practitioner survey; these respondents most frequently ranked personal
networks as very important or essential sources of information for social enterprise (83
(80.6%)) and more frequently ranked libraries as very important or essential sources of
information (59 (57.3%)) than Google (55 (53.4%)). In both the Strand 3 interviews and in the
surveys, people involved with social enterprise described creating and sharing pieces of
information.
9.4.4 What are stakeholders’ perceptions of library and information collections and
terminology?
The Strand 1 British Library case study reflects changing uses of terminology in a single library.
In the early Annual Reports, there appear to be distinct differences between the terminology
used in Reference, Lending and Bibliographic Services divisions. More recently, the Library has
begun to adopt the term “content” to describe both the materials it holds and external
resources to which it provides links.
The Strand 3 survey results showed a number of differences between different library sectors
in relation to preferred terms for library resources, including “stock”, “content” and “sources
of evidence”. Generally, definitions of “collection” seemed to be similar in both the library and
information practitioner survey responses and those from people interested in social
enterprise.
9.4.5 What does this study suggest about the wider issues relating to library and information
collections in the digital world?
9.4.5.1 Community analysis
The analysis of Annual Reports and collection policy and process documentation from the
Strand 1 British Library case study suggests possible methods of, and challenges to, performing
effective community analysis with such a large potential user population. Three core user
groups – researchers, business and the general public are identified in the Annual Reports
269

from the mid-1980s on. However, the content strategy refreshment exercise documentation
highlights the difficulty of obtaining a more granular picture of potential user communities.
This impression is also suggested by Strand 3 survey results, in which nearly nine out of ten
library and information practitioners agreed or strongly agreed that they have a good
understanding of the community their library or information service serves, although only just
over a third agreed or strongly agreed that community analysis would enable them to identify
emerging areas of interest such as social enterprise. Public library respondents described a
range of methods for finding out about their community, including the Public Library User
Survey (PLUS) and the MOSAIC marketing and demographic database. In the Strand 3
interviews with academic librarians, community analysis seemed to be conflated with
institutional structures – such as faculties, departments and committees. In contrast, both
publishers who were interviewed in Strand 3 emphasised their roles in serving a community,
not only of academics, but also including policy makers, students and researchers.
9.4.5.2 Collection policies and process documentation
The Strand 1 British Library collection policy and process documentation provided an
illustration of how the British Library develops and manages its unique and extensive
collections. This documentation was characterised by relatively discrete, small scale
documents setting out processes and policies relating to specific parts of the Library’s
collections. The documentation highlights both the extent to which all Library collecting
activities take place within the context of the Legal Deposit privilege and the extent of the
Library’s additional content purchases. This documentation also describes relatively complex
processes and, in some cases, combinations of processes by which the collection is developed
and managed. The documents provide variable levels of detail, and display a range of different
approaches to communicating about policies and processes, including in some cases specific
examples to assist decision making, or lists of relevant subjects or material types.
Although collection strategy documents are mentioned in Annual Reports – and the Content
Strategy is currently under review – it seems that the scale of the British Library’s collection
may make a single unified collection policy document challenging to develop and to
implement. The documentation provided by library and information practitioners in Strand 3
also suggests highly heterogeneous documentation in different libraries (and, indeed, in
relation to different collections within a single library). In the Strand 3 survey responses from
library and information practitioners, a main collection development policy or collection
management policy was the most popular type of collection policy document, used by more
than three-quarters. 82 (81.2%) agreed or strongly agreed that collection policy
270

documentation is “A working document setting out how we approach practical problems
managing the collection” – which might suggest that local small scale documentation suited to
the requirements of a particular part of the collection can be more useful than a broader
overarching strategy document.
9.4.5.3 “Free” information
The positioning of library and information practitioners in the Strand 3 interviews, in relation
to providing “free” business information seems to support Wilson and Train’s (2006: 55)
suggestion that “the public library service ethos should be maintained especially when
publicizing the fact that services are free or inexpensive when charged for”. The specific
example of Met Office meteorological data cited by SE2 demonstrates the rapidly changing
context of open access to public sector data. In autumn 2011, the government announced that
free access would be provided to previously subscription only Met Office data such as 24 hour
weather station observations (Department for Business Innovation and Skills, 2011). Some of
the challenges of providing “free” unmediated access to such data are explored by the House
of Commons Committee of Public Accounts (2012) and include the poor presentation and
limited accessibility of raw data. In the Strand 3 surveys, library and information practitioner
respondents seemed to support the idea of libraries providing access to freely available web
resources, with over two-thirds agreeing or strongly agreeing with providing links from the
catalogue to freely available web documents, such as PDFs.
9.4.6 What constitutes the concept of the library collection in the digital world?
The nuanced and sophisticated concepts of collection discussed by library and information
practitioners and people involved in social enterprise in the Strand 3 interviews provided the
basis for a proposed model of collection in the digital world including:






Collection as thing:
o Collection as a group of materials (on a subject or as “something special”)
o Collection as a group of sub-groups (organisation)
o Collection as quantity
o Collection as container / store (including preservation)
o Collection as a whole
Collection as access:
o Collection and connection
o Collection for use (promoting / facilitating use)
Collection as process:
o Collection as selection
o Collection as search
o Collection as service
271

9.5 Reviewing initial assumptions
9.5.1 The challenge of interdisciplinary subjects
Returning to the initial assumptions which motivated the choice of social enterprise as an
exemplifying case for exploring issues relating to library collections in the digital world, all
three strands have highlighted the interdisciplinary nature of social enterprise and the
challenges such subjects pose for library and information collection development and
management. Social enterprise exists at the intersection between business and a range of
social science subjects – many academic courses focusing on social enterprise or social
entrepreneurship are provided by university business schools. However, the catalogue
searching carried out as part of Strands 1 and 2 of this research project has revealed a wide
spectrum of interest in social enterprise from other disciplines beyond these key subject areas.
Some of these fields are shown in Table 9.5.1.

9.5.2 Terminological fluidity
In the Strand 2 catalogue searches the search term “Social entrepreneurship” provided most
results, followed by “Social enterprise”. However, terms relating to community enterprise also
provided additional results, whilst Strand 3 interviewees suggested the continuing relevance of
materials on related topics, which might not be identified in searches focusing solely on
current terminology.
9.5.3 New types of community
Documentation from the Strand 1 British Library case study suggested some of the challenges
of identifying potential user communities, a theme reinforced by both interview and survey
272

responses from Strand 3. Although nearly nine out of ten library and information practitioner
survey respondents agreed or strongly agreed that they have a good understanding of the
community their library or information service serves and a similar proportion agreed or
strongly agreed that their library or information service serves multiple varied communities,
fewer than half agreed or strongly agreed that communities of practice are considered when
analysing the community served by their service and only just over half agreed or strongly
agreed that communities of interest are considered when analysing the community served by
their service.
9.5.4 Format issues, formal and informal digital publications
Although some non-print resources were identified in both Strand 1 and Strand 2 catalogue
searches – including electronic theses and documents in repositories – most of the materials
identified in these strands were conventional print publications. In contrast, Strand 3 survey
responses suggested that Google and websites more generally were the resources most
frequently regarded as very important or essential by people involved with social enterprise,
as well as suggesting that library and information practitioner respondents underestimated the
perceived importance of social media as an information source. The final arrival of full
electronic legal deposit in the UK in April 2013, after more than twenty years of British Library
advocacy should help to capture more content from these types of informal information
sources.
9.6 Methodology and limitations
This study balanced a broad perspective on the library collection for social enterprise, with a
more focused study of the specific collections and services provided by the British Library. The
research design was complex, with three largely independent strands of data collection and
analysis. This provided rich data reflecting a range of perspectives on the research questions.
Strand 1 gave quite a detailed picture of the British Library’s collections relating to social
enterprise and their use. The content analysis of the Annual Reports provided insights not only
into the British Library’s work, but into the broad issues affecting libraries in general over the
last forty years. The methodology used in Strand 1 of this project could be adapted and
potentially automated to explore areas of emerging subject interest. This could begin with
word-frequency analysis of search terms or document supply requests, followed by subject
searches to explore coverage in different British Library collections.
Strand 2 gave a broad perspective on collections for social enterprise in a wide range of UK
libraries. It suggested that there is a large distributed national collection for social enterprise,
273

comprised of significant amounts of material which may be unique to a single library. It also
provided some useful insights into the limitations of different types of catalogues which are
used in different sectors.
Finally, Strand 3 proved to be particularly valuable for theory-building relating to concepts of
collection. Every interviewee had useful, interesting and often complex responses to the term
“collection”. The surveys helped to explore the broader transferability of the ideas suggested
by the interviews. The work relating to evaluating online survey tools and implementing
LimeSurvey in the Information School have a value beyond this specific project.
However, there were significant limitations to each strand. The Strand 1 British Library case
study only provided a snapshot of the Library’s historic activities (reflected in the Annual
Reports) and its current and ongoing services and projects. A number of potentially relevant
initiatives such as the beginning of the BIPC National Network and the introduction of nonprint legal deposit are not covered by this study.
The varied quality of library catalogues searched as part of the Strand 2 catalogue searches
and the mixed sampling techniques used in this strand limit the conclusions which can be
drawn from those findings. There was an initial intention to search more catalogues –
although this was not possible, the additional WorldCat searches which were conducted later
do provide an additional source of data about relevant materials in other library catalogues.
Recruiting publishers willing to participate in Strand 3 interviews proved to be challenging and
led to the decision not to invite publishers to take part in an online survey. The range of
different stakeholder groups involved in both the interviews and the surveys meant that
sampling was quite complex. There were some elements of random sampling to identify
potential survey participants, mixed with availability factors such as the presence of a contact
email address, whilst other potential participants were purposively sampled. The survey
invitations to national library librarians and information practitioners were sent to people in
only one national library. These factors, combined with the relatively low response rates, limit
the conclusions which can be drawn from the survey findings.
9.7 Contribution to knowledge
This project has explored issues relating to social enterprise information seeking behaviour and
library and information service provision on this topic. It has examined the extent of the library
collection for social enterprise in the UK and has investigated people’s perceptions of library
collection concepts and terminology.

274

Three potential new models have been proposed and are discussed in detail in the Chapter 8.
These include an extended version of a proposed revised collection development hierarchy,
shown in Table 9.7a, described in Corrall and Roberts (2012) and Roberts (2013b), but
including more detail of the further levels of collection definition.

Potential relationships have been described between ideas of collection-as-thing, collection-asaccess and collection-as-process and are illustrated in Figure 9.7b.
Presenting the relationships between the three concepts of collection in this way – intended as
a non-hierarchical diagram in which each of the concepts has equal weight – emphasises the
potential value of a more dynamic view of collection than may traditionally be associated with
libraries. Conventional views of library collections may tend to focus more on the idea of
“collection-as-thing”. Individually, ideas of “collection-as-process” and “collection-as-access”
are not new. However, by combining these three concepts of collection in this way they may
be seen as building a new conceptual approach to collection, in which there is fluidity and
interdependence between each of the three concepts. This research shows that the concept of
collection remains highly relevant in the digital world, although the onus is on libraries to
embrace all dimensions of these three concepts of collection if they wish to add maximum
value to the content they identify, select, hold, connect to, and make accessible. This model

also suggests that both librarians and users are and should be active participants in collection,
interacting with collection in myriad different ways, including by search and through linking,
and potentially co-creating collections based on these interactions.

Figure 9.7b: Concepts of collection and some of their potential inter-relationships.

276

Figure 9.7c proposes that collection adds value to objects (physical or digital) by
contextualising content, and shows how some of the same dimensions of “collection-as-thing”,
“collection-as-access” and “collection-as-process” may provide different types of context.

Figure 9.7c: Content, context and collection.
This contextual information should be surfaced more explicitly by library and information
services, in order to maximise the value of collection context for users. The idea of collection
as context may also suggest new potential directions for library and information services in
supporting individual user personal collection building. Thinking about the addition of value in
this way may also suggest new directions for examining and deconstructing the intrinsic value
of library activities more generally, in contrast to the dominant approach of quantitative
assessment of value based on outputs and outcomes.
These models provide original ways of thinking about collection in the digital world and
emphasise the importance of dynamic approaches to collection development and
management in the digital world. Returning to Charmaz’s (2006: 182-183) criteria for
evaluating grounded theory studies (credibility, originality, resonance and usefulness), these
models display originality, whilst being rooted in findings from all three strands of the project
(lending credibility to the conclusions). Positive responses from British Library staff during the
277

member-checking exercise – and comments from audience-members following presentations
relating to this research – have indicated that the findings have resonance. All three models
presented here offer approaches to practical problem-solving and opportunity-spotting in
relation to library collection activities, suggesting that these findings are also useful.
9.7.1 Recommendations
Based on findings from this project, the following specific recommendations have been made
to the British Library:






Re-evaluate how well the British Library’s existing structure reflects, accommodates
and integrates the three concepts of collection identified in this thesis. Priority should
be given to developing the central role of users as active participants in collection.
A more dynamic approach to collection: collection as process:
o Support user co-creation of collections: enable members of user communities
to volunteer link trails on specific topics to highlight web documents or useful
online communities.
o Explore new ways of identifying and addressing emerging topics of interest,
including:
 Adapting the Strand 1 methodology from this project to explore areas
of emerging subject interest and to chart latent collections of relevant
materials within the existing collection.
 Developing interoperable statistics to chart usage of diverse collection
sources – eg EThOS, Document Supply Centre data (including
potentially keyword analysis of journal article titles) and patterns in
Reading Room enquiries and catalogue search terms. Connecting
these data more effectively may help to identify emerging subject
areas and to gauge levels of collection use by people interested in
particular topics. Opening up this data for use by others may
encourage more granular data sharing between libraries. Facilitating
data sharing about collection may be one way in which the library can
act as a “hub of the nation’s library system” (British Library, 1974).
 Mapping web links relating to emerging topics – eg on news sites or
emergent Wikipedia taxonomies – could be integrated with open data
about the Library’s resources to create dynamic new topic-based
“collections”.
A more dynamic approach to collection: collection as access:
o Present subject guides in a more interactive format – LibGuides software
shows how multimedia and social media can be used to supplement
traditional bibliographic information about resources and to provide more
interactive approaches to guidance. Consider separating the current single
guide for social enterprise, environmental business, and ethical business.
o More dynamic library guides would also provide one way for curators to share
their subject expertise with librarians from other sectors (for example,
providing information about free web resources for business, or identifying
business resources in different public libraries). An alternative approach would
278



be to introduce stand-alone online tutorials, in a similar format to the British
Library’s collection care e-induction tutorial.
o Strand 2 of this project revealed significant limitations in public library
catalogues. The British Library should consider whether it could have a role in
helping public libraries to acquire, or to develop procurement guidelines for
acquiring, library management systems including catalogues. This would
return to the Library some of its original role, apparent in the Annual Reports,
of providing assistance for implementing improved catalogue systems.
o Consider webcasting London events (for example BIPC sessions) to public
libraries (possibly the BIPC regional libraries), to provide opportunities for
interested people to both engage with events featuring high profile speakers
and to have opportunities to meet and discuss with others.
o Consider embedding collection access points within online communities, such
as communities of practice for social enterprise or online social enterprise
networks. Librarians embedded in such networks could actively seek out
opportunities to provide information based on collection resources.
Practical suggestions:
o Consider how the idea of collection as the addition of context to content
relates to different subject areas in the Library. Analyse the context which is
provided by collection in different subject areas to articulate subject-specific
aims (whether these are best described as “comprehensiveness”,
“distinctiveness”, “coherence” or other terms).
o Digitise the twenty-six print-only British Library Annual Reports – a valuable
record of the development of the institution, which also sheds light on broader
political, economic, social and technological changes affecting libraries
between 1973 and 1999.
o Conduct a detailed review of existing operational policy and procedures
documentation relating to collection activities to identify examples of good
practice, emergent themes and useful tools for aiding decision-making.

Recommendations for UK libraries more generally include:










Explore how the different types of context added to content in different library
collections and sectors may be used to support individual users, and how users and
user communities can participate in adding context to content.
Develop a shared infrastructure for connecting institutional repositories to build large
scale, cross-repository “collections” in particular subject areas (such as social
enterprise) and to provide a single access point for this.
Develop cross-sectoral approaches to collection development and management,
especially for subject areas where people without formal access to academic libraries
may need access to quality research.
Work together to support public libraries in delivering on the Finch report
recommendations regarding the provision of access to open access publicly funded
research publications (Finch Group, 2012: 51).
Although some arguments have been made for providing dedicated library and
information services to social enterprise (Walton, 2013) the impression from this
research is that the current social enterprise audience is small. Some Strand 1 data
279

suggest levels of interest of less than 2% of the BIPC audience, itself only a small part
of the British Library’s total audience. Libraries need to be better able to identify and
accommodate subject areas with similarly small audiences dynamically as they
emerge.
9.7.2 Suggestions for future research
Suggestions for further research identified in the course of this project, and the sections of this
thesis on which they are based, include:
















Test the usefulness of Figure 8.5b (also Figure 9.7b) through an action research
project, which would use the model to review existing collection structures and
services, and then to identify, implement and evaluate changes.
Test the usefulness of considering collection as the addition of context to content as a
way of describing or measuring added value within library services (based on section
8.6, Figure 8.6 and Figure 9.7c).
Use a case study of the BIPC National Network to examine the role of British Library in
the UK library landscape (based on section 9.6) and particularly its role in England. A
similar project with a library in Northern Ireland would provide a useful comparison
between two countries which lack their own dedicated national libraries.
Explore the British Library’s role in relation to open access, perhaps beginning with an
evaluation of the Library’s role in UK PubMed and DataCite (based on Annual Report
discussions of these services described in section 4.2.1.2).
Explore whether the British Library could act as a facilitator of institutional repository
interoperability. This could take the form of action research to build a cross-repository
collection on business topics (this would build on the idea of “connection” emphasised
by the Library’s content strategy described in section 1.1).
Explore the impact of electronic legal deposit, potentially focusing on technical
aspects, the practicalities of building electronic legal deposit collections, or
perspectives of impact from different stakeholders. An action research project could
explore and evaluate methodologies for building a business subject collection
(including social enterprise material). The lack of coverage in this project of this new
area of the Library’s services was identified as a limitation of the research (section 9.6).
Revisit, assess and evaluate previous initiatives supported by the British Library, such
as the regional Library and Information Plans developed in the 1980s, with a particular
focus on any residual impact on current service provision, especially focusing on crosssectoral collaboration. This is based on Annual Report discussions of these initiatives,
described in section 4.2.1.1.
Action research with a social enterprise and a library to investigate information
management and information sharing techniques, aiming to bridge the gap between
social enterprise information behaviour and formal library collection. The social
enterprise would identify relevant material and the library would organise, preserve
and make it accessible to a wider audience. This would be based on a revised version
of a project proposal which was developed after a Strand 3 follow-up interview
(described at the end of section 3.7.1).

280

9.8 Publications and presentations
6 articles and papers based on this project which have so far been published, or accepted for
publication, are listed in Appendix 24. Proposed future dissemination of findings and models
from this research includes presentations at academic conferences such as the iConference
2014 (for which a proposal for a Note has been submitted) and Conceptions of Library and
Information Science (COLIS). Presentation proposals will also be submitted for conferences
which attract both academics and practitioners, such as Information Management in a
Changing World, Libraries in the Digital Age and IFLA. Having presented twice at the Charleston
Conference on Issues in Book and Serials Acquisitions, a further presentation there would
provide an opportunity to disseminate the final project findings to a large audience of
collection practitioners. Submitting a proposal for the next CILIP (Chartered Institute of Library
and Information Professionals) Umbrella conference would enable dissemination to a UK
practitioner audience.
Proposed future journal articles based on this research include:










An article discussing the usefulness of conceptualising and deconstructing specific
aspects or activities of library and information services in order to describe and
evaluate the intrinsic value of library and information services, specifically based on
8.6, Figure 8.6 and Figure 9.7c. This might be suitable for submission to JASIST (Journal
of the American Society for Information Science and Technology) or the Journal of
Documentation.
An article about the interrelationships between the three concepts of collection,
possibly for the Journal of Documentation or JASIST.
An article focusing on the British Library case study and discussing the Library’s role in
the library landscape. This might be appropriate for submission to the Journal of
Librarianship and Information Science.
An article on catalogue quality for a more practitioner focused publication, such as
CILIP Update or Library and Information Research.
A practitioner article about support for social enterprise: library opportunities and
social enterprise perceptions. This might be appropriate for CILIP Update.
An article for the Journal of Social Enterprise, presenting project findings about social
enterprise information needs and support.
An article for the Journal of Mixed Methods Research about the value of mixedmethods in accommodating breadth and depth in a single study and reflecting on the
practical issues encountered, such as the survey tool evaluation and the choice of
Fisher’s Exact test for analysing survey results.

9.9 Conclusions
This chapter has reviewed the background to this project and has summarised the main
findings from each strand. The chapter examined each of the six research questions in turn to
suggest answers to these questions, and re-examined the initial assumptions articulated when
281

selecting social enterprise as an exemplifying case for exploring issues affecting library
collections in the digital world. The contribution to knowledge made by this thesis has been
outlined, including the models proposed in Chapter 8. A number of recommendations are
suggested for the British Library and for library and information services more generally, and
possible areas for future research have been identified. Publications and presentations arising
so far from the project have been listed and topics for future journal articles and possible
conference papers based on this research have been proposed.
