ABSTRACT
Lilly, Jessica Michelle, Social capital experiences of solo middle school librarians at a
public school district in south Texas: A phenomenological study. Doctor of
Education(Educational Leadership), December, 2016, Sam Houston State University,
Huntsville, Texas.
Purpose
The results of a pilot study (Lilly Hughes, 2013) I completed in 2013 sparked my
interest in investigating the social capital activities of the solo middle school librarian. I
investigated a sample of middle school solo librarians in a large Texas school district as
they shared their participation and experiences with librarian-to-librarian social capital.
First, the social capital activities in which solo middle school librarians and other
librarians participate were identified. Second, the social capital activities in which solo
middle school librarians participate with other solo librarians within their school district
were identified. Third, the factors that influenced the solo middle school librarian’s
ability to participate in social capital activities were examined.
Method
A qualitative approach was used to determine solo middle school librarians’
opinions about social capital experiences at a public school district in south Texas. A
phenomenological approach was used because this study involves real-life, contemporary
settings. Five solo middle school librarians were interviewed in this study. Recorded,
semi-structured interviews were conducted with the solo middle school librarians at each
school or home allowing the participants to describe their feelings about and perceptions
of these experiences. Using the participants’ responses in the interviews, I interpreted the
data to understand the phenomenon.

iv

Results
A high degree of consensus across the 5 solo middle school librarians led to the
themes of collegiality, professional organizations, principal support, librarians are
teachers, and isolation. Implications for practice included librarian advocacy for
principal support of additional support staff. Findings relevant for policy included the
need for updated state library standards. The need for increased library staffing and
opportunities for solo middle school librarian to experience social capital opportunities
was confirmed. Not all participants in this study value all social capital experiences. The
same was discovered true for each participant regarding the benefit of social capital
experiences provided by professional organizations and social media on their professional
practice. All participants agreed some form of self-imposed restrictions have been made
regarding involvement in social capital experiences because each is alone on the job,
which restricts their time and stamina to engage with other school librarians.

KEY WORDS: Social capital, School librarian, Teacher isolation, Library staffing,
Collegiality, Phenomenology

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
With deepest gratitude to family, friends, cohort, and colleagues, I wish to offer
my humble thanks and appreciation. In addition, professors in the Education Department
and the Library Science Department of Sam Houston State University challenged and
stretched my thinking and learning beyond what I believed I could accomplish through
their excellence in teaching and caring encouragement.

When I needed it most during

this five and one-half year journey, I extend my thanks for your compassion.
To Dr. George Moore, my dissertation chairman, I must extend my deepest
appreciation for his constant encouragement, gentle wisdom, and humor. He never gave
up on me. My committee of Dr. Stacey Edmonson and Dr. Karin Perry must be

awesome professional example, and for their positivity. I would like to recognize the
members of Cohort 26, my friends Dr. Janet Fick, Dr. Janie Flores, Rebecca Novotny,
Dr. Janie Pickett, and Melanie Wachsmann. Ladies, you inspire me, made me better than
I thought I could be, and helped me through times that were tough, and we celebrated
much joy, too. I can’t wait to see what the future holds for us!
To my friends, especially Kimberley Arnold Parker, thank you for never giving
up on me and for being so brave. My cousins were a huge support for me through this
arduous journey. Vanessa Lilly Hospeti, my sister, I thank for being my biggest
cheerleader and believing I could actually accomplish earning my doctoral degree, during
which we suffered the loss of our mother, as we move forward toward keeping her legacy
alive.

vi

Last, I tip my doctoral tam to my beloved, Sean Garner Hughes. He helped me be
brave, his sacrifices allow(ed) me to accomplish my dreams, and he is forever embedded
in my heart with undying appreciation and awe. He is my “Stretch” and challenges me to
stretch myself beyond what I believe possible. I love you.

CHAPTER I
Introduction
Quality public schools are drivers of performance, and their effectiveness affects
our culture and economics. An equitable education for all students requires a large fiscal
investment from taxpayers. In addition, over the years, higher performance standards,
beginning with A Nation at Risk (National Commission on Excellence in Education) in
1983, have caused government officials, parents, and the business community to demand
increased student achievement (Pil & Leana, 2009). The emphasis on school-level
performance on standardized assessments encourages educators to consider student
academic achievement as “a collective effort across the school rather than as a solo
endeavor by individual teachers within the school” (Leana & Pil, 2006, p. 355). Each
year schools across the nation strive to surpass the previous year’s student academic
performance by educating a future innovative and competitive workforce (Manafy &
Gautschi, 2011).
Historically, teaching students in the United States has been an individual
professional endeavor (Warren, 1975). Teachers worked alone while planning their
lessons and taught students in the singular classroom (Pil & Leana, 2009). As per Pil and
Leana (2009), “enhancing teachers’ human capital—such as their classroom competency
and experience—has been a subject of particular attention from policy makers (p. 1101).
Now, teaching is a growing social endeavor (Frank, Zhao, & Borman, 2004; Healy, 2011;
Van Maele & Van Houtte, 2011) because teachers (a) plan lessons with others; (b)
collaborate with campus, district, and third-party professional organizations; (c) attend
professional development workshops; and (d) co-teach with other educational

2

professionals (Pil & Leana, 2009). Despite the growing number of socially-centered
teaching activities, the research literature is lacking upon teacher social capital, or
networking, collaboration, and relationship-building. Concurrently, growing evidence
exists that teacher social capital positively affects student achievement as much as teacher
human capital (Healy, 2011; Pil & Leana, 2009; Plagens, 2010). When a teacher has an
instructional question or one regarding content, he or she talks to other teachers (Leana,
2010). As educator Richard F. Elmore (2000) stated, “isolation is the enemy of
improvement” (p. 20). Collaboration between individual teachers and teams of teachers
requires communication and collegiality to enhance student learning (Lunenburg &
Ornstein, 2012).
Now, communication is considered essential in every school because education is
seen as taking place in a social atmosphere. The process that joins all stakeholders
together in the school is considered essential (Lunenburg & Ornstein, 2012). Purposeful
communication between teachers focused on teaching strategies and instructional
practices can enhance student learning and achievement (Leana, 2010). With federal and
state public leaders raising academic expectations higher each year to elevate the level of
student readiness to compete in a global economy, investigation of teacher
communication and how the communication affects student achievement is paramount.
By collaborating with other educators, teachers grow professionally, improve their
teaching skills, and increase their knowledge of content, thus providing better lessons and
environment for students (Zepeda, 2004). Students then benefit from enriched learning
opportunities. As high-stakes testing and rising standards are the 21st-century reality, all
teachers must work together to support student achievement.

3

One teacher who is overlooked in the literature is the school librarian. In Texas, a
certified school librarian must also be a teacher. Furthermore, many times the school
librarian is alone in the library, and is referred to as a solo librarian (Adams, 2011; Busch,
2011; Church & Reeve, 2011; Karabush & Pleviak, 2011; Nickel, 2011; Slusser, 2011;
Woodard, 2011). If teachers exchange purposeful communication, focused on teaching
strategies and instructional practices, that communication can enhance student learning
and achievement (Leana, 2010), then purposeful communication between school
librarians might also enhance student learning. Little (2006) stated the professional
school librarian has been professionally trained and certificated, and the effective
librarian has multiple options of professional support and development from a library
network. Library leader Diane Oberg stated librarians “need to be aware of and utilize
professional networks throughout their professional lives (Oberg, 2007, p. 342). In short,
effective librarians participate in social capital because “it is active participation in the
library…network that helps the specialist gain needed knowledge and expertise and
continue to develop those sources of power and influence” (Little, 2006, p. 14).
Moreover, research is even more deficient on investigating solo librarians’ social capital.
Problem Statement
A surfeit of research (e.g. Penuel, Riel, Krause, & Frank, 2009; Pil & Leana,
2009; Plagens, 2010; Van Maele & Van Houtte, 2011) exists investigating the
sophisticated kaleidoscope of teacher communication, or social capital, in K-12 public
schools. More specifically, teacher social capital and its effect on student efficacy
continue to be extensively investigated (Pil & Leana, 2009). As per Goe and Stickler
(2008)

4

Teacher collegiality and the willingness to collaborate have received considerable
attention in recent years as potential vehicles for improved student achievement…
it is not possible to use these data to accurately measure the impact of individual
teachers’ collaborative skills on student achievement. (pp. 6-7)
The definitive meaning of teacher social capital, however, continues to be
disputed, and is a multi- faceted, complex system (Bolino, Turnley, & Bloodgood, 2002;
Coleman, 1988; Daly & Silver, 2008; Fu, 2004; Kilduff & Brass, 2010; Lin, 1999;
Nahapiet & Ghoshal, 1998; Plagens, 2010; Tsai, 2000; Tsang, 2009; Tzanakis, 2013;
Watson & Papamarcos, 2002). The components and strategies of teacher social capital
are extensive but not conclusive. Due to the lack of standards and definitions, teacher
social capital is overlooked when professional educators investigate instructional quality
(Leana, 2010) despite findings that teacher social capital does affect student achievement
(Goe & Stickler, 2008; Penuel et al., 2009; Pil & Leana, 2009; Plagens, 2010; Van Maele
& Van Houtte, 2011).
As previously mentioned, the school librarian is overlooked when discussing
teacher social capital (Preer, 2001). Teachers teaming with other teachers are a critical
step to enhance student improvement (Costello, 1987). Knowledge sharing and
introductions to new instructional practices may benefit teachers learning (Jackson &
Bruegmann, 2009) and student achievement (Goddard, Goddard, & Tschannen-Moran,
2007). If purposeful communication between teachers focused on teaching strategies and
instructional practices can enhance student learning and achievement (Leana, 2010), then
purposeful communication between school librarians who in Texas must also be a
teacher, should also enhance student learning.

5

The topic of school librarian social capital is confounded when the librarian is a
solo librarian, and even more so when the library is understaffed according to library
standards (Busch, 2011); thus, he or she is even more challenged to provide adequate
services without at least a library clerk (Terrell, 2011). In Texas public schools, many
librarians became solo librarians due to state-level budget cuts in 2011 (Districts Sue
Texas Over Aid Formula, 2011). Before librarian personnel cuts, “Anytime a student,
parent, or staff member had a need or concern, we could address it immediately because
we had adequate staffing” (Terrell, 2011, p. 19). In Texas public schools, “cutting staff,”
as stated by Busch (2011), means “cutting services” (p. 15). As one librarian stated:
Consider all the small daily tasks done in the background that contribute to the
overall maintenance and outward credibility of the school library program. Computers up
and running, books on shelves, equipment ready and available, furniture in place,
databases and books selected and acquired, well-trained and helpful staff—all those
ingredients and more create a school library that is ready to accommodate student
research, recreational reading, best use of Web 2.0 applications, and student/teacher
contacts. So many of my former clerk's responsibilities enabled me to address the
instructional needs of students and staff. How would those jobs be accomplished without
losing the instructional component of the school library? (Busch, 2011, p. 15). The
school library, led by the state certified or licensed school librarian with support staff, can
positively impact student achievement (PA School Library Project, et. al., 2012). A
strong school library is staffed by a team of professionals, which includes clerical
assistance (Kachel, 2011).

6

Some states, (e.g., Texas) established standards and guidelines school libraries
strive to attain. Libraries and the school districts use the standards and guidelines to
address (a) teaching and learning, (b) program leadership and management, (c)
technology and information access, (d) library environment, (e) connections to the
community, and (f) information science and librarianship. For each standard, goals and
principles are evaluated by various components and identified as Exemplary, Recognized,
Acceptable, and Below Standard (School Library Programs: Standards and Guidelines
for Texas, 2005). However, according to the Texas Administrative Code, Title 13, Part 1,
Chapter 4, (Texas State Library and Archives Commission, 2005), schools are not
required to have a school library.
Purpose
The results of a pilot study (Lilly Hughes, 2013) I completed in 2013 sparked my
interest in investigating the social capital activities of the solo middle school librarian. I
investigated a sample of middle school solo librarians in a large Texas school district as
they shared their participation and experiences with librarian-to-librarian social capital.
First, the social capital activities in which solo middle school librarians and other
librarians participate were identified. Second, the social capital activities in which solo
middle school librarians participate with other solo librarians within their school district
were identified. Third, the factors that influenced the solo middle school librarian’s
ability to participate in social capital activities were examined.
Significance of the Study
If purposeful communication between teachers focused on teaching strategies and
instructional practices can enhance student learning and achievement (Leana, 2010), then

7

purposeful communication between school librarians should also enhance student
learning. However, data and literature regarding investigating school librarian social
capital is lacking (Schultz-Jones, 2009). Research and literature are even more deficient
on investigating solo librarian social capital (Galoozis, 2014). If librarian-to- librarian
social capital exists and may support student achievement, librarian social capital should
not be overlooked by educators and stakeholders (Schultz-Jones, 2009). Continued
research may assist school educators in discovering librarian social capital best practices
for increased student achievement, which will benefit all educators’ professional growth,
instructional strategies, and leadership to increase student achievement. In addition,
public school leaders may create library staffing that supports the state and national
library standards, and provides professional opportunities for librarian solo capital to
foster and grow. With more data and literature addressing the benefits of solo librarian
social capital, informed policies and decision-making by educational leaders may follow.
Research Questions
Focusing on five solo middle school librarians in a large suburban school district
in south Texas, the three research questions addressed in this qualitative study were as
follows:
1. How do solo middle school librarians perceive social capital experiences with
other solo middle school librarians in a large Texas school district?
2. How do solo middle school librarians in a large Texas school district perceive
social capital experiences with other school librarians outside of their large Texas school
district?

8

3. How do solo middle school librarians in a large Texas school district perceive
factors that influence social capital experiences?
Theoretical Framework
Social capital theory and human capital are the two theoretical frameworks
establishing the foundation for this qualitative study, as applied to the public middle
school solo librarian (Putnam, 2000). Multiple social capital theories exist, and for this
research study, the work of Bourdieu (1985), Coleman (1988), Granovetter (1973), Lin
(1999), Portes (1998), and Putnam (2000) build the framework. As evident in the
previous research, relationships matter in a person’s life (Bourdieu, 1985; Coleman,
1988; Granovetter, 1973; Howard, 2010; Johnston, Markle, & Arhar, 1988; Leana, 2010;
Leana, 2011; Leana & Pil, 2006; Lin, 1999; Nahapiet & Ghoshal, 1998; Portes, 1998;
Putnam, 2000; and Smith, 2009). For this study, a sense of community and networking
was highlighted (Bourdieu, 1985; Lin, 1999; Nahapiet & Ghoshal, 1998; Portes, 1998;
and Smith, 2009) with a focus upon interpersonal attachments (Granovetter, 1973).
Additionally, this study featured social capital and education on relationships (Putnam,
2000).
Educational practitioners and researchers (Costello, 1987; Dow, 2010; Goodlad,
1983a, 1983b; Johnson, Lustick, & Kim, 2011; Koechlin, Luhtala, & Loertscher, 2011;
Lance, 2002a, 2002b, 2002c; Leana, 2010, 2011; Oberg, 2009; Penuel, & Riel, 2007;
Penuel, et al., 2009; Plagens, 2010; Rosenholtz, 1985; Tsang, 2009; Tye, & Tye, 1984;
Tyler, 1983; Uekawa, Aladjem, & Zhang, 2006; Van Maele, & Van Houtte, 2011) have
increasingly focused on school improvement and school conditions that may increase
student achievement and benefit instructional practice. Relationships between educators

9

through collaboration and formal and informal learning communities become an
important component of school effectiveness (Healey, 2011). Within these relationships,
“teachers can share expertise, observe one another’s instruction, critically examine
teaching and learning, and develop collective norms and values” (Healey, 2011, p. 3).
Social capital framework provides understanding of how teachers’ relationships affect
their professionalism and how the relationships might relate to student achievement. In
addition, recent investigation of teacher social capital reveals that principals can influence
relationships with teachers (Healey, 2011).
Definitions
The operational definitions used in the study are defined as follows:
BLAB. BLAB is a video chat application on social media. Topic driven
conversations allow 2-4 people on air with live audience participation commenting on the
side of the live or recorded video. Participants create a virtual room in which to talk,
watch videos, or listen to music together (Blab.im, 2016).
Human capital. Human capital may be defined as “the ability, education, and
training that people bring to a job” (Leana, 2010, p. 16).
Isolation. Isolation is the “feeling experienced by teachers that no one cares about
them or what they do” (Robert, 1973, p. 4). A complex term with multiple perceptions
by teachers, what one teacher may deem isolation another deems professional autonomy
(Gaikwad & Brantley, 1992). Isolation may also be defined as “the unpleasant
experience that occurs when a person’s network of social relations at work is deficient in
some important ways, either quantitatively or qualitatively” (Dussault, et al., 1999, p.
944).

10

Librarian-to-librarian. Librarian-to-librarian means that one or more librarians
communicate, network, or collaborate with another librarian or librarians.
One-person library (OPL). A one-person library (OPL) is the only professional
librarian in a library, information or media center, or a specialized library serving specific
clientele or providing specialized services and materials (Siess, 1997, 2006; St. Clair,
1997). An OPL may also be named a solo librarian, sole-charge librarian, or one-man
band (Siess, 1999, 2006). The OPL performs all library duties, including but not limited
to acquisitions; cataloging; circulation; and reference (Siess, 1999, 2006; St. Clair, 1997).
Social capital. Social capital may be circumscribed as a social network where
stakeholders collaborate with each other, share resources, and support each other in
providing learning opportunities that benefit all stakeholders (Minckler, 2011).
Solo school librarian. The solo school librarian may be defined as “a school
librarian working alone—no paid clerk, aide, paraprofessional, or second librarian”
(Church & Reeve, 2011, p. 6). He or she may work in a small school library where staff
has always been one professional, in a library that once had clerical staff and/or another
professional colleague, or in multiple school libraries as the only professional (Church &
Reeve, 2011).
Twenty-first century skills. Twenty-first century skills is a framework for
defining the skills and aptitudes students need to be academically, economically, and
culturally successful in an era increasingly defined by information and technology. These
skills include information, communications and technology literacy, critical thinking,
problem solving, creativity, civic literacy, and global awareness (Partnership for 21st
Century Skills, 2012).

11

Delimitations
Delimitations include the site of the study: one large suburban school district in
south Texas. In addition, of the fourteen middle school solo librarians in the district, only
librarians who have at least three concurrent years (beginning fall, 2011) of experience as
a school librarian will be asked to participate. The small size of the group of middle
school solo librarians will allow for trust and amity unreachable in a larger sampling.
Last, data will be collected from a focus group interview, demographic information, and
individual interviews in the phenomenological research design.
Limitations
The first limitation in the study is that no consideration of the solo librarian’s
teaching experiences nor librarian experiences are investigated. The solo middle school
librarian is required to have only two years teaching experience. However, for the study
the solo middle school librarian must have at least three years of librarian experience.
Various teaching and librarian experiences on different grades and for various amount of
may impact the professional actions of the solo middle school librarian.
A second limitation in the study was that no consideration of the quality or
credentials of the library preparation program in which the solo middle school librarian
attended are investigated. For example, school librarian preparation programs may be
endorsed by the American Library Association, provided completely online, provided
entirely face-to-face, or taught by non-public school experienced professors. Each
experience is different and impacts the quality of the education received by the librarian,
and could impact quality of the library program.

12

A third limitation in the study was the amount of additional assistance the solo
middle school librarian may receive. Some schools have many capable and reliable
volunteers that assist with the daily clerical activities in the middle school library, and
others do not. As a result, the solo middle school librarian’s ability to provide services
beyond the clerical can be negatively affected.
Last, a fourth limitation is that data from only one large urban school in south
Texas will be collected. A small representative sample may limit the generalizability and
transferability, as explained by Onwuegbuzie (2003), that without a large representative
sample we may not apply our findings to the larger population, to solo librarians in that
district, and to other school districts in Texas or the nation that are comparable in
demographic data.
Assumptions
It is assumed that the solo school librarian is providing the same basic quality
library programming and services as specified by the district’s Librarian Appraisal
Instrument. The librarian’s three designated roles include teacher, campus leader, and
program administrator. In addition, I assumed the campus principal and staff are
supportive of the library program and along with the librarian, encourage the use of the
library’s facilities and resources. Another assumption is the solo librarian has admission
to a plethora of formats and resources for social capital activities. The last assumption is
all procedures for selection of participants, data collection, and data analysis were well
defined within the high ethical standards as stipulated by the district, Sam Houston State
University, and the Institutional Review Board.

13

Summary
Chapter I began with the explanation of the problem, purpose, and significance of
the study. The problem is the literature on teacher social capital overlooks the school
librarian. If teacher social capital focused on teaching strategies and instructional
practices can enhance student learning and achievement (Leana, 2010), then purposeful
communication between school librarians, who in Texas must also be a teacher, should
also enhance student learning. The topic of school librarian social capital is confounded
when the librarian is a solo librarian because he or she is understaffed (Busch, 2011).
Next, Chapter 1 continued with the inclusion of the study’s research questions and
theoretical framework. Social capital framework provides understanding of how
teachers’ relationships affect their professionalism and how relationships might relate to
student achievement. Specifically, Bandura’s Social Learning Theory suggests through
collaboration with others and coaching, colleagues learn from one another (Social
Learning Theory [Bandura], 2012). Definitions of key terms needed for understanding
were then included followed by delimitations, limitations, and assumptions. Last, the
organization of the study was described.
Organization of the Study
The study will be conducted to investigate the social capital experiences of solo
middle school librarians in a large urban public school district in south Texas. The
background of the study is included in Chapter I. Moreover, the surfeit of research (e.g.
Penuel, et al., 2009; Pil & Leana, 2009; Plagens, 2010; Van Maele & Van Houtte, 2011)
that exists in investigating teacher social capital in K-12 public schools. Teacher social
capital and its effect on student efficacy continue to be extensively investigated (Pil &

14

Leana, 2009). Because state-certified public school librarians in Texas must also be
teachers and are instructional staff on campus, the goal is to identify social capital
activities in which solo librarians participate.
Chapter II provides a review of literature relevant to the study. A plethora of
related topics discuss the role of the public school librarian as a teacher and leader. Then,
social capital and social capital activities in context are explained. Next, library staffing,
attributes of a strong library program, and the special challenges facing the solo librarian
are discussed.
In Chapter III the method used in my study is explained. Subsections include: (a)
the purpose of the study, (b) the research questions, (c) design overview, (d) participants,
(e) instrumentation, (f) procedures, (g) and data collection and analysis. A summary
concludes the chapter.
Chapter IV includes a discussion of the results of each participant in the study.
Emerging themes are identified and explained including: (a) collegiality, (b) professional
organizations, (c) principal support, (d) librarians are teachers, and (e) isolation. A
summary concludes the chapter. Chapter V completes the discussion of the study.
Implications and recommendations are included. I address the study’s connection to the
literature and theoretical framework. In addition, I provide implications for practice and
policy. Last, recommendations for future research and school leaders and a conclusion
complete the chapter.

CHAPTER II
Review of the Literature
A review of research related to the topic was conducted. To locate relevant
literature, I first entered the search terms social capital and school library* and solo
library* into Sam Houston State University library’s integration of Google Scholar. The
search term social capital and school library* yielded 25,900 results and the search term
solo library* returned over 39,700 results. Searches were repeated by replacing solo
library* with one-person-library because those two terms are frequently used
interchangeably. The number of times each of the resulting articles had been cited and a
review of the brief abstracts listed in the Google search results page was used as a guide
to select relevant articles. Articles that had full-text links were saved and reviewed.
To narrow the number of results and identify scholarly works the terms mentioned
above were then entered into the Academic Search Complete, Education Research
Complete, JSTOR, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Full Text databases. An
appraisal of the citations from seminal articles guided the collection of additional articles.
Studies were identified by the scope of the research. Additionally, articles were gathered
to focus on the importance of teacher isolation before gathering information about the
history, definitions, and focus of social capital.
Chapter II will provide explanation of broad topics regarding teacher isolation,
school librarians as teachers, middle school library staffing in Texas, solo librarians,
social capital theory, and the theoretical frameworks used in this study. Teacher isolation
is historically addressed. Social capital theory in relation to (a) teachers, (b) trust, (c)
human capital, (d) effects on students, (e) innovation, and (f) the role of the principal is

16

also investigated.
Isolation
Teacher isolation is a serious issue in schools (Chandler, 1983; Chenoweth, 2009;
Costello, 1987; Davis, 1987; Dussault, et al., 1999; Elmore, 2000; Flinders, 1988;
Goodlad & Klein, 1974; Levine, 1986; Lieberman & Miller, 1992, 1984; Little, 1990;
Rosenholtz & Smylie, 1984; Rothberg, 1986; Zielinski & Hoy, 1983) and separation is
encouraged (Rothberg, 1986; Su, 1990). Cox and Wood in 1980 discovered teachers
were “alienated” (Rothberg, 1986, p. 320) within their school (Hadar & Brody, 2010).
Teachers work alone in the enclosed classroom with little occasion to confer with
colleagues about best teaching practices (Davis, 1987; Flinders, 1988; Hadar & Brody,
2010; Lieberman & Miller, 1992, 1984; Little, 1990; Lortie, 1975; Rogers & Babinski,
2002; Sindberg & Lipscomb, 2005; Thompson & Hamilton, 1991). Teachers are “being
alone” (Daly & Silver, 2008, p. 541) or as Sarason stated in 1966, “teaching is a lonely
profession” (Sarason, Levine, Goldenberg, Cherlin, & Bennett, 1966, p. 74). One teacher
said “I feel like I’ve been thrown into deep water without a life preserver” due to the
isolation of schools and “no one ever asks me if I need help. No one ever comes into my
classroom. I had no idea teaching could be such a lonely job” (Fulton, Burns, &
Goldenberg, 2005).
Sarason further connected isolation to “the absence of shared practical
knowledge” (Sarason, 1982, pp. 132-133). Overall, the greater the teacher isolation, the
lower the teaching aptitude and implementation (Rosenholtz & Smylie, 1984). In 1975
Lortie noted, teaching has been characterized as taking place in isolation with the

17

formative decades of our school system formatted around teacher separation. Goodlad
and Klein (1974) concur.
Historically, schools and districts have established organizational structures which
limit interaction between teachers (Bidwell, 1965; Keedy & Robbins, 1993; Rosenholtz
& Smylie, 1984). Ultimately, isolation causes teachers to become “burned out” (Davis,
1987, p. 72). Presently, collaboration is deemed a solution to reduce professional
isolation (Sindberg & Lipscomb, 2005).
Teachers in colonial times were dispersed all over the populated territories and
isolated for long periods of time. Self-sufficient isolated adults represented “cells.”
School patterns changed as population increased in various areas and separate cells
converged in one building, organized by student age; however, teacher task
interdependence did not increase. One-room schools, however, remained, and the multiunit school did not impact teachers’ work (Lortie, 1975, 2002). The physical isolation
prevailed because “geographic barriers and extreme localism in school affairs inhibited
the creation of bonds among those who worked in schools” (Lortie, 1975, p. 20).
Decentralization was the school organization norm (Dornbusch, Glasgow, & Lin, 1996).
The 1800s produced a great expansion of schools with a fixed ratio between and
teachers and students; growth meant and still means more teachers. Teaching had high
turnover in the nineteenth century and due to demand, schools required many new
teachers. Administrators could add new classrooms and new teachers even as they lost
experienced teachers (Lortie, 1975, 2002). As Lortie (1975) states, “Such flexibility was
possible as long as teachers worked independently…but had their tasks been closely
interwoven, the comings and goings of staff members would have created administrative

18

problems” (p. 16). Teacher interdependence was minimized by the lack of interaction
with colleagues. Even after schools employed married women and the average time of
service increased, low task interdependence prevailed (Lortie, 1975, 2002).
Lortie (1975) argues that the cellular or “egg crate school” (p. 14) began to be
challenged in the 1950s. However, through the 1970s schools were organized around
teacher separation. Teachers were expected to instruct students over specific knowledge
and skills without help from others. Teaching was behind closed doors, making it
impossible for collegial evaluation to occur (Dornbusch & Scott, 1975). This format “has
played a key role in the development of the American public school” (Lortie, 1975, p.
15). This teacher separation and low task interdependence affected the demographics of
those persons drawn to the profession (Lortie, 1975, 2002). Organizational conditions
within schools also affected the ability to attract academically talented individuals to the
profession (Rosenholtz & Simpson, 1990).
In 1932, Waller’s Sociology of Teaching highlighted a foundational study of
schools and teaching. Waller was a teacher practitioner and his experiences informed his
studies (Cohen, 1989). Providing “the first comprehensive sociological analysis of the
school” (Bidwell, 1989, p. 39) Waller also first viewed schools as social organizations
(Willower & Boyd, 1989). Widely cited in other prominent works such as Lortie’s
(1975) Schoolteacher: A Sociological Study, Eisner’s (1979) The Educational
Imagination: On the Design and Evaluation of School Programs, Lightfoot’s (1983) The
Good High School: Portraits of Character and Culture, and Bogdan and Biklen’s
(1992) Qualitative Research for Education: An Introduction to Theory and

19

Methods (Testa, 1998). Waller’s observations are still relevant today when investigating
the impact of teaching on adults (Pajak, 2012).
A central question to Waller’s 1932 study was: What does teaching do to
teachers? (Waller, 1932). Hansot (1989) argued that Waller’s 1932 depiction of teachers
is timeless and universal. Waller believed that one could only learn to teach by the act of
teaching and this occupation impacted all forms of social life (Waller, 1932). During the
1930s community members schemed to keep teachers isolated from other adults to limit
their romantic activities and expressions (Pajak, 2012). Teachers are considered
outsiders with placed-upon “humbling restrictions” (Waller, 1932, p. 49). Therefore, “the
teacher is psychologically isolated from the community because he must live within the
teacher stereotype” (Waller, 1932, p. 49). The teacher stereotype is a barrier between the
teacher and all of society. As Waller (1932) stated, “the teacher can never know what
others are really like because they are not like that when the teacher is watching them.
The community can never know what the teacher is really like because the community
does not offer the teacher opportunities for normal social intercourse” (p. 49). As a
result, teachers never get to truly know themselves (Pajak, 2012).
Ironically, during the 1930s a teacher’s enforced isolation was also of the utmost
interest to the public. Members of the community would “spy upon him from curtained
windows and quiz the children for news of his doings” (Waller, 1932, pp. 62-63). A
teacher’s expression of sexuality was tremendously cautioned against and the community
took careful steps to prevent its expression. Male married teachers were preferred, and
single male teachers were discouraged from dating. Most restricted were women, who in
some communities were required to sign a statement such as: “I promise not to go out

20

with any young men…” and “I promise not to fall in love, to become engaged or secretly
married” (Waller, 1932, p. 43). As a result, the teacher is isolated from society. The
energy a teacher must spend on maintaining poise and inhibiting feelings and emotions
restricts his normal communication with others; sexuality was traded for service (Pajak,
2012).
Social distance and sterile conversation enforced a vast collective chasm between
teachers and students which, according to Waller (1932), was to discourage spontaneous
human interaction and deter emotional entanglements. The teacher, alone in the
community and divided from students, would seek out colleagues, basically strangers.
Teachers conducted their lives in accordance with the expectations of the school
(Rosenholtz, 1991).
Alienation from others and self-permeated the 1930s teacher. Because of a
teacher’s constant need to keep students’ attention while maintaining authority, along
with a drive for perfection, the teacher’s temperament, demeanor, and facial expression
were hardened. Control, rather than true feelings, led to the teacher’s loss of spontaneity.
Teachers also became alienated from students, self, and even other adults due to
mechanical routines such as emotionless gestures and the daily rhythms of routine.
Furthermore, the teacher sacrificed part of adulthood in the necessity for understanding
student culture to be successful in the classroom. Further isolation from others was
created due to the teacher’s becoming less friendly due to the demands of teaching and
loss of the essential self (Waller, 1932).
Waller (1932) did not believe that all was lost for teachers and their struggles with
isolation. He did, however, have recommendations for improvement. In short, the role

21

of the teacher would have to change as would teachers themselves (Pajak, 2012). First,
the social restrictions on teachers should be removed; teachers should fight for their right
to act as adults and embrace an adult lifestyle without the scrutiny of the community.
This would benefit current teachers and those of future generations. Waller (1932)
envisioned teachers rejecting the social norms limiting their lives and inhibiting their
personalities. Waller (1932) stated
Certainly teachers must be free outside the school. Teachers must be received as
normal and in no way exceptional members of the community; they must neither
gain nor lose status by being teachers…If teachers…invariably met the statement
“That’s no way for a teacher to act” with a cacophonous jeer, then the social
position of the profession might be changed in a very few years. (pp. 455-456)
Waller (1932) also proposed hiring married and mature teachers to impact the social
context of teaching. As a result of these recommendations being carried out, enforced
social isolation would lessen. Waller (1932) also recommended lessening teacher
isolation with psychological support.
Related to the findings of Waller (1932), today teacher identity does not belong to
the teacher (Pinar, 2004). Students, parents, administrators, politicians, corporate CEOs,
and policymakers dictate and influence teacher identities by their expectations and
preconceptions (Bikmaz & Guler, 2002; MacLure, 1993; Pinar, 2004; Woods & Jeffrey,
2002). Because politicians blame teachers for society’s ills, teachers take on even more
scrutiny as cogs in the institutional formalism wheel (Goldstein, 2014; Pinar, 2004).
Pinar (2004) recommended for teachers to overcome the “’self’ conceived by others” (p.
22) through a reflective practice.

22

Several other researchers (Bentzen, 1974; Bentzen, Williams, & Heckman, 1980;
Flinders, 1988; Goodlad, 1975; Ross, 1958; Tye & Tye, 1984; Waller, 1932) indicated
teacher isolation is an issue. In the mid-1950s, Columbia University’s diffusion studies
resulted in a suggestion that innovation in schools occurred with more extroverted
teachers (Ross, 1958; Tye & Tye, 1984). Posited in those studies conducted in the 1960s
and 1970s was the idea that teachers must be able to share information with each other
for improvement to occur (Bentzen, 1974; Goodlad, 1975; Tye & Tye, 1984).
Furthermore, in the late 1960s, groups of schools in Los Angeles, California formed by
the Research Division of the Institute for Development of Educational Activities
conducted a successful experiment (Goodlad, Sirotnik, & Overman, 1979).
The League of Cooperating Schools formed an informal network of 18 school
staffs to collaborate on strategies to improve instructional programs. The primary
opportunity to do so was through teacher sharing. This early success coupled with the
findings of A Study of Schooling in the 1980’s laid the foundation for discovering ways
for teachers to collaborate on best practices (Bentzen, 1974; Goodlad, 1975; Lieberman
& Miller, 1992, 1984; Tye & Tye, 1984). As Tye and Tye (1984) stated, “recognizing
the existence of and intervening in the pattern of social interaction is one obvious
strategy” (p. 321).
In the 1970s, Dan Lortie’s seminal work Schoolteacher: A Sociological Study was
published and continues to be cited in studies related to the working environments and
conditions of teachers (Sindberg & Lipscomb, 2005). Lortie is credited with first
identifying the concept of teacher isolation (Sindberg & Lipscomb, 2005). Lortie
believed teacher isolation is the norm in many schools resulting in a loss of valuable

23

knowledge (Lortie, 1975, 2002; Marshall, Pritchard, & Gunderson, 2004). According to
Lortie (1975, 2002) teacher isolation begins with the teacher’s college education.
Teacher preparation programs lack connecting recurrent dilemmas to available
knowledge or cited situations for study. This intellectual isolation requires the student
teacher to rely upon individual recollections, encouraging student teachers to come to
believe teaching is an individualistic, not collegial, enterprise (Lortie, 1975, p. 70).
Furthermore, a student teacher’s practicum is usually with only one professional teacher,
limiting the scope of experiences and exposure to students, and reinforcing the ideals of
traditionalism and individualism. Isolation forces the new teacher to attempt to rectify
issues independently before reaching out for assistance (Rosenholtz, 1985). Even when
teachers do finally converse, however, it is difficult for the beginning teacher to
understand and relate to practical knowledge as he or she struggles with perceiving and
interpreting what is significant (Lortie, 1975, 2002; Rosenholtz, 1985).
Lortie (1975, 2002) discovered regardless of gender and relationship status,
isolation is perceived negatively by teachers. Teachers are likely to turn to other teachers
for support (Lortie, 1975, 2002; Rothberg, 1986). According to Lortie (1975), “relying
upon other teachers to prevent loneliness intensifies the role of teaching in one’s life;
cultural isolation follows personal isolation” (p. 98).
Lortie “refers to restricted opportunities for feedback in accounting for the lack of
a technical knowledge base in teaching” (Flinders, 1988, p. 19). Isolation is, Lortie
(1975, 2002) argued, a product of historical institutional characteristics such as cellular
architecture and high teacher turnover. Lortie (1975, 2002) argued that from an
organizational perspective, teachers working independently provide greater flexibility of

24

the organization to replace them; high teacher interdependence would thwart school
management.
Seminal research by Goodlad in 1983 known as A Study of Schooling (Bentzen,
Williams, & Heckman, 1980; Goodlad, 1983a, 2004; Goodlad, Sirotnik, & Overman,
1979; Tye & Tye, 1984) indicated that teacher separation is the norm and encouragement
for teachers to collaborate on curriculum and instruction strategies is lacking (Rothberg,
1986). Goodlad based his research on the perspective teachers may hold of what
constitutes isolation (Goodlad et al., 1979). For schools to improve staff members must
be able to share new knowledge with each other (Tye & Tye, 1984). A Study of
Schooling discovered that of the 1,350 elementary and secondary teachers who
participated (Goodlad, 1983a), 75% stated their greatest influence for the content taught
was decided by their own interests, experiences, and backgrounds (Goodlad, 2004; Tye &
Tye, 1984). Only one half of the teachers relied upon district-level personnel or outside
consultants (Goodlad, 2004). If teachers rallied together to discuss best practices via
college courses, in-service workshops, or professional organization meetings, they did so
infrequently and these activities were not popular (Goodlad, 2004). In addition, teachers
were ethnocentric in their world view, transcending the physical and social environment
(Goodlad, 2004). Last, very few teachers visit colleague’s classrooms to observe best
practices and supervisors do not support the exercise. Despite the separation, all teachers
responded they perceived the best way to collaborate “would be through informal
gatherings” (Rothberg, 1986, p. 320).
Flinders in 1988 concurred with previous researchers in resolving that teacher
isolation is an important concern (Costello, 1987; Goodlad, 2004; Rothberg, 1986). He

25

argued that previous research describes isolation as commonplace and is a barrier to
innovation (Goodlad, 2004). Previous strategies to reduce isolation have failed, albeit a
problem for beginner and experienced teachers in all types and levels of schools
(Flinders, 1988).
Flinders (1988) posited isolation as an explanation of “the minimal-to-nonexistent
influence of research-based information on teacher decision making” (p. 19). Finders
also noted that isolation may be viewed differently teacher to teacher. What is isolation
for one equates to autonomy and support to another (Flinders, 1988). Flinders’
qualitative case study on teacher isolation followed 6 high school teachers and their
management of daily teaching activities. The researcher observed little to no express
contact with school administrators and only minimal contact with other teachers
(Flinders, 1988). Flinders deduced isolation “as a shared condition under which teachers
carry out daily classroom instruction” (Flinders, 1988, p. 22). Agreeing with Lortie
(1975) regarding the physical cellular nature of schools physically dividing teachers and
also teachers describing their tasks as separate from colleagues, teachers seem to accept
isolation as part of the job description (Flinders, 1988). The educators observed
purposely chose to use their classroom in which to escape collegial collaboration and
maintain that reality (Flinders, 1988). Why would teachers impose isolation upon
themselves? Flinders (1988) posits the weight of the interpersonal strains teachers are
burdened under coupled with the practical demands of the teaching profession cause selfimposed isolation. School teaching has the feeling of no definitive ending to tasks, unlike
most professions, with demands surpassing resources (Lortie, 1975).

26

Teachers set high professional standards for themselves and their actions may be
driven by their need to complete administrative tasks. Collegial interactions may thus be
seen as not only a distraction but also a threat (Flinders, 1988). Lack of time is the
culprit. Flinders’ (1988) study produced responses from teachers regarding collegial
interaction as a true hindrance to complete instructional tasks. One teacher said in
response to the idea of collaborating with administrators, “What they do best is just stay
out of my way” (Flinders, 1988, p. 24). In fact, teachers organized their activities to
prevent collegial interaction to protect their time. This adaptation strategy may be
referred to as a “practicality ethic” (Flinders, 1988, p. 25) in teaching, motivated by the
professional goal of instructional quality. As a result, isolation as a means to protect
professional excellence undermines “the very instructional quality that this work strategy
is intended to protect” (Flinders, 1988, p. 26).
In 1999 Dussault, Deaudelin, Royer, and Loiselle published their discoveries
studying the relationship between professional isolation and stress in 1,110 teachers in
Quebec, Canada. These randomly selected teachers from a sample of 2,924 elementary,
secondary, and vocational French schools were given the UCLA Loneliness Scale and
Teacher Stress Inventory; a positive and significant correlation between isolation and
stress was found (Dussault, et al., 1999). These results suggest isolation is a prominent
part of a teacher’s job (Dussault, et al., 1999).
Documented studies of teachers’ isolation exist (Aiken, 2001; Dussault et al.,
1999; Forsyth & Hoy, 1978; Smith & Scott, 1990; Zielenski & Hoy, 1983). Especially in
the elementary school, teacher feelings of isolation and alienation exist (Zielenski & Hoy,

27

1983; Akin, 2001). Akin (2001) reported on a study in which a teacher beaten by
feelings of isolation and alienation and the lack of collaborative opportunities said,
Learning as a process is an idea that is painfully neglected in my own growth as a
teacher. This idea of process gets ignored in the teacher-proof curricula we are
asked to use. In order to survive we must often pretend we know exactly what we
are doing. And when asked to make improvements, we are simply expected to
incorporate new techniques. I’m brought to my knees again and again under the
weight of the purposeful, non-acknowledgement of my own status as a learner.
This is a burdens under which I feel voiceless, unable to even think straight. (p. 10)
Isolated conditions render teachers to learn new skills through trial and error (Rosenholtz
& Smylie, 1984; Smith & Scott, 1990). Conversely, Odden and Archibald (2009), Barber
and Mourshed (2009), and Hattie (2009) all discovered collaboration between teachers
increased student achievement. Working with colleagues is especially important with
teachers because their learning is procedural, meaning feedback on performance and
altering implementation is needed for improvement (Johnson & Johnson, 1987).
In 2011, DuFour posited nothing has changed since Goodlad’s 1983 study of
schooling. Teachers continue to toil in isolation, have limited access to colleagues, and
many times prefer to labor alone (DuFour, 2011; Little, 1990). DuFour claimed
embedding professional collaboration as part of professional routine as the only way
isolation will lessen (DuFour, 2011). He stated “the structure and culture of the
organizations in which they work haven’t supported, required, or even expected them to
collaborate” (DuFour, 2011, p. 58). Teachers have been left to do as they wish, and
DuFour believes this contradicts professionalism. In short, “professional doesn’t mean

28

autonomous” (DuFour, 2011, p. 58) because collaboration with colleagues in most
professions is considered a best practice. Professional organizations such as the National
Education Association, the American Federation of Teachers, and the National
Commission on Teaching and America’s Future all recognize collaboration as a
mandatory professional activity (DuFour, 2011). However, collaboration must focus on
curriculum, assessment and performance evidence, improving professional practice, and
supporting struggling students (DuFour, 2011).
Few organizational supports exist for teachers upon which they may develop
social capital (Awang, Ismail, & Kareem, 2013). Rosenholtz (1991) identified social
organizational conditions that influence faculty collaboration (Collinson, Cook, &
Conley, 2006). When a teacher believes he or she is inept in educational technology
applications or instructional practices, they are less likely to seek out collegial advice
(Rosenholtz & Smylie, 1984). When faced with a lack of routine or the teacher feels
their students’ work is unpredictable, teachers believe requests for assistance would
negatively reflect upon their teaching performance (Collinson et al., 2006; Rosenholtz &
Smylie, 1984). Teachers also believe they have a lack of time in their busy work
schedules to facilitate social capital (Collinson & Cook, 2004; Collinson & Cook, 2001).
These conditions may keep the teacher from self-disclosure and seeking out assistance
(Collinson & Cook, 2004; Rosenholtz, 1991).
Teacher sharing professional ideas with each other is necessary (Rothberg, 1986)
yet teachers continue to work alone (Davis, 1987). Public schools do not intrinsically
support a collegial structure (Davis, 1987). Rothberg (1986) argues that teacher isolation
exists and is a problem in education today, despite “successful schools, where student

29

achievement is greatest, do not isolate teachers, but rather encourage collaborative
planning and collegial relationships” (Johnston, Markle, & Arhar, 1988, p. 28). In 1987
Johnson and Johnson concurred “cooperation with others is especially important for
teachers because much of what they need to learn is procedural…it relies heavily on
receiving feedback about performance and modifying one’s implementation until errors
are eliminated” (Johnson & Johnson, 1987, p. 27). In 1993, McLaughlin noted teacher
isolation negatively impacts teaching quality. If left unchecked, isolation may cause
teacher attrition (Davis, 1987).
Reduction of isolation is, however, achievable. Face-to-face resources are key
(Fulton, Burns, & Goldenberg, 2005) and supervisors and administrators must support
these initiatives for success (Davis, 1987; Lieberman & Miller, 1992, 1984). Solutions
include but are not limited to (a) building trust, (b) shared decision making, and (c)
training and staff development in human relations activities (Rothberg, 1986). Davis
(1987) recommended teacher supervisors who also teach classes, such as a department
chairperson, to allow teachers to observe them teaching. This activity will build trust and
collegiality between supervisors and teachers.
Once trust is developed, supervisors may encourage similar relationships between
teachers that help reduce isolation (Davis, 1987). Rothberg also recommended (a)
creation of quality circles, (b) task forces or committees to address issues, (c) teachers
and staff sharing what is it I do at staff meetings, (d) required peer observation, (e)
increased social dealings among teachers and staff; (f) attendance at professional
meetings; (g) retreats; and (h) informal staff gatherings to discuss professional reading
and/or teaching skills (Rothberg, 1986).

30

Other recommendations have appeared over the decades. Davis (1987)
encouraged teacher observation without and between departments, support groups,
cluster groups, team teaching, and joint decision-making on professional matters. Hadar
and Brody (2010) disclosed another solution is to put teachers together in groups to break
isolation (Gaikwad & Brantley, 1992). By providing opportunities for acquaintance,
discussion of shared topics of interest or discipline, and a safe environment for which this
can occur, isolation can be overcome (Dussault, et al, 1999.; Hadar & Brody, 2010;
Keedy & Robbins, 1993). As stated by Couros (2015), “Sometimes, the most valuable
thing you get from the network isn’t an idea but the inspiration or courage to try
something new” (p.54.)
In the 21st century, teacher isolation continues. The majority of teachers continue
professional activities alone, as discovered in a study by Scholastic and the Gates
Foundation (2013). Research data findings include only 3% of a teacher’s day is spent
collaborating with colleagues (Scholastic & the Gates Foundation, 2013). Furthermore,
in countries other than the US, such as Finland and Japan, where students outperform our
students on international tests, teacher collaboration is a critical component of teaching.
American teachers do believe collaboration is important. A study by Scholastic
and the Gates Foundation reported that to help teachers remain in the profession, 90% of
US teachers believe time for professional collaboration is critical (Mirel & Golfin, 2012).
Fifty-one percent of all respondents in the study expressed lack of time for collaboration
with colleagues as one of the most significant challenges they face professionally
(Scholastic & the Gates Foundation, 2013).

31

By reducing or even eradicating teacher isolation, schools can improve (Rothberg,
1986). Because no one can learn in vacuity, teachers are professionally limited in their
capacity for excellence (Hadar & Brody, 2010). Instead, “new information and ideas
emanate not only from individual learning, but also from interaction with
others…collaboration creates a culture in which further learning is stimulated and
supported” (Hadar & Brody, 2010, p. 1642). Teachers teaming with other teachers is a
critical step toward isolation plummeting (Barron & Bergen, 1992; Dussault, et al., 1999)
and student improvement increasing (Costello, 1987). Decreased isolation promotes
knowledge sharing and exposure to new instructional practices which may promote
teacher reflection on their effectiveness (Little, 1982; Smylie, 1988) which may benefit
teacher learning (Jackson & Bruegmann, 2009) and student achievement (Goddard,
Goddard, & Tschannen-Moran, 2007).
In this phenomenological dissertation proposal, the solo middle school librarians
asked to participate are also teachers. Like their colleagues teaching in the classroom,
“…the separation and isolation of content and learning how to learn not only has isolated
teacher librarians but made them invisible in school culture” (Loertscher, 2012, p. 57).
As far back as 1960, Gaver commented on the isolation of the school librarian (Gaver,
1960). Therefore, school librarian isolation is not new to education.
School Librarians Are Teachers
The evolution of school libraries influences the role of the school librarian as
teacher. School libraries are a relatively new concept in the United States. During the
18th century, classroom libraries held resources for student use. However, by the 19th
century school libraries began to be created. In 1838 New York state allocated funds

32

specifically to create school libraries (Greenman, 1913). During the second half of the
19th century students and teachers received library services through a variety of means,
many of which are continued today: (a) the public library provided books to students and
teachers; (b) the public library and school library shared materials and rotated resources;
(c) the public library existed within the school; or (d) students and teachers went without
library materials and resources (Harris, 1995; Wofford, 1940).
These methods for library services could not support the instructional needs and
interests of students and teachers like that of a dedicated, centralized library of resources
and materials on the school campus managed by a qualified individual (Woffard, 1940).
By 1915 school libraries were considered critical to advancing a school’s goals (Harris,
1995; Woffard, 1940). The cost for establishing a school library, however, was cost
prohibitive for most school districts (National Education Association, American Library
Association, & Certain, 1925). The federal government had not yet begun its role in
funding schools, but that changed in 1917 with the Smith-Hughes Act. By increasing
funding to education, secondary schools began to transform, and the school library as an
institution began its expansion (Rudy, 2003). The number of school libraries doubled in
growth from 5,290 to 11,734 between 1895 and 1912 (Greenman, 1913).
Approximately 65% of students in the United States received some type of school
library services by 1945 (American Library Association, Douglas, & American
Association of School Librarians, 1945). Secondary schools continued to improve, but
elementary schools continued to exist without school library services. Previous methods
of providing elementary students with information and reading materials continued via

33

classroom libraries, the public library, or not at all (American Library Association,
Douglas, & American Association of School Librarians, 1945).
By 1953, 95% of secondary schools received some form of library services,
although of those only 36% received services from a centralized school library (United
States Board of Education, & National Center for Education Statistics, 2005b). On the
other hand, only 25% of elementary schools received some form of library services. How
their information needs and reading materials were provided remains unclear (American
Association of School Librarians, & American Library Association, 1960).
Public education in the late 1950s proved to be in crisis mode. Due to the 1957
Sputnik launch and its impact on the Cold War, education became a matter of national
security (Rudy, 2003). The National Defense Education Act passed in 1958 did not
specifically assist school libraries, but did provide for the purchase of print and
audiovisual (AV) materials wherever needed in the schools (United States Board of
Education, & National Center for Education Statistics, 2005a).
By the early 1960s the number of schools increased, but the number of school
libraries did not (USDOE, & NCES, 2005b). With acceptance of the Standards in 1960,
it became evident that a demonstration of what strong school library programs looked
like was needed (Boardman, 1994; Sullivan, 1963). In 1962 the American Association of
School Librarians received a five-year, $1,130,00 grant from the Knapp Foundation, Inc.,
to study five elementary and three secondary school library programs and their pivotal
role in quality education (Sullivan, 1963). The grant also highlighted the value of school
libraries in the instructional program. As a result, evidence submerged that highlighted
the value of a centralized school library with multisensory materials (Boardman, 1994).

34

The Project’s impact could be seen through the hundreds of school libraries developed
and expanded and the increase demand for credentialed and qualified librarians and
support staff (Boardman, 1994).
Furthermore, in 1965 U. S. president and former teacher Lyndon Johnson was
able to secure federal funding of school library resources through Title II of the
Elementary and Secondary Education Act (USDOE, & NCES, 2005a). As a result, by
1978 the number of schools with dedicated libraries increased to 85% with an average
number of 12 books per student. This trend continued through 1990 (USDOE, & NCES,
2005b).
The 1990s and 2000s brought more change in school libraries. The number of
schools with a library and schools with a librarian began to drop. In 1993-1994, 96% of
schools had a school library and 83% of schools had a school librarian. Soon those
percentages dropped to only 92% of schools having a school library in 1999-2000
(USDOE, & NCES, 2005b). A small increase occurred in 2003-2004 and was followed
by a decline in 2007-2008 to 90% of schools having a school library and only 62%
having a school librarian (USDOE, & NCES, 2009).
During the 1920s, the American Library Association (ALA) and the National
Education Association (NEA) created Standard Library Organization and Equipment for
Secondary Schools of Different Sizes (NEA, Certain, North Central Association of
Colleges and Secondary Schools, & ALA, 1920) and Elementary School Library
Standards (NEA et al., 1925). These were the first standards created to describe what
secondary school libraries and elementary school libraries should look like and the
services the school librarian should provide. They were passed in 1920 and 1925

35

respectively. For the first time, the types of work the librarian was to perform included
(a) administrative, (b) technical, and (c) instructional.
Administrative and technical tasks included the obvious daily activities specific to
a library such as (a) collection development, (b) circulations management, (c) cataloging,
and (d) book repair. The third type of work performed by a school librarian, the
instructional role, explicitly stated in the standards that school librarians were to be of
equal status as a teacher in compensation and importance on the campus. Therefore,
since the beginning of library standards, the instructional role of librarian as teacher at
both secondary levels and the elementary level was that librarians teach students how to
search, access, and use library materials and to foster a lifelong love of reading. The
elementary standards provided specific content to be taught at each grade level, and the
secondary standards provided general recommended instructional content (NEA et al.,
1925).
The Standard Library Organization and Equipment for Secondary Schools of
Different Sizes and Elementary School Library Standards may have also established the
idea that school librarians and teachers should collaborate on instruction. These
standards dictated that school librarians and teachers meet with teachers to discuss
instructional policy (NEA, Certain, North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary
Schools, & ALA, 1920; NEA et al., 1925). In addition, both levels of school librarian
were to encourage students to become public library users (NEA, Certain, North Central
Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools, & ALA, 1920; NEA et al., 1925).
After the Great Depression and World War II, the idea of increasing spending for
education was not popular (Rudy, 2003). Despite this lack of interest, in 1945 new

36

professional standards for the school librarian were published, School Libraries for Today
and Tomorrow: Functions and Standards, again for elementary and secondary levels
(ALA, Douglas, & AASL, 1945). While the 1945 standards remained basically the same
for the administrative and technical role of school librarians, the expectations for the
instructional role deepened. For example, not only were school librarians to foster a love
for reading in students, but school librarians were to also hold deep knowledge of what
books were in their collection and each student’s reading abilities. In addition, school
librarians were to “provide an opportunity through library experiences for boys and girls
to develop helpful interest, to make satisfactory personal adjustments, and to acquire
desirable social attitudes” (ALA, Douglas, & AASL, 1945, p. 10). Also, school librarians
were expected to “cooperate with other teachers” (ALA, Douglas, & AASL, 1945, p. 12)
implying that they, too, are teachers.
The standards covered kindergarten through Grade 12 and specified the role of
school librarians in the context of learning, calling for certification of school librarians
(Kester & Jones, 2004). The standards indicated that school librarians were to provide
expertise in curriculum development by serving on committees and provide materials
through the library that supported the curriculum. School librarians were to provide
bibliographies for a variety of reading levels and interests, and provide assistance with
remedial programs. They continued to teach students how to access and use various
reference materials (ALA, Douglas, & AASL, 1945).
During the development of library standards, Francis Henne, a passionate leader
in school library advocacy supported the instructional role. She even believed that school

37

librarians should retain certification as a school librarian and a teacher. Her advocacy
impacted future library standards (Kester & Jones, 2004).
In 1960, new standards were published, Standards for School Library Programs
(AASL & ALA, 1960; Kester & Jones, 2004). Most of the descriptions of the roles of the
librarian remained unchanged, but added were serving parents and the community, and
more instructional activities. Specific activities for instruction, including but not limited
to book talks, storytelling, and reading aloud, were mentioned (Craver, 1986). Also
included were the expectations of managing a student assistant program (AASL & ALA,
1960). The idea of students being communicators of information, not only receivers of
information, was shared. The 1960 professional standards also stated that audiovisual
(AV) equipment was the jurisdiction of school libraries (AASL & ALA, 1960).
A report by the US Department of Health, Education, and Welfare published in
1963, The School Library as Materials Center, dictated that school librarians should
teach all aspects of the curriculum with their teacher colleagues (Craver, 1986). In
support of such direction, in 1965 federal funding through the Elementary and Secondary
Education Act (ESEA) positively impacted services and resources provided. This began
a period of school libraries being able to support the curricular and instructional needs of
students and teachers (Kester & Jones, 2004).
Only nine years after the previous professional standards were published,
Standards for School Library Programs (AASL & ALA, 1960) became Standards for
School Media Programs (AASL & Department of Audiovisual Instruction of the NEA,
1969). The result of the increase of audiovisual resources and media into school libraries,
the school library was renamed the media center. As a result the instructional role of the

38

librarian as teacher expanded to activities such as (a) assisting students, teachers, and
technicians in the design and production of media, (b) encouraging and supporting
student development of listening, viewing, and reading skills; (c) visiting classrooms as
an instructional resource per teacher request; and (d) providing teachers with information
about professional development opportunities (AASL & Department of Audiovisual
Instruction of the NEA, 1969; Kester & Jones, 2004). In addition, as school librarians
collaborated with students selecting materials, school librarians were expected to teach
students how to evaluate the resources (Kester & Jones, 2004). The roles of
administrative tasks and technical tasks were briefly mentioned in comparison to
instructional tasks of the school librarian (Kester & Jones, 2004).
The 1960s and 1970s were a time of tremendous change in society and culture in
the United States. This included educational change under the direction of President Ford
(Rudy, 2003), and as a result, new school librarian professional standards were published
in 1975, Media Programs: District and School (AASL & AECT, 1975). The school
librarian’s instructional role as teacher evolved due to a greater emphasis on student
communication of ideas through the creation of media and the application of information.
The school library program was to become an integral part of the larger campus
instructional program, and school librarians were to measure the effectiveness of their
programming and instruction. School librarians were to deepen and expand their role as
a teacher by facilitating course development, instructional design, and the “creation of
alternative modes of learning” (AASL & AECT, 1975, p. 13). In 1979, according to
Craver (1986), the school media specialist was referred to as a teacher in professional
literature.

39

In 1983, the government published A Nation At Risk: The Imperative for
Educational Reform. The report sounded the alarm regarding America’s inferior
education programs and their lacking to provide the level of education needed for
students to ultimately be successful and competitive in a global environment. As a result,
the report called for extreme educational reforms. More important to school libraries,
although the report did not mention libraries directly, A Nation at Risk called for
information literacy instruction, acknowledging the emerging technology and information
age and the need to provide students with the necessary skills to manage information
(Levitov, 2004). As a result, librarians began to assume a focus on their instructional role
while grappling with how to integrate emerging technologies and information literacy
instruction into the library program (Craver, 1986).
In response to A Nation at Risk, The Sandia National Laboratories published a
controversial report entitled “Perspectives on Education in America” that contradicted A
Nation at Risk (Carson, Huelskamp, & Woodall, 1993; Stedman, 1994). The Sandia
Report contended that A Nation at Risk was misleading in its depiction of declining SAT
scores, NAEP scores, and international assessment comparisons (Stedman, 1994).
However, the Sandia Report did agree that poor and urban schools needed better support
and resources for more successful schools (Carson, Huelskamp, & Woodall, 1993;
Stedman, 1994).
Computers and information technology appeared in schools in the 1980s. Once
again, such a tremendous change in education sparked the publication for new school
library professional standards. Information Power: Guidelines for School Library Media
Programs (AASL & AECT, 1988) was published in 1988. The roles of the school

40

librarian had evolved into that of (a) information specialist, (b) teacher, and (c)
instructional consultant.
The three roles added complexity and depth to the role of school librarian.
Information specialist replaced the label of administrative yet broadened its idea of what
constituted a resource; school librarians were still providing adequate materials and
guiding students and teachers to appropriate resources. The teacher role was greatly
expanded to not only the content of the curriculum, but also teaching information literacy
skills and how to use and communicate the information discovered. Content also now
included copyright, privacy, constitutional rights, critical thinking, encouraging lifelong
learning, and ensuring students understood the new role of the school librarian (AASL &
AECT, 1988). Providing professional development courses to staff grew to also
providing training to parents about how to enhance student reading, viewing and listening
skills. Last, the instructional consultant role added the component of school librarians
developing assessment development, in addition to the development of instructional
activities (AASL & AECT, 1988).
The 1998 revised publication of Information Power: Building Partnerships for
Learning and its updated professional standards were a result of computers and
technology becoming a norm in schools, providing access to information in real time
from all over the world. Instruction was the tome’s focus with indicators and subject area
connections for instructional standards; the role of teacher came to the forefront. The
new roles of the school librarian included (a) teacher, (b) instructional partner, (c)
information specialist, and (d) program administrator.

41

The most recent professional standards publication is Empowering Learners:
Guidelines for School Library Programs (AASL, 2009). The four roles of the school
librarian remain the same. However, the student learning standards were modified and
are discussed in detail in Standards for the 21st Century Learner (AASL, 2007) and in
Standards for the 21st Century Learner in Action (AASL, 2009b). These standards are
currently under revision.
On December 10, 2015, President Obama signed the Every Student Succeeds Act
(ESSA), the rewrite of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). In the
federal law, school libraries are included in what great schools should encompass.
However, school libraries are not a line item in the bill nor are there dedicated funds, so
school library professional organizations such as the American Association of School
Librarians (AASL) are advocating for opportunities to address the issues (Miller, 2016).
Sheketoff, executive president of the American Library Association Washington Office,
stated, “Now this process moves to the state and local governments . . . librarians need to
be talking to the people who run the school districts” (Miller, 2016, January, p.6).
Sketetoff went on to say, “We are no longer the sideshow or the entertainment. We are
[one] of the key elements” (Miller, 2016, p. 8).
Another provision of ESSA is the Supporting Effective School Library Programs
Act, “an authorization for developing and enhancing effective school library programs,
including professional development and support for up-to-date materials” (Vercelletto,
2016, p. 10). School libraries in the USA have faced huge budget cuts in the past,
resulting in understaffed, understocked, or closed libraries. With AASL’s definition of
an effective school library program for ESSA implementation, implementation on the

42

state and local level can begin implementation. AASL defines the term as, “An effective
school library program has a certified school librarian at the helm, provides personalized
learning environments, and offers equitable access to resources to ensure a well-rounded
education for every student” (Habley, 2016, p. 1). In addition, AASL wrote the U.S.
Department of Education (USED) in response to a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on
ESSA accountability and state plans. The recommendations, cosigned by the American
Library Association Washington Office, focus on school librarian participation in state
plan development and on the school librarian’s role in teaching digital literacy skills
(Habley, 2016).
In Texas, school librarians must hold the School Librarian Certificate (Texas
Secretary of State, 2009). Rule §239.40 of the Texas Administrative Code (TAC)
enables the holder to practice as a Prekindergarten-Grade 12 librarian. In its introduction,
the General Provisions of the law reads as follows,
Because the school librarian plays a critical role in campus effectiveness and
student achievement, the rules adopted by the State Board for Educator
Certification. . . ensure that each candidate for the School Librarian Certificate is
of the highest caliber and possesses the knowledge and skills necessary to
improve the performance of the diverse student population of this state. . . An
individual serving as a school librarian is expected to actively participate in
professional development activities to continually update his or her knowledge
and skills. Currency in best practices and research as related to both campus
leadership and student learning is essential. (Texas Secretary of State, 2009)

43

In addition, the certificate holder must have successfully completed a Texas-approved
school librarian preparation program, successfully complete the Texas school librarian
examination, hold at least a master’s degree from an accredited college or university, and
have at least 2 years of creditable years of teaching experience as a classroom teacher
(Texas Secretary of State, 2009). Texas defines creditable years of teaching experience
in 19 TAC §153.1021, in the position of teacher or higher, from entities that are (a) Texas
public elementary and secondary schools, including charter schools, (b) state regional
education service centers, (c) state departments of education, (d) Texas Department of
Corrections—Windham schools, (e) public elementary and secondary schools in all other
states of the United States or any of its territorial possessions, (f) overseas school
operated by the U.S. government, (g) Texas public or private colleges or universities, (h)
Texas private elementary and secondary schools, (i) non-public special education
contract schools, (j) Texas Department of State Health Services state hospitals and state
schools, (k) Texas veteran’s vocational school, (l) public or private colleges and
universities and private elementary and secondary school in all other states in the united
States or within its territorial possessions, (m) foreign public or private elementary and
secondary schools, colleges, and universities, (n) United States Department of the
Interior--Bureau of Indian Affairs, (o) United States service academies, (p) United States
military service, (q) Job Corps, or (r) Peace Corps (Texas Education Agency, 2015).
Currently the minimum full-time equivalent for one-half year is 90 service days (Texas
Education Agency, 2015).

Middle School Library Staffing
Historically, middle school libraries in a large suburban school district in south
Texas have been staffed with one full-time certified librarian.

Student enrollment for

each middle school is between 560 and 1,500 students; no variation exists in library
staffing regarding the variance in student enrollment. Based on the Texas library
standards, the staffing provided the school libraries with an Acceptable rating. See Table
1 for Texas library standards regarding professional staffing.

Strong Library Attributes
Quality public schools are drivers of performance and their effectiveness affects
our culture and economics. An equitable education for all students requires a large fiscal
investment from taxpayers. Over the years, higher performance standards, beginning
with A Nation at Risk (National Commission on Excellence in Education) in 1983, have
caused government officials, parents, and the business community to demand increased
student achievement (Pil & Leana, 2009). The emphasis on school-level performance on
standardized assessments encourages educators to agree student academic achievement is

46

“a collective effort across the school rather than as a solo endeavor by individual teachers
within the school” (Leana & Pil, 2006, p. 355). Each year schools across the nation strive
to surpass the previous year’s student academic performance by educating an innovative
and competitive workforce (Manafy & Gautschi, 2011).
Educational practitioners and researchers have increasingly focused on school
improvement and any school conditions that may increase student achievement and
benefit instructional practices. Strong libraries with adequate staff support student
achievement (Achterman, 2008). Researchers in multiple state-level studies have
discovered that test scores tend to be higher for schools that have a full-time, certified
school librarian, and even higher for schools with such a librarian with support staff
(Achterman, 2008).
The American Library Association (ALA), and its division of the American
Association of School Librarians (AASL) state that any school library program success,
regardless of how well designed the program is, “depends ultimately on the quality and
number of the personnel responsible for the program” (American Association of School
Librarians, 2010). With at least one certified school librarian working full-time in the
school’s library, support staff is necessary at all grade levels. Each school library should
have at least one full-time clerk for each school librarian (American Association of
School Librarians, 2010).
Texas established its School Library Programs: Standards and Guidelines for
Texas in 2001; the standards and guidelines were updated in 2005 and are currently being
updated again. Standard II of the School Library Programs: Standards and Guidelines
for Texas (2005) addressed school library staffing and rates different professional and

47

paraprofessional levels as seen in Table 1 and Table 2. With the elimination of the
library assistant, the librarian and the campus library program is most impacted by fewer
visits to the library by individual students, fewer information literacy skills instruction
contacts, fewer books and materials checked out, and reduced administration of
electronic reading programs (Smith, 2001). Strategies to deal with decreased clerical
assistance must be addressed.
Solo School Librarians and Their Work
The solo school librarian makes a long-lasting impression on administrators
because principals have no consistent information provided that may counter impressions
made as students, teachers, or aspiring administrators (Hartzell, 2002). Each individual
solo librarian’s work is therefore extremely important to the overall profession. A solo
school librarian works alone in the library that may serve hundreds of students and staff
or multiple thousands of students and staff. No paid clerks, aides, paraprofessionals, or
second librarians exist. For some solo school librarians, they once worked with other
paid staff, but are now alone. Or, perhaps the solo school librarian has always worked
alone. They deliver services that “empower others to be successful…and their
contributions get swallowed up in the activities of these people” (Hartzell, 2002, p. 95).
This may result in a type of occupational invisibility (Hartzell, 2002). Being the only
library staff member on campus limits the scheduling of the solo librarian, bringing about
isolation and invisibility (Hartzell, 2002).
Regardless, school librarianship is challenging work, and the solo school librarian
must “learn to prioritize, to work smart, to strategically use their time and resources, and
to take time for themselves, both personally and professionally” (Church & Reeve, 2011,

48

p. 7). In addition, the solo school librarian may have to let go of things that may have
always been, delegate or share responsibility, and focus on students first (Church &
Reeve, 2011).
Solo school librarians have many duties that include but are not limited to (a)
budgeting, (b) collection management, (c) lesson planning, (d) book fairs and
fundraising, (e) professional development (participating in and providing), (f) volunteer
recruiting, (g) technology resources, (h) research classes, and (i) reading promotions
(Cherry, 2011; Karabush & Pleviak, 2011). To ensure the mandatory library areas are
served, the solo school librarian must conserve resources, energy, and time by identifying
high-impact tasks that provide the most value and best supports the school’s mission
(Karabush & Pleviak, 2011). Lofrumento (2004) suggested the solo school librarian must
always first address the tasks that directly affect student learning. To get the work done,
Lofrumento (2004) also recommended the solo school librarian (a) keeps one’s desk
clean, (b) handles paper only once, (c) handles email only once, (d) doesn’t procrastinate,
(e) limits attendance to meetings, (f) shortens meetings, and (g) makes lists.
Solo School Librarians and Local Resources
Despite the lack of clerical or professional support in the solo school librarian’s
campus library, many local resources may be available to assist the solo school librarian
in his or her work. First, the solo school librarian may join campus committees such as
the school improvement committee and department chair meetings to build instructional
alliances. In addition, the professional development campus committee is an ideal arena
to promote the solo school librarian’s potential offerings and expertise to teachers, and is
the perfect scenario for library advocacy (Karabush & Pleviak, 2011). Second, a means

49

to the end of receiving support for the solo school librarian is for the solo school librarian
to become indispensable to the campus through leadership in understanding curriculum
development and implementation of new technology innovations (Karabush & Pleviak,
2011). If the solo school librarian earns linchpin status, the importance of the library to
administrators, who may then become more open to requests for additional staffing may
be solidified. Third, if a solo school librarian is from a larger urban area, the school
district may provide district-level support, such as in Mesquite ISD in Mesquite, Texas.
The district provides support for (a) acquisitions, cataloging, and processing; (b)
technology assistance; (c) programming; (d) personnel; and (e) time management
(Woodard, 2011). Support allows the solo school librarian to concentrate on instructional
and student-centered tasks. Some school districts, like the Elko County School District in
Nevada, which covers 17,100 square miles, collaborate and provide staff development
monthly either face-to-face, online via the district’s interactive video equipment, or using
Elluminate Live! (Blackboard Collaborate). For Elko County School District,
collaboration and sharing make the solo librarian feel less isolated, and improve the
school library program through librarians sharing ideas with colleagues (Nickel, 2011).
Last, the solo school librarian may join local or regional library professional
organizations.
Perhaps the most crucial support system a solo school librarian may need is the
connection to resources in day-to-day work. Karabush and Pleviak (2011) recommend
that every solo school librarian has “someone who can ‘talk you off the ledge’” (p. 51)
when he or she is overwhelmed. Face-to-face meetings provide the best support. In
addition, local school librarian groups provide opportunities for collaboration and

50

comradery with others who understand what the solo school librarian is going through.
The researchers also recommend that the solo school librarian joins educator groups, too
(Karabush & Pleviak, 2011).
Solo School Librarians and Non-Local Resources
The solo school librarian must not forget that he or she is also a great resource and
can greatly benefit and grow professionally by attending and even presenting to peers at
local and statewide conferences (Karabush & Pleviak, 2011). The cost of attending
conferences can be, however, inhibiting. If attending conferences is not possible, the
resources available to the solo school librarian include local, state, national, and
international networking resources.
Although face-to-face interaction is preferred (Baber & Waymon, 2010) web sites
provide instant and constant access to professional organizations and research. Email and
listservs such as LM_NET are open to school librarians worldwide. In addition, state
professional organizations provide listservs to facilitate communication (Church, 2011).
The American Association of School Librarians (AASL), a division of the American
Library Association (ALA), provides members a “community filled with people that will
completely understand your role” (Harvey II, 2011, p. 5). Not only does the AASL
provide members with a database of lesson plans based on the AASL library standards,
but also provides planning resources for goal setting to create a 21st century school
library. Other Web 2.0 resources abound, from Facebook groups to following library
experts on Twitter. Online learning communities exist as well (Church, 2011).

51

Theoretical Framework
Prominent experts Bourdieu (1986), Coleman (1988), and Lin (2001) explained
social capital as representing the relationships between actors and their connections to
resources secured through relationships (Healey, 2011). Specifically, Bandura’s Social
Learning Theory is used to illuminate collaboration with others and coaching through
activities such as observation, colleagues learn from one another. Other activities for
learning may include demonstration and replication (Bandura, 2012). In schools, teacher
social capital “promotes instructional innovation, the diffusion of effective teaching
practices, and facilitates school reform efforts (Healey, 2011, p. 4). When prominent in a
school, teacher social capital can influence how teachers teach to improve instruction,
and therefore increase student learning (Healey, 2011).
In schools, social capital may be described as the collegial interactions between
educators (Leana, 2010). More specifically, teacher social capital may be circumscribed
as a social network where teachers collaborate with each other, share resources, and
support each other in providing learning opportunities that benefit all stakeholders
(Minckler, 2011). Social capital resides in the relationships between teachers as they
look to other teachers for information and advice instead of experts or their principal
(Leana, 2011). Social capital activities that create social capital experiences may include:
(a) engaging in reflective discussions about teaching and learning; (b) observing a
colleague’s instruction; (c) sharing expertise; collaboration on instruction; (d) planning
for instruction with colleagues; and (e) sharing a focus with colleagues on instruction and
student learning (Healey, 2011).

52

The economical aspect of education includes human capital, which is established
by changes people make that bring skills and capabilities to their work, causing people to
behave in new ways (Blaug, 1970; Coleman, 1988). The creation of social capital is
benefited by family and community social capital (Coleman, 1988). Education has been
the focus for analysis of human capital (Sweetland, 1996) as education improves people’s
economic standing (Becker, 1964, 1993; Johnson, 1960; Schultz, 1961, 1971). The
importance of human capital theory can be observed in its formal publications record, and
its five Nobel prizes awarded since 1971 to scholars studying human capital theory
(Becker, 1993; Wright, 1992). The leading scholars of human capital theory were
Theodore W. Schultz and Gary S. Becker (Sweetland, 1996). Other leaders in the field
included Milton Friedman and Simon Kuznets’ work published in 1945, and Robert M.
Solow’s work in 1957 (Sweetland, 1996).
Social Capital Theory
The three most influential thinkers of social capital were Pierre Bourdieu, James
Coleman, and Robert Putnam. The World Bank also used social capital as an organizing
idea stating it is what holds organizations together (The World Bank, 2014). The formal
idea of social capital began, however, in the 19th century.
French aristocrat de Tocqueville (1835, 1840) wrote about the life and institutions
of early America in Democracy in Action. Regardless of socio-economic status, age, or
personality, he observed that people were forming relationships and these associations
were important to building a civilized nation. John Dewey (1915) referred to “social
capital” in 1899’s The School and Society, but did not define the term. Almost a decade
later Granovetter (1973) based his ideas on de Tocqueville’s and identified social capital

53

relationships as interpersonal ties in social networks (Daly & Silver, 2008). Granovetter
(1973) explained these strong and weak ties in social capital as “a (probably linear)
combination of the amount of time, the emotional intensity, the intimacy (mutual
confiding), and the reciprocal services which characterize the tie” (p. 1361). Granovetter
(1973) stated that trust in relationships was important regardless of the strength of
friendships or size of the social network (Daly & Silver, 2008).
Bourdieu (1985) also based his ideas on social capital on de Tocqueville’s work
(Daly & Silver, 2008). Bourdieu (1985) described social capital as not only ties to a
network, but as all of the resources in a network. Participants in the network benefited
from and created power and advantage from participating in, and having access to, the
network’s economic, social, and institutional resources (Daly & Silver, 2008). By
participating in and benefiting from the institutional relationships within the network,
people strengthened the network through their own contributions (Daly & Silver, 2008).
As the term “social capital” became more commonly used during the late 1990s, Lin
(1999) explained social capital as an “investment in social relations with expected
returns” (p. 30). Because people contribute time and resources to relationships, and do so
assuming to benefit from the give and take, social capital required relationships (Portes,
1998).
Coleman (1988) explained that social capital existed in even non-elite
relationships and came to fruition from “changes in the relations among persons that
facilitate action” (p. S100). Coleman identified three forms of social capital: (a)
obligations and expectations, (b) information conduits, and (c) social norms (Coleman,
1988). A critical attribute for obligation and expectations was trust (Daly & Silver,

54

2008). The expectation for repayment existed (Coleman, 1988) and each participant
would benefit from the endeavor (Daly & Silver, 2008; Lin, 1999). Information channels
provided communication that yielded action (Coleman, 1988; Lin, 1999). Societal norms
attributed to achievement (Coleman, 1988; Lin, 1999). In addition, social capital entailed
a broad variance of entities that were defined by function. However, Coleman (1988)
noted that one aspect of social capital does not necessarily benefit all actions.
Putnam (2000) in his tome Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American
Community pulled ideas regarding social capital from de Tocqueville and Coleman (Daly
& Silver, 2008). For Putnam (2000), mutually supportive connections or associations in
relationships enhanced the power of those participating in social capital via increased
access to information and skill sets. Participants could positively improve their career
goals and objectives instead of working to improve their organization (Daly & Silver,
2008). Networks and resources were not focused upon; rather, relationships and
connections among individuals were most important and reciprocal. This observation
allowed Putnam (2000) to identify bonding social capital versus bridging social capital.
Bonding social capital was relationships within the group (exclusive) and bridging social
capital (inclusive) was relationships outside of the group (Daly & Silver, 2008). For
successful social relationships to foster, both aspects were critical (Putnam, 2000). This
allowed citizens to resolve conflicts, foster trust, connect to each other, and supported the
achievement of goals (Putnam, 2000). Therefore, social capital is manifested by
“connectedness, trust, and exchanges” with the expectation of a return (Daly & Silver,
2008, p. 543.)

55

More recently, the spotlight on social capital has been on social cooperation
(Gilead, 2009). Group resources exemplify the interconnectedness of relationships (Oh,
Chung, & Labianca, 2004; Oh, Labianca, & Chung, 2006). Skocpol (2003) remarked on
the decline of US associational life and the new management of civic organization by
privileged Americans. Bookman (2004) focused on new forms of social capital
developing among families, especially regarding the needs of women. “Hybrid”
associations, such as the non-profit organization, have developed into important
collective action (Sampson, et al., 2005). Wilkinson and Pickett (2009) recognized
inequality affects the important social capital component of trust. Last, Baber and
Waymon (2010) emphasize face-to-face networking is essential to productivity and
information integration.
Librarian and teacher social capital. The review of literature produced insight
on how teacher social capital (a) requires trust, (b) is most effective paired with human
capital, (c) effects students in other areas besides student achievement on assessments, (d)
inspires innovation in instruction, and (e) needs principal leadership to grow. In addition,
my statements from the literature suggested the solo librarian often lacks the resources
for exemplary social capital; whatever social capital is acquired, however, is greatly
appreciated by the librarian. The same themes were later found to infiltrate the data
collected from the middle school solo librarian focus group when discussing their social
capital activities within the school district, and outside of the school district.
Social capital and trust. Several researchers (Penuel, et al., 2009; Pil & Leana,
2009; Plagens, 2010; Van Maele & Van Houtte, 2011) have identified trust as an
important component of teacher social capital and trust assisted teachers in becoming

56

better instructors; therefore, teacher trust increased student achievement. Penuel, Riel,
Krause, and Frank (2009) suggested that social capital, including trust, provided teacher
access to the resources that effect change. Plagens (2010) expanded on the idea that
individuals socially connected to others, forming a trusting network or group membership
as a resource, were better able to achieve their goals. Van Maele and Van Houtte (2011)
explained that previous research results concluded an important component of an
effective school was strong social capital, and trust specifically affected a school’s
performance.

Building trust is a multifaceted process. Lunenburg and Ornstein (2012)

concluded that schools could not exist without trust, and trust could only be developed
through intimate, professional experiences. Pil and Leana (2009) discovered that when
teachers trusted each other, they showed their vulnerability to weaknesses and would
seek assistance from other teachers and their principal. Van Maele and Van Houtte
(2011) affirmed that trust was the foundation of social capital and teachers seek trust
from their (a) students, (b) parents, (c) colleagues, and (d) principal. In addition, the
authors stated that three aspects affected trust relations: surface level; value-oriented
standards and norms; and basic underlying assumptions (Van Maele & Van Houtte,
2011). The authors also proposed that a school staff’s homogeneity related to trust, and
that similar work values built trust.
Social capital and human capital. Researcher Leana (2010) explained that social
capital and human capital, which means teacher knowledge, skills, and credentials,
worked together to assist with student academic achievement. Leana (2010) argued that
to improve an entire school instead of only individual teachers, both social and human
capital must exist. She explained that the ideal situation of social and human capital

57

working together created a trusting climate, which was even more important than human
capital.

In reference to one study, Leana (2010) researched all public schools in a district

and found that social capital was extremely powerful. In a second study of over 200
elementary schools she discovered “human capital and social capital are inextricably
intertwined” (Leana, 2010, p. 19). Pil and Leana (2009) detailed how social capital and
human capital work together to increase student achievement. Pil and Leana (2009)
further stated that teacher social capital had been ignored by policy makers because of
“growing evidence . . . that teacher collaboration and trust may have as great an effect on
student achievement as teacher human capital” (Pil & Leana, 2009, p.1101). The authors
studied 1,013 public elementary school math teachers in a northeast U.S. large urban
school district. Pil and Leana (2009) found that first, regarding human capital theory,
teacher formal education did provide student performance gains. Second, regarding
social capital, students performed better when strong horizontal relations existed on the
group level, but vertical strength only affected the individual level. However, student
academic achievement existed when teachers had strong relationships with school
administrators, but the same could not be said for the team level. Third, Pil and Leana
(2009) learned that a teacher’s most useful professional advice came from one’s gradelevel team. Last, high-ability teachers in groups with strong ties elicited higher
performance from students. The authors recommended social capital should not be
underestimated and policy makers should consider requiring the fostering of social
capital on campuses.
Effects of social capital on students. Teacher social capital affects students in
other ways besides grades on a report card. For example, Plagens (2010) reviewed

58

studies on social capital in the educational arena and the Chicago Public Schools in 2001
via public opinion surveys of teachers and principals. Research linked an increase in
attendance, a decrease in the dropout rate, and an increase in achievement with social
capital (Plagens, 2010). The author shared that “social capital affects achievement
because it helps overcome dilemmas of collective action and encourages altruism and
social solidarity” (Plagens, 2010, p. 19). The author recommended that these findings
would be interesting to public officials and citizens who seek to improve schools so that
teacher social capital may be promoted. Plagens (2010) also stated that social capital
might be a predictor of dropout rates. He cautioned, however, that the racial and
economic representation in the sample schools were imbalanced compared to the rest of
the country.
Social capital and innovation. Schools often turn to innovative ideas to enhance
student learning. Couros (2015) defines innovation as “a way of thinking that creates
something new and better” (p.19). The innovative implementation of new math
curriculum was altered by teacher social capital. Coburn and Russell (2006) presented a
paper at the annual conference of the American Sociological Association that expressed
their conclusions to researching the determinants of teacher social capital networks
during the implementation of new innovative mathematics curriculum. The two urban
school districts studied included high-poverty neighborhoods and a large number of
recent immigrants. The authors reviewed data from eight elementary schools during the
first year of a 3-year National Science Foundation-funded study on reform strategy,
human and social capital, and implementation of an innovative mathematics curriculum.
Using questioning, observations, and interviews, the authors discovered that the informal

59

structures of teacher interaction were more beneficial that the formal ones (Coburn &
Russell, 2006). In addition, the new curriculum did not influence the social networks but
the campus strategy did. Organizational decisions such as room assignments and
scheduled planning times provided ease of access to teacher interactions, and teachers
reached out to other teachers they perceived to be alike to structurally rather than teachers
they perceived to be content experts. The authors further cautioned that their findings
were limited because they did not apply interview protocol with all stakeholders or
quantitative social network approaches (Coburn & Russell, 2006).
Another research topic was the application of new and innovative technology and
the presence of teacher social capital. Frank, Zhao, and Borman (2004) decided to learn
more about implementing innovative practices in schools, and specifically how social
capital and diffusion of computer technology innovations in public schools were affected.
The authors defined computer innovations as “the Internet, educational software, and the
digital camera” (Frank, Zhao, & Borman, 2004, p. 149). To learn more, the authors
studied six schools in the northern Midwest and Southwest of the U.S. serving students
K-12 and ranging in socioeconomic status and wide variations of ethnicity. The
researchers surveyed, observed, and interviewed 230 teachers and principals between
March and May 2000 and again between March and May 2001 (Frank et al., 2004). They
discovered quality social capital exchanges depended on the quality of the resources, and
that social capital manifested when teachers exchanged expertise through informal
means. In addition, social pressure to use the new technology existed. Therefore, social
capital was found to be an important force in successful implementation of new computer

60

technology. Suggested future research included investigation of social capital on a
multilevel framework and research on a larger or smaller scale (Frank et al., 2004).
Social capital and the principal’s role. Principals and other school leaders play
an integral role in building and sustaining teacher social capital. Leana (2010) stated that
because social capital affected teacher ability and motivation, she recommended that to
increase teacher ability, school leaders should give teachers more time to study
improving teaching strategies. Other recommendations by Leana (2010) included the
importance of group-level incentives becoming the norm because
Fundamental to social capital is a shared feeling among teachers that each of them
is going to do more than they have to do because each knows they can count on
others . . . They have a shared destiny and a shared purpose. (p. 22)
When two California elementary schools’ leadership wished to improve literacy
instruction and support teacher collegial interactions by implementing new literacy
curriculum, Penuel et al. (2009) studied social capital associated with changing
instruction and the principal’s leadership. The authors suggested that social capital
provided teacher access to the resources that effect change. Penuel et al. (2009)
suggested for change to be successful, teachers’ interactions must be focused on
discussing improving instruction. In fact, teachers benefited from purposeful time to
discuss instruction. The success of teacher interaction and student achievement in
literacy of the two schools, despite similar resources, was vastly different. One principal
alienated her staff by relying on outside experts to design teaching strategies, and the
other principal relied on her staff to design teaching strategies (Penuel et al., 2009). The
researcher (Penuel et al., 2009) cautioned that further studies needed to include classroom

61

observations. Other researchers discovered similar results regarding the role of the
principal in supporting and nurturing teachers’ social capital. Coburn and Russell (2006)
established school leaders played an integral function in supporting teachers’ social
networks beyond the campus. Likewise, in regards to supporting teachers’ social
networks, Penuel et al. (2009) recommended principals who wish to facilitate teacher
collaboration should value teacher expertise and knowledge, and foster higher teacher
social capital. On the campus, Frank, Zhao, and Borman (2004) suggested that principals
provide professional development time to teachers, support ambivalent teachers to learn
more and share with others, and encourage interaction between departments. Principals
should also create a culture that explicitly defines the school’s purpose (Dornbusch,
Glasgow, & Lin, 1996). When implementing innovation on the campus, Frank et al.
(2004) cautioned that principals must be cognizant of social capital as a fixed resource,
they must be aware of other innovations that could affect social capital resources, and
realize that one effectively implemented innovation at one school may not hold the same
result in another.

CHAPTER III
Methods
Purpose of the Study
As a result of a pilot study (Lilly Hughes, 2013), I investigated a sample of solo
middle school librarians in a large Texas school district as they shared their participation
and experiences with librarian-to- librarian social capital. Social capital may be
circumscribed as a social network where stakeholders collaborate with each other, share
resources, and support each other in providing learning opportunities that benefit all
stakeholders (Minckler, 2011). First, the social capital activities in which solo middle
school librarians and other librarians participated were identified. Second, the social
capital activities in which solo middle school librarians participated with other solo
librarians within their school district were identified. Third, the factors that influenced
the solo middle school librarian’s ability to participate in social capital activities were
examined. Last, the social capital activities solo middle school librarians believed to
increase their job performance and student learning were examined.
Research Questions
Focusing on solo middle school librarians in a large suburban school district in
south Texas, the three research questions addressed in this qualitative study were as
follows:
1. How do solo middle school librarians perceive social capital experiences with
other solo middle school librarians in a large Texas school district?

63

2. How do solo middle school librarians in a large Texas school district perceive
social capital experiences with other school librarians outside of their large Texas school
district?
3. How do solo middle school librarians in a large Texas school district perceive
factors that influence social capital experiences?
Overview of Design
A qualitative phenomenological study was used to investigate the psychological
and philosophical attributes of individuals (Creswell, 2013). Perceptions and meanings
of a common phenomenon, participants’ lived experience, were explored to find the
commonalities and generalities within (Creswell, 2013; Moustakas, 1994). Words and
actions of lived experiences were explored (Moustakas, 1994; Wall, Glenn, Mitchinson,
& Poole, 2004) to understand their wholeness (Moustakas, 1994).
Edward Husserl, a German philosopher and mathematician, founded
phenomenology in the early 20th century, establishing his ideas on Descartes’ view of
removing assumptions from philosophy (Buckingham et al., 2011; Moustakas, 1994).
Soon after, the works of philosophers Martin Heidegger and Maurice Merleau-Ponty
continued Husserl’s work to ultimately found the crux of existentialism (Buckingham et
al., 2011). As stated by Creswell (2013), phenomenological assumptions are based on
the common grounds of “. . . the study of the lived experiences of persons, the view that
these experiences are conscious . . . , and the development of descriptions of the essences
of these experiences . . .” (p.77).
Moustakas (1994) based his transcendental phenomenological research method on
Husserl’s work. Moustakas’ research method differs from other qualitative research

64

methods (i.e. ethnography, hermeneutics, and empirical phenomenology) in approach to
the study, data gathering methodology, and data analysis methodology. A systematic
approach was applied to put aside the researcher’s preconceived ideas about the
phenomenon being researched (called the Epoche) so that the researcher listened with an
open and receptive mind (Moustakas, 1994). Intuition and imagination during data
collection focused on perceptions and feelings with all statements first treated as equally
important (Moustakas, 1994).
Creswell (2013) described a phenomenological study as investigating “the
common meaning for several individuals of their lived experiences of a concept or
phenomenon” (p. 76) to find its “universal essence” (p. 76). The researcher investigated
the individuals experiencing the phenomenon, and created an amalgamated account of
“what” and “how” they encountered the phenomenon (Moustakas, 1994). Popular in the
study of education (Creswell, 2013) and based on the writings of Tesch (1988) and van
Manen (1990), the philosophical assumptions had a common foundation: the conscious
experiences were described (van Manen, 1990) and the essences were described, not
analyzed (Moustakas, 1994).
Moustakas (1994) suggested phenomenological investigations have four
processes: (a) the Epoche, (b) phenomenological reduction, (c) imaginative variation, and
(d) synthesis. Husserl called the first process, the Epoche, “the freedom from
suppositions” (Moustakas, 1994, p. 85) and an experience itself for the ever present and
receptive researcher who perceived and experiences (Moustakas, 1994). The second
process, phenomenological reduction, provided the researcher the opportunity to focus on
the qualities of the experience. The approach was “elucidating one’s knowledge”

65

(Moustakas, 1994, p. 91) to find meaning in everything in the phenomenon leading back
to the researcher’s experiences (Moustakas, 1994). Steps included: (1) bracketing [sic],
where the research focus was placed in brackets; (2) horizonalizing to create Horizons,
which were “the invariant constituents of the phenomenon” (Moustakas, 1994, p. 97); (3)
clustering the horizons into themes, and (4) organizing the horizons and themes into a
coherent textural description of the phenomenon (Moustakas, 1994). The third process of
imaginative variation was using the imagination to describe the essential structures of a
phenomenon toward meanings. The last process was the synthesis of meanings and
essences of the phenomenon as a whole (Moustakas, 1994). These processes provided a
methodology from which we understood the meaning of the phenomenon via human
experiences, perceptions, and feelings.
Creswell (2013) based his studies on phenomenology on Moustakas (1994) for a
psychological perspective and van Manen (1990) for human science. Features included
•

an emphasis on a phenomenon to be explored;

•

the exploration of this phenomenon with a group of individuals who have all
experienced the phenomenon;

•

a philosophical discussion about the basic ideas involved in conducting a
phenomenology;

•

the researcher brackets…herself out of the study by discussing personal experiences
with the phenomenon;

•

a data collection procedure that involves typically interviewing individuals who have
experienced the phenomenon;

66
•

data analysis that can follow systematic procedures that move from the narrow units
of analysis to broader units…and on to detailed descriptions that summarize …
“what” the individuals have experiences and “how” they experienced it; and

•

[it] ends with a descriptive passage that discusses the essence of the experience…The
“essence” is the culminating aspect of a phenomenological study. (Creswell, 2013 pp.
78-79).
Today the solo middle school librarian’s participation in social capital activities

has very little literature addressing the phenomenon. The opportunity for the solo middle
school librarian to participate in social capital activities influences job performance and
student learning, and should be of interest to education leaders.
Sampling and Participants
As per Onwuegbuzie and Collins (2007), qualitative studies do not, like
quantitative studies, apply statistical generalizations to the population. As a result,
instead of random sampling, qualitative studies use a sampling scheme (Onwuegbuzie &
Collins, 2007). Participants must know something about a shared topic to illustrate their
experiences (Marshall, 1996) and describe their observations of the phenomenon
(Creswell, 2013). As a result, qualitative studies require a non-random (probabilistic
sampling) scheme (Onwuegbuzie & Collins, 2007).
External and internal generalizability influence qualitative and quantitative
research (Maxwell, 1992). In quantitative research, external generalizability is used
where findings are applied to a population. In qualitative research, however, internal
generalizability is applied and as a result, sample selection becomes even more important.

67

Therefore, purposeful methods for selecting participants must be in place (Onwuegbuzie
& Leech, 2005).
For a phenomenological study, several participant selection strategies must be
implemented. As per Creswell (2013) and Johnson and Christensen (2010), the
researcher must (a) establish a sampling strategy, (b) identify the appropriate number of
people to interview, (c) look at the research questions for guidance on whom to choose to
interview, (d) and decide upon the approach of selecting participants. Phenomenological
research guides all aspects of selection (Creswell, 2013; Marshall, 1996).
Purposeful sampling, most commonly used in phenomenological research of
information-rich studies (Miles, Huberman, & Saldaña, 2013), was utilized. The
experiences of participants were not generalized to the population (Onwuegbuzie &
Collins, 2007). Because the solo middle school librarians shared their experiences as
participants in solo capital activities, purposeful sampling was suitable.
Using the purposeful sampling technique, I selected the solo middle school
librarians. I first limited the 14 current solo middle school librarians group to those who
had at least three consecutive school years’ experience as a solo middle school librarian
in the school district. I gleaned this information from the school district’s library
director. From those who met the criteria, I contacted their principal via encrypted
electronic mail to invite each librarian to participate in this phenomenological study.
From those principals who agreed I could approach each librarian, I contacted the
librarian via encrypted electronic mail to invite each to participate in this
phenomenological study. With those who agreed to participate, I scheduled a time for the
interview within a three-week window. From those who could meet this time constraint I

68

met with five solo middle school librarians privately for individual interviews. I chose
participants with the most overall years of experience as a school librarian in the school
district. I implemented this technique because this characteristic provided me with
increased insight to the phenomenon (Onwuegbuzie & Collins, 2007).
Determining the adequate number of participants was debatable (Creswell, 2013;
Johnson & Christensen, 2010). The number of appropriate participants to interview in a
phenomenological study has yet to be agreed upon, and recommended numbers vary.
Creswell (2013) suggests between five and 25 participants, but Marshall (1996)
recommends a more flexible suggestion of interviewing participants until data saturation
occurs. No new data emerging defines data saturation (Onwuegbuzie & Leech, 2005).
The number of participants I chose for the individual interviews fit within the ranges
recommended by researchers (Creswell, 2013; Johnson & Christensen, 2010; Morgan,
1997). Each participant was provided a pseudonym to protect their anonymity.
Instrumentation
Of the several characteristics of phenomenological research, the researcher is a
key instrument to examine, observe, and interview sources and then interpret data
sources, collection, and analysis; I am the main instrument for data collection and
analysis (Creswell, 2013; Leech & Onwuegbuzie, 2008). My role as researcher is
disclosed in this section. In addition, specific instruments and data collection processes
are explained.
Role of the Researcher
Influenced by Descartes, Husserl’s principle of Epoche in the phenomenology
philosophy is to set aside one’s preconceived notions or postulations so that clear

69

understanding of the phenomenon may come to fruition (Dowling, 2007; Hamill &
Sinclair, 2010). Researchers in phenomenological studies put aside their biases to create
a new perspective to the phenomena (Creswell, 2013). Moustakas (1994) uses Husserl’s
term of Epoche when referring to bracketing (Creswell, 2013; Hamill & Sinclair, 2010;
van Manen, 1990; Wall et al., 2004; Williams & Morrow, 2009). Bracketing is putting
the research focused upon in brackets; all other data are put aside (Moustakas, 1994).
I hold certifications in Texas for secondary language arts teacher, school librarian,
and school principal, and have 27 years of experience as a Texas educator. My first
encounter with middle school librarians began in 1994, when I first became an
elementary school librarian in a large, suburban school district in southeast Texas.
Observing them at all-level librarians’ meetings, they seemed to keep to themselves and
not be as vocal as the elementary school and high school groups of school librarians.
When I became a high school librarian three years later, my exposure to them remained
the same, and they continued to keep to themselves. Only when I was promoted to
district-level library coordinator five years later did I begin to experience their
personalities and professionalism. During this time middle school librarians became solo
middle school librarians. Again, I only saw a fraction of whom they were, and felt that
they were the library program’s weakest link.
I was finally exposed to their true selves when I went back to the campus nine
years after being library coordinator, as a solo middle school librarian. Between the fall
of 2011 and fall 2012 I was a complete member of the middle school solo librarians;
however, mid-fall of 2012 I left the group due to a leadership promotion in a different
large suburban district in south Texas. For the 16 months I was a solo middle school

70

librarian, getting to know the library programming, collegial spirit, kindness, and
creativity first-hand elevated my professional and personal opinion of each of them. As a
result, my interest in the solo middle school librarian continued to my new leadership
position in a large suburban district in south Texas.
I am also an introvert. I am uncomfortable in social settings and gain energy by
participating in quiet, solo activities. I am not necessarily someone who talks much
except on topics on which I am passionate. Over 100 years ago, Carl Jung identified the
psychological types of introvert and extrovert, but did proclaim that no one is purely one
or the other (Cain, 2013). Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary narrowly defines
introversion as “the state of or tendency toward being wholly or predominantly concerned
with and interested in one’s own mental life” (2012, p. 657). Today’s experts, however,
disagree with this definition. Laney (2002) explained,
Introversion…is a healthy capacity to tune into your inner world. It is a
constructive and creative quality…found in many independent thinkers whose
contributions have enriched the world. Introverts have social skills, they like
people, and they enjoy some types of socializing. (p. 43)
Introverts simply recharge by taking part it quiet activities in solitude (Cain,
2013). In the past, I have worried that my introversion negatively impacted my
participation in social capital, and I have negatively associated introversion with being
quiet. However, Cain (2013) says, “We perceive talkers as smarter than quiet types—
even though grade-point averages and SAT and intelligence test scores reveal this
perception to be inaccurate” (p. 51). So as an introvert, of which I am in company with
50% of the world’s population (Baber & Waymon, 2010), I do, as an introvert, bring

71

positive contributions to the social capital arena. Ironically, because of participation in
social capital being challenging for me, I am more interested in the phenomenon. Today,
more professionals expound upon the significance of social capital (Baber & Waymon,
2010).
My relationship with the school district was bracketed to focus on librarian lived
experiences (Creswell, 2013; Hamill & Sinclair, 2010; Moustakas, 1994). I used
bracketing (Hamill & Sinclair, 2010), or the Epoche (Moustakas, 1994), to ignore
personal assumptions and feelings about the study’s participants and the school district.
To reduce bias, I focused upon what the librarians said in response to questions compared
to my personal reactions through reflexivity, or self-reflection (Creswell, 2013; Merriam,
2009; Wall et al., 2004; Williams & Morrow, 2009). Informal member checking, which
required me to ask librarians in the study for feedback on the accuracy of my findings,
assisted in ensuring precise data analysis (Lincoln & Guba, 1985; Merriam, 2009) as I
minimized my personal thoughts.
Procedures
Working with my doctoral chair and committee, I sought their approval to
conduct the research. After chair and committee approval, I sought permission from the
large suburban south Texas school district to conduct research. The school district
granted approval for my research. After the school district granted approval I submitted
the Institutional Review Board (IRB) Application to Sam Houston State University
(SHSU). The IRB at SHSU granted approval. After both school district and IRB at
SHSU approval I contacted the school district’s library director, campus principals, and
pool of participants via encrypted electronic mail to begin data gathering activities. After

72

I received affirmative responses, each participant received an encrypted electronic folder
that included the following items: (a) a consent form; (b) a demographic survey; and (c)
the interview questions for preparation of the interview. Each item was styled as an
encrypted Google form so that participants could respond to the inquiries or create
personal notes electronically. Google forms allowed for expedited data collection.
Individual interviews were scheduled with five solo middle school librarians.
After I identified each item in the folder with the participants, they were asked to sign the
consent form when I interviewed them face-to-face, and electronically completed the
encrypted electronic demographic survey. The survey included questions about age,
gender, race, level of experience, and formal education levels.

Participants were asked

to respond to open-ended questions about social capital opportunities within the school
district, outside of the school district, their perceived level of support from school
administrators, and their perceived attitudes to how social capital impacts their
professional goals. Encrypted audio recordings as well as researcher notes were saved
from the interview, and subsequently, responses were transcribed.
For effective research, Creswell (2013) recommended researchers use two of
eight strategies in qualitative research: prolonged engagement and persistent observation;
triangulation; peer review or debriefing; negative case analysis; clarifying researcher
bias; member checking; rich, thick description; and external audits. Of these, Creswell
(2013) stated the most reasonable to apply are triangulation, writing detailed descriptions,
and member checking. I employed clarifying researcher bias, and member checking.
I have clarified my bias as researcher. I have highlighted several past
experiences, biases, and prejudices that impacted my interpretation of and approach to

73

this study (Creswell 2009, 2013). I challenged myself by confronting my introverted
tendencies by interviewing participants (which was uncomfortable for me), and attempted
to build social capital with participants by doing so.
Informal member checks (Lincoln & Guba, 1985), also called respondent
validation, were used to obtain feedback from interviewees regarding my findings in
progress (Creswell, 2009, 2013; Merriam, 2009). Considered the most important
technique to establish credibility, I went back to the participants so they judged my
interpretation of the data and provided suggestions for better capture of perspective
(Merriam, 2009). Participant feedback allowed for improved representation and
interpretation of their experiences (Creswell, 2009, 2013; Merriam, 2009). I sent the
participants a copy of my comments, observations, and interpretations for confirmation of
accuracy and my understanding.
Access to the individual interview questions were provided in an encrypted
electronic file. Encrypted electronic access to the questions allowed participants to
prepare their answers to expedite time limitations and allow for more thoughtful
responses. Questions included topics such as specific social capital opportunities and
solo librarian factors that may influence these activities. Questions flowed from one
question to the next with transitional phrases. Encrypted audio recordings as well as
researcher notes were saved from the interview, and subsequently, responses were
transcribed.
In an effort to record and organize the data, the interview protocol included one
open-ended question per page recording (Moustakas, 1991). I recorded the responses and
my reactions to the interviewee’s comments via memoing (Creswell, 2013; Miles et al.,

74

2013). Memoing is writing a narrative describing my reflections about the data,
analyzing their meaning, and contemplating my thought processes (Creswell, 2013;
Edmonson & Irby, 2008; Miles et al., 2013). I implemented memoing throughout the
data collection process. Words are the most basic focus of the data and the medium, so
memoing contributed to my coding (Miles et al., 2013).
In addition, to allow for possible technical difficulties, a back-up battery for the
encrypted digital audio-recording device and a back-up audio-recording device were
available. I implemented a collaborative interviewing strategy by welcoming participants
to also ask other questions (Moustakas, 1994), received participant feedback from my
interpretations of their comments, and received participant feedback before my final
report (Creswell, 2013) to help extinguish any withholding of information and support
open discussions. The participants were involved themselves in social capital and as solo
librarians, and therefore cared about the results of the interview; they talked as friends
(van Manen, 1990).
Next, notes were scanned to create encrypted digital copies of hard copies and
saved to an external hard drive. The encrypted digital notes as well as the encrypted
audio recording were saved to the internet cloud using Dropbox, a secure internet storage
platform. I implemented reflexivity (Creswell, 2009, 2013) throughout the study, and
was conscious and forthright with my identified biases, values, and personal and
professional history. In addition, I included reflexive comments to discuss how what I
brought to the research impacted my interpretation of the phenomenon (Creswell, 2013).
Codes emerged during analysis, and were recoded (Creswell, 2009, 2013;
Edmonson & Irby, 2008; Merriam, 2009; Morgan, 1997). Codes are “labels that assign

75

symbolic meaning to the descriptive or inferential information compiled during a study”
(Miles et al., 2013, p. 71). “Chunks” (Miles et al., 2013, p. 71) of data were assigned
codes or terms (Creswell, 2009, 2013; Merriam, 2009; Miles et al., 2013) based on the
actual language of the data (Creswell, 2009). By performing this process, I began
analyzing and interpreting the data’s meanings (Miles et al., 2013). Therefore, I easily
and quickly pinpointed data and categorized the data with similar chunks for further
analysis and drawing conclusions (Edmonson & Irby, 2008; Merriam, 2009; Miles et al.,
2013). Codes evolved throughout data analysis (Creswell, 2009).
The inductive process is when a theory is identified based on what the data says
(Moustakas, 1994). I obtained the “experiential experiences from subjects” (van Manan,
1984, p. 42) and performed a thematic analysis. Patterns and field notes led me to several
themes that were refined as data were reviewed using inductive analysis (Moustakas,
1994; van Manen, 1984). I isolated thematic statements to determine essential themes or
“structures of experience” (van Manen, 1984, p. 59). I used both the highlighting
approach and line-by-line approach to determine themes. Essential statements or phrases
were highlighted, circled, or underlined. In addition, sentences were read line-by-line
and recurring themes and commonalities were noted and phrases and statements were
lifted (van Manen, 1984). Themes are answers to the question “what is it that makes this
lived experience what it is?” (van Manen, 1984, p. 41). As the process evolved, themes
were dropped, added, or edited.
Data Analysis
In this qualitative study, the researcher was integral to data analysis (Creswell,
2009). By understanding and interpreting the data, the process of analysis relied upon the

76

researcher to discover meaning during the process through interpretation (Leech &
Onwuegbuzie, 2007). Interpretation built upon analysis through the researcher’s
“intuition, past experiences, emotion” (Wolcott, 2009, p. 30). Analysis occurred during
the chunking, categorizing, and coding, despite any discrepancies (Wolcott, 2009).
I had adapted Moustakas’ (1994) data analysis procedure to include the individual
interviews. The steps I applied to analyze the data include:
1. Describing the Epoche (my perceptions of the phenomenon)
2. Recording via encrypted digital audio the individual interviews and
transcribing them verbatim. This will document the statements made by the
participants through verbatim examples
3. Specifying the reoccurring meanings of the experience, including verbatim
examples
4. Clustering the meanings into themes, including verbatim examples
5. Synthesizing the themes into detailed descriptions.
I bracketed my perceptions about the solo middle school librarians in Step 1. I
applied reflexivity to eliminate my perceptions so I could listen clearly and truly hear
about the phenomenon through the responses of the participants. This was a difficult
process due to my proximity to and opinions of the phenomenon.
Steps 2 and 3 occurred simultaneously. I transposed the encrypted audiorecordings and then reviewed the transcripts. In Step 2 I noted meaningful comments
from relevant statements (Moustakas, 1994). In Step 3, I organized reoccurring meanings
of the experience together. Each participant was quoted and reported in Chapter IV as
supporting data from the individual interviews.

77

In Step 4 I clustered the meanings into 5 themes. Step 5 involved synthesizing the
themes into detailed descriptions of the phenomenon. Quotations from the participants
and my experiences with the process peppered the synthesis. The results are vivid
description of the “meanings and essences” of the phenomenon (Moustakas, 1994, p.
122).
Summary
Chapter III focused on the research design, participant selection, instruments,
procedures, and data analysis. I described the data collection process, and steps I
implemented to deter bias. Last, the data analysis procedures were explained.

CHAPTER IV
Results
Introduction
The purpose of this phenomenological study was to investigate a sample of solo
middle school librarians in a large Texas school district as they shared their participation
and experiences with librarian-to- librarian social capital. In this study, qualitative data
were collected from interviews and used to organize the ideas of five solo middle school
librarians. In this chapter, I present the results of the qualitative data and the analysis of
the data under the guiding research questions.
Research Questions
1. How do solo middle school librarians perceive social capital experiences with
other solo middle school librarians in a large Texas school district?
2. How do solo middle school librarians in a large Texas school district perceive
social capital experiences with other school librarians outside of their large Texas school
district?
3. How do solo middle school librarians in a large Texas school district perceive
factors that influence social capital experiences?
Analysis of Data
This phenomenological study was completed to investigate a sample of solo
middle school librarians in a large Texas school district as they shared their participation
and experiences with librarian-to- librarian social capital. Using the transcriptions from
participants’ interview responses, I described and interpreted the data to understand the
phenomenon. The analysis of the transcripts started with circling important phrases from

79

each participant’s response to interview questions. After color-coding patterns of
responses, themes emerged. The themes became categories and repetitions of responses
were noted.
This chapter includes the results of the data analysis. First, I described the
characteristics of the solo middle school librarians who participated in the interviews.
Next, the results of the quantitative analysis were examined.
Participant Characteristics
The five solo middle school librarians that participated in the interviews include
four females and one male. Three participants’ ethnicity is white and two participants’
ethnicity is Hispanic. All participant ages are between 40-49 years. The total number of
years’ experience as a solo middle school librarian for four librarians is between four to
ten years and one participant’s experience ranging between 11-15 years. All hold at least
a master’s degree except for the male participant who only holds a bachelor’s degree. All
meet the NCLB requirement of a highly qualified teacher.
Demographic information about the participants in the study is represented in
Table 3. Gender, ethnicity, age group, range of years’ experience as a solo middle school
librarian, highest level of education, and NCLB highly qualified teacher requirement are
represented.

Results
The results of a pilot study (Lilly Hughes, 2013) completed in 2013 sparked my
interest in investigating the social capital activities of the solo middle school librarian. I
investigated a sample of middle school solo librarians in a large Texas school district as
they shared their participation and experiences with librarian-to-librarian social capital.
First, the social capital activities in which solo middle school librarians and other
librarians participate were identified. Second, the social capital activities in which solo
middle school librarians participate with other solo librarians within their school district
were identified. Third, the factors that influence the solo middle school librarian’s ability
to participate in social capital activities were examined.
To investigate a sample of solo middle school librarians in a large Texas school
district as they shared their participation and experiences with librarian-to-librarian social

81

capital, I conducted interviews with each independently and face-to-face. Each
participant was asked the same 16 questions. I asked additional questions during the
interviews when needed for information to enhance my understanding. All of the
interviews were recorded on my digital audio device and cassette recorder. After each
interview I transcribed it and then member-checked, allowing the interviewee to clarify
any inaccuracies. This procedure ensured clarity of their views and comments.
Analysis of the transcribed interviews began with my identification of significant
statements, categories, and descriptions. Grouping the significant statements, I
established themes. As per Moustakas’ (1994) recommendation, I closed analysis with
the recognition of the essence of the study and what inspired me.
I met the solo middle school librarians for the interview at a location of their
choosing. Participant 1 chose to invite me to her home on a Saturday morning, and
Participants 2-5 invited me to their library during school hours. All interviews lasted at
least 1 hour and 15 minutes with some lasting 1 hour and 45 minutes.
Participant 1. She and her three pets welcomed me into her home on a warm
Saturday morning. Dressed casually and offering me iced tea and a comfortable chair,
she needed clarification on the definition of social capital. We soon began our discussion
of the 16 questions that guided the study. Overall, Participant 1 is weary from physical
and mental fatigue from being a solo middle school librarian and as a result finds social
capital experiences with her colleagues in-district to be “critical” to her professional
success. She shared, “[My principal] said, ‘I want you to stop talking about how not
having an assistant is impacting you because people are thinking that you’re just whining
about it.’” She values most the informal 30 minutes before district monthly meetings and

82

stated, “We all think it’s the most important time of the meeting is the time we get to
spend together in that 30 minutes…just because we are alone.” In addition, daily
electronic interaction with other solo middle school librarians helps her keep in touch
with other solo middle school librarians and monthly evening book clubs fosters close
relationships where Participant 1 said, “I just get to know them and trust them.” Informal
interaction is valued more so than formal interaction. She said,
I trust the ones the most I’ve had the most interactions with. Outside the
profession. Meeting for happy hour or participating in book clubs. When you
spend time with people you get to know what that person is all about. And if I
had a question about something or needed advice I would know exactly who to
ask . . . we so look forward to the time we get to spend together. It doesn’t even
have to be structured…we talk about things that we’re concerned about at school
and how we’re doing this in handling this.
When in formal settings, interaction and training provided by colleagues in-district is
preferred to that provided form outside of the district because, “It speaks volumes about
their knowledge of being a librarian at our level . . . to me it’s more valuable and
creditable.” She also credits the other solo middle school librarians as each exhibiting
their individual strength, area of expertise, or special knowledge.
Participant 1 is a member of a few professional organizations to remain informed
of professional topics; however, she does not attend conferences due to lack of
professional and financial support from her principal. Despite lack of support from her
principal, advocacy for her program and profession is always at the forefront of her mind.
She said, “Advocacy never ends and it is ongoing.” Although she is allowed to attend

83

monthly librarians' meetings, she is not allowed to close the library to do so; if she is
absent, she can, however, request a retired librarian substitute. She absolutely trusts and
respects her solo middle school librarian colleagues in the district and shared she “looks
forward to the time we get to spend together. It doesn’t have to be structured because
everyone is open to sharing; they are upfront, honest, sympathetic, and eager to help.”
Participant 1 believed the biggest barriers to experiencing social capital are librarians
working alone, and that educators do not realize librarians are teachers and librarians
must “prove themselves” as instructional leaders at the campus.
Participant 2. Walking into a library space filled with natural light, contemporary
tables, chairs, shelving, lounge seating, glass partitions, and that has been open for only 2
years, I was greeted by a vivacious librarian working with a handful of student assistants.
After a welcomed tour of the space, Participant 2 and I sat down at a table in the middle
of the library and immediately opened the Smart Waters I provided to enjoy an easy
conversation covering the 16 questions that guided the study. Seemingly relaxed and
eager to chat, she finds the district’s monthly librarians’ meetings “pretty helpful,”
especially the informal discussion time 30 minutes before the meeting begins; she notes
that 30 minutes isn’t enough time to really discuss what’s going on at campuses. She
said, “I miss a chance to get to really talk about what’s going on at our campuses.”
However, she does “try to make a goal to incorporate something from everything we do
so otherwise why bother to go [to the meeting]?” Daily electronic interaction with other
solo middle school librarians are imperative, and “crucial” informal interaction is valued
more so than formal interaction. From those discussions, however, she has noticed “from
that informal [discussion] it [professional development] becomes formal.” She also

84

credits the other solo middle school librarians as each exhibiting their individual
strengths, area of expertise, or special knowledge. She provides staff development to
teachers and is considered part of the campus leadership team, and attends in-state
professional conferences because she is supported professionally and somewhat
financially by her principal. She also utilizes technology to expand her social capital
experiences via social media such as Twitter, web sites, blogs, a variety of Web 2.0 tools
such as Google Applications, and technology- focused organizations such as Texas
Computer Education Association (TCEA).
Participant 2 is overwhelmed by the job duties as a solo middle school librarian
and relies heavily upon volunteers in the library. She said,
Volunteers are really important because it allows a librarian to not feel tethered to
the space so you can collaborate with more teachers on their time. It also offers
opportunities to go and attend to the part of other things that are going on outside
of the space whether it’s a meeting or other PD [professional development] or
even a meeting with administration to talk about different things. The other thing
is just to have another adult in the room to help supervise because you constantly
have a variety of things [going on]; every day is different.
She believes professional organizations such as the American Library Association (ALA)
and the Texas Computer Education Association (TCEA) are “critical” for social capital
activities to foster and to defend institutions from becoming “myopic.” She finds
involvement “invigorating” and “motivating” and contributes by presenting at
conferences, writing articles for journals such as Library Media Connection, and sharing
on social media. If participation of social capital experiences demanded the library to be

85

closed, she does believe her principal would support that; when absent Participant 2 does
secure a substitute. She absolutely trusts and respects her solo middle school librarian
colleagues in the district, although sometimes she feels she is sometimes
“misunderstood” due to her desire to help and share. She said,
I just feel like it is wrong not to institute some possibilities that could really affect
change. Because if we don’t we might as well just cash it all in now as a planet,
as a nation, as a state, as a city, as an individual. So I just tend to think way too
big sometimes but it’s just kind of what feed stocks that desire to help and share.
Participant 3. Nestled down a long dark corridor of the middle school,
Participant 3’s library, in capsuled as box-shaped, all dark wood, with canned lighting,
and impeccably maintained shelves, waft the faint scent of mold. Peppered with modern
designed portraits of famous young adult authors both past and present, bright book
displays, and some comfortable seating and task lighting for student use, a beleaguered
librarian invited me to sit at a table for a chat. Setting up my recording devices and
providing the Smart Waters I brought did not prepare me to see a Library Services central
office personnel person arrive anticipating another meeting with all middle school
librarians. Realizing the other meeting was at a different campus, the central office
personnel left, causing me to conclude my conversation with Participant 3 was on a
shortened time frame. We quickly dove into the 16 questions that guided the study so
that Participant 3 could meet the other librarians after our interview.
Participant 3 acknowledged the importance of the district- level middle school
librarians’ meetings, yet bemoaned “our meetings require us to travel to different
campuses which can be a hindrance.” She does, however, find the meetings, especially

86

the informal 30 minutes before the meeting, “the most valuable.” Ironically, she usually
only shares during the formal session of the meeting due to not wishing to be viewed as
overbearing. Overall, even more important to her are the informal communications
during the day via instant messaging, going out to dinner, and book club. She appreciates
opportunities to share, especially “programming ideas and great things that are happening
in our libraries.” She explained, “The most valuable resources are my co-librarians . . .
we are family.” She also credits the other solo middle school librarians as each
exhibiting their individual strengths, area of expertise, or special knowledge. She
conceded, however, that without a library assistant, she had to let go of some
programming ideas, such as creating promotional reading incentive videos, “because it
got just way too much to do [without an aide].”
Participant 3 recognized the vital role professional organizations such as Texas
Library Association (TLA) and ALA play for library advocacy. She emphasized, “I am
very much an advocate of people being involved in the professional organizations . . . it’s
just vital for the networking and opening up your web of resources and people;” she
currently serves on a state book selection committee. She prefers to experience social
capital experiences face-to-face, or occasionally over video social media such as blab.im,
but struggles with the after-school hours it takes to participate in these activities. She is
the host of the librarians’ book club. If she were not alone in the library, she could
participate more regularly. In addition, if she had a library assistant she would not have
to close the library when she was away. She said, “Since we lost our assistants, that has
been a huge burden on us to be able to get professional development.” She believes in
advocating for libraries, and does receive some professional support from her principal to

87

attend conferences and collaborate with other librarians, but zero financial support. She
said many impediments hinder social capital, including but not limited to “time is a
factor. Money is a factor. Closing the library is a factor . . . lack of support personnel is
a hindrance . . . you can’t run a library without a manager, and our library assistants were
our managers.”
Participant 4. With dark wood shelving, dim canned lighting, chairs and tables in
disarray, and a messy makeshift circulation desk to greet me, Participant 4’s library
exuded chaos one afternoon of a student early-release day. A beleaguered librarian
invited me to sit at a table among a King Arthur’s Court display for a chat, so I set up my
recording devices and provided her with a Smart Water. We quickly dove into the 16
questions that guided the study because I could see by the librarian’s tired eyes she was
ready to call it a day and go home to rest. Participant 4 echoed her colleagues in
recognizing the “sharing” time the 30 minutes before the monthly librarians’ meeting as
being “a really good time [for] sharing new things.” However, she does have a smaller
cadre of librarians she defers to for ideas because “since we don’t have library aides,
we’re trying to figure out systems. So we spend a lot of our time trying to create systems
that allow the library to run more smoothly.” She also credits the other solo middle
school librarians as each exhibiting their individual strengths, area of expertise, or special
knowledge. Feeling isolated, she emphasized monthly meetings as her “lifeline.” She
almost cried when she said
I could not continue in my position if I didn’t have the opportunity to go to the
library meetings once a month and count on other librarians in between to bounce
off ideas and sometimes get a little encouragement . . . it is so nice to have a

88

chance to talk with someone else who knows exactly where I’m coming from
because we’re the only ones on our campus . . . it’s a lonely business. I have had
an assistant before and it was wonderful.
Participant 4 also finds her solo middle school librarian colleagues to be
trustworthy and her local and state librarian professional organizations such as TLA and
workshops at her education service center. However, she does interpret the larger
professional organizations as being out of touch with reality in school libraries, and
therefore relies upon the advice and input from her local colleagues. She said, “My
world is different from what I was taught in library school.” As a result, she works hard
to cultivate a strong positive relationship with her principal because “so much of my
success depends on the principal support.” She does not close the library when she
attends meetings, and instead relies upon volunteers to circulate materials and supervise
students when she is away. Otherwise, her principal would not allow her to leave.
Participant 4’s principal does allow her to pay for attending conferences with library
fundraisers. She does not supplement face-to-face interactions with social media. In
addition, she believes “social capital time is hindered by time and inconvenience.’ She
emphatically stated, “So some of me not participating in social capital is self-imposed;
it’s physically not possible [without an assistant].”
Participant 5. Participant 5 jubilantly greeted me at the door of his library where
public voting was taking place, and we walked through the sparsely decorated cavern to a
back conference room to address the 16 questions that guided this study. Grateful for the
Smart Water I provided, he began to talk about how he manages his library before I can
even set up my recording devices. He wanted me to know first and foremost that he

89

could not provide the programming and instructional support he does without his group
of 10 volunteers from the Parent Teacher Association (PTA). He declared, “I couldn’t
run [the library] without it [PTA volunteers].” I redirected him to the questions at hand
and he immediately identified the librarians’ monthly meetings as the “biggest way” he is
involved with social capital. He identified the “social time” 30 minutes before the
meeting and then added, “The only way to get ideas is to bounce them off each other and
use them when you get back to school.” Currently an official mentor to a new librarian in
his district, Participant 5 does not attend book club, participate in social media for
personal or professional use, nor reach out to those outside the district for social capital
endeavors. Instead, he said, “I kind of just gravitate to the people around me and it’s
probably even more so the people whose schools are in close proximity to me . . . the
only things that I do that are outside of this little realm is go to TLA [annual
conference].” He also credited the other solo middle school librarians as each exhibiting
their individual strengths, area of expertise, or special knowledge.
Feeling support from his principal professionally but not financially, Participant 5
pays his own way to professional conferences and workshops from his personal pocket.
In general, unless he is particularly sought out professionally, he does not willingly share
out his ideas or expertise because while he would “love to be able to do more of the
things I actually do…if I had a library assistant I could do more.” He does, however,
recognize the importance of staying current to best practices through organizations such
as TCEA and TLA. From these organizations he stated, “Every year you [learn] and oh
my gosh, I could do so much more. If I had another adult to work with, instead of a
different person every day.” The “eduspeak” of many professional organizations, he

90

said, “turns me off,” so he remains a lurker and instead focuses on social capital
experiences with other solo middle school librarians in his district. He claimed, “I’ve
never had anything but positive experiences with my colleagues. I’ve heard that other
people have not. But it’s never been me.” Overall, he believes they “value each other.”
Emerging Themes
Using the transcriptions from participants’ interview responses, I described and
interpreted the data to understand the phenomenon. The analysis of the transcripts started
with circling important phrases from each participant’s response to interview questions. I
then wrote rich descriptions of each interview. After color-coding patterns of responses,
themes emerged. In Table 4, the emerging themes are presented with the number of
times the theme was mentioned. The categories became themes and repetitions of
responses were noted.

Collegiality. The solo middle school librarians value their district-level monthly
meetings, held specifically for their level. All participants stated the importance and
priority these monthly meetings have. Participant 5 said, “I think the monthly meetings

91

are the most important [social capital activity].” Participant 1 shared, “Because we are
alone, it’s another professional adult that understands what we’re going through.”
Participant 3 agreed by stating, “We as middle school librarians have the opportunity to
meet. We have a district librarians meeting . . . to get together and collaborate and
discuss and learn with each other.” Participant 1 reinforced her colleagues and stated,
“We all think it [monthly meetings] is the most important time of the meeting is the time
we get to spend together in that 30 minutes.” Participant 5 added,
Opportunities to discuss, learn, and share with other middle school librarians
within his district is extremely important. Even a solo librarian isn’t an island.
You have to have people who are knowledgeable . . . they’re so good to get ideas
from. If we didn’t have a monthly meeting I think it would be more difficult than
it is . . . a lot of times I come out of there my track gets reset.
Participant 3 exclaimed, “The most successful and in-depth meetings have been
the informal ones.” These examples exemplify the notion that successful schools
encourage teacher collegiality (Johnston, Markle, & Arhar, 1988). Of greater importance
to the solo middle school librarians are the optional 30 minutes before the monthly
meeting where unstructured topics may be discussed. Participant 4 expressed,
Formal school district opportunities occur monthly with our middle school
librarian meetings through library services. And so there’s generally we always
have discussion time at the beginning . . . at the beginning that can be directed or
just open. There’s lots of sharing on how do you do things and we’re real good
about finding out from each other at those meetings what do you, what do you
like, how do you do this, and that’s a really good time to find those things out.

92

The solo middle school librarians appreciate this time. Participant 5 said,
We have time to socially interact once a month at a meeting. Thirty minutes
before the meeting you can come at the very beginning and it’s a structured
meeting after that . . . it’s the only way to get ideas is to bounce them off each
other and use them when you get back to school.
Participant 1 restated the importance of the monthly meeting and the informal 30 minutes
beforehand:
One of the best formal opportunities that we have in the district is meeting once a
month on our levels . . . we have the opportunity to get to the meeting about 30
minutes before the meeting starts. We discuss concerns, ask questions give
feedback, and pick each other’s brain . . . that has been the best part of our
meetings by far.
The informal 30 minutes before the monthly meeting is so valued, Participant 2 said, “I
miss a chance to get to really talk about what’s going on at our campuses, without any
kind of structure. I find that really helpful although 30 minutes in not a lot of time.”
Participant 2 restated her thoughts and expressed opportunities to discuss, learn, or share
with other solo middle school librarians within her district.
Really important. I think the informal is super important and I’m also wishing
there was some way that we could have a structured informal afternoon were
more regular. Leave for us to meet . . . where we can get together and we knew
we would be sharing and getting ideas and brainstorming whatever it might be.
Or just talk about issues we’re having. I mean because obviously the more brains

93

you have working on a problem the more possible solutions you can come up
with.
These examples exemplify the research stating opportunities for informal collegial
interaction positively affects student achievement (Penuel et al., 2010).
Value extends to relationships, where Participant 4 “trusts” her other librarians “to
share experiences with.” Participant 4 said,
They trust me, and so I try as hard as I can to be a sharing person . . . I want to
build that relationship with my colleagues of sharing. I want to be of value to
them as much as they are of value to me. The reciprocity of it.
Participant 3 shared, “I love my middle school colleagues. We always refer to ourselves
as a family. We are a family unit. We are very close.” The feeling is mutual for
Participant 5, who firmly declared her most valuable professional resources “are my
professional colleagues . . . because we are the ones who are actually in the trenches
doing the work.” Participant 3 held the same feeling and stated, “The most valuable
resources are my co-librarians, or my librarians in the district . . . we work together as a
team and collaborate and come together with ideas. It’s just better for everybody.”
By utilizing the informal opportunities for social capital, the solo middle school
librarians learn to whom to address in times of need. Participant 1 said,
When you spend time with people you get to know what that person is all about.
And if I had a question about something or needed advice I would know exactly
who to ask . . . we so look forward to the time we get to spend together. It doesn’t
even have to be structured just on our own we talk about things.

94

At various times throughout the year, the solo middle school librarians may work
together during the school day. Participant 2 shared,
With early release days I’m planning on working with another library to talk
about just some stuff, some ideas to share . . . to get some ideas about different
kinds of maker space stuff. So we work within the parameters of what the
schedule is . . . so there’s a lot of partnerships like that, that happen.”
Participant 3 said, “It’s great to get together and hash out ideas. So I’ve actually
personally asked people to collaborate with me individually or informally have a mixer to
share.” Participant 1 stated, “They [librarians] seek me out like I seek them out for
particular issues or problems all the time. Email, instant message, face-to-face, phone
calls; it goes both ways. I think they trust me about as much as I trust them.” Participant
3 expressed, “Everyone has their own niche and talent, so it’s nice to be able to get
together as a cohesive whole . . . we all have our own individual talents and strengths and
together we are the whole enchilada.”
To enhance the social capital opportunities of their monthly meetings, solo middle
school librarians embrace technology. Couros (2015) said, “As educational leaders, we
must promote and capitalize on open, connected learning” (p. 170). Participant 5 said,
Once a month meetings are probably the biggest way. Of course we do have IM
and we’re all on Skype IM that we’re on day-to-day so little questions pop up or if
you have an idea or something you can share it that way. And everybody also
shares through their email.
This layer of instant feedback in a fast-paced school library is a best practice. The
activity also builds relationships because, “The three most important words in education

95

are: relationships, relationship, relationships. Without them, we have nothing.” (Couros,
2015, p. 68). Participant 4 reinforced Participant 5’s thoughts and shared,
It [social capital] almost always starts communication with an instant message,
and if we can’t get it done through that we will pick up the phone. But we want
an immediate back-and-forth feedback. Email is too slow. We need that instant
feedback. A couple of buddies, we text even after work. We’ll be thinking of
something, so it goes beyond the school day.
Participant 3 added,
I’m trying to try technology and post on social media . . . we get together on a
regular basis just to talk and share out. That is a very valuable group to me.
Because we talk not only about programming but also about advocacy . . . on my
time.
Other technologies enhance social capital. Participant 2 added, “We do a lot of things
through Google Docs and sharing in Google Drive. Outsourcing ideas and things like
that . . . we’re taking some type of initiative to learn from each other; it’s because we
have a direct need for it.” Participant 2 went on and stated,
I think things like Twitter have been helpful because it’s allowed me to see what
other libraries are doing . . . instant messaging is helpful because it allows me to
show I’m available and that I’m receptive and responsive . . . there are certain
people I know to go to for certain things based on their areas of strength and what
they’ve decided to become their daily work.
Solo middle school librarians use a combination of face-to-face opportunities and
technology to enhance social capital opportunities. Participant 3 shared, “I usually like to

96

get together in person and share about what I’ve learned informally at dinner with my
colleagues . . . we do BLABing which is something through Twitter.” Participant 3 said,
Informal opportunities [to meet] are the most valuable . . . we take it upon
ourselves to get together and discuss. We can do that either through instant
message . . . or just meet for dinner. Or, for example, I have a book club mixer
for the librarians . . . [we also] share programming ideas and great things that are
happening in our libraries.
Participant 4, in response to the sharing at meetings stated,
I just would go back to school and try to do it [what I’ve learned] and try to do it
and generally follow up with a phone call or instant message. Just a kind of check
in and follow up. All the librarians are sharing new things . . . we have such
different strengths . . . people have different skill sets and interests and needs for
their school.
Social capital is important to the solo middle school librarians, but not all are
happy with each other all of the time, although they are interdependent (Deal, Purinton,
& Waetjen, 2008). Participant 5 said,
I’ve never had anything but positive experiences with my colleagues. I’ve heard
that other people have not . . . if I’m part of a group I’ve always felt like I’ve been
included and my comments were taken as being just as important as anyone
else’s. And I’ve always respected whatever anyone else has said . . . the librarians
in our district are so willing to give their ideas and their information. I mean they
will help you. We value each other. Some are more disgruntled than others . . . I

97

like all the people that are my colleagues. They wouldn’t say it to me but to the
side I can hear disgruntled [voices].”
Participant 2 values the social capital time together, yet admitted, “I feel basically
misunderstood a lot of times . . . But I do think they get it and they value my input, and
like what I have to offer.” Participant 4 recognizes she must be proactive to receive
assistance from other solo middle school librarians. She stated,
I have to ask . . . there’s only a few who really would focus their attention on me
and I really, I value that and count on it . . . If I don’t have that vibe of absolutely
no problem [they’ll help] then it’s really hard for me to ask anyone. If there’s
some hesitancy to take a minute to explain something or give me some advice
then I’d rather try to figure it out myself or go someplace else.
Professional organizations. The solo middle school librarians in this study
participate to various degrees in local, state, and national professional organizations. The
solo middle school librarians engage in face-to-face interactions and contribute
electronically to organizations such as: (a) Texas Library Association (TLA), (b)
American Library Association (ALA), (c) Texas Computer Education Association
(TCEA), and subdivisions thereof. Not all solo middle school librarians agree on the
significance and applicability of each organization on their professional responsibilities;
membership in a professional organization is less common than other organizations such
as sports, interest, or idealistic groups (Lin & Erickson, 2008).
National professional organizations are important to several solo middle school
librarians, and educators from several disciplines agree in the importance of participation
in professional organizations to enhance professional skills (Kasar & Clark, 2000).

98

Members of professional organizations “take care of each other” (Sinek, 2014, p. 18).
Participant 3 believes involvement in professional organizations is vital to the profession.
Participant 3 explained,
I am very involved in both TLA and ALA. I am a member of YART. I’m
actually running for chair elect of YART this year, which is the Young Adult
Round Table. With ALA I’m also a member of YALSA [Young Adult Library
Services Association] and I’m currently serving on the selection committee for
that. I am very much an advocate of people being involved in their professional
organizations . . . it’s just vital for the networking and opening up your web of
resources and people. Not only on the state level, but on a national level.
She continued and shared receiving professional advice and information from a
professional organization was
Vital because that’s what the professional organization is what supports us. So
they are the one who will have our backs for advocacy, they are the ones who are
going to support us with programming ideas. ALA is excellent at doing that.
Participant 2 agreed receiving information from professional organizations is
Really important . . . any organization can become too closed into a little myopic.
So going outside and looking what other places are doing is extremely
invigorating and motivating . . . it’s crucial to look outside in the business
communities, entrepreneurially, technology, that kind of stuff, too. What’s
trending in the real world.

99

Participant 5 concurred with the importance of professional organization and declared,
“It’s very important to stay current with what other people are doing all over the
country.”
State professional organizations are more important to most of the solo middle
school librarians. The research supports professional organizations providing
professional development opportunities as imperative for student achievement (Dow,
2013). Whatever it takes to attend annual conference, most solo middle school librarians
are willing to do whatever it takes to get there. Participant 4 said, “TLA is our voice.”
She expanded on the statement and shared,
I definitely feel a connection to TLA. I’m not a member of ALA anymore
because of the cost . . . I feel it’s more distant unless it’s relevant to my situation
or my priorities. I use ALA as a resource rarely . . . I go to TLA [annual
conference] every year if possible. A lot of people to TCEA . . . but I still feel my
comfort is with TLA . . . it’s more practical.
Participant 5 is also dedicated to TLA, and related, “I do pay my own way to TLA
[annual conference]. I pay for my own hotel. I could pay for it with the book fair money
but I never use it because I want to use it for school staff.” Participant 1 is more
lukewarm toward any professional organization and dryly mentioned she belongs to ALA
and TLA. She accesses resources such as “award winners book lists, resource that help
me advocate.” She expressed she thought library professional organizations were
“relatively important.”

100

Attending a professional organizations’ conference or accessing the professional
organization’s resources doesn’t ensure the solo middle school librarian is fully engaged
in its offerings. Participant 5 explained,
I go to TLA but I don’t contribute anything to it. I’ve been a part of blogs before,
but really that’s not my strong suit. But I do get stuff from them. I’m more of a
lurker than a contributor . . . sometimes the eduspeak just puts me off.
Various degrees of participation depend on the interests and resources of the solo middle
school librarian. Contradicting most of her colleagues, Participant 2 mentioned,
I’ve lapsed my membership [in TLA] just because of cost and because I feel
ambivalent about TLA . . . I feel like TCEA is a much more progressive thinking
organization . . . TLA is behind the times . . . I just get always get more out of
TCEA conference than a TLA conference. And I’ve presented at both
conferences . . . I belong to TCEA, I’m a member of ALA and AASL [American
Association of School Librarians] . . . and then the other is ISTE [International
Society for Technology in Education] . . . I look more to AASL more than I do
TLA . . . AASL and TCEA really enriched my practice and constantly gives me
new ideas . . . I don’t always go to conferences just because of cost, not because
of lack of desire to go.
Contradicting the importance of professional organizations altogether, Participant 2
surprisingly noted,
I would say I get more from non-librarians than I do librarians because partly I’ve
been doing this for a while . . . but I’m looking for more. I guess I always want to
learn more and I get bored really easily.

101

Web resources and technology from professional organizations receive mixed
reviews from solo middle school librarians. Participant 4 said,
A lot of it [professional organizations] seems to be how to use technology [for
sharing] different ideas for promoting books, reaching kids outside the library,
[or] using social media. Probably a lot more of it is inspiration rather than a
blueprint for what I would do here.
Others do use technology to expand upon and share what they learn at conferences.
Participant 2 said,
I do try to share what we do when we go to a conference within the district. We
would create some type of Google Doc and share the resources and email that out
to everyone and if there’s time at our PD sessions we try to schedule 30 minutes
share time where we can talk about what we learned.
Participant 4 further shared, “I’ve gone in waves with social media . . . but I do like to
follow experts or leaders in the field or authors.” She also admitted, “I’m a member of
several ListServs but I don’t truly pay any attention to them.”
Despite the resources professional organizations provide, the solo middle school
librarians prefer social capital opportunities with and from their colleagues (Couros,
2015). Even the conference experience itself is no match for actual time the solo middle
school librarians spend together. Participant 4 said, “Probably the best part of it [TLA] is
sharing in the casual setting whether it’s at dinner after workshops; just talking about it.
It’s more informal sharing.” Participant 3 reinforced this idea but in a more formal
setting. She shared,

102

The meetings I really like are the meetings right after TLA. At our formal
meetings we always share out what was learned at TLA and the resources we
gather while we’re at conference. Which is always a great thing to do . . . and
then we get to take that back to our campuses and share with our faculty and
students.
Participant 4 blatantly stated, “It is most important to get information from them [middle
school librarians]. Less so from professional organizations, because I think a lot of our
professional organizations are cut off to the realities of the schools.”
Principal support. The solo middle school librarians experience varying levels of
support from their campus principal. Each recognizes the critical role principal support
plays in their taking advantage of social capital experiences (Leana, 2010). Participant 4
said,
I have worked really hard to cultivate that relationship . . . being friendly, trying
to be welcoming, trying to be accommodating for things that are important to
them. Getting over in my mind the fear when I do advocate for the library, that to
be able to talk in a straight up manner. I guess I’ve been fortunate that I’ve had
great relationships with my principals so I don’t know what it’s like for somebody
who doesn’t have that and so that is a factor in who I relate to with other
librarians.
She emphasized, “So much of my success depends on the principal support. So I’ve been
very lucky.” Participant 3 echoed Participant 4 a stated her principal is “absolutely very
supportive . . . a lot of the principals are very supportive about having us get together.”

103

Participant 5 agreed with the other solo middle school librarians with one caveat and said,
“The only person I answer to is our principal. And everything I’ve ever asked him to do
has been, ‘Of course, do that’ if it’s going to be good for kids . . . but he’s always been
supportive of me.” These librarians recognized the significance of principal support to
their success (Frank, Zhao, & Borman, 2004).
Other principals show support of their solo middle school librarian by allowing
them to take a leadership role on the campus or attend professional workshops during the
school year (Frank et al., 2004). Participant 2 triumphantly stated, “Almost every time
we have a staff development day I’m asked to do a session.” She added, “My principal is
pretty supportive . . . he saw me as part of the leadership team and wants me to provide
sessions to teachers.” On the other end of the spectrum, Participant 1 expressed, “They
do allow me to go to meetings as long as I have permission with plenty of advance
notice.” She is not allowed to provide professional development to teachers and has been
told, “There’s not a lot of time for the library to present.”
Principal support may be distributed in a number of ways. Regarding the
opportunity to attend conferences or workshops, Participant 4 shared,
I try to make it as easy as possible for them to say yes. I don’t ask for the funding
to go to these events. I . . . use the fundraising from book fair . . . not from the
campus budget . . . so they’re very supportive but I try to make it so it’s easy for
them to be supportive of it. I get my substitute, I make sure everything’s okay, I
pay for it with library funds.
Similarly, Participant 3 reported,

104

I co-presented a session on reading as a committee member at [my education
service center]. Besides ALA and TLA I go to I also go to the young adult
symposium and the [education service center library professional development
day]. I go to ALAN [Assembly on Literature for Adolescents of the NCTE]
workshops. I’ve gone to the International Literacy Association conferences . . . if
it’s in the area or it’s something I’m very interested in to go. By the way, I pay
for all of this myself, out of my pocket. 100%. In the past I’ve asked leadership to
fund my staff development . . . they were not willing to pay . . . [but] I do not ever
want money to be an issue for me not going to get professional training so I have
since paid my way 100% to everything I go to professionally.
On the opposite end of the spectrum regarding principal support, Participant 1
said, “I have been told there’s no professional development money for librarians to go to
conference because there is more important professional development for teachers
because teachers are more important.” Lack of principal support is a significant cause for
teacher dissatisfaction (Hallinger, 2003). Participant 1 pays for TLA conference
expenses on her own and said, “It’s not true for other campuses . . . their principal pays
for the conference and the travel expenses that are associated with it. But not mine.”
Participant 3 bemoaned, “I know some principals won’t let librarians go to TLA or they
won’t provide financial assistance for them to go.” Or, the principal will allow the
librarian to attend a conference or workshop, but keeps the library closed while she or he
is away. Participant 3 said, “Some campuses the principal will make them just shut the
library down and not get a sub, which is not good, because then the library is not
available to the students.”

105

Librarians are teachers. Texas certified school librarians must have at least 2
years successful teaching experience, and are therefore teachers. All solo middle school
librarians in this study are No Child Left Behind (NCLB) highly qualified teachers.
Opportunities to teach lay with students, teachers, administrators, other librarians, the
librarians themselves as lifelong learners, and the community. As noted by Participant 5,
“My job has totally changed in the past 25 years.” The job has evolved to be even more
instructionally laden. As stated by Participant 2, “We need to reframe the perception of
what the librarian does and what this space is about.” Participant 1 echoed the sentiment
and flatly expressed, “They don’t realize that we were once teachers . . . in the 21 st
century a lot of people don’t understand what librarians do.”
The opportunity to plan collaboratively with campus teachers and leaders is
critical to a library program’s success and appropriate use of resources, including access
to the librarian (Lance, 2002c). Sometimes to provide for collaboration, alternatives must
come to fruition. Participant 4 said, “I don’t close the library when I go to meetings. I
have a parent volunteer who can come in . . . so I can attend the department meetings and
the department head meetings.” She continued and said, “I wouldn’t get support for
collaborating [with teachers] if I closed the library.” Yet working with teachers is not
always easy to achieve. Participant 1 explained, “I am not given time to share
information during professional development times. Again, I’ve been told there’s not a
lot of time for the library to present . . . I wish I could be part of professional
development activities throughout the year.”
More specifically, the solo middle school librarians are mindful of specific
instructional strategies. Participant 2 expanded and stated, “Whenever I learn something

106

new, I think how can this be reframed within the context of our campus . . . in that it can
support all of these TEKS and the readiness TEKS. Participant 2 shared,
I collaborate with the teacher. I try to incorporate some strategies that are just
taking the content and reusing it a different way but also teaching the kids some
types of thinking skills or more 21st century approaches that are going to help
them be more self-sufficient and challenge them a little bit more.
Participant 5 commented there are challenges, however, to providing instruction:
If I’m going to do some sort of research or go to the lab with the class . . . if I’m
going to preview any authors’ books I need to go to all the reading classes. I need
to do a book talk and those instances I have to put a library closed sign on the
door and find a place for my [student] library assistant to go.
He went on and shared, “I just want to make sure that the kids know the current books
now because I wish I would’ve known the current books when I was a kid . . . I’m a male
role model.”
Other ways the solo middle school librarians find instructional strategies from
which to teach students include even more social capital experiences. Participant 3
shared,
I’ve gotten some very good ideas from what I’ve learned just either collaborating
with my professional learning community or online sources such as social media.
You know the last thing I did we went ton Pinterest and my little library student
aides and I found things to [promote reading].
She went on and said,

107

I try to get people together so they can come up with programming ideas for the
year. Or even it’s just a calendar of events so that we can remember to hit the
highlights for book displays, programming ideas, activities for the kids to do. It’s
great to get together and hash out those ideas.
Isolation. Teaching is a lonely profession (Chandler, 1983; Chenoweth, 2009;
Costello, 1987; Davis, 1987; Dussault, et al., 1999; Elmore, 2000; Flinders, 1988;
Goodlad & Klein, 1974; Levine, 1986; Lieberman & Miller, 1992, 1984; Little, 1990;
Rosenholtz & Smylie, 1984; Rothberg, 1986; Zielinski & Hoy, 1983). Being a solo
middle school librarian is interesting but also lonely work. To illustrate this point,
Participant 4 said, “So it’s a great business but it’s a lonely business. I have had an
assistant before and it was wonderful.” Participant 4 expanded on the notion and
claimed, “To me one of the most rewarding parts of the profession is getting to help
another librarian who is also lonely. She continued with a confession:
[Opportunities to discuss learn, or share with other middle school librarians within
your district] It is my lifeline. I could not continue in my position if I didn’t have
the opportunity to go to the library meetings once a month and count on other
librarians in between to bounce off ideas and sometimes get a little
encouragement. And we probably say most every time after those meetings it is
so nice to have a chance to talk with someone else who knows exactly where I’m
coming from because we’re the only ones on our campus.
Participant 1 adamantly agreed and expressed, “The biggest barrier is that we are alone.”
Isolated from other teachers, other librarians, and appropriate support staff, the
solo middle school librarian has to prioritize daily goals and objectives (Siess, 2006). As

108

a result, higher-level professional activities get put aside as routine clerical support
systems take over. Participant 4 stressed, “Especially since we don’t have library aides,
we’re trying to figure out systems. So we spend a lot of our time trying to create systems
that allow the library to run more smoothly.” She continued, “It’s tough to implement,
it’s hard to find the time to actually implement these things that I do learn about . . . it’s
hard to make a programming change, even a scheduling type change . . . it is not easy.”
Participant 3 elaborated upon the loss of professional activities and adamantly
bemoaned,
Lack of support personnel is a hindrance. We have to, I mean all of the things
we’re good at, sometimes get put on the back burner because we have to actually
manage the library. Meaning we have to run circulation, or we have to shelve
books, or run reports, or make sure the collection is developed. [It’s] the day to
day running reports, overdue notices, whatever it may be for whatever it might be
for the library. Because that has to be done.
She continued and emphatically declared,
Essentially you can’t run a library without a manager. And our library assistants
were our managers. They managed our libraries which allowed us to be the
professional and to interact where we need to interacting with the patrons whether
they be student or teacher or colleagues. So sometimes we ran out of time to do
that because we have to manage which is essential. And that’s why it’s so very
important we have to properly staffed libraries.
Yes, some solo middle school librarians have student assistants during the school day, but
child labor is not enough (Siess, 1997; Siess, 2006). Participant 5 shared,

109

That’s where it gets impacted if you do have another adult assistant in here then
the way you can be more involved in instruction in the classrooms that’s the
impact there. You have to have everyone come to you if you don’t have someone
who can command the ship while you’re gone.
He continued by explaining his situation with adult volunteers, which is very much
appreciated by the librarian (McGown, 2007).
I have support as far as the parents and PTA . . . they cover every day my lunch.
Some days if I need them they have a person assigned before or after school to
help with shelving or with laminating or other kinds of clerical duties . . . they
help me run my book fairs. They supply money for authors . . . I couldn’t run
without them.
Participant 4 explained, “So if it were between not having a parent and closing the library
that would cause a problem. I would have to keep the library open.” Participant 5 said,
“Every year you come out [from TLA conference] and oh my gosh! I could do so much
more if I had another adult to work with instead of a different person [volunteer] every
day.”
Participant 5 explained a fabulous analogy regarding the idiocy of relying on adult
volunteers instead of proper clerical assistance and described,
You wouldn’t want to be a principal having to train a new person every day of the
week that would be mind-boggling especially when you’re trying to instruct kids
and going to orientations and having to orientate the person at the front desk and I
have kids now to do it.

110

Principals do not seem to understand the issue of a librarian being alone as problematic.
Participant 1 lamented “[my principal] said, ‘I want you to stop talking about how not
having an assistant is impacting you because people are thinking that you’re just whining
about it.’” Only Participant 2’s principal offered hope when the principal would see “to
close the library to go collaborate I think she realizes that there’s an issue . . . she’s like,
‘You do need somebody in here.’”
Because the solo middle school librarians are exhausted trying to maintain
programming and services alone, they cannot perform at a professional level from which
they aspire (Siess, 2006). This includes their ability to participate specifically in social
capital experiences. Participant 5 said, “I’d love to be able to do more things than I
actually do . . . if I had a library assistant I could do more.” Participant 3 shared, “But
time is a factor. Money is a factor. Closing the library is a factor.” Participant 4 said,
So some of me not participating in social capital is self-imposed. . . it’s physically
not possible . . . I’ve got to find this sustainable mode of operating the library and
that’s hard because it’s fun operating at a high level but I couldn’t keep doing it . .
. it’s too frustrating to be thinking well if I had more help, if I had an assistant I
could be doing this, if I stay in that mindset then I can’t complete and do well
with what I have now.
She continues to steadfastly express the situation:
Social capital time is hindered by time and inconvenience. When I had my aid I
could plan together and bounce ideas. I was bouncing ideas off of her and then I
had that energy to get things going and try things. It’s harder now for me to try
new things because I don’t have much time to fail . . . I need to be pretty sure it’s

111

going to be worth my time and energy . . . I almost died when my aide was cut, it
was so stressful trying to keep that level of programming and activity and realize I
can’t do the job of two people even if you have student aides I cannot do the job
of two people. So I was so exhausted by the end of the day I had to change.
Participant 4 continued, “I have to ask [for help] . . . because we don’t have help . . . I’ve
had to create on my own a little network of help with a few reliable friends . . . I’m very
fortunate to have a core.” Participant 5 stated, “I’m very poor on this outside of our
district. I kind of just gravitate to the people around me and it’s probably even more so
the people whose schools are in close proximity to me.” He continued and stated, “There
are book clubs but I’m not in it . . . I’m busy . . . you just can’t do it.”
For some solo middle school librarians, taking part in social capital experiences
means eliminating library services to students, teachers, and the community.

Participant

1 beleaguered,
Having to close down my library to be able to leave and participate is a barrier I
have to overcome each time I go to participate . . . and locking the door means my
students don’t have access to not only books and computers, they don’t have
access to me. I think that’s one of the biggest barriers. Maybe that goes back to
me being a solo librarian. If the world could understand how school librarians
impact the students maybe it wouldn’t be so easy to start cutting their funds little
by little.
Participant 3 said she would not collaborate with other librarians on a school day
because “I wouldn’t do that on the school day. I could not close the library.” She

112

explained that without a library assistant, being away from the library on a school day is a
burden:
Because we can only have a very small pool of subs . . . they have to be retired
librarians basically . . . [so] I have to in advance look at the calendar for the year
and call one of those few librarians and schedule them for the whole year. For the
times I know when I have to be out. When I had an assistant that was never an
issue because the assistant would run the library while I was gone . . . so since we
lost our assistants that has been a huge burden on us to be able to get professional
development . . . Heaven help if I get sick because if I ever get sick and it is lastminute then the library will be closed.
Participant 3 fondly reminisced,
I have in the past when I had an assistant . . . I would get together with one to two
of the other middle school librarians and we would put together an elaborate
reading promotion video . . . I haven’t done that the last couple of years because it
got just way too much to do [without an assistant].
Even for monthly librarian’s meetings, Participant 3 said, “Because our meetings require
us to travel to different campuses which can be a hindrance . . . and close the library for a
couple of hours.” Participant 5 reiterated, “I don’t like to go for a long time because
when you’ve been gone when you come back you never know what is going to face you
when you get back. It’s like gremlins have been in here.” But in the end, as Participant 5
stated, “Do what’s best for the kids first and then everything else will follow.”
The responses of the participants were honest, thorough, and passionate. The solo
middle school librarians shared confidential thoughts with me, and I assured them their

113

honest opinions would be protected. Themes from the interviews were collegiality,
professional organizations, principal support, librarians are teachers, and isolation.

114

CHAPTER V
Implications and Recommendations
Introduction
The purpose of this phenomenological study was to investigate a sample of solo
middle school librarians in a large Texas school district as they shared their participation
and experiences with librarian-to- librarian social capital. In this study, qualitative data
were collected from interviews and used to organize the ideas of five solo middle school
librarians. The guiding research questions I used were:
1. How do solo middle school librarians perceive social capital experiences with
other solo middle school librarians in a large Texas school district?
2. How do solo middle school librarians in a large Texas school district perceive
social capital experiences with other school librarians outside of their large Texas school
district?
3. How do solo middle school librarians in a large Texas school district perceive
factors that influence social capital experiences?
The participation and experiences of a sample of solo middle school librarians in
a large Texas school district was investigated in this study. Each participant shared
anecdotes regarding librarian-to-librarian social capital. I interviewed 5 solo middle
school librarians face-to-face. After transcribing the 5 recorded interviews, I analyzed
the data to compare the responses. Several themes were revealed from the responses and
discussed in Chapter IV. These themes included collegiality, professional organizations,
principal support, librarians are teachers, and isolation.

115

Connection to the Literature
Several findings of the study connect to the literature, specifically: (a) isolation,
(b) school librarians are teachers, (c) strong library attributes of librarian work, (d) and
professional resources. Research described in the literature review of Chapter II and new
research discovered as a result of analyzing the interviews, uphold found results. Works
by Couros, 2015; Johnston, Markle, and Arhar, 1988; Penuel, Riel, Joshi, Pearlman,
Chong Min, and Frank, 2010; Lance, 2002c; Kasar and Clark, 2000; Sinek, 2014; Lin and
Erickson, 2008; and Dow, 2013 were particularly helpful to me.
Isolation was the foundation of every solo middle school librarian’s comments
(Chandler, 1983; Chenoweth, 2009; Costello, 1987; Davis, 1987; Dussault, et al., 1999;
Elmore, 2010; Flinders, 1988; Goodlad & Klein, 1974; Levine, 1986; Lieberman &
Miller, 1992, 1984; Little, 1990; Rosenholtz & Smylie, 1984; Rothberg, 1986; Zielinski
& Hoy, 1983). The solo aspect of being a middle school librarian obstructed each’s
ability to get together with other librarians during and beyond the school day, hindered
the solo middle school librarian’s energy and ability to participate in professional
organizations, restricted principal support, and impeded collaboration with teachers.
Couros (2015) may have argued isolation became a choice in today’s technological arena,
yet it was a reality for the participants in this study who yearned for face-to-face social
capital experiences. Strong relationships and collegiality impact the solo middle school
librarian’s success in schools (Johnston, Markle, & Arhar, 1988; Penuel et al., 2010).
Each solo middle school librarian recognized the critical role principal support played in
taking advantage of social capital experiences or remaining isolated (Leana, 2010).

116

Peppered throughout the participant responses were the fact solo middle school
librarians are teachers. The opportunity to plan collaboratively with campus teachers and
leaders is critical to a library program’s success and appropriate use of resources,
including access to the librarian (Lance, 2002c). All participants bemoaned the lack of
time to be able to collaborate with teachers, learn from colleagues, and spend
instructional time with students. Teachers need time to plan and develop studentcentered lessons, and leaders need to “provide ample time for exploration and
collaboration to allow new and better ideas to emerge” (Couros, 2015, p. 157). Each solo
middle school librarian recognized the critical role principal support plays in their taking
advantage of social capital experiences as teacher leaders (Leana, 2010).
The American Association of School Librarians (AASL) defines the term
effective school library as having “a certified school librarian at the helm, provides
personalized learning environments, and offers equitable access to resources to ensure a
well-rounded education for every student” (Habley, 2016, p. 1). These strong library
attributes of librarian work were exemplified their continued quest for bettering
themselves for increased student achievement. Researchers in multiple state-level studies
have discovered that test scores tend to be higher for schools that have a full-time,
certified school librarian, and even higher for schools with such a librarian with support
staff (Achterman, 2008). In Illinois, a 2003 study asserts statistically significant relations
between strong library attributes and student achievement (Lance, Rodney, & HamiltonPennell, 2005). Each solo middle school librarian recognized the critical role principal
support plays in taking advantage of social capital experiences that affect instruction and
student achievement (Leana, 2010).

117

Educators from several disciplines agree in the importance of participation in
professional organizations to enhance professional skills (Kasar & Clark, 2000).
Members of professional organizations “take care of each other” (Sinek, 2014, p. 18).
The solo middle school librarians in this study each spoke of the importance of
professional resources. While various roadblocks may hinder participation, including
support or lack thereof from the principal (Couros, 2015; Lin & Erickson, 2009),
professional organizations providing professional development opportunities are
imperative for student achievement (Dow, 2013). Each solo middle school librarian
recognized the critical role principal support plays in their taking advantage of social
capital experiences via professional organizations (Leana, 2010).
Theoretical Framework
Social capital theory and human capital are the two theoretical frameworks
establishing the foundation for this qualitative study, as applied to the public middle
school solo librarian (Putnam, 2000). For this research study, the work of Bourdieu
(1985), Coleman (1988), Granovetter (1973), Lin (1999), Portes (1998), and Putnam
(2000) build the framework. Relationships matter in a person’s life (Bourdieu, 1985;
Coleman, 1988; Granovetter, 1973; Howard, 2010; Johnston, Markle, & Arhar, 1988;
Leana, 2010, 2011; Leana & Pil, 2006; Lin, 1999; Nahapiet & Ghoshal, 1998; Portes,
1998; Putnam, 2000; Smith, 2009), and each solo middle school librarian recognized the
critical role principal support plays in their taking advantage of social capital experiences
(Leana, 2010).
Relationships between educators through collaboration and formal and informal
learning communities become an important component of school effectiveness (Healey,

118

2011). The solo middle school librarians in this study highly regard their relationships
with each other and the professional community. Within these relationships, the solo
middle school librarians “can share expertise, observe one another’s instruction, critically
examine teaching and learning, and develop collective norms and values” (Healey, 2011,
p. 3). Social capital framework provides understanding of how teachers’ relationships
affect their professionalism and how the relationships might relate to student
achievement, and participants of this study value these relationships.
Not all participants in this study, however, absolutely value all social capital
experiences. Each participant valued the 30 minutes before monthly meetings to various
degrees. Each participant valued the monthly meetings to various degrees. The same
was discovered true for each participant regarding the benefit of social capital
experiences provided by professional organizations and social media on their professional
practice. All participants agreed, however, that some form of self-imposed restrictions
have been made regarding involvement in social capital experiences because each is
alone on the job, which restricts their ability to have the time and stamina to engage with
other solo middle school librarians.
The economical aspect of education includes human capital, which is established
by changes people make that bring skills and capabilities to their work, causing people to
behave in new ways (Blaug, 1970; Coleman, 1988). Leana (2010) explained that social
capital and human capital, which means teacher knowledge, skills, and credentials,
worked together to assist with student academic achievement. Leana argued that to
improve an entire school instead of only individual teachers, both social and human
capital must exist. She explained that the ideal situation of social and human capital

119

working together created a trusting climate, which was even more important than human
capital. Each participant of this study purposely sought out relationships with other to
increase their knowledge and skills to best meet the needs of learners. Each satisfied the
credentials for being a certified Texas teacher and school librarian, and Participants 1, 3,
and 4 surpassed those requirements.
Implications for Practice
School librarianship is challenging work, and the solo school librarian must “learn
to prioritize, to work smart, to strategically use their time and resources, and to take time
for themselves, both personally and professionally” (Church & Reeve, 2011, p. 7). The
solo school librarian may have to let go of things that may have always been, delegate or
share responsibility, and focus on students first (Church & Reeve, 2011). To ensure the
mandatory library areas are served, the solo school librarian must conserve resources,
energy, and time by identifying high- impact tasks that provide the most value and best
supports the school’s mission (Karabush & Pleviak, 2011). Lofrumento (2004) suggested
the solo school librarian must always first address the tasks that directly affect student
learning.
Unfortunately, no new hope for a full-time, or even part-time library assistant, is
on the horizon in the Texas public school district. Allocation is a site-based decision.
Therefore, the solo middle school librarian must advocate to the principal to secure a
volunteer coordinator, times for other instructional paraprofessionals to work in the
library, and support via dedicated librarian substitutes or library coverage when the
librarian is out of the building.

120

Implications for Policy
Leana (2010) argued that to improve an entire school, both social and human
capital must exist. Pil and Leana (2009) detailed how social capital and human capital
work together to increase student achievement. The researchers recommended social
capital should not be underestimated and policy makers should consider requiring the
fostering of social capital on campuses. Therefore, school and district policies must
support human capital and social capital requirements, experiences, and opportunities.
Solo middle school librarians must have the time and opportunity for social capital
experiences, such as conferences, that are paid for by school leadership with designated
substitutes in their absence.
In addition, Texas should provide new school library state standards, School
Library Programs: Standards and Guidelines for Texas, which are currently under
consideration. I am a member of the Library Standards Metrics Committee and work
with other Texas school library leaders on this initiative. My input to the committee
includes standards for professional library staffing and paraprofessional library staffing.
These Standards should be Texas law. Once the Standards become law, principal
preparation programs will be obligated to teach future principals the critical role libraries
and librarians provide in supporting student achievement.
Recommendations for Future Research
With the study on the social capital experiences of the solo middle school
librarian, a surfeit of questions for future study emerged. Social capital touches all
persons professional and personally. For this study, overriding themes of teachers and
teaching, technology, various school levels, staffing, support and school size emerged.

121

A multitude of ideas for future study came to fruition due to the dearth of research
available on topics surrounding solo librarians and social capital experiences. The first
topic of interest is the phenomenon between school librarian and teacher social capital
experiences. A researcher might investigate more deeply by studying the phenomenon
between teacher and solo librarian or conversely, with a librarian supported by adequate
staffing as recommended by the School Library Programs: Standards and Guidelines for
Texas. Another idea for further research is the need for the study of the phenomenon of
technology and social capital. Historically social capital experiences have been face-toface interactions, yet now technology’s role is emerging as another platform for social
capital. Third, the phenomenon of the solo school librarian may differ on the elementary
and high school level. Next, the phenomenon of social capital and the properly supported
by paraprofessional staff librarian would be a significant study. Fifth, because of the
reduction of library support staff, have educators seen in impact on student scores or
literacy attitudes? Sixth, research on how principals learn about what expertise and
programming a Texas school librarian offers could be investigated. Furthermore,
research investigating the social capital opportunities for rural or small school districts
could occur. Eighth, social capital experiences of the non-solo librarian should be
investigated. Last, because of my rare role as a central office library leader supporting
campuses, the school library canon would benefit from research regarding the social
capital experiences of librarians, either solo or properly staffed, with district-level support
compared to no support.

122

Recommendations for School Leaders
Relationships between educators through collaboration and formal and informal
learning communities become an important component of school effectiveness (Healey,
2011). Therefore, school leaders cannot ignore the significant impact social capital can
have upon educators. School leaders must provide time and resources for professional
development, and they must promote opportunities to staff. Communication of this
support is imperative because, “People are afraid to share what they want because they
don’t know that getting it is even a possibility” (Couros, 2015, p. 132). Second, school
leaders are responsible to grow more leaders (Tschannen-Moran, 2004), and should
identify school librarians as instructional leaders on the campus and support their
leadership development.

Last, school leaders must provide adequate support staff for

school librarians if instruction, leadership, and learning are to take place. With the
elimination of the library assistant, the librarian and the campus library program is most
impacted by fewer visits to the library by individual students, fewer information literacy
skills instruction contacts, fewer books and materials checked out, and reduced
administration of electronic reading programs (Smith, 2001).
Recommendations for school leaders with personnel or hiring authority should
consider implementing the following to support the solo middle school librarian: (a) hire
a full-time library paraprofessional; (b) limit extra-duties of the librarian and library
paraprofessional; (c) expect collaboration between librarian and teachers; (d) provide
time and opportunities for librarians to provide staff development to teachers and other
librarians, (e) and ensure the library program is on a flexible, not fixed, schedule. If a
full-time library paraprofessional is not fiscally possible, school leaders with personnel or

123

hiring authority should implement the following to support the solo middle school
librarian: (a) limit extra-duties of the librarian; (b) ensure the library program is on a
flexible, not fixed, schedule; (c) provide librarian-trained specialized substitutes for days
when the librarian is away due to illness or for social capital or professional development
opportunities; (d) provide paraprofessional support during the school day for shelving
books and other clerical work such as organizing overdue notices and book repair; (e)
assign a volunteer coordinator to facilitate a schedule of specially trained volunteers to
work in the library during the busiest times of day, during the librarian’s 30 minute lunch,
and when the librarian collaborates with teachers or other instructional leaders, (f) expect
collaboration between librarian and teachers; (g) and provide time and opportunities for
librarians to provide staff development to teachers and other librarians,. These
recommendations can easily be implemented without taxing other programs.
Overall, each solo middle school librarian values social capital opportunities,
especially those face-to-face with colleagues within district. Without appropriate support
staff of a full-time adult library assistant, opportunities for adequate social capital
experiences do not exist. School districts and campuses should provide opportunities for
librarian social capital by providing full-time adult library assistants and time during the
school day for librarians to professionally interact with other library professionals on the
district, local, and state level.
